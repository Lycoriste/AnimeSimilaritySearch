16498,"# [~~~This review will contain Spoilers for the show!~~~]()

At first I did not understand the hype surrounding this series. Yeah the plot and everything sounded nice but why did it get so popular?
Well I learned that when I finally decided to watch this series and fall in love with it.


[(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) STORY:]()
Season 1 of Attack on Titan is a nice introduction to the universe of the show. It tells us everything we need to know and it lays it out in such a way that is nice and comfortable to watch.

Summary of the story for anyone that has forgotten:
To start us off. Humanity has enclosed its self within walls to keep out the ""Titans"", creatures which (as the name suggests) are much larger and stronger than Humans. They possess a great threat to the survival of humanity.
 
The show focuses on a group of friends: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Although the show does focus more heavily on Eren all of the characters present have a huge role in the plot. They're living their lives quite calmly... until one day, two Titans manage to break the gates to the outer wall in which our heroes live. With no way of beating the numerous titans pouring in the City the retreat. Eren in the process loses his mother due to a Titan, this is a vital part of the story as it build Eren with unspeakable hatred towards these creatures.

Ever since that moment Eren and the rest have been training to join the ""Scout Regiment"" and defeat the Titans.
After intensive training they manage to get to the top leads in the training group and join the Regiment. Filled with passion Eren tries his best to kill as many Titans during the  new found invasion...he dies...but not really.

It is later revelead that our boy Eren Yeager has the ability to turn into a Titan. Now he can trully be useful, he can plug the Walls and even venture to his old house to find out the secret his father left him...

All in all the way the story builds up along with the character, and even how the atmosphere changes is trully magnificent.
From the get-go this has managed to capture my interest and made me fall in love with the series. I cannot express enough just how much I love this show.

[CHARACTERS:]()
The character we get to see in Attack on Titan are very interesting and work really well in the atmosphere of the show. We have:
Eren, a young lad, he is basically the focus of the show due to his powers. Though he mostly cries and gets kidnapped.
His character is great, he is very determined and tries his best which is something that I admire. The sheer will power he has is incredible.
Mikasa, a young gal, she doesn't speak much apart from screaing ""EREN"" every now and then to check up on him.
She is one of my favourite characters in the show, she is the pure defenition of badass. The way she sets her eyes on a target and smoothly completes her task is to be awed.
Lastly I'll be talking about Armin, the character which does not really build much hype within me but still is an important part of the series as a whole. He is the brains of the whole show. Without him we wouldn't get as much plans. Despite his lack of strength I still do like him, he is very determined on helping people as much as he can which always is a plus in my book!

AoT has many more characters, all of which have important parts in the development of the story. Some have much bigger impact and some are just one off characters. Each and every one of them have their own personalities and back stories. With most of the characters we get to know their backstory which further cements their part in the show and in our hearts and thus makes the whole experience of watching much more enjoyable.

[ART/ANIMATION:]()
This show has great art and animation. It does improve throughout the various seasons but the one we see in Season 1 is also quite a sight to behold.
In my opinion I'd have to rate it above the average. The animations too, they are very smooth and fluid. Well that is expected since a lot of the combat scenes have the character move in very agile and fickle ways which require such smooth animations.

[MUSIC:]()
Attack on Titan, man it has a banger of an OST. Each and every song that plays throughout the show is so fitting for the scene which it resides in. They fill the viewer with the right kind of emotion for the scene that is about to unveil, may it be sadness, anticipation, or even sheer HYPE
The OPs, too, are bangers. They are up there with the Steins;Gate OP, which always manages to build up hype and nostalgia within me.
The EDs, too, had (and still do) a huge impact on me when re-listening to them. Much hype to be had.

[OVERALL OPINION:]()
All in all Attack on Titan is a series with amazing combat and story.
Like with Steins;Gate (going back to comparing this to Steins;Gate xd) I do try to get people to watch this since it is such a great show.

As I said in the very first sentence:
>I did not understand the hype surrounding this series.

But after watching it I understood why, the story and characters, just the whole show in general fit together so well.
Though I did give it 92/100, reason for that is...Season 3 is soooo good compared to this season.

#####(Note - Tried changing up my style of writing a little bit. Hopefully it turned out alright!)"
101922,"I am gonna be totally honest here. I never thought I would be writing a review for Demon Slayer. You can imagine why I say that. It's an obvious answer. It's undeniable the truth I turned a blind eye to most of the issues the first time I watched Demon Slayer. Still, this anime strongest point is the animation, fights. How it executes and explore the simple power-system. Let's not forget about the backstory on the different demon we'll be facing through the journey. Ufotable took the ok manga and made it ten times better. Added some more flavor to the story through extending scenes, like demon backstory or flexing madly on us with that top-notch sakuga and sound effects and what more. But If you look at it with open eyes, it's the usual shounen we either love or hate with a simple premise and story. That said, it's more to a good show, then some flashy actions and tons of money thrown at it. This is no doubt different from people to people, but I have the biggest weight put onto the cast themself. I would never watch any form of media unless the characters first and foremost resonate with me in any way. Now don't get me wrong. Demon Slayer is a decent shounen, but it's far from the best thing out there. 

In the first few episodes, I can already tell this would never have the potential to become a masterpiece at all. It's so simple in anything it does, and it shows Koyoharu has no intention to get out of his comfort zone to explore the dangerous territory. Bless Ufotable for adapting, or it might not be this popular. Think about it, would Black Clover or Fairy Tail not get this amount of fame if Ufotable adapted it? That's nothing but fact since when I first began my anime journey, I too was baited by the art and animation. It's not that it's a bad thing since you can have a good story and fantastic production or even the opposite of the spectrum. Tho, it amounts to nothing if the rest of the content is not all there. I will most likely compare Demon Slayer to many stories to hopefully get my point across with much credibility as possible. If you don't wanna read-on, then let me just tell you that Demon Slayer is the equivalent to Fairy Tail but far worse. Fairy Tail at least had heart. Take it as however you want, but it should be clear what I am implying here. I guess I should start with the characters. 

Tanjiro seems to be many fan favorite since he is so easy to like, but gosh is he one of the most boring protagonists I had the pleasure of following. He is viewed as this picture-perfect person everyone would wanna be, the guy got no flaws from a normal person standpoint. Or the author does not do a good job of conveying them if they exist. Tho, no lie how he is so kind, and it pisses off Inousuke to no end is a good comedy to me. I will give the author that, Koyoharu Gotouge knows how to make simple but effective comedic relief moments. That's not true all the time tho. Also, sadly, I can't say the same about the protagonist lacking proper substance and depth. Tanjiro has no real glaring flaws, and that makes him dull and tiresome in the long run. Additionally, there is little no growth to him as a character and the biggest change is how stronger he becomes. I mean, Asta in Black Clover comes off as loud, curious, reckless, and even stubborn. I could still keep on going. Let's throw my favorite male mad lad of all time here too. Luffy, who is overflowing ball of curiosity, charisma, romance for adventure, an unpredictable fellow, and reckless goofball of a lovable dork. I guess I can throw my scientific lovable nerd Senku in here too, who has many of the traits of those mentioned above. 

Then you have Tanjiro, who is simply kind, had one or two burst out to make him seem more. Still, it feels out of character since he is already established as a gentle, kind-hearted soul. Not that's it wrong either since all those mentioned have that as part of their traits but so much more too. Even the side characters in Demon Slayer are not all that great. Zenitsu is loud and annoying without a balance, and the comedic relief is so absurd it's cringe-inducing. Please tell me I am not the only one who wanted to shoot myself every time this Mineta wannabe opened his mouth? Zenitsu does, in fact, get growth in the manga, but to be frank, it just happened. There was no underlying context to show you the process in a way you could comprehend the character properly. Among the trio, Inousuke is simply the best. He seems to have some layer to him, outside of being a funny, quirky, and a battle-hungry maniac. He is one of the few ones, I would say Koyoharu does a good job with. Every time Inousuke comes by an unprecedented situation, he feels fear, anger, depression, and so forth. We see it clearly in detail and how it affects him. A lot of work could be used, but he is a better example of a properly written character if you ask me.

The Hashiras, who are a significant part of the story, is also not poorly written but far from the best. They all have their own set of unique selves and are not cut out from the same cloth. Shinobu is the most complex I have seen. She has that arara onee-san vibe and one heck of an enticing smile that draws you in with an energetic persona. Did I forget to mention, all of that is merely a facade, and there is more to her than meets the eye? Not gonna sugarcoat it, but since she is a waifu material, I do have a level of bias with my opinion of her. Anyway, Koyoharu clearly has some nicely written characters. Still, since the main trio, or should I say the quartet is the focus, their potential is not fully tapped into. I wanna lightly touch on Nezuko, tell me what is her purpose, besides being an adorable and pleasing sight for your aching eyes who can throw around some punches? She adds nothing to the story before way in and is only a way to lure watchers and readers into this terribly mediocre shounen. And the title of best girl goes to either Shinobu or Kanao, who has more to tell than a cute ""hmmph"" all the damn time. Hey, I am not complaining, just trying to prove a point. Nezuko's purpose also comes out from the left field, even if it was an apparent outcome anyone could see coming.

As if that not enough, the big bad villain, Muzan, who started out with a strong introduction. It is just a scary Micheal Jackson with anger issues, and thirst for blood and is simply a manipulative douchebag. Koyoharu do use shock factor to make him seem intimidating and while some moments do give you an impact of emotions. It's not that he is a well-written villain. In a way, he is also a waste of potential since he could be so much more than this sad excuse of a way to give something at least resembling a closure. You know, going out with a bang so that all you went through was well worth it. But it's not. Why do I say that? I am not a manga reader anymore, I'll wait out untill the story concludes and then we'll see what happens. So take my coming opinion with a grain of salt. Ignorance can be such a bliss when you don't realize the bigger picture, it's factual that the pacing in the manga is terrible. No room to breathe to see character interactions and let you bond with them before we are yet again thrown into more actions. We barely know a thing about the world of Demon Slayer, and there is no realism to give it that authentic feel. So you can feel more significant emotions, which actually amounts to something. The world is flimsily established and is merely just a means to an end.

Now, look at some other work that is simple in the core but has more to offer and has better established it's setting, world, and characters. Before that, I wanna say I am looking at the source material and not just the anime. Black Clover is one such which stars Asta and Noelle. Let's focus on those two for this example. Asta comes off as simple and is generic, just like any shounen protagonist. Still, he is humane and not as easy to describe. At one point, he gains appetizing growth, which makes you appreciate his character all the more. Let's not forget about best girl Noelle, who starts out as a typical tsundere and thinks everything is above here. But slowly mellows out and becomes a truly complex, deep, and very charming of a character you grow to love so immensely. In fact, the whole cast of Black Clover feels more than merely simple. Another shounen worthy of praise is Dr. Stone. Great cast of characters you can easily differentiate. Not to mention, both execute their story efficiently with a level of balance when it comes to pacing to establish the world, setting, and the cast themself. There is a reasonable level of growth, and someone you hated at first might become your fav the next moment and so forth.

Tell me, what does Demon Slayer do differently besides being backed up by the monster of a studio with an unlimited budget to work with? I can tho give some sincere praise to the backstory of each respective demon who feels like such a more interesting character. I mean, in my eyes, both Kyogai, the spider lady, Rui even is more fascinating than the quartet of Demon Slayer. And that's only an example since many demons feel like someone you want to learn about than the actual main cast. It's evidently clear Demon Slayer is only popular since it's animated by Ufotable. Easily accessible to newcomers to anime and get into in terms of manga since it has less than 200 chapters available. There is not much dialogue, so you can burn through the content pretty damn fast actually, and it's easy to digest to boot. However, not everything is average about Demon Slayer. I want to give some praise to one of the greatest episode animated which ironically come out from Demon Slayer. It's not my favorite moment, but it's no doubt worthy of attention and recognition. Episode 19 is Ufotable at best, sure it has some ass-pulls here and there, but the execution and direction are stunning and do the trick. 

The build-up is gradual, as one beautiful soundtrack ramps up in the background before the climax hits and delivers a fantastic finish. This episode displays the bond of brother and sister with the utmost respect, touching on the connection, and subtlety exploring it in-depth. It's generic in its core, but it would be stupid to not appreciate the work that put into it and the meaning behind it Ufotable is trying to get across. Outside of that, Demon Slayer is top-notch when it comes to visual and artwork. There is not a second. It looks terrible or just low quality in any way. Of course, nothing beats the highly engrossing and famous Fate franchise. Especially Heavens Feel, which is in another league when it comes to production value or likewise the Kara no Kyoukai movie franchise. It's not fair to compare TV shows to movies, but I am just trying to give a different point of view many seem to miss now that they are highly influenced by Demon Slayer. On that note, the OP and ED for Demon Slayer are great. I mean with Lisa on both, did you expect anything else but quality, beautiful and catchy tune? Same, me neither. That goes for the soundtrack too which has one of the legends Yuki Kaujira and the equally amazing Go Shiina composition so you better bet your ears will thank you for experiencing bliss.

One more thing the anime provides tremendous justice for is the fighting scenes. And elevate the power-system of Demon Slayer, which otherwise feels simple and is not appropriately shown in the manga. It's not easy to tell what happens every time someone uses one of the many breath styles, not for sure anyway. This has more to do with colors and accurate display of what the author is trying to show, which is not easy to draw in the manga. Often when you don't have colors or can visually show the process of an attack. Ufotable, however, gives justice to this display and shows the attack clearly. They all are flashy, colorful, and packed with sound effects and beautiful spectacle to behold and be astounded by. In which case, I can safely say. At the same time, the power system of the Demon Slayer is good enough. Even while many things feel not as solidly built. I guess it does the trick. And Ufotable does a great job of showing the illustrations of water, fire, wind, and any other Breath Style. 

It also shows the user's traits. For instance, Tanjiro style is water since he is gentle, has self-discipline, among others. While Inousuke, who wears a boar mask and was raised in the wilderness, puts emphasis on that in his Breath Style. Zenitsu is slightly tricky since no bit of his character tells you he hits strong and fast like lightning. Wait for a second, I could put in the fact his growth just happened since it was fast and hit you out from nowhere. One more example is Kanao, who is the Breath of the flower since she is beautiful, peaceful, quiet, and blooms slowly, just like a flower would. So while I am harsh with my opinion of Demon Slayer, I am trying my best to not gloss over the things Koyoharu was able to do well and Ufotable who rose it into much greater heights. As you continue the journey of Demon Slayer, you see more power-system developments, and many of the things are, in fact, foreshadowed every so subtlety by Koyoharu. Without giving way heavily spoilers to anime only, I am referring to the crimson red Nichirin Blade and the mark on Tanjiro's forehead, which was foreshadowed before the battle at Natagumo Mountain arc. Honestly, speaking as I wrote this review. My opinion on Demon Slayer changed ever so slightly again since I looked at both sides and not just controlled by the negative emotions. It's not at all a bad shounen, and I really hope I didn't give that impression. That's not my intention.

There's it's no question about it; it's highly overrated. Demon Slayer has only Ufotable to thank for to gain a massive boost in sales for the otherwise a-okay manga. Besides, any other shounen with a simple basis would've blown out of proportion if a studio with an enormous amount of budget worked on it. At the time of writing this article, Demon Slayer is in its last stage of the story and seems to be suffering a lot. That's the result of glossing over many things that would otherwise result in a much bigger pay-off in the long run. It's the reason One Piece's popularity is more or less consistent and can easily explode if Oda-sensei ever wishes. It's the reason Black Clover gets way-way better later on when introduction and all the things are properly established. It's the reason, Dr. Stone is also just that good after the slow beginning. If you don't want to listen to my side, then take at least one thing out from this review. At the very least, animation and art-style. Will only truly shine if the author's work already has some well-developed parts as we have looked from Demon Slayer, which has some. But it's not a great shounen, groundbreaking or any of that. It's simple and has a huge studio backing them up with unlimited budget works."
1535,"Death Note, Death Note, Death Note. There was so much potential to be an absolute masterpiece. I legitimately thought that it was a solid 9/10 after 13 episodes or so. Then it kept going....And going....And going...And going long after reaching a satisfying conclusion, after two characters that could go down in history as the greatest rivalry of all time concluded their epic intellectual battle. But much more on that later. I'll get to the technical side of the show briefly, then talk about my feelings regarding the show, its characters, and my verdict. Needless to say, I will be going into spoiler territory in the favorite character section and beyond. I feel like I kinda have to do this to effectively talk about the show's postive and negative qualities. Anyway on to it.

I'll keep my discussion of Death Note's technical aspects brief. Audially, I thought it wasn't anything special. There were certain OST songs that really hit hard, such as L's Theme and Misa's Song, but as far as openings and endings went, I really couldn't tell you. I listened to them once I think, then skipped them every time after that. Take that as you will.
As far as the show's visuals, again, it's nothing special. For a show made in 2006, it certainly is very good and has aged fairly well, although it certainly won't be winning any awards for stylistic reasons since it's fairly standard. I liked most of the character designs, although most of them were pretty bland, which was fine. It didn't detract or add anything to the show that way, which is probably for the best. I do have to say though, I really loved the way that they framed some shots, mostly near the end and in episode 25, where I noticed them the most. Very symbolic.

Favorite Character:  L Lawliet
~~~img(https://shareitnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/L-Lawliet-quotes.jpg)~~~
I really don't think there is another answer that's possible here, honestly. For anyone who watches this show. And this is coming from me, who didn't really care for L initially. However, seeing him bond with Light and bitterly come to terms with the fact that his first and only friend was also the person that he was hunting down was both exciting and extremely saddening. Episode 25 really turned me into an L fan, where he comes to terms with his death and accepts that Light has won. It's then that we finally see the cracks in L's wacky persona- a lonely boy who could not be understood by the world and those in it. Something that he grew accustomed to, with only his caretaker and assistant Watari as his companion. It was an absolute punch to the gut watching L deflate in his final episode, finally shedding the detective shell he wore like a skin and revealing the boy underneath. The one who just wanted a friend.

This is probably where I should say that I think these two, Light and L, are up there for greatest rivalry of all time in my mind. Greatest rivalry....And greatest friendship in an alternate world. I think that's what made me so sad about that entire episode and why L's death hit me so hard. Because, in another universe, Light and L are the best of friends and each other's only intellectual equal. It actually made me emotional to think about and still does, if I'm being honest. However, to talk about the actual show a bit more, I thought this stretch where they're playing cat and mouse with each other is the peak of the series. The show is at its best when its focus is on these two and their back and forth, and it reached an intense and perfect climax in the 25th episode. Death Note should have simply ended there, because the snooze-fest that proceeded was absolutely killer to the show in my mind.

Now, before I rant about the ending and the last few episodes, I'd like to say that I also didn't like a single character outside of Matsuda by the end. Misa was an idiot and useless after L, instead of being quirky but useful because of her eyes. The replacement L's were insufferable, Near being the worst offender. And the entire Japanese Police Task Force was way too quick to go back to suspecting Light. Not to mention that Light himself was just constantly doing absolutely nothing the whole time, while Near just picks him apart.

Anyway, the ending. My god the ending. First, I'd like to state that I wish Light had died with L. That they sort of defeat each other, in a sense. Secondly, I would have also happily taken a Kira victory. However, we got neither of those and instead got the worst option: Light just losing. Just because. Don't get me wrong, it was cool to see him torn down like that, but Light just kinda lets it all happen as the episodes are winding down. He has no contingency for if his plan goes haywire, he puts all his trust into his sidekick, who messes everything up and Near just kinda....wins. It just felt lazy, like the author had used up all his ideas with Light and L's arc and had nothing left in the tank for the actual ending, which would make complete sense from how lazy it was and how little Light did to stop Near or Mello at the end. Also, The Japanese Task Force are morons, who, at the slightest mention of Light being Kira immediately jump back into suspicion based on one flimsy piece of evidence offered by this random dude calling in. Not to mention the plot hole that is Light's father literally saying in front of all of them on his deathbed that Light isn't Kira because he has the Shinigami Eyes and can see Light's lifespan. But that's conveniently forgotten about.

Overall, I'm not really sure how to rate Death Note. It was so solid for over 2/3 of the run-time, so it's certainly worth watching, but its just such a disappointing ending to such a promising series. I would say watch it, but just keep in mind that the last 12 episodes are hella boring and, at least in my opinion, ruin the show. Yet even with all of that said, I still greatly enjoyed Death Note for the most part and I hope you do too if you decide to give it a watch!"
113415,"If you read my Demon Slayer review for both anime and manga, you should be familiar with my hate for those two. Well, here is the thing. Jujutsu Kaisen what I am currently going to write about is far worse. I bet you didn't see that one coming huh? To explain my reasoning, I am going to compare the two in some way. If you are easy to trigger, don't care about a different perspective with proper reasoning, then be my guest. Scroll down to the bottom while you are on crack like an angry kid and smack that dislike button with all your might. But in the process, giving me further solid reasons to justify my points. I will tell you this now, that I am not a manga reader as I dropped it 20 chapters in because of the tediousness of the story, inconsistent direction, stagnant and horrible paneling, and the shoddy art style making it hard to make out what's happening. My belief is revolved around anime. Well, let's get going.

There is a misconception going around the community of top-notch visuals and art is equal to good when it's not even close to the truth. I feel most don't realize it themselves unless someone points it out for you. I don't blame them either. I was riding the Demon Slayer hype-train for a while before taking a step back and looking it from my own heart. Rather than being influenced by other words, thus being a slave to their bloated opinions. Yes, I am saying that Jujutsu Kaisen's overwhelming popularity stems from its lush and stunning production value, nothing else. Do you want proof? Where was Jujutsu Kaisen before the anime happened? Just like Ufotable for Demon Slayer, Jujutu being touched by the hands of the passionate and hardworking staff at Mappa got the same prescription due to its insane production value, despite mediocre to dreadful writing.

Well, that's kind of wrong. I won't deny the fujoshi details of glossy lips of the male characters and creating them to be so handsome is another core reason people cannot stop the shill. Seesh, I lost count of the number of times I saw someone simp for a character through a global post, activity, and other means. I don't think I have ever seen someone make a valuable point about the story, crack out some theories/predictions, only a ton of simping. Say, Gojo alone got far more favorites than his worth if you exclude his appearances and look at him from a personality standpoint. The guy is literally a man-child that doesn't even know how to crack out jokes. Remember that awful scene when he wore Nobara's skirt and tried to make a joke out of it? I felt my life slipping from the amount of cringe the scene exuded. There was also that segment with those curses doing a one-note shoujo play. That was so unnecessary and awful. In any case, I liked Gojo at first but the community made me not care about him anymore. Now I only see cringe which was always there. Thank you me for waking up. Well, he's at least not the worst character in JJK even if he is high up there. That title goes for Yuuji the stoic immovable cringe-ass dried face wall.

Yuuji was introduced as this guy who was already incredibly powerful from the getgo. Guy could literally run marathons in a matter of seconds, dent football goals with his abnormal wrist powers batting a baseball, plus he was plenty agile, acrobatic, and got immense jumping power. This was all there before he got a hell of an insane powerup by eating a cursed finger belonging to the king of curses Sukuna. Which led Yuuji to have Sukuna as another lifeform inside of him and not just anyone. A powerful ancient demon essentially boosted his already haxed stats. I don't mind any of this personally. This is a shounen so expect illogical writing and lots of things served on a silver platter for the MC. I enjoy my fair shares of OP characters if they are executed rightly but most Shounen tends to something more than letting them feel like a concept, that's what Yuuji genuinely is. He is not even fit to be called a character. His motivation is as flimsy as himself, he wants to save people and that's where it ends. There is no why or other clarification. You could assume it's due to his grandpa's last words, but a guy we barely knew for a second death does not accomplish anything other than being wasteful baggage. I am sorry to put it like that but it's the cold hard truth. Yuuji is very much the same guy we know and in my case hate as he was introduced in the beginning. A wall with little to no substance outside of being crazy powerful and wanting to save people for whatever reason.

Did you know Yuuji at the beginning of the story was even able to throw cars around casually when that should not even be possible? Do you know how many tons a vehicle even weighs?. If you like Yuuji, be my guest but please don't tell me he is a good main character or any of that nor is Tanjiro that. Both are flimsy and boring. Tanjiro is consistent at least but nothing special in the grand scheme of things and Yuuji is just a ball of mess. The only thing Mappa accomplished by animating this wall was giving it some colors, but at the end of the day, a wall is a wall no matter how many colors you use. Yuuji is no doubt the worst shounen, no protagonist, in general, I had the absolute worst displeasure of seeing. Why do I think JJK is worse than Demon Slayer? Here's the thing. Tanjiro who was portrayed as this fantastic human being and was boring outside of being consistent and having the clear motivation to do things is far better than someone who's there just to be there. 

Sure, it's simple but there is a clear why Tanjiro became a demon slayer. It's to save his sister and return her to human again. And unlike him being totally overpowered from the getgo, there are things about Tanjiro that make no sense but do not become clearer before long. These details about him become clear as foreshadowing as we learn things about him. Well, doesn't change the fact the ending is a disaster, but hopefully, my points got across well. Now JJK is not entirely hopeless as it did try to explore and show us Yuuji's character as more than this overpowered boring beast. When he got acquainted with a guy, became friends shortly after only to die it definitely hurt Yuuji. He got swallowed by rage, it was conveyed on the dot through the visuals. It was the only point I remember Yuuji showing some level of personality besides spamming that stoic face all the time. Not that it matters in the grand scheme, nothing that transpired there was ever put to use again, nor did Yuuji feel any less than a wall from that point on.

Besides, the glaring flaw of Yuuji, there is no flow in the writing or the direction of JJK for the most part. We've been jumping places one after another and quite abruptly. Our main idiot trio got introduced in a rush and was barely fleshed out during their first exorcism job together. It was also against a special grade and here they tried to explore Yuuji again and show him he can be afraid when faced with a monstrous beast beyond anything he imagined. I enjoyed the moment of seeing Yuuji terrified for his life, but it quickly got shafted to the side as Yuuji used Sukuna to get out of the hell hole after making a contract with him. After that, it was never touched upon again. Yuuji had supposedly deceased but was gaining training under a poor man's Kakashi. Nothing like the aloof, hilarious, charming fella we know and love from Naruto.

Entering Kyoto arc where a bunch of characters was introduced and was given the same formulaic backstory as we saw them fighting against special grade curses. Here the author clearly tried to flesh out our cast through a segment of backstory, playing out their sad moments to make us feel sympathetic for them and give us wishy-washy reason to care about them. I never did. But I did think the stark contrast that was shown between Maki and Mai and how they were the complete opposite of each other, basically portrayed as yin and yang respectively was interesting. Plus, the matter surrounding how one cannot use curse power, but is plenty strong and crafty in hand-to-hand combats and with weapons. While the other is not quick on her feet nor good any sort of combat but can use curse power was a good idea by the author. I also adored Miwa, she might've been my favorite character. The fact Gege played her out like she was useless and her being self-aware about it was charming. Dare I say unique? I have not seen many characters like her, plus this thing about her being afraid of not being useful gives room for strong character direction for adorable and air-headed Miwa. There is one more character I liked in Jujutsu Kaisen and thought should've been the main character personally. It's Megumi. Just his name alone got lots of story intrigues plastered over it. He was far more interesting than Yuuji and had felt slightly layered. In what way, you ask? Megumi was obsessed with making his own decisions and being powerless gave him the right motivation and feasibility to become stronger.

I am not the first to admit JJK's production is stunning and Mappa knocked it out of the park. There are many good moments. One of which for me was Gojo's attack, but more than that Megumi scene of destroying that curse as he manically laughs. It's very vibrant in showing his personality and the animation to the direction was immaculate. The same goes for the scene with Yuuji fighting against Hanami in tandem with Todou. The acrobatics and the fluid of their movements were absolutely insane even if the soundtrack was misplaced and kind of killed the experience. I won't deny the scene was eye-candy but Yuuji nor Todou ever showing any expressions other than that blasted stoic immovable face kind of killed it for me and didn't make me care for it as much. Another good use of directing was Nobara moment when she shafted that one-note awful villain clown. It showed her proud and arrogant personality clearly and the facial expression on her face was satisfying. As noted previously, the way the soundtrack, insert song was used in JJK just felt off and weird. It honestly made me cringe on multiple occasions.

It's too bad the inconsistencies about JJK still manages to overshadow the few goods I have seen. What issues are you talking about? I mentioned Yuuji already, the flow of the story being erratic and the direction being random, feeling unplanned and at times even forced. I can't count the number of times JJK failed at comedy. To be fair, it's subjective but please tell me I am not the only one in the world who found the ""funny bits"" obnoxious and honestly cringe? None of the scenes with Takeda and Todou made any sense to have, I even heard that in the manga most of it was only 3 pages but the anime made it feel like an eternity by extending it without purpose. Tell me what did add? Besides telling us the comedy of JJK's absolutely is asinine and a mess. That's not even counting the time when Yuuji and Gojo tried to make a surprise out of the Wall being alive but it didn't hit the right notes. It was brushed off to the side the moment Yuuji opened his cringe-ass mouth. I am still highly disappointed in what could've been a passionate and sentimental moment being done nasty like that. The thing is Nobara was seen crying when she heard Yuuji died and both she and Megumi was clearly depressed. But when the cringing lad was shown to be alive it was like nothing happened. Pun intended. All of the emotions the character shared become null and void. Hell, it was done so it never existed in the first place.

It's time to touch upon about Jujutsu Kaisen power system, which seems easy and straightforward at first glance before getting overly complicated and illogical. To put it simply, cursed energy is a phenomenon nurtured from anger and sorrow. This allows the user to create and manifest unnatural things and apparently nurtures a broken ability that makes not even slightly sense. Take Black Flash as an example which was introduced into the story as this flashy and impressive attack that most users are unable to pull off. All the while contradicting itself by having Nanami explain most users can only pull off two attacks in a single day, while he shows off and says on a good day I could do four. Later, Yuuji the Wall uses this attack multiple times against a curse without any backlash. Not to mention, this attack that was hyped up was no doubt one of the most anticlimactic things I had seen in JJK. It was like there was no weight behind those punches. Not even after few arcs, JJK even forgot the fact it's an exorcism story. I never got those vibes. To me, it felt more like a shounen anime about slaying demons masqueraded as an ""exorcism"" story just without any sense of direction, value, or reason in the thing it with does. If you want exorcism there is Twinstar exorcist and Ao no Exorcist which most definitely sticks to its themes presented in the first episode.

Another notable negative and problematic thing I have noticed about JJK is the vast amount of dialogues. It's clear the author cares more about ""telling than showing"". During a time the scene of the characters running toward each other to throw an attack got significantly reduced to throw a bunch of nonsensical exposition that will get forgotten in the next moment. It's part of the reason I felt it was exhaustive at times to watch Jujutsu Kaisen and this has nothing to with me not tackling heavy works. Look at my favorites. I love my complex and dialogue-heavy stories, but when it's useless it just becomes a massive pain. Not to mention, while I was flipping through the pages of Jujutsu Kaisen out of curiosity to see if anything catches my eyes. I get hit by an extensive amount of dialogue boxes with nothing but text. This was on the level of Hunter x Hunter. To be fair, it's clear JJK takes some elements from there, like the expansion ability which is a more simplified version of a variation of Nen. Sadly, it took inspiration in the wrong things as well like its dullness in exposition. No, I read those boxes and it was literally just explaining the thoughts in the character's head. It was wasteful. It's something that shows the author is struggling to write interesting consistent characters and stories.

My final point is the potential with Sukuna being shafted after having few moments to shine in the story. Sure, it's early but he never really felt like part of the crew. Just a means to an end. If you have seen Naruto, you know how much personality Kurama had. It was one of the best execution of a demon residing in someone else, making their life living hell at every chance he got. While Sukuna just gets forgotten by the Kyoto arcs comes around. My favorite part was arguable during the times Yuuji and Sukuna monologued with each other. I enjoyed Sukuna's arrogant and prideful self and I was curious what the author was going to do with him. He is probably the biggest potential in JJK considering there are many routes the author can take with Sukuna. I don't know if I will be there to see it though as I have little to no motivation to pick up the sequel when it eventually rolls around from the corner.

I don't think Jujutsu Kaisen deserves a silver of the hype it's receiving. It's filled with nothing but issues and again discrepancies, no flow in moments, besides few stunningly produced cuts. Thanks to Mappa. It got an obnoxious cast of characters who are acting in the same way with meager differences, some potential solid ones but it doesn't seem like JJK seems to care about them much. No logic behind its power system which feels to me more like convenient writing. The author literally explained in detail about Gojo's broken ass ability in the extra chapters, not even during the main manga story. To me, it says the author doesn't have things planned out or rather doesn't have an idea in which direction he is heading. I am happy for them to see their work being praised and getting recognized even if I think there are far better stories out there deserving of that. I cannot deny that. However, I don't get why the community calls this messy travesty a masterpiece, excellent, best shounen of all time, let alone of the decade. Nothing has touched the big three yet in terms of writing. Really everything. I hope one day that work will come but Jujutsu Kaisen is far from ever. This is another example of anime being shilled due to it having crazy production value even when it's not worth it as a whole. I don't recommend this to anyone who wants a solid cast and writing. If you want your flashiness and lifeless light hype, sure knock yourself out. But still not worth it at all. Jujutsu Kaisen? More like Pooputsu Shitaisen."
21459,"TL;DR is located at the end of the review.


""My Hero Academia"" takes place in a world where 80% of the population possesses a special ability known as a ""quirk"", unique to the individual person. This story follows Izuku Midoriya. He's a boy who spent his childhood looking up to his idol, All Might. All Might is one of the strongest heroes, also known as the ""Symbol of Peace"", who spends his time fighting evil. He dreams of becoming a great hero like All Might, but never developed a quirk. His only chance at becoming a hero is to make it into UA High School, the #1 hero training academy. He is constantly picked on for not having a quirk by his classmate Katsuki Bakugou, and calls Midoriya ""Deku"" as an insult. Midoriya meets All Might, and discovers All Might's quirk is known as ""One For All"", giving him high strength and making him almost impossible to beat. Unlike other quirks, this quirk can be passed down and gets stronger the more people it has been passed down to. All Might is revealed to have an injury that limits his time where he is able to use his quirk. Midoriya trains his endurance so his body can handle the quirk, and All Might passes the quirk onto him. Despite this, Midoriya can only use the quirk once and then breaks whatever part of his body he used the quirk with. The story progresses and both Bakugou and Midoriya make it into UA High School through a test where they must fight robots representing villians to earn points. Midoriya meets his classmates and teachers, who have mixed opinions on him. The rest of the show follows his journey on becoming a hero.
~~~Visuals~~~The visuals feel like the standard for a shounen. The fight scenes are what really hold together the show, as they are exciting and decently drawn. The character designs are unique and make them easy to recognize.

~~~ Plot ~~~The area where this show is lacking though, is the plot. There's some filler episodes and it doesn't have a great overarching central point. Most of the episodes just show Midoriya training and attempting to become a strong hero. There isn't a strong conflict besides some fight scenes between heroes and villains.

~~~ Characters
~~~While the characters are well done on the outside, they don't add much development to the story. Only a few characters actually make a difference, while most of the class is kind of just there. I'm not referring to main characters and side characters either. Bakugou, one of the most important characters in the show, barely leaves a mark on the story. His only memorable trait is that he bullies Midoriya, which doesn't change anything about the show.

~~~TL;DR/Conclusion~~~This anime is average. That's the best way I can put it honestly. It doesn't make an impact, but it doesn't suck either. Its main purpose is to entertain the viewer and is meant for younger audiences. It certainly does fulfill that job, but not well. The parts that are meant to be funny are out of place and bad. The visuals are a slightly effective attempt at covering up the meaningless plot. Overall, I'd suggest this show to someone looking for something that isn't deep or hard to understand.

Probably gonna get bashed by the mha fandom but oh well."

Shounen anime are known power-ups which makes no sense, the story behind it feels very weak and illogical, even going by the anime in questions; worlds physics and rules. It's just there to excite you up, make you excited and that in of itself is not a bad thing so to say. However, the build-up to this point, through the world, the character's is significant. This is something I would say Hunter x Hunter accomplishes very well and is one of the few who managed to hit the right notes for this and so much more.

Story

It starts with centering around a young boy, named Gon who sets out on a journey to find his father. Sounds simple enough, but it's the journey to get there and how it does it, is what makes HxH quite special and unusual. For starters, the battles are exciting and fascinating which reflects the rules set up by this world, and it does a great job of showing it to us. It's not as simple as he is the main character and he will win every battle without any real effort or trouble since it can affect us emotionally.

At one point, you will be glued to the screen watching this young boy hunting his prey for his own goals, and while he is doing so, You get to see and hear everything that is going through his head at the time, and it leaves you with his feeling of how dangerous this situation really is and how dire the consequences could become if he where to be detected by his prey. This is just one segment among many which are directed and told so well that you can't help but be glued to your screen watching this all unfold. However, there is more.

What makes it even more fascinating, is the fact that Gon is terrified while doing so, he is acutely aware that he could die if he were to mess this up and how his character portrays this, through his actions and emotions, is a job well done. He doesn't directly attack the enemy with a one-track mind, he strategies on how to hunt his prey. He learns all the ingredients necessary trough mother nature and other hunters he managed to catch a glimpse of doing his own thing.

A big factor in most shounen anime is power, and Gon is not someone anyone sane would want to mess with, even adults. For his age of 12 years old, he is quite strong and fast, and you would rather avoid getting on his wrong side if you know what's best for you. Though, being honest, if brute force were the only thing HxH had going for it, the popularity of it would make no sense. 

We have another type of power and what makes it stand out from most of the others, is how complex and exciting it is. It's not as simple like just getting stronger, unlocking your potential, to mention some. It has its categories which reflect the user's personality and depending on where you have lived, spent your times most, all of this is important in figuring out your type and which category it falls in. Gon is one you would list under Enhancer; these types tend to be simple and straightforward in their demeanor. 

This focuses on the physical aspect of the user, his life energy and how to use it to achieve stronger and higher power. However, it's not that easy, if you were to mess it up, you could put your entire life in danger. You need to know how much to put in each of your attacks, and this is not easy and puts our character's through grueling and intense training segments to make them able to control this power more efficiently and figure out how you would want to use it. 

There is more to this power, but if I were to delve further into it, this entire review would mostly just be focused around that. What I can say, is that at one point, the anime had a one-hour explanation for this power which was one of the most exciting and mesmerizing dialogue I heard in my all time watching anime.

Sound

As for sound, effects, music, it nails all those parts and gives you a great list of many amazing tracks you can't help but get addicted to, at least I was. It feels spot-on and does a great job of reflecting the overall atmosphere and feel of the anime. Like, it would make sense to get bored of listening to the same opening song, over and over, but the things are you don't, and I can't describe adequately ""why?"". First, you might start out disliking the opening (why would you, though?), yet after a few times of listening to it, most persons would be addicted and can't stop looking. It also hits those nostalgia notes well if you are re-watching the anime. The same could also be said for the ending songs. 

The effects are another thing which feels spot-on, not only is Madhouse great at using it, but also manipulating to give you the sense if a character is one assassin, you can barely hear his footsteps, when he runs you can't see sand blowing upward from the steps he takes. Action segments are no exception either, the hits or slashes among other things are done exceptionally well. Madhouse seriously outdid itself and deserved all the praise they get.

Art

The art and animation is another significant deal aspect to an anime and HxH, is one of the best and most consistent. I don't think there was even a moment when I was watching this anime; I taught it looked terrible. Notably, during the fight scenes, it seems and feels, and you can't help but be drawn toward it. It's so fluid with some of the greatest sakuga I have seen. 

Also, depending on the situations, Madhouse does a great job of adapting to it, like the facial expression at severe or comedic moments. Lightning, shading and colors adjustments, determined by the mood or tone of the situations or even the arc in question.

Characters

Just having a good story or writing is not enough, for me at least. You need to love or hate the characters, and I can safely assure you that HxH does a fantastic job of executing them. They feel alive, quirky, noisy, and have a likable personality which makes it, so you don't forget them quickly or the individual's name. HxH has a massive cast of characters, and they all feel necessary to progress our main characters. 

Gon at the start feels simple and straightforward, but as you move forward with the story you start to see flaws in him, I mean he is 12 years old, so it's logical. It would make sense to have some noteworthy issues which make him stand out and make him more of an exciting or annoying character, depending on which category you fall in. If he or the other character's where perfect it would be tedious to follow such a main character, wouldn't you agree?

My favorite part about HxH, though, is the villains or antagonists. You start with hating them when you learn what the hell they put one of your main characters through but when you learn more about them, and you just can't help but like them.. and suddenly, you don't want them to be killed off but be incorporated in the story somehow, to maybe get them a central role in the story because they are just that much exciting and lovable and you can't help but be drawn to their silly nature and personality.

It also features one of my favored antagonists; I started with absolutely hating him and his one-track mind nature of being the best of them all. However, he was still just new to the world, and once he learns more and starts to interact with characters, which challenged his original demeanor. I couldn't help but like him and not wishing death upon him. He is easily one of the most complex written antagonists, and I sincerely hope I can find more character's like him.

You will cry for them; you will hate them, you will love them.

The Negative

This anime deserves all the praise it gets, it's not perfect by any means, but probably close. However, just like any other series, it does come with some flaws which can make the viewer drop it or entirely skip over it. For starters, it's very slow paced and takes it's time to build up. This is not an issue for me, but it might be for other persons, and if they were to stop watching. They will be skipping one amazing anime, which I think at one point, every anime watcher should give a try, it's just that worthy for me.

During a specific huge arc, the pacing became even slower, the explanations for simple things, which could be shown through the animation and art making it more enjoyable is less visible and you get tons of unnecessary info dumping which could be skipped over or replaced with more exciting events. 

This is my most significant flaw in the anime. I don't know how the manga handles this, but just in this regard, the anime did fail to satisfy me. However, this is becoming one tiny nitpick that is easily solved if you watch the anime in a binge. I am one of the persons who experience this arc in a weekly airing manner, and it was not fun to sit through 20 minutes of an episode of not seeing any real progression. Thankfully, I almost looked over this when I sat through the same arc for the second time.

Conclusion

Hunter x Hunter 2011 is one of a kind anime with some amazing and intelligent way to tell a good story, boasting some great and likable characters. Not your typical shounen or anime with some awesome strategizing events and a power that is so complex and difficult to understand but is very fun to learn about. Which totals up to my reason why this still stands strong as my favorite anime to this day and I urge everyone to give it a try, at some point in your life."
21087,"#~~~`One Punch Man`~~~

~~~img65%(https://i.imgur.com/Xo8xnZE.png)~~~
~~~In an oversaturated superhero genre, One Punch Man is a refreshing satire demonstrating that being the strongest isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. At first, the idea of a superhero that can defeat anyone in one punch seems like it would get old fast, and… it does. That’s the point. It’s a comedic take on how boring being overpowered would actually be. But don’t be fooled, because the actual story is far from dull.~~~

##~~~⬢⬡| Overview |⬡⬢~~~
- Plot: Predictable, yet enticing, and provides a good laugh (9.0/10)

- Characters: A fun poke at superhero clichés, with enjoyable interactions (8.5/10)

- Visuals: Good backgrounds and amazing animation (8.9/10)

- Audio: Great music, especially the opening and closing (8.1/10)

- Bingebale/Hype: Tantalizingly easy to continue watching and strong popularity (8.9/10)

- Enjoyment: A personal favorite and one of few re-watches (9.3/10)

##~~~⬢⬡| Summary |⬡⬢~~~
#####~~~Minor Spoilers~~~

As the name implies, Saitama is so overpowered that he can defeat any opponent in one punch. He trained so hard his hair fell out, and now he’s the strongest man in the world. He’s just a hero for the fun of it, but it’s starting to lose its appeal. After all, it’s not much fun when all it takes is one punch to finish the battle. Life is boring. Then, the cyborg Genos suddenly appeared in front of his home, seeking to avenge his dead family. Awed by the sheer power of Saitama, he begs to be allowed to learn from him how to become stronger. Reluctantly Saitama agrees, but this causes both of them to register as official heroes. Genos easily reached the top class of heroes while Saitama’s in the lowest after barely passing the written exam. This new society of class rankings and power struggle give rise to all sorts of problems with new people being introduced all the time, and on top of that Saitama is still battling monsters day after day. Just as he’s starting to get accustomed to his new lifestyle a world wide threat appears that he has no choice but to face. Finally, a worthy opponent!


##~~~⬢⬡| Plot |⬡⬢~~~
##~~~(9.0/10)~~~

If the premise of defeating everyone in one punch was all this show had to offer, then yeah, it wouldn’t be very good. But One Punch Man is more than that. As a satire, it relentlessly pokes fun at every superhero story stereotype there is, exposing just how ridiculous everything really is, making a comedy out of the entire genre. But it also explores the idea of how being the most powerful being actually really sucks. With no risk and no struggle, you just can’t have any fun or thrill. There’s no need to do anything other than nonchalantly sit back and take your time. The only real struggle is the inner one. Saitama yearns for a day when he can actually be presented with a challenge and not just some boring one-hit fight. It’s not exactly the most mysterious plot, in fact, it’s mostly predictable, but just because you can guess what’s going to happen next doesn’t mean you won’t enjoy what comes next. It’s a unique idea that took the idea of being the strongest  very literally and showing the reality of how dull it would be while also keeping everything laughable and lighthearted.

##~~~⬢⬡| Characters |⬡⬢~~~
##~~~(8.5/10)~~~

Saitama is one of the most unbothered and nonchalant characters there is, probably because he’s so overpowered. Genos, the cyborg, on the other hand is the textbook definition of someone who must become stronger to avenge their fallen family, nothing else matters. This makes their interactions quite amusing. Besides the main two characters, many other supporting characters appear too, and most of them are also perfect stereotypes, from the heroes, to the villains. In fact, the extent at which the characters portray popular clichés is probably the only thing taken seriously in the whole show. 

##~~~⬢⬡| Visuals |⬡⬢~~~
##~~~(8.9/10)~~~

As far as the style and artwork goes, there’s nothing too special about the visuals other than the backgrounds. Of course, like everything else, a lot of it is intended to poke fun at the genre, especially character designs. It’s definitely not bad, but it isn’t much more than slightly above average at best. I will say it does vary a bit, but in a good way. It can suddenly switch from an almost too simplistic style, to a highly detailed fight scene in a moment.Where this show really shines however, is its animation. Absolutely phenomenal and iconic fight scenes. Seeing the plain bald Saitama go from egg to incredible powerhouse is amazing and the scenes and angles portray the fights better than any other action anime I’ve seen. It’s exciting, it draws you in and keeps your attention. You don’t want to look away for even a second.

##~~~⬢⬡| Audio |⬡⬢~~~
##~~~(8.1/10)~~~

Much like the visuals, most of the audio doesn’t really stand out in any way, but it’s not bad either. It’s good in the same way that every other decent anime’s audio is good. However, also much like the visuals, there is one key element that stands above the rest, and that’s the music. The theme music is just, mwah \chef’s kiss. I don’t know how I would go about explaining it though, other than just saying it’s good. If you’re reading this review to decide whether or not to watch One Punch Man or not, then you’ll just have to watch it, if only for the music.

##~~~⬢⬡| Bingeability/Hype |⬡⬢~~~
##~~~(8.9/10)~~~

Despite exploring the idea of a boring existence, the plot is still enticing and keeps you wanting to watch more and more. I can count the number of animes I’ve rewatched on one hand, and this is one of them. Even after finishing, you still aren’t satisfied with watching it only once. Everyone who has been watching anime for even a short time at least recognizes the name One Punch Man, and it’s popularity is indicative of how well received it was. It might be overrated, but only slightly, and not without good reason.

##~~~⬢⬡| Enjoyment |⬡⬢~~~
##~~~(9.3/10)~~~

I heavily enjoy this anime. Action and comedy are like my two favorite genres and while they usually are combined, not one show combines them to this extent. I don’t know what good things to say about this anime other than what I’ve already said, but it is definitely a favorite of mine. It combines the qualities of multiple kinds of animes to the extreme, which is the main reason, I think, it’s so good.

~~~img33%(https://i.imgur.com/UBGe16C.png)~~~
####Something I would like to add responding to criticism of the show, is that it’s meant to be satire, it’s comedy. I think a lot of people forget that, and expect something more from it. It’s meant to be a lighthearted and fun show, so don’t expect a masterpiece of a plot. The whole point of the show is to be entertained and have a good laugh. If you go in with reasonable expectations, you will enjoy yourself a whole lot more than otherwise."

I mean everyone knows at this point that the Manga was (slightly) better and this adap was piss poor.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
The story focuses on Ken Kaneki, a human, who turns into a ghoul due to his boner doing all the thinking during a date and following a girl into a creepy alley way. That girl being Rize, a ghoul, who gets fucking decked and her organs get given to Kaneki. (therefor turning him into a half ghoul).

He now has to live with the fact that he has to feed on Human Meat or he will fucking die. But of course our main hero is too scared and cowardly to do that, I mean I understand, they wanted to show that he still has his humanity left and wants to protect both Ghouls and Humans but I felt like that whole thing went for far too long, there is only so much whining you can do before Survival instincts kick in.

During the middle episode it is revelead that a doctor is actually producing these human ghoul combos, they don't really do much with this though until much late (not included in the first season).

There is also Kaneki having to hide from ""The Doves"", these lads are basically Ghoul Hunters.

The end parts of this show is what TG is known for, white haired Kaneki. After being tortured Kaneki snaps and unleashes his inner ghoul. I mean the combat is nice and all but after this point Kaneki gets too serious for my liking.

The first season of Tokyo Ghoul doesn't really get into the juicy parts of the series. But you're better off reading the manga since even this was weirdly paced compared to the manga. They didn't skip a lot of the content (they only did that in the later seasons) but still. Not the best experience.

[CHARACTERS:]()
Tokyo Ghoul has a lot of characters, here's a few that are memorable.

Ken Kaneki - The main character, I already mentioned his origin story. At first Kaneki is quite a normal lad, though pretty shy and cowardly I guess is the correct word to use. I didn't mind that to be honest, there are too many shows where the heroes are these extroverted happy machines. I want to relate to a character xd

Touka Kirishima - The opposite of Ken, she is kinda of a tsundere. She likes humans but doesn't say that and gets all worked up when her true feelings are about to be exposed.

Kureo Mado - An insane Dove who will stop at nothing to exterminate a ghoul.

Koutarou Amon - His mentor is Mado. Amon is much more strict and work focused than Mado.

And thats about it. Sorry.
~~~img420(https://media0.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpGJ9Culw53Xydq/source.gif)~~~



[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The art style is quite good. I can't really say much else about it, its better than usual stuff we see. The animation is also well made to be honest, the combat scenes are fluid and smooth but apart from that nothing groundbreaking in my opinion.

[MUSIC:]()
Now, I'll let you in on a secret. I forgoten the OST for this show. I do remember that the OP is catchy af though.
Probably the most iconic opening right behind AoT.

[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Tokyo Ghoul (Season 1) has a lot of potential. (though me having read the manga I know that its wasted potential)

They set up the first season quite well but pace it weirdly, the combat was fun when it lasted but its not enough to hook me into watching the rest of the series. Only a handfull of the characters are worth paying attention to, the rest are either annoying or the scum of earth."
20958,"Spoilers will be discussed in this review.

Unlike my thoughts of AOT’s 1st season, I enjoyed my first viewing of S2 a lot. From memory, I remembered appreciating the focus on the side characters more than the main trio, as I felt the strengths of the show were better exemplified with them rather than a screaming lunatic. I also liked the more mysterious air the show had now and remembered the pace being slower than S1. 

After rewatching, the strengths I still stand by (though I appreciate Eren’s value a lot more now) but I could not have been more wrong about the slower and more thoughtful pace. I always found it funny when people discuss the season’s of this show, S1 is always the rollercoaster while S2 is the one with more plot progression. 

S2 is just as much an insane ride as S1, if not even crazier at some points. The set pieces are incredible, and the relentless pacing of important, hype-filled events is astounding. 

The slower moments were a little better in this season because of how much the mystery has grown. Every conversation was interesting to hear and the way this season builds up suspense is masterful. 
The very first episode is very dialogue driven except for the end which is crazy. The Beast Titan is, in my opinion, the scariest titan revealed up to that point and the whole scene with the Scout Captain (can’t remember his name) was bone chilling. Seriously, he has one of the most disturbing deaths in the series so far. 

After a great moment with Sasha in the next episode, we then head to the Castle battle which is my favorite sequence in this season. The hopeless feel and the brutal deaths filled these episodes with a sense of dread. You don’t know what’s gonna happen, especially since none of the main three are present. 

Then, it culminates in an epic reveal and rescue scene. Truly a classic moment. But then…it gets crazier. 

Spoilers in bound (for the two people that haven’t seen this show yet) but Reiner and Bertholt’s reveal was incredible. The build-up with Eren not wanting to believe it, and the casual way it’s revealed was pretty unique and unexpected for a show as bombastic as this. 

But the transformation and subsequent battle steals the show. The epic new songs by Sawano are god tier and mixed with the raw emotion of feeling betrayed by two likable characters makes you, the viewer, feel just as hurt as Eren and the others. This show would not be as good without Sawano’s score, I truly believe that. It brings that something extra to every scene, and the transformation and battle scene is a great showcase of that. 

Then, the rescue operation. So much more was revealed in this arc than I remembered. The way this show builds mystery is honestly award worthy. You see Marley soldiers before you even know who they are, you see the edge of the island where Marley turns people to titans well before Grisha’s past is revealed. 

Ymir for me is the GOAT of this season. She went from a character that wasn’t even named in season 1 to one of the most important players in the story. Her backstory was unique and really made me feel for her. The scene where she looks up to the stars and the song “Call of Silence” peaks actually brought a tear to my eye.

Continuing on with the topic of mystery, there’s parts of Ymir’s past I still don’t know about, and that’s amazing. It’s satisfying and mysterious, and beyond the hype, that is the core of this show, and this arc perfectly exemplifies this. 

But the moment that will stick out to me the most in this season, the one that has stuck with me the most is in the final episode. Death is an important part of this show and is arguably one of the best series to handle it. 

Every death is meaningful and impactful to the story, but most have been characters with no real sentimental attachment. Hannes is different. I’m not sure what the general consensus on him is, but his death is probably the most tear-jerking in the series at this point, even counting both parts of Season 3. 
He was there at the very beginning, he knows the main trio. Their struggles, hardships, and pain. He failed to save Eren’s mother and that has stayed with him. Despite this, he never lets his guilt get the better of him. Throughout Season 2, he helps Eren, Armin and Mikasa continuing moving forward and every scene with him brings a smile to my face. (Special mention to the hilarious flashback scene where everyone gets in a fight).

His burden is mighty, even mightier than Eren’s so to see the titan that devoured her return, Hannes fights to life and limb to avenge her. No scene in this show has hit me harder than his death. The final look he gives to Eren as he is ripped apart and eaten brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. 
Since the beginning of the show, it is the most hopeless moment for our characters. The complete silence surrounding the scene directly connects you to how Eren feels. This scene is incredible and really showcases how smart and well crafted this series is. 

Overall, this is one of the best follow-ups to a hyped show ever made. The non-stop roller coaster continues and keeps on rolling until the very end. I loved this season just as much as the first, and I can’t wait to continue re-watching up until I catch up to Season 4."
11757,"THIS REVIEW IS 100% BIASED (and there are spoilers so be warned)

(I updated the ""final score"" to reflect a more subjective view of the anime without personal bias)

Well, now that i've gotten that out of the way, here is MY PERSONAL review of the anime Sword Art Online. It probably is unfitting of what most people say (I've heard every negative thing said about SAO). However, there is a reason why Sword Art Online is my favorite anime to this day. I'll start with my personal reasons on why I gave it a score of 10. 

To put it simply: The rating of 10 comes from personal enjoyment. Was this anime perfect? No. Was this anime flawed in a lot of ways? Yes. Do I care? NOPE! At the time I decided to watch SAO, I had previously been unexposed to the action genre. Being a young ish (16 yr old at the time) female I typically enjoyed romance and shoujo anime. So SAO was something quite new and exciting for me to pick up. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, so of course at first I did not notice the flaws in storyline and progression that everyone seems to point out (at first anyway). To me, I simply adored the mix of action and romance, considering I still loved watching romance in anime. I will go into more details about this when I discuss characters, but my point is that the combination of action (something new) mixed with romance (something I loved) in a cool stuck-in-a-game setting was REALLY EXCITING to me. I soon fell in love with almost all the characters (talking about you, Silica...) and became a huge fan of the series from then on. I have re-watched the whole anime (both seasons) 4 times, so as that shows, I definitely know my way around the series. 

Now with that aside, I will rate some aspects of the anime like music, characters, story (with some bias obviously, as I stated above)!

Animation
This one is a 10/10 stars for me. SAO had (and has) a pretty large production budget. When you compare it to anime like Log Horizon, you can tell the difference (not to bash on Log Horizon). Many talented animators were brought in to work on this anime, and it is especially apparent with its brilliant action scenes, lively colors, and beautiful landscapes and scenery. I could go on and on, but I believe I have made my point. 

Soundtrack
Again, a 10/10 for me. The main battle theme Swordland is very memorable, and to this day gives me chills. It is no surprise that SAO has excellent music, as very talented Yuki Kajiura provided works for OST. Most people probably know she's done music for other well received anime such as Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero and so on. Every theme is fitting and I still listen to the OST to this day. All the openings and endings are catchy and I personally enjoy them. Overall, a stunning soundtrack for a stunning anime!

Characters
Oooh boy, one of the places where SAO gets bashed a ton. ""Here we have the main protagonist: completely lifeless, pointlessly overpowered, boring personality. Then we have the badass female lead who turns into a cookie-cutter tsundre"". I'm here to explain why I believe that those characters are more than what people negatively say about them. Personally, the characters section gets a solid 7/10. While there are some good characters, there are definitely places where this anime fails to deliver in its characters. To explain, let's start with the good: none other than Kirito (let me remind anyone reading again that this is my personal opinion)~

Kirito is my favorite character in the series. At the start, his personality comes across as a cold, introvert. He has trouble making everyday small talk, and this is portrayed very well. As he is a loner, he enjoys playing solo and does not like forming parties (he has trouble finding a partner for the first boss raid). However, we can see that as the course of the anime goes on, certain things happen to him to shape his personality. He goes through heartbreak, does things he regrets, and finds it within himself to beat the death game for a very compelling and heartwarming reason. In my opinion, Kirito is the most interesting character in the whole series. I do not find him boring, and despite all things, I actually find him somewhat relatable. People criticize saying it is hard to empathize with someone who is too perfect, but I disagree. During all his hardships, I truly felt his pain, I could feel real emotion from him as he fought battles and escaped near-death situations. 

So maybe he is a tad overpowered for his own good (hacking the game console, really?) However, is that REALLY bad? I don't find it to be. Sure, it might have been cool to see some progression from when he started off as being a ""noob"", but hey, he was a former beta tester after all, and seems to have a decent knowledge of games in general. That alone can explain why Kirito is a much better player than the majority of the 10,000 who are trapped. There are (unfortunately) some major time skips that happen which fail to show any progression from his character (more on this in the story section), and after a two year time skip, he is leaps and bounds better. Unfortunately, we do not get to see this development. It just happens. However, I don't feel like this limits his character. You can still see his character develop in other ways as he finds his romantic interest, and begins to see a future that involves her. His personality is shaped by the interactions he has with the people around him, and the experiences he goes through. From his guilt of killing the moonlit black cats, to facing Akihiko Kayaba at the end, to nearly dying by a laughing coffin member, and so on. You will start to see how his mindset goes initially from it being all about himself and how he was going to survive... to turning the focus on saving Asuna. A shift from selfish to selfless. This continues to show through in the second half of the first season all the way to the second. He is always determined to keep his party members alive. I loved his determination, how he never gave up. His sheer passion for what he was doing was incredible to watch. I could really see how much he loved Asuna, and how much he was willing to do to clear the game.

Another negative aspect that people say about Kirito is that he gets a special skill: Dual Blades. How could this be? Why is he the only one? Well, Kayaba (the creator of SAO) stated very clearly that this skill was awarded to the player with the fastest reflexes, or someone that he thought would be the one to beat the game. That may not reflect how games are played in real life, and to that I say SAO is NOT a typical game! This is a fantasy game, in a fantasy world, and of course, it does not need to reflect how things are done in our real world, period. 

Before this gets too long, I want to state that I do see where his character has flaws, but to me, the good outweighs the bad. It didn't stop me from absolutely loving him as a character. I know not many will agree with me on this, but this is what I truly believe. 


Asuna is another great character (my second favorite). We can see some fantastic character development in the first season as she goes from seriousness, to learning how to love the dire situation she was in. Although she was trapped in the world of SAO, she didn't hide herself in the town of beginnings, but rather ventured out to clear the game. Even though she had never played a game in her life, she decided that living in fear wasn't going to be an option. In my opinion, that takes courage. In the Mothers Rosario arc, we also see lots more much needed back story of her home life, and we can see how the effects of Sword Art Online make things troubling at home. 

Overall, I can see how people say that Asuna is a ""cookie cutter character"", however, I think she has more complexity than that. For critics, she is too ""tsundre"", but again, is that a bad thing? (Toradora's Taiga... hello?) It may be typical and not unique however, I think Asuna goes beyond her ""lackluster tsundre trope"". For one, she is essential to the story, not only as Kirito's love, but for the sole fact that Kirito and Asuna are a great team. We can see how her experiences in the death game evolve her personality into becoming someone who would risk her own life to save the one she loves. I personally enjoyed her spunk and and feminine, yet badass personality.
I loved seeing such a strong female lead in this anime. At times, she may be slightly shadowed by her counterpart Kirito, but that does not make her any less of a character (more so in the second part of the first season). She and Kirito make a fantastic couple. I was delighted while watching the romance between them ensue. They might have been young, but it was pleasant, and heart-warming to see.

Finally, I have a very quick note on Yui. Personally, I found her as an addition to the family to be extremely cute, which further bonded Kirito and Asuna's relationship. Yui could be seen as a cheat device, but I think the complexity of Yui being an artificial intelligence, yet seemingly having real life emotions adds to the futuristic setting we are in (2024). Yui was created to assist players with mental health problems, but she was attracted attracted to Kirito and Asuna because they were among the few players who still managed to laugh and be happy despite dire situation they were in. She managed to defy the game master and help Kirito and Asuna, something that goes beyond what a normal AI should be able to do. I found that connection between them to be adorable especially the fact that she was their adoptive daughter! 

Now, to try to wrap things up, I'm going to quickly say a few things about the rest of the characters in general. Unfortunately, I believe that some characters were useless in SAO. Silica and Liz are the two that stand out in this category. To me, they did not add much to the story of value, and seemed to be more filler than anything. Other characters like Klien and Agil were great, however, I wish they had more screen time. 
Sinon and Yuuki were well fleshed out characters as well, however, this review will become way too long if I start talking about that. Suguha, or Leafa is another character that had complexity, however, I personally was not a fan of her incest love for her brother. Some of the villains are too stereotypically villain-y (at least that is what most people tend to say), but it did the job (and made me hate them). Overall, there were some issues with characters, but for the sole reason that the two main characters were great, I still can find enjoyment with the rest. 

Story
This one gets a 10/10 for me. It has a fantastic plot. I mean, come on, trapped in a VIRTUAL REALITY video game? That with the added ""if you die in the game, you die in real life"" factor makes this incredibly fascinating to watch. It was a concept that I had never thought of before. That is one of the reasons why I loved it so much the first time I watched it. 
Moving on to the second half, the whole story of saving Asuna is loathed by many, but I found that half to be very moving and driven, as you can see Kirito's determination very apparently in this arc as well (especially when he makes attempts to get to the top of the world tree). I did not mind that Asuna was a ""damsel in distress"" in this case. I loved seeing Kirito's love for Asuna continue to shine through his actions. The downside? It took the compelling death game aspect away, which lowered the stakes in a way. It wasn't a huge problem for me though.

The Gun Gale Online arc attempted to bring back the death game aspect with death gun (who looks and sounds way too much like darth vader by the way) It was enjoyable, but there was a lack of Asuna which wasn't my favorite, especially since Sinon was a LITTLE too comfortable with Kirito in that cave....

The 3 episode arc in between GGO and Mother's Rosario is nothing special. Basically a side quest for a sword. That's it.

The Mother's Rosario arc featured Asuna and some new characters. Easily the second most emotional arc there is in SAO. I really loved the focus on Asuna, and how much emotion and character development there was. (Sorry about the shallow reviews and summaries here, but I've been at this for two hours and I'm starting to feel like this review is too long!!) 

Plot Execution
The worst part of SAO in my opinion (however, this does NOT influence how I feel overall about it). I give it a 6/10. Like I mentioned earlier, there are too many time skips, too many pointless, filler episodes, and I sometimes wish that the anime could be redone but using the progressive novels instead of the original light novels. I also wish there was more focus on the Aincrad arc. Stopping mid season felt so unfinished (although, it was an interesting plot twist. I definitely was not expecting that), as even critics agree that the Aincrad arc was easily the best part of SAO. So with those critical flaws, the ideas and story were great, just poorly executed in my opinion if I will be honest. However, this does not change how I feel about SAO as a whole. As I stated above, my 10 score is based on my enjoyment I have had for the anime, so the negative aspects don't bother me! 

I'm going to go ahead and end the review here. I could easily continue writing this and polish my thoughts even more. However, that is for another time. Kudos to you if you read this far. I bet you're a hardcore SAO fan like me, haha (or heck you might be a hater trying to comprehend how I could even think the way I do). Anyhow, I hope this shows you why I personally loved Sword Art Online so much. Even though I know lots hate it, there are also those like me who love it. Here's hoping this essay explained that thoroughly. Until next time!"
5114,"# Verdict
This is undoubtedly one of the top 3 animes to have ever been produced. The art, the music, the story and it's characters all fit together perfectly. If you choose this as your first anime, you will hold almost every other anime to it's standards for quite a while. For this reason I cannot recommend anyone breaking into watching anime for the first time, to pick this one as your first. Pick another. Hold off long enough so you can appreciate some of the lesser ones a bit better. Nothing else can be said about this apart from that it's not just an anime. It's a masterpiece.

## The Music

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dNkQoE76nY)

I don't know how to say this. But when ""Again"" by Yui started playing to the intro, I felt a teardrop rolling down my cheek. I rarely cry to any sort of media, but this one really got me. To put things into perspective, that song was my ring tone for a whole 2 years.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0cbUHmVdu4)

The other opening song that really caught my attention was ""Golden Time Lover"" by Sukima Switch. Still all the opening songs were amazing.  That's not the only thing, the scores were downright perfect as well. If the story and the art weren't just as intriguing, then one could argue all your focus would be on the music.

## The Art
I'm going to let the art speak for itself.

## The Story
Without spoiling anything, the story is about a search for something by two brothers and the epic adventure that follows it's wake. The emotional connection between the brothers and the characters they encounter in their journey is what sets this story apart. There is something for everyone, be it romance, adventure, drama or action packed fighting. 

The whole thing is set in an alternate universe where military rule and strange powers preside. The bewildering mysteries will keep you on your toes and the action packed sequences will make some characters bad-ass and others hated beyond reason. Despite the story being serious overall, it still manages to squeeze in comedic effect where none would expect. You cannot be disappointed.

## Reason for the Score
Some of you might be wondering, ""How can any anime deserve a perfect score?"". There's a lot of obscure anime out there that might fit your taste better in the long run like it did for me. But this isn't about personal (subjective) tastes. This is about objective popularity. In the majority of cases it is indubitable that this anime will be in the top 10 of lists that rank anime TV series by quality. Don't get me wrong, I'm not appealing to the majority. Rather the contrary, I'm appealing to the genius is takes to appeal to everyone. To be fun for everyone. So if we're going to say there are objectively some really good anime, then you'd have to agree with me that this should always top the list."
20,"Out of all the long-running Shounen series that are out there, to me, one stands above the rest. Even though I only watched this anime recently, it holds a special place in my heart as my favorite long-running action anime that I have ever seen, and for good reason. 

One of the main problem’s that plagues a lot of long-running Shounen’s is their ability to keep an interesting narrative throughout the entire run time of the show. They make it interesting by having the show made up of many different arc’s that each have their own stories, characters and problem’s that the characters must face. A lot of these arcs are self-contained stories that don’t do much for the plot, despite the quality of some arcs. Naruto, doesn’t really do that. While each arc does have their own problems that the characters face the overarching story and the reason these events are happening tie in to the constant narrative that plays throughout the whole show. The plot is always advancing and not once is it ever boring to watch since the characters are always growing and learning different things about their friends and the world that they live in. Normally, if I would ever review any long-running Shounen’s in the future, this would be the section where I do mini reviews of every main arc in the series, but considering the whole show plays out like one big narrative, it’s almost impossible for me to do that. 

The main story itself is compelling enough that it doesn’t feel like reason just to get cool characters to fight it out (Which is the vibe I’m getting from Bleach from my experience of watching it so far. The story in Naruto is always expanding, new characters get introduced, new villains emerge and while a lot of the events in this series are set up for what’s to come in Shippuden (Especially in the Sasuke Retrieval Arc) it’s still worth watching to see where the characters grow and mold into the people they are later in the story (I say this because it seems quite a few people skip this series and start with Shippuden). 
Not everything is flawless in this department, however. Naruto is notorious for having insane amounts of filler episodes and this show is one of the biggest offenders of this problem. It starts off harmless enough by having a recap episode, then a hot spring episode, a fun episode about Kakashi’s face and a five-episode arc about a race which would be fine if that was all it was. Instead of ending the show at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, the show continues into 85 episodes of filler! Even for a long-running show like this one, 85 is an insane amount of filler episodes to have in a row. They even start the filler, right when the story was about to make it to the time-skip. While it was done to wait up for the manga, they could have just ended the original series and waited until they had enough material to start making Shippuden. Instead we got 85 episodes of low-quality random ninja missions that are close to unbearable to watch. I made it through the first few episodes of the first filler arc when I decided to stop and skip to the final episode. Even though this problem can be avoided now since you can just skip these episodes, it only really bugs me when I think of how long fans had to wait until the filler ended back when these episodes were airing. It may not be a problem now but it gets annoying when it still plagues Shippuden. But as I said before, you can just skip them now (Which is the most recommended option). So, in terms of the story department, Naruto does an excellent job considering all the filler is skippable. 

For long-running Shounen battle series, it is important to have cool, likable characters that make up the cast. No matter how cool the battles are, they won’t matter if you don’t care about who is fighting. Luckily, this is where Naruto shines the most. Naruto, as the protagonist of the story, does a great job to make the viewers root for him. Being the ultimate underdog, Naruto aims big in this series and is where the main emotion comes from throughout the show. He’s a boy that has nothing, that aims for everything. His relationship with the other main characters, his rival and best friend Sasuke, his love interest Sakura and his teacher Kakashi is what really drives this show and is what made this show so popular in the first place. As Naruto bonds with these characters you see him grow from being the village loser to their strongest ninja by doing nothing but making friends and working hard to get stronger. His struggles are relatable and his goals make sense for a person like him. At first, he causes trouble because he’s alone and he thinks that everybody hates him. But by meeting his new squad and bonding with other ninja, he becomes aware of how special friendship is and how you need bonds if you’re going to be Hokage (which is the head of the village). 

Apart from Naruto, the cast is made up of the coolest and craziest character’s I’ve seen in any anime. I already mentioned Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi but some of the best characters come in the form of rival ninja teams or the crazy villains that the heroes face. Among my favourites are Rock Lee (the lovable goofball), Shikamaru (the lazy genius), Hinata (the very shy, true love interest), Neji (the vengeful prodigy turned ally), Temari (this one is biased since she is my favourite female character) and Gaara (the frightening villain turned greatest ally). Even characters that I didn’t like at first like Ino, Choji, Kiba, Kankuro and Orochimaru turned out to be some of my favourite heroes and villains. But the best character (apart from Naruto himself) is Naruto’s perverted teacher, Jiraiya. Jiraiya is probably one of the most important characters in the series, mostly because of the impact he has on Naruto. While his squad leader Kakashi is training Sasuke, Naruto heads to Jiraiya who teaches him the Rasengan which becomes Naruto’s signature move and becomes Naruto’s father figure throughout the rest of the series. He’s motivation for Naruto to not give up and to continue moving forward with his dreams and ambitions. While I could continue with characters like Tsunade, Kabuto and Itachi, I’ll end this segment here by saying that out of all the other categories, Characters is what Naruto excels at the most.   

The soundtrack is amazing. The songs are a nice mix of traditional Japanese music mixed in with badass guitar. The Main Theme of the series is one of the most memorable, iconic and beautiful pieces of music to anybody that’s seen this show. If you haven’t heard it, you owe it to yourself to listen to it since it’s probably the most amazing song in the whole soundtrack. In terms of Openings and Endings, Naruto proves once again that just because it’s a long-running Shounen, it doesn’t need to half-ass it’s theme songs. Every Opening is a memorable J-Rock tune and not one of them is bad. It’s hard to pick a favorite from these songs which is why mine is a three-way tie between Haruka Kanata (OP 2), GO!!! (OP 4) and No Boy, No Cry (OP 6). The ED’s, while not as good as the OP’s, are still good and get the job done as Ending songs. Wind (ED 1), Viva Rock (ED 3) and Ima made Nando mo (ED 5) are my favorites while the others are still good, but not the most memorable. 
While I haven’t heard the Japanese voice acting since I watched the Dub, I can still judge the Dub and my god, is this a damn good Dub. Every voice actor hits the mark with every character they play. Maile Flanagan does an amazing job as Naruto and Yuri Lowenthal (who is one of my favourite voice actors) does one of my favourite performances from the show, as Sasuke who is one of the most iconic characters from the show. Tara Platt also does an amazing job as Temari considering that her performance is one of the main reasons that I like Temari so much. Other notable performances are Steven Blum as Zabuza and Orochimaru, Steve Stayley as Neji, Stephanie Sheh as Hinata, David Lodge as Jiraiya and Liam O’Brien as Gaara. Every other performance of the other main characters was also great but those were some of the best ones that were worth mentioning. If you couldn’t tell, Naruto also does a great job in the Sound department. 

Now to some of Naruto’s low points. The best way to describe this show is by saying that you’re basically watching an animated manga with a few great examples of amazing fight animation. While this isn’t Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters levels of barely animated, it’s noticeable considering there are a great number of shots that either linger or are completely still. Despite that, every fight in the show (and there are quite a lot) is always interesting to watch and is never boring to watch. The lack of animation during the dialogue sections of the show is made up for by the great animation for a lot of the fight scenes. Battles like Neji vs. Hinata, Rock Lee vs. Gaara, Naruto vs. Gaara, Naruto and Jiraiya and Tsunade vs. Orochimaru and Kabuto, Rock Lee vs. Kimimaro and Naruto vs. Sasuke are all excellent examples of fight animation in long-running Shounen battle series. 
The animation takes a turn for the worse, however, when you start getting into the filler episodes. They start off fine until the big 85 episodes of filler begins and you see how cheaply the episodes are made and how ugly everything looks. Speaking of things that look ugly, sometimes the character models will look strange and distorted which can come off as very weird and half-assed. I think this might be a problem in the manga as well but some of the off looking characters can be vary jarring when you see them for the first time. This happens very rarely so it’s not too much of a problem. Apart from that, the background art looks amazing and is highly detailed. Even if a shot is barely animated the backgrounds are always interesting to look at and is proof of the crazy amount of work that Masashi Kishimoto put into when he first published each chapter. The show can look extremely beautiful at times but still looks kind of blurry at times (which is a problem shared with Bleach which means that it’s more down to what Studio Pierrot was doing). Naruto does a great gob in the Animation department). 

Overall, if you are going to pick one of the Big 3 (Naruto, Bleach and One Piece) to watch, Naruto is your best bet. It’s fun, easy to get into and has a satisfying story where you see every character grow with every decision that they make in the show. It might be the only one worth watching in the end, since it hasn’t fallen apart like Bleach did and it might end unlike One Piece. Even though the show is 50% filler, you can still skip it which will make the experience shorter than what you may think. As it stands this first season of Naruto defined a whole new generation of anime fans when it premiered all the way back in 2002. A generation of Fighting Dreamers."
21,"One Piece is a great adventure series, with a lovable cast of characters. This series follows the adventures of a boy named Luffy who's goal is to become ""King of the pirates"". This series has some of the best world building in fiction, islands and islands packed with information on geography and rich history. A map of the One Piece world can be so detailed almost as life like as a real world map. One Piece has very strong characters and a very strong protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy is a character that has dreams and goals supported with motive. The cast of characters is so grand that characters you meet 100's of episodes ago will return and impact the story in many ways. My favorite thing about One Piece however is the outside interactions that effect the plot, for example characters that are not apart of the main cast like Ace and Blackbeard will have a battle that can determine how the world will progress. Each arc in One Piece gives you a payoff that will leave you fulfilled. Some of the most impactful moments in anime I have ever seen are in One Piece, scenes will leave you in tears and run shivers down your spine. One Piece is a series that has been planned from the very beginning and you can see this with all the foreshadowing that the author leaves in his writing, even moments that are not planned he is able to integrate them into previous plot points and have them connect with something that was mentioned in the previous chapters. As it is a great spectacular series one issue that might be jarring to readers is the length and pacing of One Piece, it is a commitment of itself, watching and reading one piece won't be easy but the storytelling in this series is like no other. One Piece will fulfill anyone need for it has many genres all mixed into one but it doesn't, effect the theme of one piece in anyway. Speaking of the theme, one piece's theme does not change from the beginning of the series to the end, and has a main character that embodies the message of the theme. There is many more great things about the story ""One Piece"" I do recommend anyone to give it a watch/read I will however recommend you read the manga over the anime due to pacing issues in the anime. Other than that I would give the series a 10/10 just due to the story."
21519,"You’ve probably already seen this movie but regardless, mild spoilers for the premise that truly reveals itself whole past the synopsis and maybe a few specific spoilers along the way

When most people think of Kimi no Na wa, they think of a simple emotionally gripping, beautifully animated masterpiece that touched them at their very core. When I think of Kimi no Na wa, I think of a tedious, convoluted, contrived, and ultimately misguided emotion-based time travel story blessed with wonderful visuals and cursed by its confusingly bad time travel narrative and equally hard to stomach main leads.

I know, I’m a buzzkill. 

So, why my cynicism? Before you try to answer, let me take two of them out for you. It has little to do with it being in the top 10 on every anime aggregation website, or the fact that this not only outsold every single Ghibli movie such as the insanely popular Spirited Away, or that it is the highest grossing anime movie of all time as of writing. I don't feel it was anywhere near good enough to warrant any of that, but it would be incredibly petty of me to call that a reason I dislike the film. With that out of the way, let's begin with the writing.

A boy and a girl suddenly wake up from a dream, only to realize that their bodies have switched. I must say, right out the bat, I like the fact that each new day is told from the perspective of one of the two characters while switching perspectives to suit a new day in the beginning and that it starts on a character being explained to how she was acting weird, and putting two and two together allows us to see that this is the aftermath of one of these body-switching incidents that occur a lot throughout this movie. This is where the compliments of the story end for a while.

How long have these two been switching bodies? Given the montage especially, it's insanely hard to keep track, and I know it's all thanks to a comet, but I doubt a comet would remain visible for a small country like Japan for so long that the montage sort of hints at weeks of this happening? How come these characters start off thinking they're in a dream, even after feeling pain (especially given the whole gag cliche based around this exact trope of waking up after pain in a dream) and seeing the entire day go by in real-time? I know full well that no dream lasts that long without entering at least one period of long, non-R.E.M. sleep (and R.E.M. lasts for about 15 minutes and that's when you dream, and dreams are never this coherent)? How come after so long, nobody tries to put two and two together about this whole thing with their own theories until the second half? Speaking of the second half…

The second half is where this movie turns from just irritating to convoluted and contrived. A comet from 3 years ago is seen 3 years later (I can't fathom how that's supposed to work, especially in such a short amount of time given a comet or a star) by these two main characters and that's what caused them to switched bodies with each other every day, and only them for no adequately explained reason, and that's a missed opportunity. We could've had scenes of some other people acting weird because of that too, though they would still need to explain it well beyond time travel-esque bullshit that doesn't explain anything. It turns out that two people end up, for no good reason, figuring it out: the grandmother of the girl, and the girl’s father. An explosion happens at one point in a major facility and no one considered that a  dangerous threat after being told that more of this can happen (though it's a diversion to evacuate the people from 3 years ago because apparently the comet splits and destroys the city that the girl was in, including her, meaning it would make no sense how she could connect with him, especially since the ending sort of rewrites that, which sort of changes the future but people can't do a good time travel plot for shit). The ending also just ends with the two sort of recognizing each other and then rolling to credits after panning up towards the clouds, so...that's something, I guess.

I had to go back and research literally every character’s name, they were that forgettable. It's not even like Rogue One where they either say most characters’ names once or not at all, they say these guys’ names constantly. This has never happened to me before for any anime. Let that sink in...and then realize how funny it is that the movie is translated as “Your Name” given these circumstances.

Taki and Mitsuha are dense, extremely dense. I mean, I’m a bit of a dense person myself as anyone who knows me IRL for longer than a small bit will tell you, but these two are infuriatingly dense to the point of actual stupidity. There was the “dream” example from earlier but also, these guys constantly set rules for each other to not interfere much with their lives, only to constantly break them. They conveniently forget things for the sake of the plot, though to be fair, that's just the plot actively forcing them to forget things for no reason and not then being idiots, so back to that. When Mitsuha meets Taki in the emotional climax of the film, she straight up calls him an idiot over the fact that he often played with her tits when he woke up in her body...and this is the first thing g she says to him in the middle of an emotional climax. Not “I finally found you” or something befitting of such a scene where they first sorta meet each other truly within the little time they have before convenient BS makes it so they physically don't see each other anymore and proceed to go on their way to accomplish a necessary task, but “Baka”. Fucking really?

It's insanely hard to talk about any of the characters’ personalities since while outside of the protagonists, none of these are truly bad characters, they are insanely forgettable. I forgot everything about these people by the time I finished the movie, aside from the fact that Mitsuha's little sister doesn't like taking shit from people, and that she conveniently forgets something too (not even for plot convenience this time, just her being an idiot at one point in the final act). I genuinely cannot describe these people, and again, this has never, ever happened to me before! That is a cardinal sin for a movie so focused on pathos! So, fuck it; moving on!

If nothing else can be said, let it be known that this is a rather gorgeous film. CoMix Wave Films did an amazing job with the visuals and digital effects here, especially with the environment. Shoutouts to how jaw-dropping the comet was and how despite many shots being busy as hell, they all still look beautiful. Sure, the character designs are pretty bland and I don't enjoy the equally plain and sometimes malformed art style in general but it's all animated incredibly well for the most part. Sometimes it seems as if the characters are animated in CG with 2D artwork put over them as the movements can feel almost uncanny every now and then, but rarely was it that distracting. There are some moments looked insanely choppy with blatantly low frame rates in comparison to everything else, though as per usual, this is apparently fixed in blu-rays and cinemas. Regardless, the film still looks amazing, even if the studio apparently ran out of budget for this film, and the fact that such a thing isn't noticeable at all is astounding, probably thanks to good cinematography and stellar digital effects.

RADWIMPS does several vocal tracks for the film's opening, ending, and background. None of them stick out, unfortunately, though that doesn't mean they're bad. In fact, after relistening to some of them, I find them mediocre at worst and decent at best. If there are any non-vocal background tracks, I don't remember them either. Ironic given what this film is about, which leads me to my final thoughts.

For a film about remembering, this film is awfully forgettable, especially in terms of its characters. As visually stunning as it is, I felt more annoyed than touched. This is easily the most forgettable film I've seen in quite some time, and it's not all that terrible but it's certainly not good in the slightest either from anything other than a visual perspective. Certainly not Number One anime film worthy, especially not when it's this contrived and unintentionally convoluted at time travel. I remember there was something about the director, Makoto Shinkai himself telling people to stop seeing this movie. He claimed that he didn't want people to see this as his magnum opus and for people to hold all of his films to that standard from now on, especially given the production issues that occurred towards the end. For me, I wouldn't know if this was his best film yet, but if so, then I dread his current filmography. With all that said, I bid you adieu."

“A silent voice” by Kyoto Animation, an animated Romantic drama movie, directed by Naoko Yamada is an exceptionally excellent movie that highlights one of the most significant problems in our life, bullying or rather, dealing with bullying, and this time from the side of the bully. And I wanted to tell you about it.

The story takes place in our modern days in Japan and it is divided into two core parts. The first part is about a school student — Shoya Ishida, a troubling and popular boy, and a deaf yet kind student — Shoko Nishimiya, a new student in Ishida’s class.
Ishida recklessly causes everyone to bully Nishimiya because she is deaf and he even does it himself.
img220(https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/a-silent-voice/images/e/e7/Icanthear.jpg)

As part of the bullying, he broke Nishimia's hearing aid several times, which eventually caused her mother to transfer the girl to another school.
This is when Shoya went too far. From now on he became the center of attention in his school. 
Shoya was considered guilty of the bullying in his class. And just like that, the tables have turned, and he became an undesirable student who got bullied.
img220(https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a1/a6/6c/a1a66c90e7884ebc43e8506234655df5.gif)
The second part is the main part of the movie, which happens five years after the first part. Shoya is older, lonely, and tired from his life. He tries to cope with his past, and redeem himself from his acts. He wants to hide his past actions to become a better person.

The story has a powerful message of the way people treat others, the story teaches us to regret bad things that we have done in the past, treating others respectfully, and giving second chances even if we are afraid of it. 
""We live in a world in which judgement is more important than getting to know that person""
# Art & Music
img220(https://8hours-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/06/wHBCQ86tQgUaIQ39wQ76kX7nmI7.jpg)
The art style of the film is equally amazing in an extraordinary way. I feel extremely fortunate to witness such an art. The music is outstanding down to the most minor detail. Many people say they did not like the song in English at first, but I fell in love with it and I think it adds.

# TL;DR, Worth watching?
Even if you are just a normal movie watcher or an anime fan, if you like tragedy or drama, you will enjoy this movie no matter what age you are, you will love it. I think that it is a very emotional and enjoyable movie, that we all can learn from, and I think it's a must-watch movie.

An amazing season, animation and story wise. This is where things get real good.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
This season focuses on learning the secrets of the monarchy that rules over the area within the walls.

All of the secrets hidden from us, and even the citizens inside the show are all coming loose. This season was honestly so good, my 2nd favourite to be honest.
The way they handled the story and the animation was phenomenal.

A lot of things happen this season, we don't get to see a lot of Titan fighting but thats because we know that the real enemy is other people. The Kenny squad is equipped with shotguns with what seems to be updated version of the maneuver gear built into them. This adds such a new and great dynamic into the combat scenes.

After all of the amazing fighting between the Survery Corps and Kenny Squad we are greeted with the Royal Family (The Reiss Family). They are the true kings of the world. Meaning that Krista (which we learned her real name is Historia Reiss) is the true queen of the world, that is after defeating her angered dad. I said angered because she refused to take part in the ceremony of injecting the fluid and eating the carrier of the Titan Eren has, she saved him and therefor her father sucked up the juices of the Titan on the floor and became the biggest Titan we have seen.

Near the end of the season we are greeted with Keith, the lad who was training Eren and the rest in Season 1. He knows more than he leads on to. He wanted to protect Eren that's why Eren's gear didn't work during the test in Season 1. I honestly loved all of that, all of the little plot twists which seemed like nothing important at first but then built up gradually to unveil such a massive story.

This season originally was supposed to be two cour but the second part was delayed, which yes at the time I was really impatient and wanted the second half now I am glad they took their time cause Part 2 is 10000x more intense. Get Excited!

[CHARACTERS:]()
The characters matured quite a lot during the span of the season.

Not only that their appearance changed slightly but also their lil quirks.
Of course they still are the same ol' characters we fell in love with in Season 1 but they are much more serious now.

I won't be talking much about the already existing characters such as Levi and Mikasa but instead will be focusing on the new major ones, I also already talked about the changes that happened to Keith and Krista in the previous section so I won't go over them again here. Sorry lads.

First up is Kenny. He is the one who took care of Levi when he was younger. His fighting style is similar that to Levi's (go figure). His character seems much more playful, I suppose, though he is quite serious about his job (which is to eliminate the Survey Corps). He also knows quite a few secrets from the past about the Royal Blood.

Flagel Reeves, he is the son of Dimo Reeves. After the assassination of his father due to the betrayal. Flegel has been huge help to Survery Corps, with not only getting their plans to go smoothly but also few other things.

We also get a lil sneek peek at the back story of Grisha (the father of Eren).
~~~img420(https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BlaringRawCollardlizard-sizerestricted.gif)~~~



[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The animation of the previous two seasons was great, but this season takes it up to 11.

The smooth motions between each frame and each movement in combat is so well done that I honestly rewatched each and every one of these scenes hundreds of times. My favourite scene out of this whole season has to be the one near the start, the chase between Levi and Kenny Squad.

The art style also got a new coat of paint, it looks much more realistic-ish, which is also a nice change, it adds to the combat just that much more due to the detail.

[MUSIC:]()
Shingeki no Kyojin has an amazing OST everytime, this goes without saying. 
This Season is no different, the intense music during the all scale fights were adrenaline inducing, the calm tracks which appeared in the resting areas of the show where amazing at getting that adrenaline out and make you calm before it kicked you in the gut with more fights so well done it should be a crime.

[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Season 3 Part 1 is amazing, not only the animation and OST but also the story.
All of the lies and facades are crumbling down from the old kings, the truth is being exposed to everyone.
I honestly had so many moments during this season where I had to pause and appreciate the amazing writing of this series.

Part 2 tho, oh lawd. That just takes it up to another level. Get Excited!"
21856,"I have never been a fan of shounen anime, but dear God if this isn't one of the best shows to come out in the past few years. My gripes with the genre are consistently made to seem completely unfounded every week as new episodes air. To have a shounen manga adaptation clip along at a decent pace is already an impressive feat, but to also include incredible characters, stellar animation, and great music is just a medium-shattering achievement, especially when the series came straight out of SHONEN JUMP. The last I remember having this much pure unadulterated hype and fun with shounen was with YuYu Hakusho back when it aired on Toonami, and there's something to be said for recapturing (and going above) that magic. Oh, did I mention yet that there's nearly no filler? Yeah, there's only ONE anime-original episode, and the only way you'd even pick it out was if you were an avid manga reader. 

It's been said to death by the anime community at large, but the secret to HeroAca's quality is in its perfect execution of what we already expect. You're going to get all of your standard shounen tropes here; HeroAca embraces them to the fullest degree. The difference is in HOW the show does them, and does them so, so, so right. Deku is the most compelling shounen main character I've encountered to date, with, for possibly the first time in shounen history, a believable reason to actually be considered an underdog. You can't help but empthaize with him in his struggles and be hype as all hell for his achievements, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast as well. So much obvious loving time and care was put into making our core cast feel like actual fucking characters instead of power-husk show-offs. Personality-rich, driven, and (most importantly) believable characters are the name of the game here, and I can't help but enjoy pretty much every character that gets any ounce of screentime.

None of this is to say that HeroAca, and by extension this second season, is perfect by any metric. There are some misgivings with the plot and some of the general anime ""bleh"" that plagues all releases to come out within the past several years (high school setting, etc...). World-building is also a little suspect, and there's a clear requirement of being able to both suspend disbelief and to not question the lack of exposition regarding the character's environment. This issue is especially notable when the show likes to play with the idea of the ""ideal"" of being a ""real hero"", with some heavy handed messages about how widespread power has warped public perception about what being a hero really is and what sort of behavior they should exhibit. Although an interesting and compelling discussion for HeroAca, it's heavily damaged by this lack of meaningful exposition, and can come across as misplaced and even boring if you haven't properly ""bought-in"" to the series. 

Still, if we're talking in-genre here, and if you've been with me for this song-and-dance before you know we always are, you'll be hard pressed to find anything better than this. If you have ever been a fan of shounen anime, or you are just looking for an new pick-up with a fair bit of content on the bone, I implore you to check this one out. Whether you end up watching it or just dive straight into the manga, you definitely won't be disappointed."
101759,"With The Promised Neverland wrapping up its first season this week, the only thing I can say about this series is ""WOW!"" Suspenseful, gripping, at times heartwrenching, and with enough cliffhangers to make you feel like you're a mountain climber. 

The art is phenomenal and the sound design is great. More importantly, the direction was on point from beginning to end. All of this culminated in a great viewing experience that kept me on the edge of my seat through all 12 weeks of the season. The chess-like mind games and one-up-manship from both sides made it interesting to watch and made you want to know see what the other sides plan was every time something happened. 

The characters from nearly top to bottom are fleshed out and have their own individual quirks. The three main characters, Emma, Ray, and Norman all brings something different and unique to the table and really feed off of each other when it comes to conversations and planning. This trio makes for an interesting dynamic, especially during times where trust is at an all-time low among everyone. Even when each character holds their own personal beliefs you never once feel like a person's feelings are unwarranted. Each character brings up strong points as to why they are right and that is a good indication as to why this series is so good. I'm no manga reader and for me, I think I might just stick to being an anime only for now. The twists and turns give me life when I have to wait to see what happens next. 

With a series like this there are so many ways that things can go wrong quickly. One slip up, one continuity error and a lot of that suspense can go down the drain. That is just a testament as to why this show is so good. A plan is always in motion whether the view can see is happening or not and that is what gives this show its charm. The writing always has to be on point or else things fall apart.

The last episode gave a me a very satisfied feeling that also left me wanting to know what comes next for our band of mischief kids and it makes me excited to see what comes after. The last episode gave some insightful character development to a character that I won't name to avoid spoilers but it was very much needed and changed my view on that character entirely. This last episode just felt like I had been sitting holding my breath for the past 12 weeks and only now I can breath easily. It's not very often that I feel that way about a show and it leaves me happy.

With all of that said, I look forward to next season and what the future holds for our group of precocious kids."
110277,"Attack on Titan is a modern masterpiece. It’s not just a piece of fiction which has thrown quality season after season, it’s also one of the very few anime to have broken into the mainstream, so much so that people who do not watch anime at all have experienced and loved it. The emergence of the first season of Attack on Titan drove the series’ popularity to levels rarely seen before in the medium. The long wait before the release of season 2 was a major reason (along with certain pacing issues with the manga at the time) for the dying interest in the series at the time. By the time S2 aired, Attack on Titan wasn’t the global phenomenon anymore. One Punch Man had broken the mold in a similar vein to AoT S1 and become the new big anime amongst casuals and non anime watchers.

Then came Season 3, and the series was roaring back. The interest in the series had never been higher, and fans flocked back in droves to have their questions answered. Many began viewing the first two seasons in new light once the revelations showcased the intricate planning and immense foreshadowing that had gone under their noses when they’d watched it first. For me, Attack on Titan was always great. Never has an anime made me feel so hopeless if I viewed the world from the perspective of the characters. The absolute mystery surrounding the titans for most of the first season along with stunning animation for fights, memorable OST for almost any scene and emotional dialogue delivered by passionate voice actors made for an unforgettable experience. Season 2 and 3 bring in more revelations, slowly unfolding the mysteries of the world and the titans and shifting the themes of the series. Season 4 has another tonal shift - much greater than previous ones - and it handles it with aplomb.

img(https://i.imgur.com/m8W6j5p.jpg)

A change in studios has often led anime series to ruin. The aforementioned OPM was one of the recent big victims of it, but other popular series like Seven Deadly Sins have also suffered due to it and never recovered.

Fortunately, MAPPA have handled the transition well. They haven’t been perfect (more on that later), but all in all, they’ve done a good job producing a new season of what is probably the most popular anime of the last decade.

The start of S4 might have left some people wondering where the original cast went. There’s not just a change of cast in the first few episodes, but also a switch in perspectives. We’re no longer seeing things from the side of Paradis and the Scouts. Instead, we now see it from the view of Marley’s warriors, who’re training to inherit the titans from their predecessors once their time runs out. Gabi and Falco want to inherit the armor but Reiner, i.e. the plot armored titan (Sorry, had to use this once I saw it on Reddit) can’t catch a break. Someone, grant him his wish to die.

Eren’s growth as a character is one of the highlights of Attack on Titan as a series. He wasn’t always a fan favorite because of his hotheaded nature, but as time went on, his perspective of the things around him changed, most noticeably multiple times throughout season 3. Come season 4, his character undergoes a paradigm shift; calm and sympathetic, yet ruthless. As his famous quote goes, “I won’t stop moving forward until all my enemies are destroyed.” He’s a lot more distant, not just to everyone else in the show but also to the viewers. Unlike previous seasons, his thoughts are a mystery and the season clearly displays the divide between him and the other old Scouts. 

img(https://i.imgur.com/bs8JkDy.png)

The handling of his growth as a person and a titan shifter is outstanding, firstly in the manga and then in the anime. Yuki Kaji, the voice actor, supported this exponential growth by exceeding expectations on character delivery. I especially love how well he’s transitioned seamlessly along with Eren as a character and nailed almost every line. There’s hardly a line Eren has spoken in season 4 that isn’t extremely significant to the story.

Oh Gabi! Where do I even begin? She’s supposed to be the female parallel to pre timeskip Eren, but apart from some core traits like being stubborn, she isn’t really that similar to him. Gabi hates the Eldians from Paradis for no other reason other than that she thinks they’re devils and should suffer for the crimes of their ancestors. Eren was stubborn, headed into almost unwinnable battles without a second thought. However, his reasons to hate the titans were justified. His mother was eaten in front of him by a titan, his home destroyed and tens upon hundreds of his comrades butchered by titans in cold blood. He fought for his freedom, and humanity’s. 

Gabi, on the other hand, hates Eldians without having seen any of them. She kills people for glory, just for some useless praise. And without spoiling anything, I’ll also add that she’s a hypocrite with her iconic line that’s become prevalent in memes now “But did you see it happen?”.

img(https://i.imgur.com/bvX0Cn2.png)

In her defence, she’s a twelve-year-old girl who’s been brainwashed so it’s hard to not give her some benefit of the doubt. But boy, is she annoying! She’s actually portrayed a lot better at the start of the Marley arc in the anime than in the manga, so I didn’t dislike her as much. She’s neither a bad character nor a great one, but she serves her purpose.

Onto Falco, then. My cute, lovable boy, are you sure you had the same upbringing as Gabi? He’s her polar opposite, able to empathize with his enemies and an antithesis for every one of Gabi’s morals. He views things from a wider angle, often showing maturity way beyond his years. He might not be as naturally gifted as Gabi but he’s a whole lot more likeable. From posting letters for injured people to helping his enemies who shun him instead, this good boy has it all covered. He’s one of the beautiful things in this cruel world.

Pieck is the new waifu that every fan seems to be simping over; Reiner and Zeke share the title of best character amongst the Marleyans for me. Their internal struggles and motives, some of which are only seen by viewers, make a significant contrast to their outer persona, and this holds especially true for Zeke. 

Jean remains the character who makes the viewers question their morals because he questions his own and that’s what I love about him. He’s another one who’s come a long way since the cadet days.

Did you think I’d have forgotten Floch? He might’ve been a forgettable side character who didn’t even have a distinct design before S3 P2 (Isayama has himself admitted as much), but he’s one of the stars of season 4, running the show like the chad that he is. He’s an extremist and his actions are brutal; at times, it seems as if he’s doing it to sate his own ego and hate towards those who’ve imprisoned him and his race behind the walls. But despite all this, he’s one of the most entertaining characters post time skip. He’s unpredictable, spunky and has the audacity to pull off stunts that might’ve had your jaws slacking on the floor more times than one. And who can forget the “shh?” King Floch has unquestionably engraved his name as an Attack on Titan legend. 

img(https://i.imgur.com/qg3DHVc.png)

There are so many excellent characters in Attack on Titan that the review would be too long if I talked about all of them, so I’ll stop here. 

The character designs in Season 4 see a distinct change, and that’s not all to do with the timeskip or the change in the studio. It’s a mixture of both. To anyone who’s read the earlier chapters of the Attack on Titan manga, it’s no secret that the art at the start was mediocre. Wit Studio did a great job of enhancing the character designs and the art in general, especially in S1.

MAPPA on the other hand have stuck closer to the manga art style for characters (apart from beautifying Armin as compared to the manga, their reasons for which I’d like to know). So there’s a slight change in the art style because they’re following Isayama’s art a lot more closely.



The animation of S4 has been the most talked about point, and for good reason. I’ll mince no words: some of the CGI was downright terrible. There was some genuinely impressive CGI like the Jaw titan, but some very important scenes involving the Attack Titan and Beast Titan were horrendous. It’s not the animators who’re to blame for this but the greed of the production committee and the manga publishers who wanted to have S4 airing before the end of the manga to boost sales.

>An ODM animation from Season 3:

For almost any other anime, I would’ve let even the terrible CGI scenes slide, but this is Attack on Titan, one of the most popular and highly acclaimed anime ever, and surely it deserved the best treatment possible. Unfortunately, it didn’t get that. Does it make the season bad? Of course not since the season covers one of the best arcs in the manga and the adaptation itself was faithful with top tier voice acting. Could better animation elevate S4 of Attack on Titan to higher levels? Greatly.

My biggest problem with the titan CGI was that it just broke immersion. One moment we had fluid 2D animation, the other we had some janky CGI lacking weight, which made me pause and check if I was still watching Attack on Titan. I’ve re-watched these scenes multiple times and every time, I came to the same conclusion: Attack on Titan deserves better. Remember the marvelous scenes with ODM gear we got in the first three seasons or the titan fights or Levi vs the Beast Titan? Unfortunately, we don’t get that level of animation in season 4, and while understandable given the time constraints, it’s disappointing nevertheless.

The CGI wasn’t always as bad, but had enough prevalence in the most important moments (Eg: Attack Titan vs Warhammer Titan) to be a stain on an otherwise stellar season.
 
 
We have some new and honestly breathtaking tracks added to the already great OST from S1 - S3. One of the highlights in the sound composition this season is that there were different composers depending on whose perspective a scene is shown from. For Paradis, we have Hiroyuki Sawano back with all our favorites from previous seasons while Kohta Yamomoto handled the Marleyan side, giving us bangers including Ashes on the Fire. I missed the old OST in the first few episodes because I was worried they’d underuse S1-S3 OST, but they did not. It wasn’t used much because the initial episodes take place from the perspective of the Marleyans. Honestly, having different composers for either side of the conflict seems like a superb choice and helps immersion. 

The only real criticism I have about the sound was the OST choice in some scenes in the latter part of the season. And no, I’m not talking about the basement scene here. I thought the basement scene OST choice was great.

Similar to the OST, it took a while for me to warm up to the OP, but looking back now, it’s great and suits the themes of S4. This was a common opinion amongst the community; the majority seemed to have disliked My War for the first couple episodes, then it just grew on people and now it sets the tone for the rest of the episode.

Now that Attack on Titan’s final season (Part 1) has ended, it’ll be intriguing to see what route MAPPA takes for the rest of the adaptation. There’s anywhere between 13-16 episodes of content left to cover, depending on the pacing. Will the production committee see Attack on Titan as a chance to make hundreds of millions of dollars in a movie format or will we have Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 (lol), only time will tell. I’m not against either, as long as they take enough time and pour passion into making it. I don’t mind waiting longer if it means getting the best production values. Hopefully, that’s the case."
20755,"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, AKA Assassination Classroom, has the sort of fun and silly premise that anime tends to become known for. It features on a classroom full of academically backwards students who are trying to kill their teacher--who is also a yellow smiley face with the body of a tentacle monster--before he destroys the earth at the end of the year. He can do it, too. He's already proved that by blowing a hole in the moon.

Assassination Classroom certainly has some fun moments, mostly related to Koro-sensei's personality and how his body functions. But these moments tend to get repetitive fairly quickly, and the flaws of the series threaten to outweigh them. The rest of the cast is fairly lackluster. This is likely a side effect of its Too-Many-Characters Syndrome. There is an entire classroom worth of students, all of them introduced in the OP, but only one or two are memorable. I can think of four off the top of my head: Nagisa, Karma, Ritsu, and that one dude who has something close to a character arc but not a good enough one that I can actually remember his name. The rest are just a blur of faces and names that have pretty much no real relevance.

What's more, the story doesn't often go anywhere. It is, as most shounen, deliberately drawn out so that the franchise can be milked for all it's worth. The result is that the plot largely becomes filler. Over the course of twenty-two episodes, we spend a bit of time learning how Koro-sensei functions and what his strengths and weaknesses are. The rest of the show is filled with Koro-sensei doing teacher things and the class combating other villains. These diversions would almost be welcome were they not a distraction from the real story. Sure, it's good that we're getting character development for these professors and students, but there are more pressing concerns. Namely, ""why would such a cheerful creature threaten to destroy the Earth?"" and ""why does this creature want to teach a high school class?"" I can ignore that the moon getting a big hole blown through it doesn't mess with gravity or tides. I can ignore that Koro-sensei can fly at mach 20 and is basically a giant emoji. But I can't ignore that the entire premise of the series is built on unanswered questions. The longer it continues, the more it seems like it's simply an excuse to create this specific situation. But instead of addressing these questions, we get a vague comment about Koro-sensei being a man-made biological weapon, then shrug off any other answers in favor of adding new villains so that we don't have to kill of Koro-sensei until sales start declining.

Assassination Classroom is a funny joke that drags on for about 15 episodes too long. Sure, the concept is fun, but a concept can't carry a show. There are too many characters for them to get fleshed out and the plot refuses to progress. What we're left with is a series with glaring questions that only become more frustrating the longer they go unanswered. And the worst part is that the show gives no indication that they're considering addressing them anywhere in the near future. Three stars."
21507,"A wonderful show about a boy with no confidence in himself, and no idea how he should live his life. Completely listless, he simply does what other people around him want him to do in the hopes that he’ll find acceptance. Afraid of his powers, he’s been forced to live repressed, unable to talk about who he really is. Needless to say, plenty of people can see themselves in Mob, myself included. This show really hones in on just about every anxiety one had back at that age. Trying to live up to others expectations while also figuring out who you are.

The central idea of the show is that when Mob gets stressed out and pushed past his limit, he expresses himself the only way he really knows how: with rage. Its again, something I can relate to. When you spend most of your time hiding your emotions, rage is the only thing strong enough that can build and build up until you simply can’t control it anymore. Often hurting those around you, even when they’re people you love. After which comes immediate shame and the desire to simply be another person. 

Mob has two main guides in life. The first is his “master”, Reigen. A con man that has convinced Mob that he’s a psychic like him and can help him control his powers. Despite being a con man, his cons are somewhat innocuous as he truly wants to help people, Mob in particular. While his words may be empty, to others, they carry the weight they need. He gives genuinely good advice and wants the absolute best for Mob.

The other guide is the Body Improvement Club. A club that Mob joined more or less on a whim in an attempt to make himself more attractive. Despite the superficial reasons, and his frail body, the club welcomes him with open arms and are constantly supportive of him, never once judging him or making fun of him. It seems very intentional to me that Reigen and the Body Improvement Club are not psychics like Mob at all, yet they’re his biggest supporters. The show repeatedly stresses that even though Mob is unfathomably strong, he’s not any better than anyone else. He is, ultimately, an average joe. Why shouldn’t he get support from people that don’t share his narrow specialty? 

To me, it seemed to be saying that even though we all have different stuff we’re good at, we’re all ultimately in the same boat. Just trying to live, and no one can make it alone. We all need help from others. Even Mob, as strong as he is, needs support, even from “normal” people. 

Mob and his brother present such a great dynamic. Both are jealous of what the other doesn't have and think things would simply be better if they could adopt these traits. Mob doesn't care that Ritsu can't use psychic powers. However, these feelings of essentially unconditional love were warped into feelings of inadequacy. Mob doesn't value psychic powers because its mundane to him. But to Ritsu, it's everything. This sort of thing is a repeated occurrence throughout the show. Mob is always kind to everyone, to fault even. However even when one has the most genuinely kind intentions, it sometimes can just backfire. It's what makes socializing and interacting with people so difficult.

The show's answer to this is rather simple, and delivered via the Body Improvement Club. To fight on, to keep trying. No matter how much you fail, get back up and go at it again. It's rough, no one will say it isn't. but it's all we normal humans can do."
100166,"# ~~~The Decline of My Hero Academy Part 2: Season 3~~~
~~~youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIph1LLCQiE)~~~
~~~[Season 2](https://anilist.co/review/13277 ) ~~~
~~~(SPOILER WARNING FOR HUNTER X HUNTER, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, AND NARUTO + SHIPPUDEN)~~~

Season 3 is bad. It is the point where you finally realize that all the potential the earlier seasons flashed was no more than just that: unrealized potential. And all the problems with the writing weren’t blips, they become a constant problem that deflates the tension and drama in every arc.

Every time Deku we’re told Deku is risking his body only for him to be fine after a day in the hospital, every time a villain is hyped up only for them to lose while barely accomplishing anything, every time stakes are established and then retreated from immediately. It all starts to add up.

# ~~~Decline of Visuals 1~~~

Now, one thing that’s important to note is that the decline of the MHA anime is not entirely due to Horikoshi’s writing. A fair amount of blame should be attributed to Studio Bones, as well. I complimented the show based on how there was a lot more effort than I remember in season 1, and the reason I was surprised by that is because of how low the quality of visuals is in seasons 3 and 4.

MHA’s visuals in general have never been that sharp (especially in terms of backgrounds), but season 1 did a good job of covering for that by being loose and creative with the visuals.

That is no longer the case. The visuals are flat and the tone is overly stiff. Which uh, is a lot less fun to watch. And if you’re not enjoying what you’re watching, you tend to be less engaged. And when you’re not engaged by what’s in the foreground, you start to zone out and look at the backgrounds out of boredom.

img(https://i.imgur.com/RxsxW21.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/P6C5mQw.png)

At which point, you start to notice how cheap-looking and shoddily thrown together the backgrounds in this show look. You’ll notice the same tree copy and pasted over and over again, stale coloring, buildings with no style or personality put into how they’re drawn, and sometimes you can’t even tell what you’re even looking at:

img(https://i.imgur.com/tCl2Jdl.png)

This is supposed to be an establishing shot of the city. What the hell is this? Looks like a bunch of digital garbage.

img(https://i.imgur.com/9SEjjIV.png)

What the hell are those things in the background even supposed to be?

# ~~~Forest Training Camp Arc~~~

The first two arcs of season 3 are the forest training camp arc and class raid arcs, and they are both very bad. So bad that season 3 (and really, the whole series) never recovers from it. What you realize while watching these arcs that all the bad aspects of Horikoshi’s writing thus far aren’t going to go away: the problem has actually gotten much worse and is deflating any potential drama and tension for new arcs.

The Forest Training Camp arc isn’t as bad as the Class Raid arc, but…it’s still bad and starts season 3 off on a very bad note. Most of why I dislike this arc is the emergence of Horikoshi’s writing becoming…lazy. The problems that pop up in the Class Raid arc are recurring issues that have spun out of control, but The Forest Training Camp arc started to make me question if he even had a plan for where the story is going.

Here’s a brief summary:

Students go on a class trip to train. Deku meets Kota, a kid who lost his parents and hates heroes as a result. Villains attack, Pixie Bob is injured, Deku fights muscle guy and beats him, Bakugo gets kidnapped, arc end.

There’s a lot of dumb shit all over the place here, but let’s start with the villain’s reason for the raid:

img(https://i.imgur.com/z4uppDK.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/FqrZMCA.png)

What the fuck does that mean? Something I’ve noticed while re-watching is with the villains, you kind of have to ignore what they say at times to make the writing coherent. Like with Stain when he says that money and fame worshippers are ruining hero society, despite there being sort of 1 example of each that fit that description even existing. What he does in the alley though, points to a more coherent ideology.

img(https://i.imgur.com/n1WvlG4.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/XuaVuRT.png)

Iida ignored an injured hero because he was too busy trying to get revenge on Stain for his brother. That selfishness and inability to control his emotions is bad and holds Iida back. You gave me an example of something Stain opposes directly and showed me rather than told me, excellent.

Then you have this shit. I don’t know what the fuck “make them see that their peace is resting in our hands"" means. That’s confusing, vague nonsense. Later on, they explain that they want to kidnap Bakugo and try to show him that there are options other than being a hero. So why not just say that to begin with? You want to kidnap students to convert them to your cause. It conveys your motivations better than whatever the hell “make them see that their peace is resting in our hands” is.

Anyways. Most of the villain attack is standard MHA stuff. Villains attack, have mixed results, students counterattack. Blah blah blah.  The real garbage starts here, with Pixie Bob getting hurt:

img(https://i.imgur.com/BKOKx4h.png)

This is lazy, last minute garbage. Last-minute characterization is something I really don’t care much for, but this is pathetic. This is literally just Horikoshi saying “Hey I know you barely got to know this character, but you should feel something because I’m abruptly telling you she’s getting married”. There’s no emotional anything here. I don’t know how important marriage is to her, I don’t know who she’s getting married to, I don’t know anything about this woman! If this plot line had been developed ahead of time (aka Horikoshi had scenes where we saw her doting over her fiancé, or just scenes of the 2 together in general), then there would be grounds to put this line here. Because then, the show would have actually earned it. But you can’t do it like this. This is lazy. We’ll get back to this problem in part 4, as it (like the other parts of Horikoshi’s writing) snowballs out of control.

And then we get to the big fight from this arc, Deku vs muscle guy. I don’t care what his name is. His design is bad, he’s badly written, his only notable feature is how muscley he is. He’s muscley guy.

img(https://i.imgur.com/rhEOqV8.png)
~~~muscle guy~~~

Before getting to the fight, we need to talk about Kota.

img(https://i.imgur.com/aYgpQLy.png)

Kota is this little dipshit. His parents are heroes that were killed in the line of duty, and he now he hates heroes. Which is whatever. Generic backstory, depends on what you do with it. Its fine by itself. But what I dislike about this is Deku’s reasons for wanting to help him. The show treats Kota as though his opinion about heroes is…wrong. Something that needs to be corrected. This is an annoying part of the way MHA is written, and is yet another problem that spirals out of control in seasons 3 and 4. On its own it isn’t a big deal. But when you take into consideration the fact that Horikoshi very clearly wants to write villains who represent problems with society, but at the same time is unwilling to write flawed superheroes or hold accountable UA or his society’s heroes, and also seems to treat all criticism of the heroes as wrong…like which is it? You can’t have both, they clash with each other.

So obviously, this muscley guy is not a very good villain. Kota’s backstory with his parents was already pretty token, but did you really have to make muscley guy the same guy that killed his parents? That’s like the lamest twist ever. Then you have the fight itself. Which is…whatever. There’s some neat animation here I guess, but overall I don’t really care. The villain is bad, the drama is bad, and there aren’t really any stakes with Deku injuring his body because I know after the arc is over, he’ll sit in a hospital bed for a bit and then be fine. Speaking of...

Before we get to the episodes after the forest training camp arc, I'd like to highlight one thing Deku says during this fight:

img(https://i.imgur.com/24y9z90.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/w12l2KR.png)

Remember this quote. I'll refer back to it a lot going forward.

# ~~~Fake Stakes 1~~~

The episodes between the end of the Forest training camp arc and the class raid are important, in that they highlight the one problem with MHA that it has proven unable to escape from:

Horikoshi is deathly afraid of taking risks. His writing is among the stalest and safest in a popular shounen I’ve ever seen. He’s overly attached to his characters, he never provides long-lasting consequences for the actions of his characters, and he seems terrified of moving a single piece out of place.

There are 2 categories of this I’d like to highlight here:

UA

The first problem area when it comes to fakes stakes is this ongoing storyline with the media's criticism of UA and their failures to protect their students. Or rather, it’s just Horikoshi pretending there will be consequences for the students getting into trouble for both UA and the students, but then immediately retreating from it because actual consequences would be hard to write. Anyways, we're gonna establish the details of this subplot that are important, and I'll explain why this part of the story is a problem in a bit.

In season 1, the media manages to sneak onto school grounds after Shigaraki blows up the wall. This one isn't as notable as the others, but I just wanted to point it out because in this instance, UA couldn't even keep reporters off their school grounds. Maybe a wall and sensor isn't a great security system in a world where nearly everyone has superpowers, yeah? You think maybe someone might try to just jump over the wall or blow it up?

img(https://i.imgur.com/CNFLmNd.png)

Anyways, then you have the villains that attack students at the end of season 1. Also does not reflect well on the school, and they receive criticism for it. This looks even worse when you consider the people that got in were proven to be morons. That's basically the subplot. The media goes after UA for letting the students fall into danger, and that's uh. That's it. As for the students:

In episode 31, the police guy tells Deku and friends that they and the other heroes are going to receive strict punishment...and then they don't do that at all. Not a huge deal they don't follow through here. But next time they get into trouble, there needs to be actual punishment for the students or UA. This could just be to establish stakes for the future. All you gotta do is follow through next time.
There you go, that's how all that...stuff is setup. The important part of this plotline is that somewhere along the line, the show has to be able to establish real consequences for UA for not protecting its students, and for the students of class A for getting into trouble. And...we'll get to that in a minute.

Deku Destroying His Body

Another recurring problem is Deku's body. The threat of Deku damaging his body so badly he can't be a hero anymore is established pretty early. It’s a good way of keeping One for All from feeling overpowered, and a constant source of drama during Deku's fights. At least, it would be. If Horikoshi was willing to actually commit to it.

img(https://i.imgur.com/GcsxjwJ.png)

Knowing that Deku could permanently damage his body so badly he could never walk again is an interesting subplot, but it can't be if every time he risks his body, he stays in the hospital for a day and then he's fine again. This is, again, something that isn't a struggle for other popular battle shounens:

We're back to Naruto and Hunter x Hunter again.

In Naruto, when Rock Lee uses his Hidden Lotus ability, it has very similar risks to Deku's ability, with Lee's being a bit more extreme the further he goes with it.

Anyways, when we see Deku and Rock Lee overuse their ability to try to win, we do see them exhausted, crippled, etc. But it’s what the writers do after the fight ends that separate the two.

Rock Lee's body is torn up really badly after his fight with Gaara, and they tell Guy that it's likely he'll never fight again. But then, they follow through on that. He is absent from combat for the next 76 episodes, but it is a source of ongoing drama as we see his recovery process and struggle to come to terms with the possibly giving up his entire way of life. And then, several arcs later, when he pops out to fight Kimimaro, you get a huge adrenaline rush. This happens for 3 reasons: one, Rock Lee was gone for so long. Two, the last time we saw him he was in the most entertaining fight of the show thus far. And most importantly three, we saw his recovery process and knew how hard it was for him. So when he jumps out here, we know that his recovery is complete, he's back as a ninja, and we finally get to see him fight again. Great moment, and a great example of establishing stakes for a fight and actually sticking with them.

img(https://i.imgur.com/pZfae7j.png)

In Hunter x Hunter, Gon loses control of his emotions after he finds out Kite is dead. His anger leads him to use ""everything"" to kill Pitou. But since Gon is nowhere near strong enough to even fight Pitou, he has to sacrifice...well, everything. Based on what we know about nen and the way it works, seeing him suddenly obtain this much power means the amount he sacrificed is so great he will probably die.

Okay, so our main character has taken on a colossal risk and the stakes are his sacrifice took a massive toll on his body, and he could die. How do we follow up on this?

img(https://i.imgur.com/wFJZl89.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/cfHdWqQ.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/wpNaP04.png)

This is what it looks like to create stakes and stick with them. Gon nearly dies, and Killua has to go through tons of hoops to save him. And while yes, Gon does recover. He is completely absent from the manga for the following arcs. No, really. The protagonist is out of the story for several major story arcs. He can't use nen because of what he did to beat Pitou. Kurapika is the main character during the prince succession arc, which is the current arc. Togashi was willing to take that risk to make it clear that when he declares stakes, no matter how great, he will follow through. As a result, when they say something like ""we could die”, I believe it regardless of who its referring to.

And yet with Deku, we are told time and time again that he is risking his body by being reckless, and every single time he goes to the hospital, the nurse heals him, and he's fine again. There are no stakes here. Deku has the strongest plot armor on I've ever seen.

img(https://i.imgur.com/crZ044G.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/c7Mz7qj.png)

This isn't even that hard to fix either. Here's how you do it:

Have the nurse heal him a couple times, then have the villains kill her; cutting Deku off from having an insta-heal every time he's reckless with his body. He will then be forced to actually deal with the damage he's doing to his body, and for the first time in the series actually following through with the stakes it established. It would also ground Deku, preventing him from just doing whatever he wants with no consequences.

But killing the nurse lady would be a risky choice to make, and we can't have that!

Or alternatively, stop reminding us of this plot point if you refuse to do anything with it. If you're gonna keep saying he's risking his body, then show the stakes! Have him damage his body so badly that he's absent for an arc. Naruto did it with Rock Lee. And Hunter x Hunter is doing it with Gon right now. The other guys don't seem to have a problem with it, and if MHA is as great as people say it is, it shouldn't either.

# ~~~Class Raid Arc~~~

Now. The reason I brought up all of that now is because the episodes between the Forest Training Camp arc and the Class Raid arc are so fucking stupid, and it's because of the issues with the writing I just talked about. Deku suffers colossal damage to his body. He is up and walking immediately after. The heroes say that they're going to keep a closer eye on the students, and LITERALLY THE FUCKING NIGHT AFTER THEY SAY THIS, THEY LET THE STUDENTS SNEAK OUT. You even have the stupid fucking press conference the teachers put on, acknowledging all the criticism UA has rightfully gotten for putting its students in danger.

AND AS THEY ARE SAYING THIS, NO ONE IS WATCHING THE INJURED STUDENTS AT ALL, SO THEY ALL SNEAK OUT.

img(https://i.imgur.com/24y9z90.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/w12l2KR.png)

Remember this? Do you remember this fucking line? This is My Hero Academy summarized in a single fucking line. Say you're gonna do one thing, and never follow through. It constantly contradicts the message of its own main theme because of its incompetent and lazy writing.

""Yes, we're taking the criticism seriously and are making changes"" as they are letting the students sneak out because no one bothered to keep an eye on them. Deku is threatened with losing his arms, and yet THE LITERAL DAY AFTER THE ATTACK, he sneaks out with the other students to go get Bakugo back! Ridiculous.

And Iida understandably objects to this stupid ass plan, but since Horikoshi refuses to take a risk like slowing down for a bit to enforce the stakes he just established, Iida backs down and goes with them. 

This was the point where I could no longer deny the truth: My Hero Academy is a big piece of shit. Horikoshi is unable to establish any drama or stakes or tension due to his overly safe and lazy writing, and Studio Bones' effort in its production has gone down significantly.

It had another chance, though. It had one last chance to fix its villain problem. This could have done a lot to ease my growing irritation with the series. But again, it blew it.

# ~~~All for One, and Why the Villains Need to Kill~~~

So, a growing issue I have had with MHA is the villains. Like yes, they're bad. If we're keeping track of only the ones we've seen so far, Shigaraki is an idiot (allegedly on purpose) and Stain doesn't accomplish much on-screen. That's in terms of writing though. Another big problem I have is that they never kill anyone.

You see, when you have a problem with weak villains like MHA does, a great way to establish a new villain as a threat would be to show them killing a hero we know on screen. Not in the past, not telling us they kill people; actually showing them kill someone. This ties into my problem of Horikoshi being overly attached to his characters and not wanting to make sacrifices or take risks with them. Because there are tons of expendable ones.

Anyways, the reason I bring this up now is because the class raid arc is where we are introduced to All for One, the Ying to All Might's Yang and supposedly the strongest villain there is. He has dozens of quirks stored away. He can use multiple quirks at once. This guy is a FORCE. So naturally, I'm expecting him to have a big impact in his first appearance. After all, All for One is THE GUY. Finally, a competent villain! This is gonna be great!

img(https://i.imgur.com/hKNG2S3.png)
~~~...Oh.~~~

img(https://i.imgur.com/W9i3pZg.png)
~~~Oh…~~~

All for One is disappointing for a number of reasons, but really All for One being disappointing is a backbreaker itself. He NEEDED to succeed, and needed to make an impression on the audience.

The villains up to this point have been a joke. They also kinda just…always lose. Not every villain can just inflict ""psychological"" damage to the heroes or whatever. It’s the battle shounen equivalent of a moral victory. That's what Shiggy did in season 1. His raid was a laughable failure that got him ridiculed by the students and All Might. Stain loses without killing anyone in season 2. Dude's name is literally ""Stain the Hero Killer"" yet we see him kill no one and then he gets arrested. Eventually, a villain needs to actually win. Succeed at their goal, outsmart the heroes, kill someone. Just something, so I can believe for once that there’s some competency to these dumbass villains.

The most dangerous villain in the show has to establish themselves as a threat somehow when they show up. They can't just not kill anyone and get owned. Why? Because it makes them look incompetent, and that has a trickle-down effect on the other villains. You REALLY aren't going to take the other villains seriously. After all, if the biggest, baddest villain isn't allowed to win; if the heroes all have plot armor that can't be penetrated even now, ...what threat are the lesser villains? I see them as a joke now as a result of All for One's first appearance. His goal here is to kill All Might here. He does make All Might retire, but whatever. He still loses and gets captured. This is another moral victory.

The best way to shock your audience and establish this guy would be to have him cut down a hero. It would be great! Hasn't happened before, so it would shock everyone. Horikoshi even has 3 excellent opportunities to do it.

img(https://i.imgur.com/BjGhP6B.png)

Obviously the preferred choice would be All Might. Him dying in a fight with All for One is a better way of inflicting fear admist uncertainty among the citizens for future arcs than him just retiring. And it would display vividly the ultimate act of what All Might says is the most important qualification for a hero:

The spirit of self-sacrifice.

It doesn't have to be him, though. Best Jeanist is incredibly expendable. Gran Torino is old and senile. They're so expendable and yet Horikoshi just...can't...let go of them.

You kill Best Jeanist here, and the following fight with All Might suddenly becomes incredible tense. Why? Because when you kill a hero like that, it firmly establishes the stakes as life and death. Something that was kinda not established during the season 1 raid, Stain arc from season 2, and the forest training camp arc. And, it would completely shock the audience, thus raising their investment. And that shit is important for a series like MHA.

An important principle of being a hero in this series (and for…most battle shounens) is that they are fighting for their lives. As such, it’s important to establish that the stakes of fights are well, life and death. This is something I think My Hero Academy is trying to do. 

But without examples of heroes we know LOSING their lives fighting or just generally, it's hard to really say the stakes are that high. We’re told that people could die, but we’re never shown it. Because all the heroes have plot armor. They aren't allowed to die because they're heroes. Why? Horikoshi is unwilling to take risks. And no, heroes that died before the show starts don't count. Heroes we know and that have been established, that we've seen in the series, dying. That's what it is needed here.
This is, again, something writers of other popular battle shounens understand. Let’s knock these down quick, I don’t need a paragraph to explain each:

Hunter x Hunter:

img(https://i.imgur.com/BMyQSJD.png)
Everyone Hisoka kills during the Hunter exams: establishes Hisoka as a serious threat and that the Hunter exam is very much life or death, which is very much true.

Orochimaru kills Hirouzen: makes it clear how dangerous he is, and more importantly makes the audience worry about what's going to happen when Sasuke decides to chase after him. ""Oh, shit. that guy killed the hokage. And Sasuke's going to go with him?""

Stuff like this sends a message, and its usually pretty good at scaring the audience if they’re invested. When a villain kills someone, it says “this could happen to one of the protagonists if they aren’t careful”.

img(https://i.imgur.com/EG2JvWX.png)

Killing a character is an amazing way to establish danger, something that MHA sorely lacks at this point due to how shit the villains are and how safe the writing is. This is especially true here, because it ruins what could be a genuinely great fight. On paper, the way it's set up works. But to once again have no one die and the villain lose despite setting the stakes higher than ever; that just can't happen here.

# ~~~In Between Arcs 1/Fake Stakes 2~~~

Now hold on just a minute. Because everything I complained about in the Fake Stakes sections immediately comes back again after the All for One vs All Might fight.

During the first half of episode 50, All Might yells at Deku for destroying his body and sneaking out even though All Might and the other dumbass teachers weren't watching the students, and thus let it happen. Also, Deku is fine after all that. Walking around with some bandages. In the second half of episode 50, Deku's mom takes a stand against All Might and UA for continuously allowing them to endanger her son, and threatens to pull Deku out of UA. This, of course, does not happen. All Might begs and she gives up. (flashback to Iida giving up trying to stop the students from sneaking out?). The show declares stakes in the form of consequences for a student and UA, and this is again retreated from in the same scene.

img(https://i.imgur.com/hFZwoXj.png)

Despite episode 50 focusing on the fallout from the class raid for UA and the students, including showing several parents of class A students angry with the school, not one of those parents pulls their kid out. So, no consequences of any kind for anyone. The most we get is that UA has a dorm system now. Ugh.

Later in this same episode, Eraser says that he would've expelled almost all of them if not for All Might's retirement. The fuck does All Might's retirement have to do with anything? Just expel them. All Might's retirement is just a lazy excuse to not follow through with stakes you yourself established. Stop being lazy and taking shortcuts with the writing. You keep saying you're going to do one thing, and then you don't because you're scared of the risk. As I recall, that seems to contradict what you said earlier:

# ~~~Provisional Hero License Exam~~~

And finally, we have the last arc from season 3. Like usual, we start with the stakes:

img(https://i.imgur.com/tGaVJ5x.png)

That’s actually pretty intense! Sure hope they don’t immediately retreat from that after the exam like they always do.

Overall, this arc is…bleh. I think its main problem is that it feels like it goes on forever. And due to the repetitive plot structure, this just feels like the 10,000th exam stage. I don't believe you about the stakes. Deku will be fine no matter what they do. None of this matters. I’m not invested anymore. And of course, the visuals don’t help matters at all.

img(https://i.imgur.com/Co1ZdWk.png)
img(https://i.imgur.com/sgHBysN.png)

I think the training camp and Bakugo retrieval arcs were just so bad that the show can't recover now. I am actively irritated with the show now while watching. Also, the tone is incredibly tiresome and stiff now. I miss the loose feel of season 1, where All Might swore in front of Deku and it didn't take itself as seriously as a heart attack. Seeing the number one hero in the world, the symbol of peace, swear in front of a young kid is hilarious. It made me feel like at least part of his hero persona was a front that he put on. As such, he felt a bit more human. I liked that side of him. I don't really like him at all now. He's boring. This exam stage in particular is really fucking boring. They're doing a little with making the people they're supposed to be rescuing assholes, but it isn't enough.

And then there's this guy, who has possibly the funniest backstory ever written.

img(https://i.imgur.com/HLenXqH.png)
“Todoroki was mean to me and now I don’t like him” ahahahahaha

~~~Exam Stages/Fake Stakes 3~~~

Oh, and guess what? Just like I said, they waved off the stakes. Those who failed can take a 3 month course to get their provisional licenses anyways. Since this is now a problem I can't ignore, I'll address it here. One of the biggest offenders of fake stakes in this series is the exam stages. Horikoshi has a crippling habit of creating stakes for the students during exams, only to backtrack as quickly as possible once the arc is over. For example:

In episode 5, Aizawa threatened to expel the student that scored the lowest on an entrance exam. This is quickly retreated from the next episode. Not a big deal that they backed away from it here. Just make sure you follow through next time, that way I can believe there's actual stakes to these exams.

In episode 38, the students are threatened with having to go to summer school if they fail.

img(https://i.imgur.com/Kigy4ze.png)

This is again, retreated from after the arc ends. Now it’s a problem. Because twice now, you have declared there to be stakes via consequences for failing or performing poorly in an exam, and both times you failed to follow through. There will be more examples later. So, why is this bad?

Because 1, I don't believe the show when it tells me there will be consequences when someone fails. Because there never are. Be it the students getting into trouble, UA failing to protect its students, or something as simple as student failing an exam. You always retreat from it afterwards. And because of that, I'm less engaged during exams. After all, there are no stakes because Horikoshi insists on giving plot armor to everyone in class A. And 2, because it’s supposed to be difficult to get through UA, right? They tell us that very early in the show:

img(https://i.imgur.com/iGzGL1Y.png)
~~~(From episode 4)~~~

Like a lot of things the show does, this is telling without showing. The show will tell us it is difficult to get through UA, but it really isn't at all. The school bends over backwards constantly to keep students from failing. This is not really something that should be a struggle for a battle shounen at all, at least if you're a writer that's willing to take risks. Want some examples?

Let’s look at the Hunter exam from Hunter x Hunter and the chuunin exams from Naruto. These are basically the same thing as the exams the characters go through in UA. To become a pro hunter/ninja, you have to pass these exams. Naruto and Hunter x Hunter want you to know that these tests are difficult and making it through is a significant is a huge feat. So how do Kishimoto and Togashi support it?

Uh, by having people fail. A LOT of entrants fail in both the chuunin exams and Hunter exams. And not scrubs, either. One of the main characters fails the first time in Hunter x Hunter, and most of the entrants that you end up spending most of the show with end up failing in Naruto. As for as numbers go:

Most of the characters lose before the finals, including main characters.  Killua fails in Hunter x Hunter. if you look at insignificant characters, all but 7 failed the hunter exam. 400+ examinees failed. In the chuunin exams, hundreds failed as well. There were only 5 genin remaining when the Konoha Crush interrupts the exams. (Failing is a bit different in Naruto. You can lose in the finals and still become a chuunin). Why does this matter?

img(https://i.imgur.com/79vx7M7.png)
~~~Killua fails the Hunter exam~~~

Because part of the point of having these exams in the first place is to make it clear how difficult it is to become a shinobi/hunter. People need to fail out so 1, the threat of characters failing is established. 2, to establish stakes. And 3, establish the extreme level of difficulty to accomplish the goal, for the purposes of making the task seem daunting (which will be a constant source of drama), and to make those that have accomplished it (in this case the pro heroes) worthy of respect for having reached it.

Hunter x Hunter and Naruto wanted their exam stages to seem difficult and intense, so they supported it by being willing to have characters fail. It’s really that simple. Kishimoto and Togashi as writers are willing to take those risks to make their manga better. Horikoshi is not.

~~~Class B~~~

Another example of fake exam stakes that annoys me is how they keep telling us that if class A trips up, students from class B could replace them. This is another good source of drama, and adds even more stakes for the class A students. But like all the other stakes, the show never follows through with it. I really wish they would too, because there are some weak characters in class A I really wish would get cut out. Like the animal guy, and the tail guy, and especially this guy:

img(https://i.imgur.com/AwREDD9.png)

He's boring and his power is boring. Get rid of him.

I would love for Horikoshi to take a risk and move one of these boring dorks out for someone like Shinso, but Horikoshi is again too afraid to move even a single character out of place for some reason. So once again, you say this one thing will happen, and then retreat from it afterwards. You never follow through with what you say you’re gonna do, which, again, contradicts this:

img(https://i.imgur.com/CnecvXq.png)

# ~~~Deku vs Bakugo~~~

Capping off season 3, we have Deku vs Bakugo. And look. I know people think this fight is amazing. And…I mean it could be. If it was organic to the narrative, had stakes, and wasn’t forced into a place in the story it doesn’t belong. The problem I have with this fight is it doesn't represent a moment where past and/or current differences and philosophies collide naturally due to the narrative. The show is pausing its story to have this fight. Deku vs Bakugo is MHA's version of Naruto vs Sasuke. But with Naruto vs Sasuke, it was very much the right time for that fight, and there were real stakes. Sasuke wants to go off and join Orochimaru to gain power, but Naruto knows and we as an audience know that Orochimaru only wants to use Sasuke as a vessel to switch bodies. And while you might think Sasuke can handle himself, …we watched Orochimaru kill a hokage earlier. (One of the benefits of killing off characters btw). So we know he is a serious threat to kill Sasuke. That's the kind of stakes and emotional drama you need for a fight between main characters. Which is what I think this fight lacks.

Granted, there isn't really a rule to how you write a fight like this. And I'm not really advocating for it to just do what Naruto did. It isn't a bad fight. I just think you need a little more here. Something to be lost for Deku when he's defeated. And have it be written more organically into the story, rather than shoving it awkwardly between arcs.


# ~~~In Between Arcs 2~~~

We end season 3 with episode 62. The first half of it is looking into the idea of how All Might’s retirement is affecting normal citizens. This is, of course, a very good idea. The show hasn’t really put any effort into humanizing the citizens so we gave a shit when villains attack and put their lives in danger. It also is the start of the idea that Endeavor doesn’t really work as an All Might replacement. He lacks the charisma and people just don’t react to him the same way. It’s…interesting. And they follow up on it later. Uh, good stuff.

The second half is more fake stakes for Deku’s body and consequences after his fight with Bakugo. Deku is fine, again. Deku and Bakugo broke curfew, destroyed a bunch of shit, fought, and their only punishment is they have to clean more. Really? After sneaking out during the class raid? Have the teachers at UA learned absolutely nothing this entire time?

Big three arrives, season over.

~~~[Two Heroes](https://anilist.co/review/13322) ~~~"
21234,"[Disclaimer: The arguments I've made for story structure and such I'd probably still stand by. However, events of the plot I didn't judge necessary to address when I first wrote this review I can't say if I'd defend now. I made the choice to let the review as it stands and make no further edits.]

I was originally not planning in writing anything in regards to this anime in specific, as I thought I had nothing interesting to say about the title. However, after reading the analysis by Zephsilver, I managed to put together some thoughts in regards to Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (or Erased, if you are not fond of tongue-twisters) that I’d like to offer in addition to the debate. I also would like to say: Zeph, I appreciate and respect your text, since it had a rational depiction of your perspective that I could reasonably grasp, but I’d like to politely disagree.

Before getting into the review, though, I want to give some context: before the beginning of the winter season I had read the synopsis of Erased and added to my Plan to Watch list, as it seemed mildly interesting. Later, after watching the first two episodes, I was hooked by the premise and highly invested in what could be the outcome of the story. Only then that I got to know about the hype surrounding the series and from that point I witnessed the internet go insane over its score.

Story and Characters

My reviewing method for this one will be somewhat different from the norm. By the time I’m writing this, the series itself is still surrounded by controversy with two sides with very questionable motivations either raising it as the best thing since Page 3 or clamming it’s an overrated abomination pandering to masses who want to think of themselves as smart (doesn’t that apply to 99% of humanity?). Here, besides commenting of the story and characters within the work, I’ll also discus some of the arguments brought up against Erased and offer my perspective if they are correct in any form or if they hold any water. The first thing I think it’s important to understand is that Erased is, at its core, a very simple story. Besides the time-traveling plot, it has a very streamlined narrative and it is focused almost exclusively on the actions of the main character, in accordance to the fact that he is the “strange element” in the child timeline (suddenly feels like I’m talking about Zelda!). What it avoids in complexity, it opts to use in character interaction, developing the drama and the motivations that move the story forward. Before I get to the meat of the argument, though, let’s talk about some of the characters.

Fujinuma Satoru is the main protagonist. “Gifted” with the ability he calls Revival, he can go back a few minutes in time, whenever something bad is about to happen. Detached and constantly feeling unfulfilled, he holds a strong regret due to events of his childhood, when two of his classmates were murdered and one of his friends was incriminated. These feelings lead him to distance himself from his past, but he is forced by a Revival to go back to the days of his childhood in order to prevent those crimes.

Hinazuki Kayo is the girl who Satoru wants to prevent from becoming the first victim. Frequently abused by her mother, she avoids interacting with her classmates and is usually seen alone. She initially tries to keep a distance from Satoru, not understanding his motives for trying to get close to her, but his friendly demeanor ends up softening her emotional barriers.

Yashiro Gaku is Satoru’s teacher and one of the main agents in the narrative, as he seems interested in solving Kayo’s family situation. Satoru later comments on how Yashiro was an influence to him due to a speech he gave at school, before the story had began, and a specific moment in which Yashiro looked like what Satoru expected his deceased father to be.

Shiratori Jun, mostly known as Courage, is an adult who was friends with Satoru in his childhood. Socially awkward and with a heavy stutter, he feels more comfortable interacting with children, which leads him to be framed for the child-murders Satoru tries to prevent. Besides feeding the motivations of the protagonist, the story also uses him to briefly comment in how his inability to be socially active and preferring the company of children led society to misjudge his intentions, especially when Satoru faces a similar situation in the future.

While the thriller aspect of the anime is in the center of the driving forces of the narrative, the bulk of the emotional investment Erased strives to build is on the bonding between Satoru and the people he is trying to save, and his motivations within the story. Great focus is given to his interactions with his friends, who with the exception of Ken’ya, who seems unusually mature for someone of his age, are all very believable child characters. By that I don’t mean being as obnoxious as an inch-deep testicle wound, by the way, these kids are actually designed to be likeable. This aspect of the story is built upon until the conclusion, where they play a part in finally getting the killer arrested. Having all of this in mind, let’s tackle some of the complaints about the series.

“The time travel element is underdeveloped”

The time travel element is kept simple. Firstly, Satoru’s ability to go back in time is nothing more than a plot device to put him on the track of the murders and since it seems to be simply a supernatural element instead of the usual sci-fi occurring, keeping it simply is a better idea. The story in Erased isn't about time travel, it just features such element as the one necessary for kicking the narrative into motion. Stories that are centered around time travel usually stumble and fall when they decide to flesh out this element without paying proper attention to consistency, which leads to gross plot-holes. Maintaining this element simple and undetailed allows Erased to avoid major inconsistences and focus on the main drive of the story. Also, I know some people were upset by the second instance where Satoru goes back to his child-self as it seemed he had gained control over his ability. To that, I hope you can forgive me stepping out of my polite demeanor for a while to say: For fuck’s sake, that only happened ONCE and it doesn’t even look like he had much control over it! Being it a supernatural ability, and one that seems to have a mind of its own, nonetheless, the event itself isn't so out of place as one might think.

“The identity of the killer is obvious and the reveal is underwhelming”

This complaint is one that fans and detractors of the series seem to agree, although in different levels of importance. I mean, the opening itself tells you who it is. The point of contention here is not whether or not the average viewer can easily guess the killer’s identity, but the purpose that such attribute plays in the story. To some, working under the mindset that Erased’s genre is Mystery; such flaw would represent a sign of incompetent use of red-herrings, as well as inability from the writer to effectively create other suspects. In other words, hack writing. Fans of the series, however, work under the mindset that Erased is, in reality, a Thriller. Such idea is supported by an interview with the director of the anime, where he states:

- “I see this story as a suspense thriller, or well, a human drama in the guise of a suspense thriller”

By that definition, the tension within the story would come not from the mystery over the killer’s identity, which is constantly flashed throughout the story, but from the knowledge the audience has in opposition to the cast, since knowing who is the killer would raise tension whenever he and the main characters were close, and that emotion would then culminate when the villain finally reveals itself for the protagonist. Some of his attitudes could be very ambiguous, like the ones at episode 09, but they ultimately filled the role of driving him closer to Satoru, which would then lead to their connection in the years to come, finally bringing his downfall, as Satoru himself had become the killer’s weakness. But seriously, folks, the opening just flat-out tells you who it is in the very episode the killer is introduced, how do you get to reach episode 10 still thinking it's supposed to be a secret in the first place? 

“Erased becomes an unfocused mess in the latter half”

This is the one argument to which my response is a categorical NO. Before I get into a fair explanation in relation to that statement, though, let give a better example of how to define lack of focus. For that, I’ll actually give the other face and throw under the bus an anime that just so happens to be one of my favorites, Ergo Proxy, because self-awareness is important. The first 8 episodes of the anime are some of the most tightly written episodes in anime, with barely any line of dialogue wasted and plenty of subtle details in character reactions. Right before the first half, though, the main characters go into a journey looking for the truth behind the main mystery of the series, and from that point on Ergo Proxy adopts a highly experimental structure, focusing plenty of episodes in isolated conflicts tied only to the theme it wanted to address in that specific episode (I apologize for the repetition). Very little of those episodes has connection to the main goal, and when the characters reach their destination it turns out to be a dead end, forcing them to return in order to find the truth. For all of that, it’s not unreasonable to say that Ergo Proxy specifically lacks focus on its narrative. From the point Kayo leaves the center of the plot, Satoru’s objectives change, from saving the girl to protecting the other victims and uncovering the identity of the assassin. As a result, the series follows along with such change and turns its eyes to him, in the same fashion as does the danger of attracting the attention of the villain, just like we would see later on, when Satoru’s actions lead him to be the new target. In that sense, the anime simply shifts its focus, it didn’t lose it and that was the natural root to take. That also leads us to another topic;

“Erased lost its charm once Kayo left the picture”

I always found questionable the idea of attributing the entire appeal of a story in a side-character, but that aside, let’s understand this argument: The idea here is that, since the anime spent so much time revolving around Satoru’s efforts to save Kayo, much of the audience’s investment was crafted around the girl, as she would be the one the viewer would immediately want to see shielded from harm. The series does many efforts to frame her in sympathetic light and give her endearing qualities, so when she is moved away from the plot many felt it had wasted their investment. This is a comprehensible thought, indeed, but I believe it ignores another important aspect of fiction: by maintaining focus on a character that has already fulfilled its narrative purpose, the work runs the risk of saturating such character, diminishing the values that made them endearing in the first place and ultimately compromising the story to make room for them. Moving Kayo away from the narrative not only makes sense from a logical point of view, as it completely places her away from the killer, but also preserves her from becoming a hindrance to the story and leaves her character with the emotional baggage that comes at play during the last episodes. There is a merit in avoiding wish-fulfillment if it prevents characters from becoming a problem to the flow of the narrative.


""The ending is rushed and the villain's motivations are poorly explained""

This criticism specifically I can understand on the basis of how the anime progresses in his final episodes, but I’d like to explain the reason for my disagreement by discussing one of the references made by the villain, the spider thread tale. This element is first brought up at the beginning of episode 11, when the antagonist comments that after a specific event during his childhood, he begins to see spider threads hanging above the heads of his victims, in reference to a tale about a criminal who gets the chance to escape from hell using the thread sent by Shakyamuni Bhudda, but is condemned once again when the thread breaks, in punishment for his selfishness. In this tale, the thread was the last source of salvation given by a superior being to a soul in despair, so seeing it above the heads of those he wanted to kill can be interpreted as the antagonist’s desire to be someone above his victims, to be an “entity” with the power to condemn or give salvation. When he is finally defeated by Satoru, he sees a spider thread above his own head be torn apart. This is the point when he realizes that he was powerless and susceptible to being manipulated and judged just like his victims, he realizes he’s not an entity in control. By the same line of thought, he takes an interest in Satoru, after the kid survives his first attempt to kill him, because Satoru was the one able to escape his judgment.

Presentation

I believe many of you heard Erased’s visuals being called “cinematic” and that is actually a statement that holds water, as the anime utilizes some techniques of traditional cinema in much more noticeable fashion, a result of the experience the director had working with other professionals like Hosoda Mamoru or Araki Tetsuro, this last one an expert on making anime with mainstream appeal. Now, another term I believe can be applied to the show’s presentation, in general, is minimalistic. The characters are frequently framed in wide shots within the scenery, with the fixed camera giving full comprehension of the environment while the figures are kept small and with minimal action. The purpose of this directing style is to avoid the viewer getting lost in the imagery and lead them to focus only on the details that are relevant to the narrative. In the other hand, it also serves to emphasize emotional moments and heighten the impact of scenes that display a little bit more of flare, giving them a whimsical feel.

This trait also manifests in the characterization, as the shots stealthily introduce certain details and character motivations, like the hero’s Mask in Satoru’s bedroom, to show a figure that inspired him as a kid, or in the manner in which the killer is framed, from the point he’s fully introduced to the brief interactions that hint to his identity, like when the camera is focused upwards, mirroring Satoru’s perspective. These choices of framing serve to cut on the necessity of exposition, reducing the dialogue only to what is essential. This can also be noticed on the sound work: important scenes, like the moment Satoru makes the first impactful contact with Hinazuki, frequently opt for not having soundtrack, driving even more attention to the dialogue and giving full responsibility to the viewer to infer on what is going on between the characters. For an anime that has been accused of being heavy-handed, I’d say this directorial decision is pretty respectful towards the audience.

The points that feature soundtrack, though, don’t tend to be impressive. Most of the noticeable tracks play their purpose, but are fairly generic, serving only to highlight the specific mood the scene wants to convey. Exceptions would be, of course, the highly catch opening, the fitting and mellow ending, and tracks such as “Only I am missing”, “I have to save her”, which is brief but very effective at crafting tension despite the upbeat vibe, “Reasoning” and “She was there, alone”. Hum, I’m noticing a pattern here! When it comes to the acting, it’s very consistent with character portrayal and overall quite solid, but one aspect that might raise disagreements, more than usual at least, is Satoru’s voice actor. Despite a solid performance, even taking into consideration it’s his first anime role, Shinnosuke Mitsushima is one of those actors who has a voice that is too singular, which can drive attention away from the acting itself.

Personal Ramblings

I think now we can address some of the external questions related to Erased.

Is Erased the best thing since dark beer? No, I can myself point out more than a handful of titles that are better, without taking away from the anime itself. Was it overhyped? Sure! I mean, it’s hard to refute that an anime getting into MAL’s top 10 before it is even finished is quite a ludicrous event. Is the negativity warranted? My stance, at least, is “not really”. I believe it’s fair to ask how much of the negativity towards the series is a direct result of its hype, as some people might think it pressures them into a position. I’ve seen even better shows get attacked with far less meaningful arguments, as a result of public opinion being highly favorable towards them, so the attitude itself doesn’t surprise me. The most interesting question, though, seems to be: how did Erased of all anime become so hyped? Think about the most notorious titles of recent years that can be considered overhyped: Attack on Titan was a shounen with focus in drama and a high body count, with an overall gritty setting and story; Kill la Kill was a self-aware ride of nonsensical action with very little restraint; One Punch Man was a parody of superhero tropes centered around fast-paced action and comedy. To think that a slow-paced thriller like Erased, with such an emphasis in children interacting and very little action, would become the hit of the season is a very surprising event.

I must admit that I somewhat enjoyed the polemic surrounding the anime, not so much for how it affected the show itself in the public eye, but because it rings specially close to one of my personal beliefs: fixation on scores is bullshit! People going crazy over one title’s score seemed ludicrous and drove the discussion away from the important elements by turning it into an exercise in group-think. Now you had to rate the show a certain way so that your opinion could be taken seriously by certain sections of the anime community. Now, however, the fires of the flame wars are on the rout to be tamed, so I thought it would be a good idea to offer my perspective on the anime, hoping that it can invoke some respect around.

Since this is the section of the review I leave (specially) dedicated to self-indulgence, I’d like to talk about specific details about Erased that I really like: I like Satoru’s interactions with his mom as a child, showcasing that he still cared for her, even with the distance between them in his adult self; I like his interactions with his friends, both as a child and as an adult, when we can see the contrast their relationship takes; I like the lack of control Satoru has when talking as a child, showing the disconnect between his body and his mind; I like the meaning the title takes at the end of the series; I like the whimsical moments between Satoru and Hinazuki, which really drove home the meaning of his actions even at short term; I like the childishly awesome lines Satoru’s friends said; I like when he reads the text he had written as child, about his favorite hero; I like it, simple as that.

With this review I don’t aim to change people’s opinions or scores about Erased (although if it leads more people to give the show a try it would be really cool!), I hope simply to showcase how this opinion in specific can be valid, because as minimalistic of a story as it was, it did something for me, and for that I appreciate it."

##~~~Your Lie In April~~~
~~~There is a reason why almost everyone who's watched this anime loves it.~~~

Since I absolutely SUCK at summarizing anime, here’s the official one:
>Once an accomplished child pianist, musical prodigy Arima Kousei lost his drive to play the piano after a traumatizing event involving his mother at the tender age of eleven. Now a regular middle school student, Arima spends his days with his two best friends Watari and Tsubaki devoid of music. However, his life changes dramatically after meeting Miyazono Kaori, a pretty violinist every bit as brash as the way she plays.

This anime is beautifully, heartbreaking. ‘Your Lie In April’ takes you on an emotional rollercoaster from the very beginning, and doesn’t stop until the moment it ends. Especially when it ends. It’s the type of show that will tear you apart, almost piece you back together, and then just utterly destroy you. But, I couldn’t seem to stop watching. It’s cheerful, but also agonizing, filled with heavy themes and dark backstories that will make you want to break down and cry for these kids. Which, in my case, I did. 

The animation is beyond stunning, consistent, smooth, and able to portray the characters emotions perfectly, and the music, oh sweet baby jesus, the MUSIC. The opening/closing songs, elegant and precise piano playing, and emotionally-appropriate background music were breath-taking and absolutely magnificent. It was some good shit. 

The relationship that the main characters shared was inspirational, loving, almost familial. It was so tight-knit, and you really see throughout the series just how much they depend on one another. 

>“Truth be told, Kousei never says those three little words to Kaori nor does Kaori say them to Kousei's face. But like all of the other musical performances throughout the anime, they didn't have to. Because their music did the talking for them. Emi's passionate pleas resounded from her piano; Aiza's determination to defeat his long-standing rival echoed throughout the stadium; and Kousei's farewell to the mother he's always feared emanated in a way that only a son could play. Therefore it is only fitting that the final performance be not one filled with selfishness, anger, or goodbyes; it's a duet from the heart of the couple that never got to be.”
~~~-Quote by BanjoTheBear on Reddit.~~~

The overall thing that the creators of ‘Your lie in april’ wanted you to take away from the anime was that music can change lives. Sometimes, life can be really hard, too hard to carry on, but you still gotta live it. You got to give it your best, and live with no regrets.

Naruto Shippuden : Review |
-------------------------------------

Naruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years.

Let me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times. But please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has been the best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular and also its flaws.

-----------
Story - 8
-----------

The story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun while being able to take itself seriously when it needs to. It starts off where the first part of Naruto ended and the very first scenes gives us a sneak peak of things to come. The series eases you back into the world of Naruto with a slow paced , almost SOL like first few episodes. And the story then on is presented in a collection of long well constructed story arcs with the bigger picture stories of Sasuke and the Akatsuki being told parallelly till a certain point. Down the line this is series deals with more mature themes and darker tones and manage to execute well on most of those themes if not all. The story is mainly hampered (not ruined) by fillers and pacing issues which I will discuss below.

Let's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole.
The issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plot line at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don’t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself.
However, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is,

Pacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up.

Now that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives.
The main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply.
Another thing that this series does very well is explaining its core concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile and detailed power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out.

The amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming pretentious.

Something that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he has already started setting up major events that happened in the last of episodes of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. Same thing applies to the moments that tug at your heartstrings , they feel genuine because how the story builds up to those moments.

Being a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines.
As I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series.
Variety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these!

The last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer as the villain had almost no personality and motives were shaky at best. Without spoiling anything all I can say is that decisions taken during the last war arc felt like it was done to unnecessarily prolong the final battle and messed it up with a poorly written villain and bad story decisions. But the final episodes after the War arc manages to reign it all in and give a proper farewell to the series it so richly deserves.

Throughout the series you will witness friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, characters growing up, politics, romance, and the world itself change. It can be flawed at times but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning.

--------------------
Characters - 10
--------------------

Now this is the core of the franchise.
Each character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out.
No matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths.
You will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships.

Now let's move on to the ""Villains""
This series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes.
Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex [checked] , Money Hungry Villains [checked] , Religious Psychopaths [checked] , Villain who is after Revenge [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the ""heroes."" The morality here is blurred.

But coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it.

-----------------------------
Art and Animation - 7.5
-----------------------------

Again we have a mixed bag here.
This show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par.
I think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita’s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11!
Despite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation.

And as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this.

--------------
Sound - 10
--------------

This is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like.

------------------------------------------------
Enjoyment and Overall Experience - 10
------------------------------------------------

Naruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment. It's by no means a flawless anime , but it's an anime with highs that more than makes up for it's lows. It reaches for the stars but makes a few tumbles along the way , but the best moments of Naruto are some of the best moments in the medium itself.
And with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation.

Sub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended

---------------------------
| Recommendations |
---------------------------

[Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series.

[Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well.

[Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden."
104578,"Every new season of Attack on Titan grows in many areas in an extraordinary way. The first one putting in more simplistic terms was simple and straightforward. Wall Maria was broken down by the Colossal titan, and the city swarmed by all kinds of weird and bizarre-looking ones of his kind. Come to find out, the main character, Eren, had the power to turn into one of these horrifying looking monsters. Then from there on, it's easy to assume everything that could've transpired — eventually followed by the season after when all these new elements started to pop out — for instance, learning about the titan's real identity that broke down the wall. Not to mention, all the signs at something bigger happenings in the shadow but still no good idea what it might be. This was also a time for characterization, as we see them more thoroughly developed and can now feel more tightly connected to them.

Then you have the season 3 where Attack on Titan grows to a whole new height. You get to see deeper into the political aspect, and the titans are on the backburner for a while. We finally find out how they came to be, and the puzzle pieces are finally starting to fit in slowly. There was also light-world building to make sure the experience was even more fulfilling and satisfying. During the next part, the biggest questions of them all are finally answered. Titans history, among others, is revealed, and the mystery surrounding them. Although we still have quite a lot left to be exposed, so the theorists and predictions are, therefore, again running wild, trying to crack the code and form a solution to what we still don't know at the moment.

As always, from the startup till now, Wit Studio delivers yet again. It's clear by how much passion and love is put into every scene. When it's supposed to be invoking emotions, if the situation is right, you can feel everything from sorrow, anger, excitement, confusion, and varieties others kind of feelings. Moreover, art is hugely detailed like you would expect from previous seasons, and it meshes well with the different moods and vibes of the current view or position. Animation, too, is insanely fluid and crisp, and there was not a single moment I taught it was feeling off. We had some small glimpses of not the best CGI, but it didn't make a dent in entertainment value and was quite easy to overlook.

Being a manga reader myself, I can also safely assure you the ""pacing"" was impeccable and barely anything or, if at all, was skipped. On the other, in comparison to the ""Uprising arc"" from part one of the season, which was condensed somewhat, but if you were to ask me, this was a sound decision. It was profoundly political centered, and if it continued to be just that the audience, specifically a portion of the ""anime onlies"" or possibly even manga readers might've liked it less. Of course, thankfully, I was not one of them, and it was many that we're able to appreciate it's grace too. Like any other season, we also had Hiroyuki Sawano delivers once again in the original soundtrack department with his undeniable impeccable and masterpiece of composition. The voice acting was merely outstanding, too, and I find myself just like any other season. Turning the volume full up during the intense conversation, packing lots of impacts to have an even more chilling and exciting experience which never has failed me.

Attack on Titan is no doubt something I would with confidence consider a ""perfect adaption"" up to this point. It's one of the best the anime industry has to offer, and anyone would have a hard time denying it as a fact with the Final season thankfully set to be released during Fall 2020. The expectations are considerably high, as you might've expected. If the studio or hopefully Wit continues to deliver justice as it has been during all these years. You can bet it will be another unforgettable mindblowing, and thrilling experience. Suffice to say my anime of Spring season 2019 and possibly the entire year is already decided."
21355,"Story

Re: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu starts out with Subaru sent to another world against his own will. But he doesn't seem to care much and sets out his new life in this mysterious world. We can already tell Subaru is someone that is probably a shut-in, and don't care about responsibilities and so forth. More likely, he spends all day in his room playing games or watching videos. This anime will play with your emotions on levels you can't even begin to imagine. But compared to other Isekai or anime in general. Our main lead doesn't get everything from power, knowledge, intelligence served in front of him on a silver platter. He has to work for it. The load is realistic in the sense it takes a sane amount of time. In other words, he can't achieve anything heavy like learning a language right then and there. I really appreciate that about Re: Zero.

Subaru will go through the pain and struggle to meet his goals, times the 100, and that's still not enough to convey the torture he will go through. At any rate, Subaru had no idea what he got himself into. His mind embarks on a thrilling and intense journey with despair lurking amidst him and circling around, waiting for the right opportunity strike to make him suffer harshly. Putting it in simpler terms, the world is out to get him both literally and figuratively. Nothing goes as he wants to easily. This journey through hell and back is something that will break Subaru and form him into a better person through multiple meetings with despair itself. However, his story in another world seems to start out happy, since soon after being transported, he befriends a beautiful silver-haired elf girl, Emilia.

For some unknown reasons, she is being hunted by a psychotic assassin who manages to kill them both. Subaru falls in despair, only to open his eyes and standing there like it never happened. He can reverse time to a specific checkpoint and make it seem like his death never occurred. The catch is that only he remembers what happened. And if he were to tell this to anybody, he would suffer severe consequences in the form of immeasurable pain. At this point, you might wonder, but what is this anime about? What is the end goal? Firstly, this is a psychologically character-driven anime that focuses on Subaru and breaks down his character to groom him into a better, more mature person. However, it's not as easy as it sounds. Without going too much into details, let us say he goes through some shit many times and comes back more broken and vulnerable every time.

Until eventually, he falls apart and starts to take it out on others. Then arrives at a point where he could be gone forever. If nothing is done to save his suffering soul from the most bottomless pits of the abyss. Before everything else, Subaru is a hyper, energetic, quite the lively guy. He doesn't seem to care what others think of him and is not afraid to be cringe-inducing or plain weird. But that's part of his charm and what makes him so likable and interesting if you ask me. You will see him at his strongest, and at his weakest. His character is what makes this anime so amazing and unique. Subaru also has great chemistry with almost anyone. Whoever the person might be. The interactions likely will be fun, lively, and won't bore you, just entertain you all the more.

My reason for praising this anime so highly is because of Subaru and his development through the series. You can clear as day see how much he has developed close to the end of the season, compared to the starting point. I could easily appreciate his character, even more at this point, after everything he went through, and the level of progress we got for him. It makes him one of my favorites characters. So as you might've predicted already, specifically, the first season doesn't have a set goal. The characters drive this anime, but as you are going through the journey of suffering. You will see sub-plots that could be considered a part of the main plot, but only if you use this season as the core. Because Re: Zero, as noted by the creator - Tappei Nagatsuki, will be around 12 arcs. The anime covered the first, second, and the third arc. He also stated there will be at least 60 volumes worth of canon content by the end, so this speaks volumes for how big each arc could be and how much is still left unexplored.

Sound

This anime adaptation of Re: Zero excels at many things, undoubtedly, the sound is one of the components. Absolute despair, grief, and even with the comedic moments. White Fox does a beautiful job of meshing and applying the right tune to their respective category. As a result and example, the conversations feel more impactful during certain dialogues and overflows the right mood. So when the soundtrack kicks in. If you already are not experiencing some sort of emotion, this will definitely help you and give you the last push if you ever need it. Even if you don't, it makes everything feel way better and heightens the experience you would go through during those moments. Beyond that, it has some seriously kickass soundtrack, which can be addicting to listen to. Both openings feel spot-on when it comes to the overall feel and atmosphere of the story. Nothing but praises is all I have when it comes to sound department. I just love the OST of Re:Zero.

The ending is the same. I could argue I like the second ending more since it feels more on-point, and no one can't like Rie Takahashi angelic voice? That said, the first ending is definitely a strong one, and I don't dislike it despite my previous remarks. To top it off, we have some quite quality insert songs here and there, which will either make you pumped up or leave you in utter despair. Another strong point is, without a doubt, the voice acting. It feels so real, and the actors can really get into the character they are playing. You will be charmed by the effect the dialogue and the voice acting can have on you. It's so powerful and realistic at times. This anime also has one of my favorites directed episode of all time, the dialogue, to the tension, the overall mood is excellent. It would not be a lie to call some of these episodes a masterpiece from a direction and execution perspective, in my humble opinion.

Art

I absolutely adore the art style used for Re:Zero, at first glance, it gives this vibe of maybe feeling cute or moe-ish. However, White Fox does an excellent job of manipulating it to provides the effect with it should be at different times. Equally, the facial expressions are on-point as well and feel realistic. Attention to detail is seriously one of the best I have seen. During action events, the art and animation look fluid. You can tell White Fox is putting money, passion, time, and effort into producing a solid adaptation. Yes, the action sequences are fun to watch. I found myself at times, going back to see those same scenes over again. And I did not find any inconsistency in art or animation personally, which one needs to be on high alert of. The CGI is not top-notch, but it gets the work done and didn't mind it too much since it was gone before it becomes an issue.

Characters

As stated before, the cast is one of the best. It feels alive, and in some ways, it does help Subaru progress further as a person. To start with, Emilia, which is our main heroine, gives you this vibe of being tsundere-ish. Though you cannot help but find her amusing and start to like her, the design of her is also stunning once you get more characterization for her. I would say it fits her character persona very well. If you see her somewhere, you can easily deduce her psyche from her appearance. As previously stated, the side character is fantastic and one the best. They all have such good chemistry with Subaru, and it is hard not to be amused by their interactions.

Whether it be a certain maid making fun of him because Subaru is silly or with bandits on the side of the road and up to no good. You will also have the side characters where you will hate the individual, but later on, change your opinion toward a positive note and want more screen time for them. To go further, there are some quality side character that stands above the others and could, for instance, be the main role material. Of course, you have those scumbags that you want to just die since they did something horrible. What. I can say without going too much into spoilers, is you will seriously hate the individual so much it hurts. Still, this one is definitely a well-written villain, and personality is one of the strongest points about this person. Just be aware when you do meet the scum, your brain will tremble.

The Negative

It really is a great anime. I cannot stress that enough. Sadly, it is not for everyone, not everyone will feel the exact same feeling as me. Obviously, I can see someone who wants a solely plot-driven story with a set-fixed goal to drop this in the earlier episode and so on. There must be at least some of those out there who would, unfortunately. But Subaru could also be one of those biggest reasons. Depending on how you take his personality, in just a matter of moments, you can come to dislike him and don't want to watch any further. If not, his future actions might have you questioning his character and could be a reason for falling out Re: Zero. My advice going into this anime, as with any media, is to completely forget the concept ""expectations"" and watch this entirely blind. Let the experience you go through this be the judgmental core for you, not your blind insight, which could be the very reason that turns you away from this otherwise fantastic, unique, intense, and emotional anime.

Conclusion

Compared to the usual, not so interesting to bad Isekai anime. Re: Zero has a unique twist to it, which just really works. This is one of a kind with lots of potentials. One of which I absolutely want a second season to see where the story goes from this point on. I will not call this a defacto masterpiece. But there is no denying it has some masterfully directed episodes which could be showered with that kind of praise. Finally, if you like a realistic, character-driven story that uses all it has in its arsenal to heighten the experience with solid side characters. To really up the amusement further. I would highly recommend Re: Zero to both new and old watchers of anime. This is definitely standard for what an Isekai can be if you think outside of the box, and it's a great gateway to anime. And yes, just like HxH 2011, you should definitely give this anime a fair and much-deserved shot at one point.

20464,"I just want to start this off by saying how much I absolutely adore  this anime. Show-stopping, spectacular, never-the-same, amazing, wonderful, funny... Y'all. 
I'm gonna start off by saying the non-personal reasons I have for loving this anime first, because that's what matters in a review, and I'll also be reviewing Haikyuu as a whole and not just the first season, so, yeah. 
So in general, this anime follows the story of Hinata, a first year student finding his way in the volleyball world, especially as a short person. His drive and energy is legit inspiring. I don't like to just say it, but for real. I hear anime protags giving their speeches about what's important and what's not, but it never really compares to Hinata's drive. 
Another thing, the main cast of the show, Kurasuno's volleyball club all have very interesting stories of their own. The character development that Kageyama faces during the show is so great to watch. He went from somewhat annoying and aggravating, to my favorite character in the show. Literally in s4 he'll breathe and my brain says: serotonin. 
As well as the fact that the show gets you to care about the other teams just as much as the main team. It makes the watcher feel so much more when watching the matches. Half of the time, I hope both teams win, because I care so much about all of them. Neko, Aoba, Fukurodani, etc, I love all of them so much even if I root for Kurasuno in the end. Most shows tend to rely on the audience hating the other side in order to make you love the main team, but Haikyuu doesn't do that. In s4, I could not express how happy I was to see Kuroo and Kenma again. Like when they showed up on screen I was screaming, y'all. Same with Bokuto omg.
I think it's so wild how this story makes you care about it. In reality, it's just some volleyball anime. But it leaves this impact on the watcher that I rarely see in other sports anime, or just anime in general.
Also I know way too about volleyball now... lol.
Now to talk about why this anime is so important to me, specifically. 
I'm a transgender man. I have a small frame, I'm actually the same height as Hinata (5'3-4), and I've never been involved with men's sports. Whether it's because I personally don't believe in myself like I should, or knowing that I won't be treated the same as all the others in guys sports. Watching this show makes me feel as if I'm apart of that world that I've never gotten to be apart of. That specific part of the -teen boy experience- that I've never gotten, one of many. It's like I get it back. I also get the feeling of having a close net group of male friends, something I've never really had as well as a trans guy.
I empathize with Hinata so much too, as someone who is looked down upon in sports because of my body. But seeing him try so hard everyday, and seeing him be one of the best on the team, and just... everything. It inspires me so much. In fact, I plan on trying out for volleyball next year. I'll be on testosterone by then so hopefully I won't get fuckin bodied by all the transphobic white boys at my school :)
Anyway. Haikyuu's given me something irreplaceable, I finally get to experience that feeling I never got to, even if it's just an anime.
So yes, watch this anime. The original Japanese dub is awesome and the English dub is fucking hilarious. Seriously, watch this shit.
Fly high, Daichi... RIP to a real one"
9253,"# [~~~This review will contain Heavy Spoiler for the show!~~~]()

Some context before I jump in. (Just doing this to show how good this show was)
Back before I watched Steins;Gate I used to not be interested in Anime, I loved Visual Novels though (Mainly Katawa Shoujo and DDLC). I was looking for more VNs to play when I heard about ""Steins;Gate"", the visual novel that was amazing. I didn't have the money to buy it at the time and the idea of it seemed really appealing to me so I decided to watch the show and my god has it changed me and my likes.

[(MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
To summarise, the story focuses on a group of friends who discover a time machine that can send e-mail into the past which allows them to alter the future, later on the crew discovers how to send memories back. Each alteration of the past has a huge impact on the future, from Luka turning into a girl to Akihabara becoming a boring old town.

Along the way they look into SERN, an organization with several rumours about them experimenting with black holes and time travel, they find out that they did infact manage to somewhat send people back in time. Soon after finding that out SERN storms in, murdering Mayuri, a childhood friend of Okabe. This moment is the most pivotal moment, the show undergoes a change in genre and atmosphere, from happy group of friends tinkering with electronics to tear producing, adrenaline inducing story of Okabe and his quest to find a World Line in which both his childhood friend (Mayuri), and ~~crush~~ Assistant (Kurisu) live. He tries over and over to save them both only to end up in spiral of depression as he has to work harder for to achieve this goal. (I'll leave out the last few scenes but you get the jist, right?)

We got to see a really interesting story, one that to this day manages to be one of the best stories out there. The way the world got built and the characters developed, it all felt really real, like they were non-fictional friends but animated.

[CHARACTERS:]()
All of the characters found in Steins;Gate are amazing and well written.
I'll only be talking about my 3 favourite characters but all of them are great and feel realistic.
Okabe Rintarou, the mad scientist and a chuunibyou, despite me disliking his chuuni side I grew attached to it. He acted like he didn't care about anyone and anything but as the show progressed we got to see how he does care deeply about his friends.
Makise Kurisu, best girl for years, she is clearly a tsundere. I didn't know what to think of her character, when I watched the show I was new to the terms and stuff so I was not used to this loving yet aggresive type, though that being said she was an amazing member of the show!
Shiina Mayuri, a cute ball of sunshine, she is not as clever so she doesn't further the plot of the time machine scenes but she fills an important role in the show, so 1. Stress relief. When she enters the scene, you know its gonna be good and fun :D 2. A turning point for the story which grasps me everytime and hooked me in so much.

[ART/ANIMATION:]()
Steins;Gate has a great artstyle. Its not the best looking show out there, yeah. But its very pleasant to look at, does not take anything away from the show at all. Steins;Gate being quite a dark and mysterious show the colour pallete is more on the washed out and drab, which adds more to the whole mystery of the show.
The show has really nice and smooth animations, as I said with the art, this makes it very nice on the eyes I was not tired of watching it or had any complaints when I binged it in 2 days.

[MUSIC:]()
The overall soundtrack of Steins;Gate is amazing. Loved it.
Each and every song fits so perfectly with the vibe of the show and the scene its playing in. I even listen to it while doing work (I'm listening to it now even!). Very catchy indeed.
The Opening! The most awesome part of the music topic. Its one of the best ones out there, everytime I hear it I get so nostalgic. Its catchy, plus the lyrics are also very good, they give insight into the world and story that will uneveil itself.

[OVERALL OPINION:]()
If what I said above make you think I loved this show so much then let me repeat.
I loved it, so much. The story, characters, everything tied in to so well creating one of the best shows I have seen to this very day.
This was a very great introduction into Anime. I recommended everyone to check this series out or even pick it up again if you dropped it due to the slow start. 

It really is worth watching.

(Note - This is my first review, I hope y'all liked it. I'll write more in the future and try to improve on each and everyone I write!)"
