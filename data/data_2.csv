4081,"The series follows the everyday life of a young, fifteen-year-old boy named Natsume Takashi who inherited the ability to see and interact with yōkai, or spiritual and supernatural beings, from his late grandmother Reiko. As we tag along for the journey, we will witness him experience many things, such as loneliness, bullying, loss, friendships, the burden of responsibilities he never asked for, and much more. The series is filled with breathtakingly contemplative motifs that tackle serious elements with heart-warming empathy and grace, as well as the bitterness of reality. It instils into the watcher as much sorrowful emotional depth as it does feel-good, fluffy ones because at it’s core the series is built upon the fundamental beliefs of Japanese Buddhism: that life is suffering and that everything in life is impermanent.

The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, regardless of the specific sect, all focus on the fact that life is suffering in one way or another, and that that suffering isn’t a permanent entity. They include:

1.)  Life is Suffering, whether that suffering is subtle or more prominent, it’s always there. Even when you feel completely happy and at ease, beneath that joy, there will be an air of suffering to one degree or another.

2.)  The Causes of Suffering almost always stems from craving and fundamental ignorance. People suffer because they are unable to see that we are not separate, independent individuals that leaves no effect on others around us; there’s this delusion of ego that we focus in on that is selfish.

3.)  The End of Suffering arises when we realise that suffering is inherently temporary, like clouds that pass over our heads in the sky. Even though the clouds are always there, they are constantly moving, changing, and shifting.

4.)  The Path is just living as a decent and ethical human being. Learning to be wiser about the decisions that we make and the negative emotions that we use to inflict pain and suffering upon others.

In season one of Natsume Yūjinchō (the Romanised version of the Japanese title), we are introduced to these precepts, particularly the first one, very early on. We see it in Natsume himself as he struggles with terrible loneliness and the fear of abandonment due to his special abilities. People see him as strange and weird and constantly make fun of him for being an eccentric outsider whose family doesn’t want him (schoolmates) or they hand him off to the next family willing to take him in so they don’t have to deal with a bizarre orphan kid (relatives). This is the epitome of prominent suffering. The kid is also constantly being chased by scary monsters and he has no idea why. The concept of joy is virtually alien to him.

When he encounters Madara, otherwise known as Nyanko-sensei, they formulate an accord due to certain circumstances. However, no one could ever have imagined that this simple contractual relationship would turn into a powerful symbol of everlasting friendship that would eventually cause them to Enlighten one another.

In the second percept, Buddhists learn that suffering is caused from desire, or cravings. One of the things that Natsume yearns for more than anything else is acceptance. He wants to be accepted by a family and finally have one to call his own, and he wants to be accepted by people around him so he’ll know what it’s like to have friends. Over time these wants fall into the territory of unfulfilled dreams. Having been neglected and hated, he concedes to the fact that there are some things he can’t have in life. His acceptance is the third noble truth. By acknowledging that he does suffer and that suffering is just a part of life, he was finally ready to learn what it felt like to end his suffering. Enter Madara.

Through their accord, they begin to live together and spend most of their waking time with one another. Through everyday interactions of walking to school or sharing meals, an intimacy between them starts to take root. It is one of compassion, understanding, and respect. Slowly, like those shifty clouds that I mentioned earlier, Natsume’s loneliness and longing start to wither away. There is a comfortable companionship that fulfils the emptiness and the ache within his heart. They then began their journey with Noble Truth Number Four: being better, wiser individuals.

Natsume’s wisdom stems from his interactions with other yōkai. The deeper his understanding of suffering and its many forms becomes, the more that he learns and grows as a person; the more that he realises the world isn’t about “I” or “me,” it’s about the people—living and corporeal, and non-living and non-corporeal—that inhabit the world together. The very same can be said about Madara. Through watching Natsume’s compassion at play in situations where his (Madara’s) way of dealing would be a quick and decisive one, he becomes enlightened to the human condition of suffering and mind-blowing ideal of mercy and forgiveness and trust.

Throughout the series, we encounter various yōkai, one after another, who also encapsulate the Buddhist ideals of Suffering and Impermanence, it’s not jut limited to our two main characters. It is quite literally in every episode with every arc that is presented to us, thus making it the basic foundation of every other theme and motif to follow suit.

Hishigaki was a very gentle and caring yōkai, as well as a terribly lonely one. Then one day she met Reiko and suddenly she didn’t feel as alone anymore. When Reiko leaves, Hishigaki is left waiting for a very, very long time. When she stumbles across Natsume, mistaking him for Reiko, she comes to learn that Reiko has passed. Hishigaki’s loneliness lasted for a horribly long time, but it wasn’t permanent. It came to an end, unfortunately so did those moments of reprieve that she felt. Hishigaki is also a prime example of suffering to the extreme because when her loneliness did return, it consumed her.

Hinoe would be another great example that follows in the same line as Hishigaki. Hinoe holds on to a single hairpin with such vehement adoration. When the hairpin gets stolen, Hinoe is utterly devastated. That small item is a reminder to Hinoe of something very precious that she lost; a keepsake of the impermanence of life, death, and even affection. After Reiko assists Hinoe, she comes to love Reiko very dearly, which once again changes many years later when she encounters Natsume.

Lastly, as far as yōkai goes, there is Madara, or Nyanko-sensei. His past is mostly a mystery for the vast majority of the series. The only things that a person can truly gauge about him is that he shares a similar loneliness with Natsume, as well as a demeanour in which he wishes to protect himself from emotional heartache. He keeps everyone at a distance to a certain point. The suffering he feels is very self-inflected, at least in regard to the chains he has around his heart. But the more time he spends with Natsume and the more people and yōkai that they help, the warmer and kinder he becomes, at least towards his human companion. That misery and isolation that he underwent for who knows how many years, was ending. The tides of suffering shifted. He learned that while it is an essential part of existence—supernatural or natural—there are many sides to it, and not all of them have to be forever.

Natsume’s Book of Friends is my favourite slice-of-life serial of all-time and it forever shall be. Watching this series, specifically as a Buddhist, I grew to love and respect it for the wisdom that laces every chapter and every episode. Additionally, it helped me develop a deeper and sincerer appreciation for things such as friendship, family, compassion, companionship, and the power of pacifistic and selfless co-existence—elements that I take with me everywhere outside of the vibrant animation and soulful instrumental music of the anime, or the intricate and stunning designs of the manga. The lessons taught and the knowledge obtained are gems that I have never received from anything else that I have ever seen or read. Natsume’s Book of Friends has shown me that, yes, life is jam-packed with suffering and pain and sorrow, but it doesn’t last forever, and that gives me more hope and inspiration than I could ever ask for.

10 outta 10."
151384,"My review cannot do this movie justice but let's try.

The First Kiss That Never Ends, a rom-com story title can never go any raw than that. This arc is widely believed to be the best and where Kaguya-Sama truly reached its peak and that is what I believe too. When I first read the manga, I was genuinely in shock at how this manga could portray the theme of ""Persona"". We all hide our true selves in front of our loved ones, friends, and even family members but a relationship with the love of our lives could never work if we never show our ""perfect"" side and also our weak vulnerable self and that is the main conflict for both Shirogane and Kaguya which takes place directly after the ultra-romantic confession.

This was the arc that made me truly in love with Kaguya-sama and the way how A-1 adapted previous seasons with gorgeous visuals, symbolisms, and the directing as a whole made me have high hopes for the movie. I dare say that this movie suppressed the manga for me and it's crazy for me to admit that because of how I hold this manga in high esteem. Despite knowing that the staff would go all the way out for the Kaguya anime, I still managed to gasp in awe in the second half of the movie. They elevated everything with breathtaking visuals ESPECIALLY the hospital scene. The comedic timing in the series has improved massively even though that was one of its strongest points. 

 Now, Kaguya and Shirogane.

She is a victim of her surroundings and that leads to the creation of an airtight persona that protects her real self. One thing though, she is not suffering from a disassociative personality disorder and that much is confirmed in the manga. But the fact remains that her mask is painfully dense that it can be fully seen as a different personality altogether. Her original self as we know in the series gets very carried away easily but Ice Kaguya is the one that thinks of the future and thinks things through properly and in a fight with her other personalities, Ice Kaguya awakens.

 Shirogane, on the other hand, strives to be perfect in any way he can be after his traumatic childhood and work himself till death. If not, no one would love him and he will be deemed worthless by himself. He has shown all his ugly flaws to Fujiwara, especially in the previous seasons but Kaguya never sees any of that. 

In the end, both of them are scared to reveal their true pathetic selves, and both of them have the right and good reasoning to conceal them. Despite that, both of them also know that their relationship won't work unless they lay bare naked of who they truly are. They know they have to be accepting of themselves and others but of course, it is easier said than done.  

Comes as the final act of the movie, arguably one of my favorite moments in the entire series where they finally confront what it means to reveal their true persona to each other and be an ordinary, flawed high-school couple and I find that very romantic in a sense where it contrasts the finale of S3 and that's beautiful. 

To sum it up, getting to watch Kaguya on the big screen was an opportunity I am grateful for. A perfect adaptation that went way beyond is what I'd been expecting and they delivered.  The tone, atmosphere, ost, voice acting, visuals, directing, and everything you can think of honestly I'm no animation expert. The decision to make this arc a movie was the right choice because the week wait in a series would kill off the vibe that they are trying to go for. The character development is of course phenomenal and this is just the beginning. 

Perfect movie, perfect adaptation, would rewatch this countless times."
2476,"Spoiler warning for School Days, though I don’t really feel like putting this because the less people that see this utter shit, the better

img520()

I’ll give School Days one thing before I tear it a new one. A show this goddamn bad has no right having music this good. For whatever goddamn reason, School Days has one of the better OPs I’ve heard, to the point where I couldn’t consistently skip it. I also enjoyed the first ED quite a bit. In general, the music sounded pleasant. It didn’t really fade in the background and was quite infectious. Maybe the songs are straight from the visual novel because they seem to be made to be looped. 

As for the art, it’s not...terrible. At worst, it’s a bit mediocre, with nothing jumping out at you. The eyes are gigantic and noses are nigh-nonexistent, making the characters look like they're from a Drawing Anime 101 book (C’mon, you know what I’m talking about). Not only does this make School Days characters not stand out compared to other anime characters, but they don’t stand out next to one another. There were points when I could not tell characters apart and became confused because I thought one character was saying something instead of another. It doesn’t help that everyone’s in uniforms and they all sport realistic hairstyles and colors.

Now onto the story. Here’s a little secret: in general I couldn’t give less of a fuck about an anime’s art or music. If it’s particularly phenomenal like [Princess Kaguya’s](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/The-Tale-of-The-Princess-Kaguya/) art or [Cowboy Bebop’s](https://anilist.co/anime/1/Cowboy-Bebop/) music, then sure, I’ll give it points for it, but music or art or shotting or whatever the hell else generally won’t make me dislike a visual work. Does that make me shallow? Sure, I don’t give a flying fuck. School Days is terrible because of its sequence-of-events-I-barely-am-willing-to-call-a-story.

Yeah, I’m throwing my desire to be “professional” out the window. School Days has boiled and melted my skin, my outer layer, revealing the angry man beneath. I can’t begin to articulate my utter and total loathing towards this show. 

img520()

I was introduced to School Days a couple of months ago at an anime club meeting. Members who were interested were supposed to binge the show as we ate pizza and riffed on it. It was supposed to be an infamous, so-bad-its-good type of show. They talked about how the last episode was postponed and in its place was a thirty-minute clip of a boat, said incident having now become a meme. We watched the first episode. It was kind of bad, in a cliche, predictable sort of way, but nothing terrible. The other members got bored and decided to skip to the last episode. I decided to leave before that happened. As I walked back to my dorm, I stewed in my annoyance. I was so prepared to experience a bad anime with others, yet they wanted to skip to the end without any context. I felt robbed.

Time continued to pass. School Days continued to gnaw at me. They said it was bad. How bad? They said it was funny. How funny? More and more, the show floated in my head, wracking my brain with possibilities. What exactly made the show so infamous? It was only twelve episodes long. I could binge it. Easily. So I did. I binged it. Curiosity got the best of me. And you know what they say, curiosity killed the cat. And it did. School Days killed me. It took all of my nine lives and then some, just stabbing me over and over again with its terribleness. I’m dead and I’m furiously typing this to warn other wayward anime watchers to avoid this garbage show and to those who already have started the journey to abandon hope all ye who enter here. 

A lot of people get School Days wrong. It’s not so-bad-its-good, it’s just bad. Really, really fucking bad with next-to-no redeeming qualities.

School Days is about a high school student named Makoto Itou, a shy and perverted boy who has a crush on his classmate, Kotonoha Katsura (she’s his phone wallpaper) but can’t spit out his feelings towards her. His best friend, a somewhat abrasive girl named Sekai Saionji, decides to play matchmaker and gives her friend a hand in asking his crush out. Makoto and Kotonoha begin going out, but Makoto soon discovers that dating Kotonoha isn’t as easy as his fantasies would lead him to believe....

img520(/revision/latest?cb=20120122063446)

And you know the really, really fucked up thing about my experience watching School Days? I have to admit that it got me at first. It really fucking did. Some annoying characters aside, the anime seemed to be a realistic depiction of two young people drifting apart due to different expectations in a relationship. Makoto wanted to get physical, but Kotonoha wasn’t ready/willing to go that far. This was episode four or so. It wasn’t happy, but relationships aren’t sunshine and rainbows and I respected that the anime depicted the end of one in a respectful way. Makoto was a horndog, but at least he’d be able either grow as a person or find someone who…

img520(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20150818084602)

Oh, Sekai decides she’ll let Makoto fondle her as a form of “training.” 

Right, I glossed over something. At the end of the first episode, after helping set him up with Kotonoha, Sekai gives Makoto a big ol’ smooch. So it’s clear that she likes him. But she doesn’t tell him and he doesn’t seem to know because reasons. And the two decide to fool around while not having Makoto break up with Kotonoha because reasons. Oh, and it doesn’t just stop at these two.

School Days holds the distinction of having bland characters that will still piss you off all the same. Taisuke, the sole other male character, acts the exact same way as Makoto. All the female characters are either cheaters, busy-bodies, just plain bullies, or all of the above. One of Sekai’s defining traits in the early episodes was that she was abrasive (getting angry at Makoto for problems completely born out of Kotonoha’s shyness) and a busy-body. These traits disappear as soon as she gets with Makoto, though she’s still an ass by helping Makoto cheat on his girlfriend. Oh, and if for some reason you like those traits, they just get transferred to other characters like Otome and Setsuna. 

img520()

You wanna’ know who does have unique and defined character traits? Kotonoha. You know who isn’t an asshole? Kotonoha. You know who gets shit on by every single person in the cast, being bullied, cheated on, and fucking gaslit throughout the series? Kotonoha. So you know who I was rooting for the entire time to get a gleam of happiness, or at least retribution? Ko to no ha. 

If I’ll give this story written by a-non-union-writer-whose-dismal-pay-is-still-somehow-too-high-for-this-nice-boat-crash-of-a-show one thing, it’s that it’s provocative. Even if the bodies didn’t start hitting the floor until the final episode, it wasn’t boring. Now I’m not a biologist, but there’s something that happens to your brain that makes it impossible to be bored while your blood is boiling. The shit that Kotonoha (and to a lesser extent, Sekai once she discovers that Makoto has started cheating on her) goes through is hard to watch. To wit, she’s cheated on by Makoto and when she discovers this, she loves him too much to end things; people keep saying she isn’t really dating Maktoto but when she asks him, he says they are, effectively gaslighting her; she’s viciously mocked and bullied; and she’s raped. And this isn’t brought the fuck back up again. And the sick bastard who does the deed gets off scot-free. And this is done just for goddamn shock because with fanservice galore, it’s clear that School Days knows nothing of tact.

img520(

Honestly, it was a good call not having us watch School Days, because it’s just plain not enjoyable to watch. It’s hard to riff on, just get angry at, and with friends, you’ll just have a bunch of angry people. Someone said that this anime’s writing, even if inflammatory, is technically sound. I have to agree with this since it proves my point. You can’t really laugh at things because things aren’t unintentionally funny, just often intentionally meant to make you pissed off. Maybe you could laugh at the increasing ridiculousness of the plot, with women who showed no interest in Makoto suddenly dropping their panties, cementing this as a harem. Still, those moments aren’t frequent enough to make this an enjoyable group watch. Everyone will probably leave just feeling bitter.

Then there’s option of just skipping to the ending, which many consider to be the best part of the show. I still wouldn’t recommend this, because if you do, you miss the buildup of shit that makes you go “just kill the fucker.” Paradoxically, if you do watch everything, you’ll go through an unenjoyable slog of anger. Basically, what I’m saying is don’t fucking watch School Days. I don’t give a shit how funny the meme is, nice boat just isn’t worth it.

Going for so many months without seeing it, I was spoiled a bit. I knew shit was going to go down, but not what, when, or where. The first half of the show already showed Kotonoha being treated shittily, so I was fully expecting her to pop off. At the end of episode six, chilling music played and Kotonoha discovered Makoto cheating on her. The shot jumped to blood red yarn and sewing needles. The creators’ intention was obvious. My girl was about to go yandere on their asses.

img520()

The infamously violent climax doesn’t come until episode twelve. We are treated to this scene only to be denied the natural resolution until the last minutes of the anime. If I wanted to be fucking blueballed, I’d edge to goddamn xnxx.com for two hours, not watch a shitty anime for over four. And I know what some dumbasses are saying, “but Pockey, foreshadowing.” No, you idiot, this isn’t foreshadowing, this isn’t a fucking “shadow,” this is so blatant that it’s the object that casts the shadow. It’s very clear what the scene implies, yet it’s postponed for far, far too long, creating an anime that’s largely unsatisfying.

Some say the anime’s good because it makes you angry. And fine, I like works that elicit feeling, but I don’t enjoy something that makes me this irate. And many people say the anime serves it’s purpose because Makoto’s an ass. Everyone’s an ass. And I don’t condone murder and even in a work of fiction, I don’t often give in to bloodlust. But you know what, I played into this anime’s fucking game. I wanted to comfort Kotonoha, but she’s a fictional character, so as replacement, I just wanted her to get the blood she deserved. I wanted a goddamn bloodbath, but since it’s Japan, she couldn’t C-------- the place, so I knew she’d have to use something like a knife. Good, it’ll be bloodier that way, they’d all fucking suffer. And if anyone has read my reviews (oh who the fuck am I kidding, no one reads my reviews), you’d know that [having](https://anilist.co/review/4892) [prior](https://anilist.co/review/4210) expectations often bites me in the ass. And it did here. Because Kotonoha isn’t the one to kill that cheating, disgusting fucker, Makoto. She only kills one person, and it’s not even her fucking rapist, Taisuke.

img520()

And I lose a little bit in faith in humanity when I see people honest to fucking God defending, this shit, saying it’s a deconstruction of the harem genre, saying it’s realistic. No. For fucking one, harem anime usually operate by having a male be vied for by multiple women, while single himself. Saying the cheating Makoto deconstructs harems and show how bad they are is disingenuous, because in a harem, no one would be actually dating someone. If they did, the harem would dissolve, which brings me to my second point. In a harem, no one would really be satisfied being second fiddle, unlike School Days where most of the members are fine being glorified sex toys. And again, everyone is an asshole. It doesn’t show how the protagonist of a harem is unlikable, everyone is unlikeable for no goddamn reason. Not to mention, the harem elements come in so late to the point where it came to a shock that the anime was going a harem route. If it really was about “deconstruction,” harem elements would come sooner.

And let’s say this anime is subversive. Let’s say it’s unique. Let’s say it’s a deconstruction. Cool, maybe it’s uniqueness will give it some points, but ultimately, I just don’t give a fuck. I don’t give a shit how unique your motherfucking show is if it’s not entertaining. Because call me unrefined or whatever, but that’s ultimately why I watch shows, why I read books, why I play video games. To be entertained, to discover new worlds. Maybe I really do watch anime as a form of escapism because I don’t take precious time out of my day to be angry. To be disgusted. To want to see children fucking murder one another. I really can’t see the supposed quality in School Days, and even if I could, I couldn’t give it props without still acknowledging it as the assault to my sensibilities that it is. It’s an affront to entertainment and maybe people are just too into the fucking meme to see that. It’s not so bad it’s good, it’s just terrible. And it’s not good in its uniqueness. Fuck that. Give me something unique that’s actually enjoyable. I wouldn’t enjoy a piece of shit just because it looks kind of like a famous person.

God, I need to wrap up. This anime is doing bad things to me.

img520(

I was at a bit of a loss as to what score to give this. I dislike this more than Gate, so I was considering bumping it up and giving this a four. But no. This doesn’t deserve a fucking four. Gate annoyed me, but School Days made my blood boil. This made me maniacally laugh. This made me clap to shit no stable person should clap at. This made me contemplate literally tearing my hair out. So, congratulations, School Days, to date, you’re my lowest-rated anime. Maybe soon people will stop bitching that I have too high of an average score. Take your goddamn three like a champ.



Fuck this dogshit anime.

Have a nice boat people, Pockeyramune is out.

21718,"Lost Butterfly is a nightmare. A violent, corrosive nightmare. Gone is the dread that Presage Flower bathed in, as terror strikes in its place. The Holy Grail War is no longer just contaminated, it's corrupted. All that's left to do is watch the fireworks as everything goes to hell.

Once the first scene of the movie finishes giving Shirou a nightmare reminiscent of the penultimate scene of Presage Flower, we start off on a delicate scene. This scene sets off Sakura and Shirou's tenuous character arcs for this movie, and these arcs allow these two characters to shine brighter than ever before. Shirou's attempts to be with Sakura and be a hero for her in the Holy Grail War without Saber to help him is his most compelling journey across the three Fate timelines. Rarely have we seen him so vulnerable, so determined to keep someone around, so enraged, and so scared. His dreams haunt him, and his enemies test his resolve for Sakura, both physically and emotionally. Sakura's descent of slowly succumbing to her base desires and losing control of her powers and mental state was, at times, even more exciting. 

No scene encapsulates her journey better than a sequence halfway into the movie where she is seemingly transported to a fantasy land, with adorable woodland creatures playing with her. As she walks along into a castle, we see some of those same creatures along a river, already having drowned. By the end, she is flicking them to death for candy, in a room full of paintings resembling her memories and insecurities, before the film cuts back to reality. 

The rest of the characters are generally decent. Rin coming to terms with the circumstances Sakura is in considering their origins makes for a compelling element to her character. Her tsundere moments are also few, mild, and amusing. It's also nice to see Ilya coming to terms with issues regarding her dead father. Shinji somehow becomes even more repulsive than his previous incarnations and seeing him get utterly destroyed was priceless. My only real complaint, as well as the last thing I will mention regarding the characters who are ho-hum beyond this point is that Taiga feels almost like an afterthought. She appears for one small scene towards the back-end of the movie to talk to Sakura and inadvertently clear something up for Ilya, and that's it. Given that she also lives in the place Shirou and Sakura are at, you'd think she would at least be in the background for a few of the more lighthearted scenes.

Yes, those exist in this movie. The film's crazy, not miserable.

Before praising the audiovisuals, I feel I need to go over a few other praises and problems with this movie. Lost Butterfly is much better paced than Presage Flower since it doesn't have a newcomer-repellant montage at the opening credits of the movie, and it doesn't have multiple false endings. The lore is still convoluted, with weird explanations regarding ""non-canonical/non-traditional"" servants and the answers to what that shadow from the first movie was. There is also one scene that is rife with gaudy melodrama, that being the second major interaction between our two protagonists early into the movie. Lastly, while I understand that the film has its fair share of sexual content that's meant to be perceived as uncomfortable, it does get a bit gratuitous at times. There are a few minor complaints that would delve into spoiler territory, so I'll leave those at the door.

Lost Butterfly might honestly be the most gorgeous Fate installment to date. There are a few small moments that look a tad off but they're nothing compared to the overwhelming might of this film's visuals. The CGI is better integrated than the previous film, only being used for a few decent CGI cars in the beginning and for some shots of the environment during the Berserker and Saber Alter fight. Said fight is where the visuals reach their peak, with one of the most lavishly animated fight scenes of the year. No expense was spared on showing every detail of the carnage caused by Berserker and especially Alter's attacks. It honestly rivals the best fights of Mob Psycho 100 II, which came out in the same season as this movie. It’s almost indescribable. Even outside of this fight, the rest of the movie and its fight scenes are still as detailed as you would expect from a high-end Ufotable production. 

Yuki Kajiura's OST is as good as ever. The one thing I noticed is that there were more chimes in some of these tracks compared to any of her other soundtracks. It continues to suit the Fate franchise perfectly, so there's not much that needs to be said if you've heard her work for the previous film and for Fate/Zero. The film's ending theme, ""I beg you"" by Aimer, is probably Aimer's best anime song to date. It exemplifies the somber terror the film embodies, fitting Sakura's character arc both with its tone and its lyrics. 

While not the pinnacle of the Fate franchise, Lost Butterfly is an exciting descent into madness. It is easily the most brutal installment since Zero, and somehow the best-looking entry in the series. This film also provides the most compelling versions of Shirou and Sakura to date. As the terror subsides with the end of this movie, all that's left is hope. I pray that Spring Song caps this trilogy off well.

20593,"Did you notice when the last time Suruga had a major role prior to this arc was? The arc she was introduced in, Suruga Monkey. Meaning that in between, we’ve had 46 episodes almost entirely devoid of her, only making occasional minor appearances.

I missed her greatly is what I’m trying to say.



Now she is finally back to the spotlight in Hanamonogatari, also known as the Suruga Devil arc. The second stand-alone arc of the series following Nekomonogatari: Kuro.

As a big fan of the character, this season lived up to my expectations wonderfully. I would say that it even surpassed them, managing to deliver a heartfelt, touching story of two individuals caught up in their own fears.

Hanamonogatari very gracefully unravels the insecurities of its lead, Suruga Kanbaru, in a slow methodical manner. I’ve heard some call it boring, but I found it really engaging. It is one that lets the viewer really sink into it. A quieter arc than most of Monogatari’s. Even the dialogue, so notoriously quirky and bizarre, is significantly more subdued here. Don’t get me wrong, it still carries plenty of that trademark Monogatari quirkiness. It’s just not nearly as overflowing with it as most of the other instalments, and I’d say it works very well for what it is trying to accomplish. A slightly ethereal, lonely atmosphere, which I find irresistible.



Nowhere does this shine more than in a certain scene towards the arc’s third act where, after certain shocking and very upsetting things are revealed to her, Suruga decides to go for a run in the middle of the night, which leads to one of my favourite moments in the entire series. Suruga runs, as she is unsure if what else to do. Runs through the empty town after dark, then by the sea, eventually leaving the town completely behind and entering the vast countryside, with none but her around, like she is the only person left in the whole world. It’s an incredible sequence, in which the cinematography, the music, the backgrounds all come together in a stunning way to highlight the main character’s feelings of uncertainty and loneliness, in a perfect encapsulation of the entire arc and its themes.

This hypnotic pace and atmosphere in addition to some well-done twists, a clever climax, and a very interesting resolution, all work together to make Hanamonogatari a masterpiece of storytelling and tone.



Characterisation-wise, this arc is just as good. Here we see a side of Suruga that we have only seen a little of prior. This is probably the most serious and contemplative she gets for the whole series, as her insecurities slowly begin to overwhelm her. She fears what the future might bring, grappling with the anxiety of making the wrong choice, sending her down a wrong path in life, and now these fears are bringing her to stagnation. They are only made worse by the fact that she does already have a history of making awful decisions, disastrous in consequences for both her, and people around her. It feels like an unexpected, yet still very natural progression for her character from the point that we left off with her in Bake and Hana does an excellent job fleshing her out further.



Suruga’s foil in this arc is Rouka Numachi, her childhood basketball rival, back in her life, as she now operates under the alias of “Lord Devil”, hearing out and solving the problems of her customers for initially unknown reasons. Rouka is a highly intriguing character in her own right. She has a fairly enjoyable personality, with her seemingly laid-back attitude and teasing nature, but this is Monogatari, so of course, there is a darkness lurking beneath this surface. Her dynamic with Suruga is fascinating due to the parallels between them, and how, despite being seemingly very different, in just how many ways their ways of thinking, and emotions overlap. Without spoiling anything, the way Rouka currently thinks and views herself and those around her can essentially be seen as something of a cautionary tale for Suruga. A deeply sad picture of what can become of a person when they are consumed by regret of the past, and fear of the future. For those reasons, and one more which I will not reveal here, Rouka ends up being one of Monogatari's most tragic characters, and a very impactful, memorable presence throughout the arc.



The other characters appearing throughout all have fairly minor roles, but they all perform well in these roles. Like some of the familiar faces from the other Monogatari instalments, as well as a new character, Seiu Higasa, Suruga’s friend from the basketball team. I quite liked her in her few minutes of screentime, her personality being this mix of cheerful and peppy, while also being a bit sassy, as she is shown to playfully insult Suruga to her face, without even the slightest change to her happy-go-lucky demeanour or way of speaking. It’s nice that they gave even such a minor character a little bit of a memorable personality.



The visuals are, as is part of the course for Monogatari, excellently done. As implied earlier, they do reel it in a bit for this arc when compared to the rest of the series in terms of the sheer visual insanity, but once again, it works incredibly well, as the visuals on display are still very creative and appealing to look at. Not to mention, accompanied by some of that trademark lively, smooth Monogatari animation, when it is needed. I will also mention that this one has some of my favourite backgrounds in the series, especially during the scenes taking place during night-time (like the previously mentioned night-run sequence).

The music is also very good, nicely complimenting the arc’s slower, more subdued tone, and the opening theme, The Last Day of My Adolescence is easily among my personal favourites. It’s a great song, which manages to sound both exciting and fun, as well as melancholic and nostalgic, invoking a strange bittersweet feeling that is hard to really describe.

The voice acting is as great as ever, with Miyuki Sawashiro's performance as Suruga easily living up to the standard set by the other voice actors in Second Season, and absolutely nailing the new aspects of her character that Hanamonogatari goes into, and Kana Asumi does an excellent job as Rouka, perfectly portraying the the character's playfulness, while also giving her this tired quality to her voice. She gets across the sadness underneath Rouka's confident smirk very skilfully. The supporting cast all do very well too in the smaller roles that they have here.

Overall, Hanamonogatari stands strong as, in my mind, one of Monogatari’s absolute best. It is a touching, clever character study, encompassing all of the wider series’ strengths, while also being quite different from all the other entries in the best way. An underrated unique little gem, which ended Monogatari’s stellar Second Season on an incredible high note."
111790,"Haikyuu is a great series, I like it. Honestly. But this OVA feels really rushed compared to the quality of the main show.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
This little pits  Nekoma High School vs Fukurodani Academy and also Nohebi Academy.

Nekoma lost against Fukorodani and then had to go against Nohebi, which is by far the worst team I've seen thus far in the series. Really dislikes all of the under-handed moves they pulled off just cause they wanted to win, like dude pleas win fair and square you big dummy dum dum.

Anyway...

The matches were really fast. Like lightspeed fast, I blinked and Nekoma was already defeated. I was honestly quite dissapointed by this fact, I wanted to watch the characters grow but when the match was that quick it was hard to actually put in some character development plotlines.




[CHARACTERS:]()
So normally I would just go over the new additions since ""I already reviewed them in previous submissions"" but I have yet to review Haikyuu so yeah, thats cool, or something.

Anyway.

Kenma - He is cold and tactical, he does his moves without hesitations because he already calculated them like 10 000 times already.

Testurou - He is quite comedic but he gets the job done, he is a great leader who alwasy tries his best to pull the team together. Great characters, especially when we get a match and we need a comedic relief.

Lev - He is new, he is still learning the ins and outs of Volleyball. He is very tall, he only this OVA realises that the team works together to win. Damn Levochki. You go my dude!

Bokuto - He is the wackiest characters out of all of them. He is not the brightest star in the universe to be honest, but when he gets in to groove he is unstoppable.

Akaashi - Same team as Bokuto but he's more calm, just like Kenma. He is tactical, especially when Bokuto is not in the right mindset

Alisa Haiba - The MVP of the OVA, every time she appears my mind relaxes. Such a pure existence.

There were a few cool character building moments but in total nothing that much to write home about. Yeah I get that this is an OVA but my dude, come on. This is marked as a ""sequel"" thus I want something to digest and not just watch meh animated scenes and next-to-none content.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
This, and the fast matches, was the main reason for the low score. The animation feels meh.
There is much more CGI and all of the spikes felt much more weak then the previous seasons of spikes.
The reason I watch this show is to see all of the cool and very impactfull spikes and other such volleyball stuff and now that all of that is gone there is not much, not even any cool character development. Yeah there is the fact that Lev now knows how to work as a team and all but my dude, gimme more.




[MUSIC:]()
There is no OP or anythin' so there is nothing to write here, sadly.
The OST was, Haikyuu level...I suppose.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
This OVA is not that great. It is not bad, not bad at all don't get me wrong. But I like Haikyuu too much to let a drop in quality this bad to pass. I don't want the series to drop, thus far ""TO THE TOP"" is great but I swear to god if the series drops its quality to this I will riot."

[![image]()](https://anilist.co/anime/21495/Tanakakun-is-Always-Listless/)


""Tanaka-kun is Always Listless"" is about Tanaka-kun... being... listless.... All the time? I don't know why I even explained that since it's pretty clear, but there are few other things that also happens while he's being listless.
""Tanaka"" is the embodiment of laziness. Think of every trait you know about a lazy person, Tanaka has it. He's lazy, introverted and don't even care to do even the basic humans needs like eating. All he ever does and wants, is a peaceful lazy life where no-one & nothing can interrupt him from his listlessness. But alas, that's just a pipe dream since he always has his friend ""Ohta"" by his side. Ohta carries him around to school, Ohta helps him to eat hard-to-eat foods like fish, Ohta takes him to the doctor when he's sick, Ohta's strong, reliable, caring; to keep it in the words of Tanaka himself:
[![image]()](https://anilist.co/anime/21495/Tanakakun-is-Always-Listless/)
Apart from Ohta, there are other people who makes his life more miserable for him. They are:
1. ""Myano"". She is a cute & energetic chibi character whom you've probably seen in gifs like these;

[![image]()](https://anilist.co/anime/21495/Tanakakun-is-Always-Listless/)

Myano mistakens Tanaka's listeness & calmness with maturity and admires him. Myano wants to be a mature woman to become a worthy companion for the one she loves.

2. Then there's ""Echizen"" or cutely put ""Ecchan"". Ecchan is a delinquent, a rowdy tomboy who likes cute things, Ohta's childhood friend and (spoiler alert), is the one Myano's talking about. After finding that Myano admires Tanaka, Ecchan goes out her way and challenges him to prove his worth of being an ""admirable"" man, which as you can tell doesn't end the way she thinks.

3. And then there's ""Shiraishi"", the class rep and school idol. I think those words suffices her character but there's little more to her than just that. And by the end of her character episode, she ends up falling for Tanaka.

And there are other characters like, his little sister Rino (How do you think he can live without someone else?) and his other classmates who are aware of Tanaka's lazy life-style.

There are many things to write about the Anime like; the warm color pallet, cute art-style, gorgeous backgrounds, soothing OSTs and just the overall relaxing feel the show carries but what's really unique about the show is ""Tanaka"", our MC. Tanaka is pretty much the projection of our laziness, he highlights all the pointless problems lazy people will face; like not able to eat snacks just because they can't stretch their hand to grab them on table, sleeping while ignoring their own hunger etc, which is pretty accurate even if it's for comedic effects. He's a character who's deemed to fail as protagonist but what makes his character likeable, is how he's self aware of himself and this really shows during his conversations with other characters, whether it be comedic or serious. He doesn't have a character development but he has some level of character depth and understanding about his own flaws and about everyone around him.

The one and only big drawback this Anime has, is the romantic subplot between Shiraishi and Tanaka. The cute romantic relationship Shiraishi tries to build between herself and Tanaka comes in the way of the calm and relaxing theme of the show. It's cute and is definitely entertaining to watch but this romance is trying to build character growth (or development), that is forced on both the characters which feels a lot like nuisance than a cute romance. Not to mention, the Anime ended without any clear resolution of the romance and just stopped (A ""Go read the Manga"" ending).

Summary

This is a relaxing Anime with so much feel goodness that helps you just chill and might even make you fall asleep, as that's the aim of an Iyashieki Anime but suffers with unnecessary romance.

And finally, what I want to say is;
BE LAZY. LIVE CRAZY
Bye Bye

How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?

Written by [Razovy](https://anilist.co/user/Razovy/)

Working out... yeah... it ain't fun! I remember when I had to work out almost every single day for 8 years straight. At the time it didn't really bother me all that much because I was used to it, but ladies and gentlemen, after quitting and trying to go back to it recently... I just couldn't.
I used to play an amazing sport called Kickboxing and it required me to visit both the boxing-gym as the training-gym almost every single day. When I wasn't lifting weights I was either hitting someone in the face or getting knocked in the face (the latter being the least fun).

I recently picked up this anime and I was surprised about how well it described the ups and downs of training. Not only that, but there were tons of cute girls in it, even a boxing girl!

We start out with our main character Hibiki who is starting to put on a few. In complete disarray she joins a famous gym, meeting Akemi, the most famous girl in school. With the help of Machio, their trainer, Hibiki is determined to lose the extra pounds.


The Good
'How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?', besides being very funny, is genuinely educational. The exercises these girls have to do are very effective in real life as well!
The comedy and educational side of the show is great of course, but the real reason we tuned in every week is because of the wonderful characters. I'm a sucker for Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, and there are plenty to choose from in this anime. My favourites being the teacher (Tachibana Sensei) and Ayaka, the boxing girl. No matter who your favourite might be, I can ensure you that the dynamic between the characters will make you want to keep watching!


The Bad
Fortunately there isn't a lot to mention here. That doesn't make this the perfect show, not even by far! However, for an anime that knows its audience and tropes so well as this one, I feel like I should only judge it on the few shortcomings it had regarding it.
The main shortcoming is that although the story is enjoyable, there is nothing truly interesting about it. Is that necessarily wrong? Absolutely not: again, this anime knows its audience and a strong story isn't what keeps them showing up every week. It would be odd for me to start talking about character development and plot progression, as this is not what 'How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?' is aiming for.


Conclusion
I definitely like this show! It will never be my favourite anime, but I am planning on reading the manga. I hope that says at least something about how well the story makes you come back every time.
Should you watch it? Sure. It won't be mind-blowing but after a hard day of work this show is very enjoyable to watch. It mellows you out :)

Thank you very much for reading my review! I hope it was useful!"
21745,"This review is for the entirety of Owarimonogatari, not just the second half.

The beginning of the end and the end of the beginning. Owari starts and finishes the process of wrapping every single loose end from the first two seasons up in a neat package, and it does so wonderfully. Not only this, but it finally resolves one of the most important, gnawing question that has pervaded the entire series: who or what is Ougi Oshino? 

Owari starts off with a different approach compared to the previous seasons. Instead of coming up with some concept or ideal that Koyomi must challenge or come to terms with like in earlier portions or focusing on a singular heroine for an arc, Ougi Formula focuses on Araragi himself. The exploration into that repressed past helps us understand where everything started to go wrong for the main character. It also sets up the subsequent arcs: Sodachi Lost and Sodachi Riddle. Compared to previous arcs, these two stick out in stark contrast. There is no supernatural mystery, only a very real case of a horrible, depressing home life, a missed opportunity, and a ruined, sour relationship. It makes the reasoning behind Araragi's current behavior crystal clear by the end of it all, helping the viewer empathize with what was previously a bizarre, inexplicable desire to help anyone in need. Sodachi herself is interesting enough, save for the admittedly stereotypical conclusion to the mystery surrounding her. She manages to carry the arc almost on her own with her fantastic performance as such a deranged, emotionally devastated young girl. 

However, the real heavy hitters of Owarimonogatari begin with the midpoint: Shinobu Mail. This arc is nearly better than, if not as good as, Otorimonogatari and Koimonogatari. The final step for Shinobu’s character arc is finally reached, leaving her as easily the best-written, consistently fantastic heroine within the entire series. Suruga has a few fantastic scenes and interactions with Shinobu as well, giving her straight-forward mindset much more depth and clarity than ever before. Koyomi is given a minor spotlight for his reciprocation of love for Shinobu, despite their rocky past. It’s set in stone by this point in the series that the two have gone from what was basically a pair of reluctant, bitter partners to what is nearly a couple. 

Mayoi Hell takes a minor dip by making its contents revolve solely around explaining some prior events that may have been unclear or otherwise confusing. However, more interaction between Koyomi and Mayoi is never a bad thing. It may lack depth or importance some of the time, but it always manages to be more than entertaining. Hitagi Rendezvous, despite being little more than a date, is one of the best arcs in the series. The depth and passion that both Koyomi and Hitagi handle their blossoming relationship with goes to show just how seriously they’re taking it underneath the banter and jokes. The opening shows just how Koyomi views Hitagi, who once used to do little else besides insult and threaten him. Over the whole story Hitagi has softened up considerably, going from a prickly, almost sickeningly tsundere girl to a very feminine, intelligent and assertive, young lady. Her place as Araragi’s girlfriend was shaky at the beginning due to the presence of Hanekawa, but, by the end of it all, she is undoubtedly the woman for him.

At last, Ougi Dark. The penultimate arc lasts only three episodes, but the final two are incredible. Every character’s story, if left unfinished, is given a proper, satisfying ending within this final arc. The fully restored Kiss-Shot is offered exactly what she desires, Mayoi is given a place among the world of the living once more, Tsukihi defines what kind of person she sees herself as, Nadeko finds her way in life with the help of her friend, and, of course, Koyomi closes out his adolescence by confronting the enigmatic Ougi. The feeling of finality and completeness delivered by Ougi Dark is perfect in every sense. Koyomi finally ends his seasons-long character arc that began all the way back in Kizu, or even further back with his traumatic experience in high school. His incessant, selfless struggles come full circle, this final predicament teaching him to treat himself with the same care and respect as every one of his friends he rescued in the past. In the end, though, he reminds the viewer that Koyomi Araragi is Koyomi Araragi, even despite his newfound self-respect. Kiss-Shot's words from Kizumonogatari remain true despite everything that has happened to him, whether good or bad.

With this, the Monogatari series is, without a doubt, complete. Nothing more needs to be said or done. Nearly everyone within this diverse, incredible cast has been fleshed out wholly. Nisio Isin has more than proven himself as nothing less than an incredible writer in every sense. Monogatari never left me feeling bored or unimpressed. This talent for such rich, dense verbal interactions is something that I have rarely seen. Not only that, but the accompanying visuals, story, and characters keep the viewer captivated by just about everything that's happening on the screen. Monogatari will hold its spot as one of the most unique stories with an absolutely amazing, well-developed cast. I truly doubt any other series could hope to rise up to match such a captivating, character-driven ride through Koyomi's fantastical, yet difficult, third year.

However, I still look forwards to what Nisio has written for the later arcs. For now, though, I am content with every aspect of this incredible journey through Koyomi's tumultuous, fascinating teenage life."
143338,"The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten is a slice-of-life romantic-comedy light novel by [Saeki-san](https://anilist.co/staff/152558/Saekisan). It was adapted into a 12-episode anime series by Project No.9. The studio behind Higehiro, the story about a guy who picks up a high school runaway, who then cooks & cleans for him and tries to get his affection.



Our story here centers around the MC Amane Fujimiya who lucks out with the prettiest girl in his high school Mahiru Shiina, dubbed “Angel”. She volunteered to cook for him and clean his apartment.. pretty much becoming his housewife simply because he was a nice guy who gave her an umbrella. Or how the story portrays it she went “damn, bitch you live like this?” after seeing his dirty flat. 

There is no unique concept or gimmick, it is just two characters falling in love with no drama, what is not to like?

Romantic comedies are some of the hardest to review. What makes a good romantic comedy to you?
Is needles melodrama required? 
Does it need to be funny, but balanced enough for the romance to flow?
Does it just need to be “wholesome” and you’ll forgive any mediocre qualities as long as it makes you feel good?

All is fine, but I believe the core of a good romcom should be the main characters if you like the duo and enjoy their characterization, interactions, and progression.

img660()


Amane's characterization is that of an inferior version of [Miyamura ](https://anilist.co/character/66173/Miyamura-Izumi), a gloomy guy with trust issues, who looks hot if he fixes his hair. Slowly becoming more of an open person as he spends time with his wife. He has no real worth mentioning traits or hobbies that would make Mahiru fall for him, maybe his ordinariness is the key factor to her interest?
 
Meanwhile, Mahiru is the pretty perfect girl who is his shining beacon, helping Amane to change himself and herself for the better. Both become more open and true to themselves.

The show is not bad, it's just flavorless and mediocre. It's like your generic Isekai of the season, but here you have people gushing over it because it is so “wholesome”. Hey, I like wholesome stuff too! It's why I adore Kobayashi, but that show has so many other qualities to list.

The story here IS boring, it doesn’t help that a good 70% of the story literally takes place in Amane’s apartment (you’ll be seeing that drywall and couch a lot). The good thing I can say is that there is genuine progress in their relationship as the episodes go, and the way they form their relationship feels natural, somewhat.

The comedy isn’t over the top, but it’s not even funny. It all boils down to scenes of Amane letting out a sigh whenever the side characters act annoying. And speaking of the side characters, they're not worth mentioning at all.

img660()

The production values are average, the art style is okay and the animation is fine, I guess. The studio most definitely saved money and time by not drawing different backgrounds, considering how often they were in the apartment and on that stupid couch.

Should you watch Angel Next Door? If you’d like to watch a simple show, with no drama you can try it. Or invest in some wish fulfillment or wholesomeness then I guess why not?

For me, this show is as boring as Shikimori."
21455,"New Game! is fun and interesting look into the production of games. As a person who wants to work in the industry this was really a fun watch.

[PREMISE OF THE SHOW:]()
New Game! (as mentioned before) is a show about VIDEO GAME PRODUCTION, gamers rise up, we follow Aoba Suzukaze as she graduates from High School and joins Eagle Jump to become a Character Designer. 

She has her own reason for joining that studio, the reason being is that her favourite game was made there, Kou Yagami (Lead Character Designer) also works there. She is the inspiration for Aoba since she became Lead Character Designer early on.

We can see Aoba completing series of tasks to help her train herself in the new workspace. At this time we see many new character, may it be co-workers of Aoba or the higher ups as well. More importantly (to me) we get to see UMIKO AHAGON, one of the programmer members. My reason for liking her scenes is  because we always get to see her with a dead/depressed look on her face which is 10000% accurate to real life.

Later on in the show the team takes up making a new game (hehehehhe) we are introduced to the stress and pain of meeting deadlines and all of the ins and outs of the game development process. Fun stuff.




[CHARACTERS:]()
New Game! has many fun characters, you can find at least one that you'll relate to.
Aoba - The main character, she is filled with PASSION and DETERMINATION. She always tries to work hard and make sure she doesn't mess up, she is the ideal employee for any company.

Kou - Is the main inspiration for Aoba, she sleeps in the offices and works at 200% efficiency. She is an absolute beast when it comes to work. She is also quite laid-back, not that strict.

Hifumi - The pinnacle of the show, the cutest character the world has seen. She is quite shy and just wants to get along with people but can't really talk well in real life. For some reason its ALWAYS characters like this that just make my heart melt so much.

Umiko - The programmer, she is quite strict. Also very obsessed with military things she often participates in Airsoft activities and tries to make others join. Because she is the programmer that must mean she is quite dead/depressed looking when at work. 100% realistic.

There are few more characters that I liked but not as much as these lads. With some my opinion changes in the S2 of the show.
For example: Nenechi, at first I was not a huge fan of her, then sort of liked her few episodes later but in S2. Oh lawd. All you need to know for now is that she is the friend of Aoba from childhood who is in Uni.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
New Game! has...well the sort of animation you would expect from a SOL, smooth but not Nichijou level of animation budget. The art style is very bright which fits very well with all of the characters being all lively and stuff. Really makes the viewer relaxed.




[MUSIC:]()
This show has quite a soothing and fun OST. Feels really ""Game-ish"". Which... well...fits with the whole idea of the show.
The OP is fun, not the best I've heard. S2 OP is better in every aspect but I wouldn't call this one that bad. ED is kind of forgetable for me.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
All in all, New Game! is a SOL that tries to show you the Game Industry, of course its not VERY realistic (Its a show, its meant to be a way of escaping reality, not go back to it). But compared to other shows that try to show people working somewhere this one does manage to be a bit more connected to reality."

 img750( 

The Dangers in My Heart has had quite an interesting run, from a full on cringefest to an incredibly wholesome ride filled with great character growth, and moments that really dangered my heart indeed. Granted, I liked the show from the beginning even with how cringe some of it was, but fast forward to about nine weeks in, and this became one of the shows I looked forward to the most every week in the spring anime season. From being lukewarm on the protagonist, I definitely came around on him, and he became one of my favourite male characters of the season. If you want to watch two dumb, goofy characters get together in a very entertaining matter, I highly recommend this, as it’s one of my favourite new romcoms I’ve seen in quite some time.

Many of us have been a cringe teenager at some point right? Right? Come on, admit it. Kyoutarou Ichikawa, the male protagonist, is the embodiment of the cringe teenager personality. He’s edgy, a bit creepy, and wants to kill his classmates. What a guy, am I right? I fully expected his edginess to be the focus of the comedy, but he ended up being a much better protagonist than I ever thought he could be. While he is an incredibly chuuni character at the start, his edgy personality makes him quite a perceptive person, who’s very aware of what happens around him, and thus, that perceptiveness allowed him to help others, and it turns out, he’s quite an empathetic character who cares a lot for the people around him.

The word “Karte” in Japanese, refers to a patient’s medical record. If you’ve watched the show, I’m sure you noticed that the title of each episode has this word in it. In a way, it means with each passing episode, Kyoutarou is getting cured from his chuunibyou personality, little by little, and is maturing. In my eyes, it’s an awesome example of “show, not tell”, as there’s just a lot of nuance here, the development isn’t just thrown right in your face, but slowly, but surely, you see Kyoutarou opening up, talking to more people, becoming braver. The romcom genre is quite a saturated genre these days in anime, and it’s pretty rare to have a romcom protagonist grow in a very “earned”, and natural way without it being forced, so I appreciated his development a lot. Not to mention, it’s also pretty rare to see an extremely short male character compared to the female character, and I honestly liked that change of scenery. I love my short kings!

And then there’s Anna Yamada, the adorable glutton who seems to like the perfect girl to the people around her. In reality, she’s quite a doofus, and does some inexplainable things that leave me scratching my head sometimes. Kyoutarou puts her on a pedestal just like most of the boys would, but that tall pedestal slowly shrank and he wouldn’t have to look too high up anymore, though he still would need to look up at the towering girl that he likes. 

The direction is also top-tier, from the first-person angles, to the colour palettes, to the framing, and the soundtrack from Kensuke Ushio, a legend who has worked on big name anime such as “A Silent Voice”, “Ping Pong The Animation”, and even another anime this season in “Heavenly Delusion”, did a fantastic job on this show as well, as it only added to the important scenes and made it ever more impactful.

From the awkward exploration of teenage love, to the heartwarming moments that left my heart in danger, this is truly one of my favourite romcoms in recent memory in my eyes, and I only hope we get to see more of these two doofuses together making some great memories."
110350,"Only this first paragraph is really a review, the rest is musings about thoughts I have on the show. 

A very cool show with an interesting concept and some cool execution. 3 episodes toward the middle of the show made the whole thing worth watching, and the rest was pretty good as well. The music is great, the animation is a little wonky at times, especially on some of the faces, but the wells are interesting scenery and for the most part the show looks great. The plot and mystery are thrilling and kept me hooked, so much so that I watched the entire thing in a single 7 hour binge. I fizzle out of interest with a lot of shows, but this one held on to me from the beginning. There were a few things in the beginning that I found a little ridiculous and I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending, but all in all it's a good show. I would recommend this show to any fan of sci-fi detective series or movies, as well as people who want to watch some mystery and maybe even shed some tears along the way. Only spoilers from here on.

A few things in the beginning that made me incredulous mostly happened in the Gravedigger case. The whole idea of love and intent to kill being crossed seemed dubious at best and a bullet going through a pre-drilled hole in someone's head was completely ridiculous. Also having the Gravedigger happen to be at the copy cat, happen to be a drill hole victim, and happen to be spotted by Houndomachi is all very convenient. 

The middle: Narihisago in the second level id well was by far my favorite point in the series. The bittersweetness of him seeing his family again while convincing himself that this fake world was truly reality hit hard. The appearance of Kiki also deepened the mystery. When I was first watching it, I was hoping that her ESP was merely a part of id well and not the true mechanism of the show in reality. Although the basic principle of picking up intent to kill particles and building a map of the subconscious is pretty fantastical, I was hoping that it wouldn't lean on something purely supernatural. Also made the Minority Report similarities even more apparent. Fukuda's part in the story here is also very interesting. His arithmomania is revealed which ties together the hole in his head, his ineptitude as a pilot, and serves to further the plot.

The end: In the end, it is revealed that the chief is secretly John Walker, which isn't really that surprising since they had cut the list of suspects to people working at the Kura and in these types of movies it is almost always the old director. The reveal of his evil schemes and intentions was disappointing to me, but not show ruining. He claims to have done what he did out of his own sense of justice, but it isn't explained all that well. I was expecting a Minority Report esque ending where he created serial killers to justify the existence of his department, which I think could've been interesting. It is also unexplained if he actually used a cockpit to link Kiki to the serial killers or how that process works. Kiki turns out to be a powerful esper with some sort of telepathic ability that allows her to project her dreams on others as well as have people visit her dreams. In the show, serial killers come to her dreams every night and kill her, encouraged and aided by John Walker. However, it isn't really explained how the serial killers get linked to her mind. Couldn't theoretically anyone be projected into her dream? Narihisago visits her dream. Does everyone in the area have the same dream, but not notice? Earlier in the show when speculating about the identity of John Walker, the Wellside operators throw out that John Walker is manipulating the unconscious of the serial killers using a prototype of the machine. In the end, he is encouraging serial killers to act of their impulse in a shared dream with an esper. I'm not really sure if that's the same thing, but it seemed odd to me. Another problem I have is why does Momoki act so weird once arrested. He knows that he isn't John Walker unless he thinks perhaps he is but only unconsciously. But then he is also adamant that the pilots should be extracted and that the scenario is a trap. That situation was confusing. 

Another issue I had was with the death of Narihisago's family. The Challenger seems perplexed with the information that he would kill a 14 year old, and based on who the Challenger is, it does seem confusing. The Challenger is a man who wants to hit and wants to be hit. He's challenged a sumo wrestler and an mma fighter. Somehow he got his hands on Kiki, which if he plans to kill her seems like it would pretty directly interfere with Walker's plans. Challenging Kiki doesn't fit with his other known kills, but that can be attributed to a desire to actually fight her after fighting her in his dreams, which is alluded to when Kiki says that he is the type who also wants to be hit and feel it, which doesn't happen in the dream. But why would he kill Muku? And why would he do it in Narihisago's house as opposed to the arena beneath his house? Without explanation, the Challenger killing Muku seems very random and doesn't really fit. Houndomachi identifies that each of the killers have a specific way of killing that has a chance of getting the killer caught. I was hoping that it would be revealed that John Walker put the Challenger up to the task of killing Muku with the intention of turning Narihisago into a serial killer that kills serial killers as a way to wrap up Walker's own method of killing, which would be to make people do things that would eventually lead to them being killed, in this case serial killing. 

The serial killers are afraid of John Walker in their unconsciousness, but it isn't really developed why they would be afraid. Unless the unconsciousness is fearful of what Walker is turning them into, but that isn't entirely satisfying. I think John Walker could've been taken in a different direction that would've been more satisfying or could have been explained better. He is one of the main mysteries of the show and the reveal of who he is isn't entirely unexpected and his motivations aren't particularly intriguing nor does the whole situation actually make much sense. If they had gone a different route with him perhaps using a more sensitive version of the device that picks up intent to kill to identify potential killers and then somehow using cockpits and the well tech to manipulate their unconsciousnesses I think that would have been more interesting. I think in this version of the story Kiki isn't an esper. Instead, she could be someone from John Walker's past that he killed that he then shares with serial killers or perhaps she is John Walker himself. Maybe she convinces the serial killers to kill her when she is in their unconsciousness which unlocks their ability to kill. The person who convinced them to do it is lost in the unconscious, but the memory of her corpse remains. I think something like that could've been more intriguing and then it also doesn't have to rely on the mostly unexplained ESP of one girl.

The timeline is also a little confusing. Two and a half years ago, the Challenger killed Narihisago's daughter and captured Kiki. In reality, before he was apprehended, Narihisago's wife committed suicide. The investigation eventually learns who the Challenger is and Narihisago kills him to get revenge. Kiki is found in the basement, so apparently she has been in there a while at this point because she was in there before Muku was killed. Kinda confusing. Kiki is then at the hospital, and this is all before the founding of Kura. The doctor is then at the hospital with Kiki working on the well technology prototype, but before Kiki was in the hospital Walker influenced the challenger to become a serial killer, so he must have had some sort of version of the well tech earlier. Very perplexing. 

Although I have questions and the show didn't go in some of the directions I wanted, it was very entertaining and gripping. Because it was so gripping I've been thinking about it a lot, and that's probably a reason that I have developed so many questions about it. Sadly, I think many of my questions don't have answers that can be found within the show."
15315,"Just a heads up that this is my first review that hasn't been written in the notes in my anime list or on a small Discord I'm in with my friend's. Not that anybody actually reads them but oh well.

Oh and this is a review based entirely on the 10 episode anime and it's OVA though the OVA does have a proper review over on it's page too.

This is a somewhat surprisingly good anime considering it's an isekai and most people seem to assume that most isekai anime are the same and past their prime but I still found this one to be quite refreshing in a way.
Yes it does have the usual main male character (Izayoi Sakamaki) with some pretty strong powers with lots of girls around them but it isn't a harem show and he's not completely overpowered from what I've seen in the anime.
I specified ""main male character"" as he isn't the only main character he just so happens to be the only male among them; Asuka Kudou, You Kasukabe and Kuro-Usagi being the others.

The basic plot is that Kuro-Usagi summoned the other 3 MCs to help her rebuild her community; a sort of adventurer's country if you will. They have their own land, flag, name and members.
However, in this world called ""Little Garden"" you compete in ""Gift Games"" which are tournaments of varying sizes with some kind of prize the line for both participants (whether this be individuals, groups of communities). Kuro-Usagi's community lost their name and flag and are now referred to as the ""No Names"" and the anime centres around the 4 main characters working together with their new community to reclaim and rebuild what they've lost.

The characters themselves seem to have plenty of back-story too and each of the 3 summoned MCs (Izayoi, Kudou and Kasukabe) come from different worlds where certain events happened in each of their worlds at the same point but other events are unique to each world (so things such as ""The Black Death"" aka ""The Bubonic Plague"" happened in each of their worlds but other things may be different). In addition to this they are also from different times in their respective worlds so Kudou is from a kind of modern-ish Japan-like world from the looks of it, Kasukabe is from some kind of fantasy world with floating islands and Izayoi is from a slightly different modern Japan complete with delinquents.

Overall I'd say that if you have an interest in isekai anime and/or are just after something to sink your teeth into for a bit you should definitely give this anime a go if you can but you may end up disappointed when you realise or remember that there's no more to the anime after the 10 episodes and the fan-service OVA.

In terms of ""best girls"" you've got a selection as there are lolis, slim girls, busty girls, vampires, animal girls (bunny girls, nekos, etc.) and more to take your fancy and a large amount of them are featured in the OVA which I'll get to in a moment.
I quite like Kudou which is surprising considering she's an ""ojou-sama"" type but she's actually quite mellow as you'll learn in the anime (I won't get into spoilers but each has their own reasons for leaving their original world and goal for their new one).
I am however torn between her, Kuro-Usagi and Leticia

The OVA is your fairly standard fan-service OVA which was bundled with volume 7 of the light novel shortly after the anime aired.
It includes a variety of fan-service ""gimmicks"" including milk, clothes in the process of being removed, school swimsuits along with ones that are similar to school swimsuits, melting clothes and more.
It has it's own mini-story/competition independent of the main 10 episode anime but requires you to have watched them as certain abilities, characters and whatnot are present that come into play throughout so unless you just want fan-service and won't watch the anime or don't mind being spoilt you should watch it after finishing the main series.

Just to reiterate; this is a great anime in my opinion to the point where I've written a review for it but sadly it seems like it's been forgotten about and therefore unlikely to get any animated sequels any time soon if ever...
If you miss the characters and setting you could always try reading the light novels; all of the main series has been translated into English and some of the sequel series called ""Last Embryo"" is translated though the group recently dropped it (not long before this review too so it's possible it may have been picked up by another group by the time you're reading this)."
7674,"This review focuses on the first season of the series Bakuman. This review is spoiler-free.

Intro:
Have you ever stayed up late at night or pulled an all-nighter to finish schoolwork? How did you feel? Good, joyous?? In truth, you didn’t feel any of that. You felt Satisfaction. Turning in that assignment you spent all night trying to complete. Watching your teacher grade it then hand it back to you with a smiley face and an A+ made you want to take an arc position clutching your fist in one hand; the paper in the other screaming “YESSS, LETSS GOOO'' right? You felt like your seeds of hard work had ripened into a tree because of the amount of time you put into finishing that work. In that moment, even for a little. You felt real satisfaction. The same can be said for manga creators, but these authors have 10 daily packets they have to pull many all-nighters for in order to complete. Even if they started their work early in the morning! They have to spend their whole day planting their seeds and doing back-paining work that they don’t even know will get full points just to make an appeal to a certain demographic, something for one of us to read in order to take our mind away from the grueling problems of this society and unironically enjoy.
Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. Two obscure names at first glance, but their work is very far from the word ‘bad’ or ‘garbage’.
Ohba and Obata put very grueling work to make all their series succeed. Their most popular series is titled.. 
Death note.
A classic that many high tier anime connoisseurs indulge in. A series that many enjoy or respect and recommended to all whether they have watched 500 anime or are starting their anime journey with 1.
Death note has had many people feel different. Whether that be getting hype or angry, as a whole the industry enjoys it. The moments in the anime itself might be worthy tenfold of the hype they receive now, even when the show ended over a decade and a half ago, many people still enjoy it as their go-to healing watch or just a mood with the actions the characters do throughout the series.

I consulted a friend known within the AL community about his thoughts on the series:
[Phineas](https://anilist.co/user/Phineas/): Very intriguing, catchy, and lets loose from the get-go, and doesn't hold back until the infamous episode 25. The only flaws IMO were that some ideas could've been further explored in the second part of DN (post-episode 25).

But some fans of the series ask a few questions..
Like “How did you know death note was a hit?” “How long did it take for the anime to blow up?”
Instead of a QnA bringing all of these questions to light or a podcast, Tsugumi and Takeshi gave us 75 episodes stretched across 3 seasons to answer all of the questions and even more with the title Bakuman.

Story:
Bakuman is about middle schooler boy Mashiro Moritika. He goes to school, passing his days by, uncertain of what to do with his life. Mashiro has a crush on the girl in his same class, Azuki. His uncle made manga and got a popular title and an anime adaptation but died due to overwork. Ever since then, Mashiro scorned the idea of becoming a mangaka or making manga. Even though he had good drawing talent. One day in class, Mashiro draws sketches of Azuki in his notebook. Class bell rings. Flustered; Mashiro shoves the notebook into his desk and quickly goes home. Just to come back to the school to get it. There, he meets Takagi.
Smartest in the class and highest scorer on tests, Takagi flips through the pages in Mashiro’s notebook to find the sketch of Azuki. Mashiro tries to grab it from him because he thinks Takagi might disapprove of his goal but then there, he tells Mashiro that he will only give the notebook back if he makes manga with him.
This is their journey to become the most popular mangaka’s.
In the later seasons of the anime, the story becomes more pumped and enjoyable. We learn more about the past of each character and other competitors that compete with one another hoping to make it big in the manga industry. This anime is a warning of a double edged sword if you want to devote your life to making manga.. If you were to choose to go into manga for a living, it can procure a stable living and you can find rivals that will pump you up to push past your limits, but people with immense talent can crumble faster than you imagine. And if you are going into the manga industry half-assed, you wil crumble faster than them. 
If there was something I would take away from this anime, it’s that hits or popular manga’s don’t come easy. 

Art:
For me, I really enjoyed the art. The series felt like homage to other popular manga creators. Often showing the workplace of other mangaka’s or workplaces with books or posters lodged into their bookshelves or walls as-well as the sketches on paper and the anime in anime . Those small details really put a smile on my face while watching. The art and the amount of detail put into small things nobody really cares about (but me) really heightened the watching experience. Same thing goes with the landscape and characters. Nothing special about em’ design wise but they only helped the watcher enjoy his experience more. (still me) 
Sound:
I enjoyed the sound. BGM and op/ed for example. In S1 the BGM near the end of the episode was re-used a-lot. But regardless of sound being reused or not still heightened my experience and brought that extra suspense or hype factor. The opening and ending choice was phenomenal. Was really singing that Blue Bird opening low-key. The opening was good too. But not on the same level as the ending. (for me.) 
Later in the other seasons they switch up the music choice a little and up the quality, and that really heightens the experience more. This is why you see more favourites catered toward the second and third season then the first.

Enjoyment: (so far)
Currently I am on the beginning episodes of season 3 on the anime. Bakuman has really been a fun ride and the anime reeks of the words 'perseverance’ and to never give up. Things don’t go your way? Revise and make it go that way.

In conclusion, Bakuman is a must watch for those who aspire to become mangaka’s and who don’t.The anime has other things to reel you in with even while also giving you tips and tricks of the manga industry. It’s an indirect way that Ohba and Obata gave us information from their experiences while also having you see Takagi and Mashiro’s journey and their experiences.. I have no intention of becoming a mangaka in the future but my respect for manga creators grew by ALOT. The manga industry is just like the rap industry. You make music with intentions of it getting popular or it becoming a hit just for it to get 1k streams and have nobody talking about it. Or you get a hit by getting memed and then going back to the usual 1,000 plays.
I originally thought manga was easy and you could make a hit from thin air, but a lot of things happen before us, the general public even get to see it.
All you have to do when you’re at the front desk for a manga publishing company is say..
 “I watched bakuman, and rewatched it too.”
receptionist instantly let’s you through
You’ll learn alot about the manga industry by watching 75 24-minute episodes, even if you don’t want to have a career as a mangaka Bakuman. doesn’t make it’s entire focus just that. These 75 episodes are highly important assets to assist your journey of aiming to become a popular mangaka. You could be an editor who cultivates talent from newbies; assistant helping mangaka’s with their recent serializations; or receptionist at the front desk welcoming immense talent to the place where they’re name will be etched into the wall as real legends.
Bakuman has it here in store for you.

Upon the 21st Century's Golden Age of Television around the early 2000s, antiheroes became a prominent figure in media entertainment once again. From Mad Men to The Sopranos, storytelling saw a drastic change in the way we perceive heroism in the modern grittier era. Japanese animation, on the other hand, have always embraced antiheroes as part of their storytelling, but it was not until the late 2000s that sociopathic antiheroes became more prominent and even embraced as a figure worthy of admiration. Characters like Light Yagami from Death Note were no longer the traditional villain, but the main protagonist whose fans have even considered him to be in the right.

By the time the 2010s came around, we witnessed several anime entries that were far more subversive of the more traditional heroic tales like Attack on Titan, Psycho-Pass, Tokyo Ghoul, Terror in Resonance, and of course, Ajin. These anime are far more flexible when showing moral righteousness and ambiguity. This has been around in anime before, but the 2010s saw a significant surge in such gritty psychological anime. Of course, only one title among these left an impact on me. As I've mentioned before, it's like a hybrid of the best parts from those aforementioned anime titles, but I feel like that's simplifying a bit how I came to feel such satisfaction from this anime. Let's start at the beginning.

Around five years ago, I've seen almost 400 anime titles, most of which consisted of popular mainstream ""must-watch"" titles like FMA:B, Death Note, Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, and many more. I felt like I hit a wall at that time and nothing really satisfied me the way those classic titles did, leaving that impact of having experienced a polished story with the right balance of action, story and character (music too). So I started to search for more niched titles, specifically the more psychological stories that challenge the viewers' perceptions. When I stumbled upon Terror in Resonance, it felt like such a novel idea, a show with terrorists being the main protagonists, the ""good guys"" even (good luck pulling that off in America). But ultimately, it disappointed me when it entered the cliched territory of a melodramatic villain with a generic backstory. Without spoiling anything, it delves into your typical science experiment gone wrong/government cover-up. It all just felt so samey and lacked that genuine freshness, and the villain acting so hammy really didn't help. I don't particularly enjoy hammy villains.

Speaking of villains I couldn't take seriously, some time before my viewing of Terror in Resonance, I saw Tokyo Ghoul, which I only picked up because it reminded me of a favorite anime of mine, Shiki. The idea of the bad guys being as human as the human good guys wasn't anything new, but Shiki managed to pull it off in such emotional intensity through its showcase of humanity's hypocrisy and cruelty towards any one ""different."" Tokyo Ghoul, on the other hand, felt like a showcase of how pretentious the villains could act with their overdramatic speeches. The focus was off. It was a showy effort that turned it into an action-packed anime lacking any contemplation on the human condition. Feels like a kids show, but with gore.

But why am I explaining my gripes about these other anime in my Ajin review, you ask? Well, Ajin took those wasted potentials and polished it up into something far more engaging. Gone are the unnecessary megalomaniacle villains preaching (false) moral superiority and instead, we have a better focus here, a character study almost, of a sociopathic kid who is forced to reveal his true colors of being an amoral monster (long before his realization of being a literal one). It's like if we never gave Light Yagami the Death Note in the first place and just disrupt his status quo to see how his sociopathic side would react. Kei Nagai is a fascinating protagonist in the realm of storytelling, because usually, with selfish characters like him, the show would try and justify his existence by showing his good side. Ajin does that to some extent, but halfheartedly, focusing more on showing how hypocritical and, sometimes, terrifying Kei's actions are, especially towards his sister. The show was perfectly comfortable in placing an emotionless creature as the main hero without rectifying his behavior later on or spelling out just how morally wrong Kei really is to the audience either. He's simply there without plot armor or deus ex machina for us to observe him in the purest way.

Such an effective moral ambiguity could only achieved by one key element in the show: evil vs. evil vs. evil. There are literally no good guys between the three main factions in this series, whether it's Yu Tosaki (crazed government agent comfortable with torturing Ajins in science experiments, even if they're children) or Sato (militant rebel Ajin whose extreme methods made Malcolm X look like Mr. Rogers). That's why there's no forced or contrived moral preaching about who's in the right or wrong. Instead, we just get a satisfying battle royale to see who gets the upper hand without any distraction.

I feel like, with villains being the main characters, it can be more interesting and provocative because most of us know what the right thing to do is, the morally righteous actions, so to watch good-natured heroes perform actions we already know they'll do for the thousandth time can get... a little stale. But with villains like Light Yagami, I feel like we're scientists watching lab rats, waiting to see just how much more evil they can get, how extreme they can become, and how far they would go. Especially fascinating are the intelligent villains (like the truly intelligent ones, not those preaching Nietzsche nihilism) who create elaborate schemes to get away with their amoral actions. In a way, it's almost like a voyeuristic escapism, like watching a heist movie and fantasizing about getting easy money.

But aside from simply having an interesting character study, Ajin also taps into some relevant social themes, but not in a heavy-handed way that leaves the audience eye-rolling. There are subtle xenophobia themes of persecution against those who are different than you and also themes of looking the other way instead of speaking out against injustice, two subjects that I'm sure all of us could relate to today. This is not the anime's strongest suit, of course, since it's not something new in anime, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless, particularly how the themes aren't heavy-handed enough to distract. Even the torture scenes are mostly left to viewers' imagination instead of showing gratuitous gore for viewer satisfaction. I feel like such subtlety only strengthened the show's focus on the character analysis devoid of superficial story elements.

And even right until the end, even when the terrorists made their big explosive move, I feel like the show has always been rooted in the study of Kei and how he reacts to people as well as how people react to him. That one old lady who was sympathetic to him, along with Kei's storyline being moved to the remote villages, was a strong move that further examine how Kei's twisted logic works. He showed compassion for the old lady, not out of kindness, I feel, but out of some distorted logic that the elderly should be helped. I feel like that's how Kei's amoral mind works, defining his world and the people around him as statistics and data to be analysed. Fascinating.

But it's not all slow-burn character study, of course, as there's plenty of Ajin action and fight scenes. This is one of those shows like FMA:B that doesn't overcompensate with action scenes that they would become boring. Instead, almost every fight scene felt like it adds something important to the story rather than just being there for the sake of showing new Ajin moves. That being said, I really LOVE what they did with Kei in a surprise twist. It's pretty much a power-up cliche you would find in most shounen anime, but this was the one time I could overlook because of how satisfying it is.

And I think, it's only satisfying because in spite of all the hypocrisy and selfishness Kei has displayed, there's indeed a ""good guy"" to root for in this show. There has to be in any story, unfortunately, as it's a basic story structure that can't be broken, otherwise the audience would be left apathetic and hating everyone. Kei is the lesser of the three evils here, but only because of 1) the aforementioned twisted logic and 2) torturing children Ajins. Yeah. It's a given who to root for.

An honorable mention should be made to Kou Nakano, unfortunately the only good guy deuteragonist around. He's probably the only likable character in the entire show for obvious reasons, the classic shounen hero full of hot-blooded justice (and reckless impulse). Unfortunately for him, he's stuck in the wrong genre. It's almost like how the girls in Madoka Magica wouldn't have faced such a gruesome fate in a vanilla magical girl anime.

To close off this review, there's one more significant element I must mention: the music. So good. The opening is an appropriately exhilarating and fast-paced song that's memorable enough to compete against the likes of HxH (2011) and Tokyo Ghoul, but it's the ending theme where it truly shines, which is rare for an anime. The ending to each episode features a graphic montage of Ajin committing suicide to ""reset"" themselves, so it's a pretty emotionally-charged outro in all honesty. Being an anime ending theme, it's naturally a somber piece, but the melancholic tune here that describes the Ajins' loneliness in this world of insanity is truly fitting for the show.

★★★★½

Can't wait for season 2."
20918,"The first series of the third season: Tsukimonogatari. It’s nothing groundbreaking for Monogatari but a good series in it own right. The series tells a great story and developed Araragi’s story in a clever way. 

This section of the timeline, between the end of Second Season and Hanamonogatari, is shaping up to be very interesting, as we see come to see what should ultimately be the final part of Araragi’s growth into maturity. 

Tsukimonogatari, then, takes place a month before Araragi’s (and company) graduation and explores themes about the blurring of what it is to be human and apparition as Araragi deals with the consequences of his actions during the period when Nadeko was a god. 



The series starts, as the all the shorter series seem to do, with a prologue. In this case, it talks about Yotsugi and we are introduced to this core theme: what is it to be human and what is it to be apparition. 

Yotsugi is the apparition that appears as a human but is not. Yotsugi looks like a human, made from a corpse and the apparition of a doll, but is not human. This is constantly reminded to us in the peculiar was she talks, quite like a doll with a voice box in it. And it is her very act that means she is not human. As Shinobu highlights, learning the language allows you to communicate but it doesn’t make you the given nationality. 

Yotisugi, here, become the point of comparison for Araragi, who has constantly flirted the line between human and apparition. This comparison of Araragi and Yotsugi is not a new one, in fact it was a brought up in the Shinobu Time arc of Second Season. 

Araragi is both alike and different to Yotsugi. We learn that his use of vampirism over the previous six months to visit Nadeko has pushed his soul towards being a vampire. He is a transitionary state, not wholly human, but not wholly vampire. Rather than not being a human and having to act as one, Araragi is a risk of losing his humanity. 

In this sense, the two are on the same path just at different places. Yotsugi, the corpse that was turned into a doll was transformed from (dead) human to an apparition. And Araragi is on this same route, on the transition from human to apparition.

Yotsugi has already crossed this line and does not want the same fate for Araragi. She cannot become a human for she is a monster, which she dramatically demonstrates by killing Tadatsuru. For Araragi, so much of his quest in not wanting to be a vampire and preventing Shinobu from becoming one again is precisely to prevent people from being killed. 

And this very act of killing Tadatsuru punctuates why Araragi cannot rely on his vampirism anymore. Becoming a vampire not just a literal loss of humanity, figurative too. Becoming a vampire requires one to kill, and this is the loss of humanity that Yotsugi demonstrates for Araragi. He cannot become a vampire or else he will becoming like her: a monster who kills. 



While I enjoyed this series more than I expected I would after I finished the first episode, I don’t think this series was an amazing Monogatari series. It did what it needed to do, and then it did some other not very interesting stuff. The animation, as always, looked very good, but at times it bordered on being a distraction rather than an amplifier for the dialogue. I think this was particularly the case in episode three, when Shinobu and Yotsugi are snowball fighting while Araragi and Yozuru are talking. 

Along with this, this series is notably egregious with the ecchi bullshit. This series has a run time of 100 minutes, and ten of those minutes are a bath scene with Araragi’s younger sister.

I’m going to be honest, this shit is the main reason I don’t recommend Monogatari to people. The dialogue of the first episode could have been done in any other way, but no, there had to be the incestuous and paedophilic crap that drags this series down.

In some series I am willing to look past it, but this made up such a large portion of this very short series that it must be commented on.  I don’t care for the totally ridiculous shots of Hanekawa or Senjougahara, but they’re forgivable. But this shit with the really young characters is just awful. 



I am not usually a fan of stories about the literal loss of humanity, but Tsukimonogatari worked very cleverly to integrate this story with a figurative loss of humanity. This has been something that Monogatari has always be great at, and it’s a big part of why the overarching story works so well. 

The story was also complimented by some great ground work for the season ahead. We are introduced to some important plot developments, namely about a mastermind who was behind Tadatsuru being called into town and something to do with Ougi Oshino. 

Tsukimonogatari was a great story, but not an incredible series. In the end, though, it still had my interest thoroughly piqued."
10800,"Karuta (かるた) , a card game unheard of outside of Japan. Competitive Karuta, an even rarer version of Karuta, is unheard of even for many Japanese people. Chihayafuru, however, changed all of this. At its core, Chihayafuru is a series about a girl’s love for Competitive Karuta. Her love for Karuta inspires others to grow as she seeks to spread the joy Karuta brings on her journey to become the next Karuta “Queen”.

Karuta?
In 13th century Japan, Fujiwara no Teika commissioned and compiled a series of 100 poems by 100 different renowned poets. This anthology of 100 poems is known as the 百人一首 (Hyakunin Isshu) translated into English as “One Hundred Poems by 100 Poets”. Centuries later after the Portuguese introduce card games to Japan (Karuta comes from the Portuguese word for card “carta”), the poems were then printed onto playing cards. Karuta is frequently played by Japanese people on New Years for fun and is then quickly forgotten the next day. Japanese students in elementary and middle school learn about the hyakunin isshu in school akin to how many English speakers learn about Shakespeare in their literature classes. 

Competitive Karuta takes Karuta to the next level. Players must memorize all 100 poems if they want a chance to win. They lay their cards down on the floor where they then race to see who can recall the poem and pick up the corresponding card the fastest. Think of it like a mix of chess and karate. It’s highly intellectual: you need to be strategic with how you place your cards, you need to memorize the position of 50 cards that are frequently moving around. It’s athletic as well: to take a card you need to be faster than your opponent. You need to swipe, slap, and block to win. Audience members watch matches in silence, but don’t be fooled. The tensions are high between players as they strain to listen to the next sound in hopes of being even a millisecond faster. And just like that, the silence is broken as you hear a bunch of people slapping the floor fill the room. You’d better watch out for those flying cards. Playing Karuta is no easy feat. 

The Characters
The cast of Chihayafuru are by far the highlight of the show. Chihayafuru spends a lot of time developing its characters, giving us reason to cheer for them, to cry for them, or to laugh with them. While the story follows the Karuta club of Mizusawa high school, the first few episodes are dedicated to the origins of our main trio: Chihaya, Arata, and Taichi. We see how Arata got Chihaya to play a round of Karuta, who in turn got Taichi to play Karuta. Karuta actually ties the 3 together and lets them bond even when they eventually separate. Chihaya’s first match with Arata is one she replays in her head years later. Her unbridled passion for Karuta stems from that very first match. 

Years later we see that passion return, stronger than ever before, as Chihaya tries to create a Karuta club at her high school. As she tries to recruit new members to the club, we see how these new members tick. Kana-chan is a lover of all traditional Japanese things, especially traditional clothing. Her vast knowledge on Japanese poetry gives her a good reason to switch to the Karuta club. Karuta scratches that itch she couldn’t get from any other club. Tsutomu is competing with Taichi for the best grades in school. He always seems to get 2nd place but figures that joining the club will help with his studies to give him that edge over Taichi. 

The 2 new recruits show us how personal of a game Karuta is. Their playing style directly reflects their personalities. Kana-chan comes not only having memorized all 100 poems in their entirety, but their histories as well. This lets her separate tricky, similar sounding cards which gives her a slight edge over everyone else. She can easily imagine the poetry in her head which lets her visualize the cards even better. She knows what cards are in play and what cards have been called by connecting the poems to their authors. For Kana-chan, each poem is unique and special and all the cards should be treated as such. Tsutomu on the other hand, is incredibly studious. The memorization aspect of Karuta which helps further his studies is a plus for him. He also loves to analyze and analyzing is his biggest weapon. Analyzing his opponents gives him the edge: he knows how his opponents play. He knows their strengths and weaknesses, he knows their secret tricks which lets him adjust his playing style accordingly. 

Characters and Karuta matches
While we could talk forever about the characters in Chihayafuru, another strong point is using the matches to develop character. Chihayafuru does a great job at giving all its opponents a personality and unique playing style. We see men and women play each other, we see old and young people play against each other. This further attests to the accessibility of Karuta and its uniqueness that separates it from other sports. Intellect means nothing if you don’t move fast enough and speed means nothing if you can’t come up with a plan. We see a plethora of playing styles: aggressive, speedy, reserved, cunning, sadistic, methodical, unfaltering, and even psychic-like styles. We learn more about our own protagonists through what they learn in matches. As Chihaya plays against tough opponents, she learns new aspects of Karuta she never considered, which in turn, deepens her love for the game. As Tsutomu gains more experience, we slowly see him develop into a player with potential. As someone who once felt worthless, he soon realizes what it means to be on a team. 

Losing
Losing is normal for Chihayafuru. They lose a lot actually. Even Chihaya, the team’s ace with the potential to become the next Karuta Queen, loses fairly frequently. While many sports anime find crazy ways to show how it’s possible to overcome any obstacle, Chihayafuru shows us the (depressing) reality that you can’t always win. You can’t always just overpower your way to victory in Karuta and in life. There will be times when you lose and there is always someone better than you. There are times when you get injured and you can’t do anything about it other than sit by and watch. All of our characters have to cope with loss at some point in the series and their losses are pivotal moments for their development. Mistakes are deadly in Karuta and can cost the entire match. It’s invigorating to watch our cast pick themselves back up and use that as constant motivation to improve. 

Animation and Music
I have nothing special to add to this section. The animation is nice and consistent. The Karuta matches are animated amazingly and it really adds life to the matches compared to manga panels. The intro is really great and so is the ending. I’m a fan of the little motif (the five notes) they play when something good is gonna happen. (Kind of like Giorno’s theme, once you hear it play you know its over for the other person). The music is perfectly utilized and adds the right atmosphere to every scene whether it be tense or fun. 

Overall Thoughts
Chihayafuru hasn’t gained much traction outside of Japan. It’s understandable seeing that Karuta is a complex game especially for those who don’t speak Japanese. I’m glad that I gave Chihayafuru a chance because it has become one of my favorite animes. For me, it combines the best aspects of Haikyuu with Sangatsu no Lion, hence why I called it the sports anime for sports anime fans and non-fans alike. The balance Chihayafuru achieves between the 2 is amazing and I believe this makes it an anime anyone can watch. Not only are the matches exciting and make you want to binge watch to see who wins, Karuta is an important aspect of Japanese culture and is simply fascinating to learn about. I have no complaints."
126192,"The title perfectly summarizes what the content of this work actually is. An anime so stupid and surreal that it's funny for the simple fact that it's impossible to take it seriously. It therefore perfectly fulfills its role as anime to be watched with the brain off (because it is scientifically proven every minute passed on watching this show causes a noticable decrease of the IQ).


PLOT:
There are few things to say here. Naoya, Saki's boyfriend, receives the declaration of another girl, Nagisa. At this point the classic romcom protagonist thinks about it, refuses, or even could start some sort of hidden relationship but he doesn't, our phenomenal protagonist is not trivial and within 5 minutes we find ourselves with The Man begging his girlfriend to be able to start a relationship with both of them. Summarized in a very essential way the main plot, I would like to underline the extraordinary ability of this anime to exaggerate every little thing. But do not exaggerate the reasons, but the reactions and consequences that follow. Falling in love with a boyfriend who is already engaged makes sense but I do not think it is very normal to camp in a tent at his house to convince him. But this is fine for this work, because it was born to not be taken seriously. On the other hand, you can't fault forcing and plot holes in an anime that lays its foundations on them. 


CHARACTERS:
Very varied characters that perfectly convey the concept that this anime wants to convey: having the intelligence of a wood stove. Let's start with the best protagonist of the season, Naoya, primary source of the comedy and character clearly opposite to any protagonist from romcom: he is not afraid to say what he thinks, he never has moments of weakness, he does not bleed from his nose when he sees a naked girl, he doesn't stall 128 episodes to declare himself or advance a relationship. So perfect, so ridiculous and so funny at the same time. The girls are the perfect support for his attitude: the moody Saki with the small breast complex, the tender and horny Nagisa, the tsundere Rika who collects likes with her tits on Twitch and the thoughtful and determined Shino (the only sane character of the anime, which however has relatively little screentime compared to the others).


ART/ANIMATIONS:
Although the studio boasts very valid animes in graphic terms such as Adachi to Shimamura, we can see that the budget that was devoted to this anime was barely enough to buy a bottle of sparkling water and a sandwich from the vending machine. But somehow one of the visually worst anime I've ever seen still managed to amuse me despite huge graphic flaws, which indeed almost accentuated all the comedy of the situations.

MUSIC:
Very catchy Opening and Ending but another very underrated comic element are the OSTs used. I can't help but laugh when in a situation of stupid tension, the classic battle shonen soundtrack plays in the background.

CONCLUSIONS:
In conclusion, I think we all agree that we have witnessed one of the worst anime on the  earth (worst obviously if we compared it to the others, but being a very extreme parody makes very difficult for me to be able to make comparisons) but personally I found it one of the works that made me laugh the most ever.
P.S. Mukai Naoya best Romcom protagonist ever.

P.P.S Don't be ashamed to hide if you really enjoyed seeing it. Do not conform to the crowd to be able to say that you are one of those with the brain that does not laugh at these things.

P.P.P.S I am not a native English speaker so I apologize for any mistakes"
2034,"Lovely Complex is a typical rom/com with a lot of unnecessary drama made by [Aya Nakahara](https://anilist.co/staff/96896/Aya-Nakahara)




The first main character, Risa Koizumi

Risa is a very tall character compared to most of the other characters (172cm). She's a very happy, cute, kind and (probably) a smart girl surrounded by a group of supportive friends. She also really likes to pick on the second main character and one of her best friends, Atsushi Ootani. She just loves to call him an idiot but she also is really short tempered when it comes to him. What she also loves is the  popular rapper Umibozu. Although Risa is happy most of the time, she cries way too easily, I swear there were at least 8-10 episodes of her crying trying to make it seem like a very serious and dramatic thing when it only seemed unnecessarily over dramatised. Other than that she was also really over reactive when it came to her loving relationship with Ootani. I really didn't like these aspects of Risa and in my opinion, she could have been so much better as a character.

img()


Ootani, compared to Risa, was a shrimp with a height of 162 cm. A short tempered and seriously dense character. He's a good and popular captain of the basketball team despite his height, often having girls standing at the sports hall entrance cheering him on. Just like Risa, Ootani loves to pick on the main character partner and just like RIsa, he's a big fan of the idiot word and the rapper Umibozu. Now about his density. It's unbelievable how dense this character is when it comes to Risa and her feelings for him. It's like the amount of density Ootani holds has been given to him just to create the unnecessarily over dramatised scenes, giving Risa the opportunity to cry over and over again over the same thing. Honestly, I didn't like this character all that much. 

img()


Nobuko Ishihara

Fairly short and probably most mature and supportive character in this show. Nobu did her 100% to support Risa in confessing her feelings through the whole show. She would give her various tips on how to confess, used her boyfriend, Heikichi Nakao, to talk with Otani and make him think more about Risa's feelings,she would go and kick Ootani's ass whenever he makes things worse, she would give Risa the push when she really needed it and she was always there to hold Risa when she was down. Risa was really lucky to have a friend like her. Definitely my favourite character from this show.

img()

Maitake Kuniumi

A tall, cool and hot looking teacher than has transferred into Risa's school through the series. At first he seemed like an obstacle standing between Risa and Ootani with Risa making a fanclub together with the other fan girls becoming the club's leader and cheering on Maitake sensei while he was whooping Ootani's ass in basketball but with the progressing story it was becoming more and more obvious that Maitake indeed had no intentions of stealing Risa away but instead gave the couple his support when he could. Maitake sensei was a nice character to see.

Seishiro Kotobuki

A trap.

img()

Mimi Yoshioka

 Mimi Yoshioka was introduced to us somewhere at the near end of the series. She's Ootani's neighbour that used to have a crush on Ootani, and doesn't like Ootani having Risa as her girlfriend. She's one of the types that acts cute and nice in front of the person that she likes but as soon as she gets some time alone with Risa, she starts acting like a real bitch towards her. It was sad to see tho with how they could relate to each other with their height problems. At some point it really seemed like these 2 characters could be friends.


img()



The last character I'm going to be reviewing, Kazuki Kohori

Kazuki Kohori, just like Mimi Yoshioka, was introduced to us somewhere during the last 5-3 episodes of Lovely Complex, the final threat to the couple. He's a co-worker at Risa's new part-time job at a family restaurant. A fairly nice guy with the height of 165 cm. Other than that, he's just another big Umibozu fan.

The story was....not impressive but not that bad I guess? It started with introducing the 2 main characters and a few supportive characters to us. Strangely enough, the first episode was straight up a beach/public pools episode type. Anyway, the story was about Risa trying to find herself a fine, tall boyfriend and she found a guy just like that at the very first episode! Just so he could be stolen away by one of her friends, Chiharu Tanaka. These 2 characters then began to go out with eachother. Risa eventually gave up on him and moved on. While she moves on, her hidden feelings for her comedian partner Ootani start revealing themselves and Risa bit by bit starts realising it. Her friend, Nobuko Ishihara, after finding out about this starts building up a plan that would take place on a beach during summer vacation. The plan is busted by Risa giving Ootani too big of a hint just for him to not realise she was being serious and says something mean, making Risa cry. Risa then starts working even harder on building up the courage to confess when a sudden unexpected obstacle appears. The new transfer student, Seishiro Kotobuki that later on goes and gives Ootani a smooch in front of the rest of the gang, just so we could later on find out....that it was a trap. With the story progressing, Risa finally has enough courage to properly confess to Ootani during the firework display....just so she could be brushed off cus Ootani is too dense to realise Risa is being serious and just made her cry again. 1 or 2 episode later the 2 main characters meet during the evening in an empty classroom during the school's cultural festival. Even tho this time Risa hasn't confessed properly, she game Ootani enough hints for him to finally realise, just that it took him way too long and Risa.......was once again crying. Few episodes passed on with Risa crying in every single one when we finally get to the point where Ootani starts showing his feelings for Risa. Yes finally! Just that half of the series are already gone with so little new things happening and the same things getting repeated over and over again. Almost at what could be considered the near end of the series and the 2 main characters have a proper smooch during Risa's birthday on a roof top behind their friend's back while they are watching the firework display. From this point, I have actually finally began to enjoy the series. The next new character that the series would introduce to us was the tall and pretty Ootani's neighbour that used to had a crush on him and is a 2 faced bitch, Mimi Yoshioka. Just like I said earlier in her character description, for some time it seemed like Risa and Mimi could be friends having their height problems despite Mimi threatening her behind Ootani's back every single time she has the chance to do so, but she went too far with it and Ootani has witnessed Mimi's true face, thus was the end of the threat. The next and final threat in the story was Risa's co-worker at her new part-time job at a family restaurant, Kazuki Kohori. They had a thing in common and that was their love for the rapper Umibozu. One day during her part-time job, Risa fell asleep while trying to memorise the food menu. Kazuki saw Risa when passing by and was tempted by her cute face so he went in for the kiss just for Risa to wake up moments before her lips touched with Kazuki's and see her boyfriend Ootani standing outside of the window watching them. A typical plot twist in the romance genre really. Risa did her best explaining to Ootani and her friends just to later on go and mess things up again by going out with Kazuki to an Umibozu event, meeting Ootani on their way back. In the end everything got resolved and they lived happily ever after. Imo, the story could have been better if it's pacing wasn't so slow. I mean, taking it slow is nice but this was too slow even for me, and that's rare. As for the relation ship between Ootani and Risa, just like I said I few times before, it was over dramatised during the first half (and a bit more). Nothing much was really happening. The comedy definitely did more than the romance here.

Anyway, that was my very first review based on my own opinion. Any type of feedback appreciated, even toxic ^^"

“And thus, did my dizzying tale of adventure with Siesta begin….
Until death did us part.”


It may be difficult now, but try to think back to the opening week of this anime season. Alongside a number of rightly-hyped premiers by anime everyone kinda expected to be good, there was the comparatively obscure The Detective is Already Dead. Tantei wa mou, Shindeiru, as it’s known in its native Japanese, had, alongside heavyweights like Sonny Boy and the second season of Magia Record, one of the most promising premieres of the season. Said premiere, “Attention Passengers: Is There a Detective On Board?”, combined witty dialogue, a gonzo, very capital-A Anime set of central conceits, [a truly impressive fight sequence](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/158854), and one of the season’s best and, let’s be honest, simply coolest characters, the titular detective, into an entertaining stew that had a lot of potential. (Full disclosure; I may have a soft spot for “basically Sherlock Holmes, but an anime girl” as a character idea.)

The episode ran through the need-to-knows with the lightning speed and self-confidence of a pulp novel. The secret organization SPES and their army of cyborgs are threatening the world! It’s up to our hero, the legendary detective Siesta, and her straight-laced assistant Kimihiko “Kimi” Kimizuka to stop them! It opens a mile in the air during a plane hijacking and ends in a high school, our leads pulling a drug bust on a dealer in a bunny costume. Capping it all off was a wildly romantic sequence at the episode’s tail end, followed by the header quote in the closing narration to hit us with the emotional coup de grace. Our hero’s been dead the entire time! How will her heartbroken assistant carry on without her? It remains one of the year’s single best episodes, and nothing else I am about to say can or is trying to change that. Episode directors Shin’ichi Fukumoto and Marina Maki should be proud.

img880()

I bring all this up not to belabor a point, but to make it clear that, yes, there was a period of time–however brief–when people thought this might be, at the very least, one of the season’s better anime. Twelve weeks on, where its reputation is somewhere between “trainwreck” and “widely-dropped laughingstock” that can seem hard to believe, but it’s true. On one level, the answer to the question “what went wrong?” is extremely simple; none of those strengths remained present for the remainder of the series, and some dropped off earlier than others. But on another, Detective is a downright fascinating case of a show almost systematically undercutting itself at every turn. Detective started falling apart as early as its second episode, and despite some intermittent highlights throughout, it never really recovered either.

We can start by making one thing very clear. Detective‘s problems do not stem from its premise. They’re certainly not helped by it, but it is very possible to tell the story of a life in the past tense. To focus on what the bygone has left behind, to examine how the people around them move on or how they fail to move on. Detective doesn’t entirely fumble this, but it misses more often than it hits. In fact, its handling of this premise reminds me of nothing less than the largely-forgotten Blast of Tempest, which had many of the same issues for some of the same reasons. The core problem is simple; if the central character of your show is dead or otherwise MIA in the present day, she needs a very strong supporting cast. And Siesta, like that show’s Fuwa Aika, simply does not have one. She is a compelling character in search of a compelling anime. It is largely her who renders the show watchable at all, as all the other characters are so underdeveloped that she appears deep as the ocean by contrast.

Instead, she gets Kimi, who, to his limited credit, does work out an entertaining straight man / weird girl dynamic with Siesta. They form a fun duo much like their archetypal ancestors (say, Kyon and Haruhi) did.

img880()

img880()
Yes that’s still Siesta in the top image. Listen, just roll with it.

-

There is also Nagisa, Siesta’s replacement, who is in almost every sense a much less engaging character, but who has the benefit of being the recipient of a heart transplant from none other than the late detective herself to at least arouse some mystery. The remaining characters are so thin that they are barely worth mentioning. There’s a chuuni-ish idol complete with an eyepatch (Yui Saikawa), an ambiguous foreigner with some ill-defined relationship to Siesta (Charlotte Anderson), and a mysterious child (Alicia) who turns out to secretly be the evil mastermind (Hel) in disguise / assuming another personality / something, it doesn’t really matter.

img880()
The fact that the episode where an idol pulls a revolver on the main character is one of the less interesting ones is not a great sign.

-

This lopsidedness of the cast ends up directly informing the episodes. As a general rule of thumb, those that center on Siesta and Kimi tend to be either genuinely good, even if only in a cheesy sort of way, or at least bad in a funny way. Those that focus on other characters are much less interesting. Sometimes they’re flat-out boring, which is a far worse crime than being ridiculous.

Beyond that, on a narrative level the show makes very little sense. The actual story is very simple, cataloging Siesta and Kimi’s attempts to take down SPES. And later, Kimi’s retirement from ‘detective’ work and eventual resumption of that same goal again, this time with Nagisa. But the show’s structure is so bizarre that it can be difficult to follow any of this. Why, for example, if the show’s central conceit is that Siesta is dead, does a huge chunk of it take place as flashback to when she was alive? These stories being told in this fashion adds nothing to the show. It makes it marginally more confusing to follow, but deliberate obfuscation is not the same as actually being interesting.

img880()

Something like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya or Princess Principal is aired non-chronologically because in those cases, the approach helps develop the sort of story they’re trying to tell. (In the former case, Kyon and Haruhi’s emotional arc takes precedence over the literal events of the series. In the latter case, it is to build up mystery and selectively feed the audience information.) No such thing is true of Detective‘s clumsy halfway flashback deep-dive. And the fact that they are some of the show’s better episodes feels more like a happy accident than anything deliberate. It’d feel like course correction given the widespread but misguided criticism of the premise if that were how anime production worked. But it isn’t, so what gives?

And what to make of the show’s utterly baffling organ transplant motif? Organs, namely hearts, transferring ownership comes up some three times over the course of the series, which is too often in a show this short to simply be happenstance. And let me make an aside here, folks, I’m not professionally trained as a critic, so I’m certainly guilty of occasionally missing things more properly literate sorts would pick up on. But I am a thinking human being, and it’s rare that I just come up completely empty when rattling a metaphor around in my brain. I have no idea what it could possibly mean. None of the possibilities I’ve come up with–the perseverance of love? Specifically the strength of Siesta and Kimi’s relationship? Some hamfisted ‘people close to each other should help each other’ thing? A religious symbol?–hold up to scrutiny. I am left to conclude that it is either a very malformed metaphor or it simply isn’t one at all. In the latter case, why is it in the show at all?

img880()

That may seem like a minor point, but the same lack of purpose applies to many decisions made throughout the series. Elements like Yui’s job as an idol, the very fact that the antagonists are shapeshifting cyborgs, a weird micro-plot about priceless jewelry and another about a serial killer, the entire character of Hel, the fact that Siesta has a mecha(?!) at one point, even the series’ gratuitous Spanish subtitle, and the anticipated-and-then-quickly-forgotten cameo by Hololive virtual talents Matsuri Natsuiro and Fubuki Shirakami, seem like they were made less for any real reason and more simply because, well, they’re Cool. Or they’re the sorts of things that are “supposed” to be in light novels.

img880()

English-language info is sparse, but the case appears to be that Detective is the first-ever published novel by its author, Nigojuu, which may explain some of the amateurishness here. Or, maybe it’s the other way around! Studio ENGI are not exactly a powerhouse, perhaps they butchered the material. Maybe the light novel’s defenders are right and all this somehow does make more sense in book form. Hell, maybe it’s somehow both at once.

All this said, even with its frankly many flaws in mind, I can’t really hate or even actively dislike Detective. It has too many actually-solid moments and too many bad-in-a-funny way moments to have burned its goodwill from that first episode away entirely. A harsher viewer may write such things off, but I can’t pretend I didn’t enjoy a decent chunk of the show, even in spite of all its problems.

That, and there is that Detective does get one thing right. Especially towards its end. Sometimes, people we’ve known all our lives can disappear like a dream at sunrise. Sometimes too, we do not even get the chance to say goodbye. This is the sole emotional string the anime manages to play correctly, and even then it’s oddly stingy about it. But aside from Siesta’s strength as a character, it is this that saves the show from being a total loss.

img880()

As an even mildly adventurous anime watcher, you expect to take a gamble on some amount of shows that end up not exactly being amazing. Detective is, by any reasonable metric, middling, rather than outright awful. But that doesn’t make it good. Which puts it in a strange nowhere-zone, both in terms of relevance and in terms of simple quality. This is another of this year’s anime that will absolutely not survive the march of history, mentioned as it will be only as a curio or a “hey, do you remember that show with….?” answer. At best, perhaps some of the staff will go on to bigger and better things. In which case it will be an amusing trivial footnote. Call it a victim of the production bubble, call it just poorly-conceived. It is impossible to imagine Detective outside of this present time and place; mid-to-late 2021 specifically. It’s a born relic.

Yet, strangely, from a certain (and I’ll admit, uncommon) point of view, that gives it its own kind of hopeless underdog charm. The show itself only just barely manages to scrap together something out of its primary theme of transience (and all else it attempts falls resoundingly flat, make no mistake), but in a meta sort of way, Detective is an ode to its own transience. Here for twelve weeks and then forgotten, as though it simply scattered into light the moment it ended. Like it was never there at all.

It’s one of the great mysteries of popular art. Sometimes something that is utterly mediocre will, just for a moment, capture the public imagination or make visible an inner light, only for that light to be snuffed out almost immediately. Such is the case with Detective‘s few true highlights. It is one of the great enigmas of our species’ collective creativity. As such, one would be tempted to ask a great problem-solver, perhaps one like Siesta herself, what to make of it.

If you'd like to, [please check out my review for the movie here.](https://anilist.co/review/18424) It's quite different thematically from the main series, which is why I chose to review it separately, but be warned that it contains full spoilers (for the movie, not the seasonals).



While this is listed under [Non Non Biyori](https://anilist.co/anime/17549/Non-Non-Biyori/) (the first season), it reviews the series as a whole — which, of course, includes [Repeat](https://anilist.co/anime/20694/Non-Non-Biyori-Repeat/) and [Nonstop](https://anilist.co/anime/109403/Non-Non-Biyori-Nonstop/). However, due to way I’ve chosen to approach this review, I am able to loosely discuss all three seasons without spoiling anything (I won’t be talking about the movie) as aforementioned.


Introduction

[ img1080() ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSY7ARnUA&list=PL85DCZiQaoYMbhXXbxk4FsleBJ0kjuP)

“It’s not the same route every day. When it’s rainy or cloudy, it’s a little bit different. That’s what’s fun.”

━━━

I don’t know about you, but I grew up in an urban environment. Maybe not bustlingly dense like Tokyo or Hong Kong, but I live in a metropolitan region with more than two and a half million inhabitants. I’m used to concrete jungles, bumper-to-bumper traffic, packed trains and buses, large lecture halls, open offices, and everything in between that comes with living in a large city. I could never imagine living anywhere other than in an urban region. And with just over half of the world’s eight billion people(!) also living in cities, I’m far from the only person that feels this way.

Enter Asahigaoka, the quaint abode where this series resides, a humble farming village in Japan’s countryside. Gone are the comforts of restaurants, convenience stores, malls, and most amenities, public or private. In fact, you don’t even get cell service unless you’re in very specific spots of the town. Its population is never explicitly stated, but I would wager it’s in the low-to-mid hundreds at the very highest.

All of this is to say — the environment and setting of Non Non Biyori is a far cry from the booming city centers of most. At the very least, it was for me. And yet, a profoundly tangible sense of bliss and comfort that can’t be put into words is realized with each and every single episode. It’s a very human phenomenon to grow attached to personal places of significance, but for most, it understandably takes years of lived experience and memories to form this fond attachment.

Non Non Biyori effortlessly manages to create this feeling and these experiences in just 36 total episodes — or with 21 minutes of runtime per, just under thirteen hours of total series time. It fosters an intimate familiarity with Asahigaoka that makes you feel right at home — a bittersweet nostalgia for a fictitious village that’s nevertheless intimately imbued. It is not merely an attachment to familiarity and the time we take for granted which generates these human catharses — this series reminds us of all the things that make the concept of “place” so incredibly special for us.

This anime is more than just the setting it’s based in, the characters that live in it, or even the time that passes it by. So if I haven’t already convinced you, here’s everything that makes Non Non Biyori so special.



Background Context — 物の哀れ (Mono no Aware)

This is a concept deeply embedded into Japanese literary social consciousness, and it's a necessary frame of reference to know in order to fully articulate this series' thematic breadth. In essence, [物の哀れ (mono no aware)](https://stephanjoppich.com/mono-no-aware/) represents the transience of time, the impermanence of human life, and the gentle yet bittersweet acceptance of this fact. This is the heartbeat of Non Non Biyori — what makes it tick, and what lends its strengths the substance which transforms it from a quotidian slice-of-life to a profound depiction of place-driven attachment and the wistful cognizance of the fleeting nature of life.



Intimacy with Place and Space — Familiarity Amongst Fleeting Time

All media in general seeks to establish a sense of place; it’s necessary to even begin to consume literary fiction and suspend disbelief — that much is implicit. But amongst the backdrop of mono no aware, Non Non Biyori functions as a much more focused and deliberate deep dive into  ""place"" as a concept, and as aforementioned, this is the gravy of what this show has to offer.

Throughout the course of its three seasons, you’re given ample time to witness the environment and setting of Asahigaoka — all the nooks and crannies, the mountains and the trees, the water and the pavement. These representations of place can be as critical as the single train line that takes you out of the village, or as charming and modest as a water well deep in the fields of a farm, a small, unpaved path that cuts between streets, or the hallway of Asahigaoka Branch School that shows its age and is poorly maintained.

Intertwined with these intimate depictions of Non Non Biyori's hometown, the viewer comes to feel the time that’s passed whenever you’re greeted with scenery of this small village. The seasons change, and life moves forward. The snow outside the classroom window. The aged produce sitting by the side of the road, where purchases are made by good-will donation. Nostalgia necessitates an emotional hook — what better way to create such than the simple transience of the creature comforts we take for granted? 

It’s these quaint depictions of Asahigaoka, combined with this aforementioned thematic impermanence of time and life, that is Non Non Biyori. This town is spatially constrained, yet its potential is limitless — and it will pass us by irrespective of whether or not we chase after it. Why not make the most of what's around us? 

Every day, the world we find ourselves in changes a little bit. There’s an exciting prospect to that, but there’s also uncomfortable undertones of sadness and longing; saying farewell to what we've always had the pleasure to say ""hello"" to. Non Non Biyori does exceptionally well in beautifully using the transience of time to build on very human and very fleeting emotions, and imbues these feelings into its sense of place. Not everyone is able to relate to having to walk through unpaved roads and endless fields of grass to get to school, but everyone can relate to their routines and environment changing, bit by bit, as a natural consequence of time. 



The Magic of Being Young — An Earnest Look at the World We Live In

[ img1080() ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIJvWkPSshk&list=PL85DCZiQaoYMbhXXbxk4FsleBJ0kjuP&index=21)

It’s no secret that Non Non Biyori’s main ensemble are young. While various college-aged, working-aged, and parent-aged characters round out the cast, the oldest character within the main four is a second-year middle school student. This equates to around 13-14 years old.

I want you to reminisce for a bit about how you lived life when you were this age; and perhaps even younger, as the youngest in the main cast is about 6-7. We tend to be very impressionable, seeing the good in everything, and taking this radiant perspective for granted. It’s easy to get jaded as life goes on and responsibilities catch up to us, but this anime functions as a heartfelt reminder — it wasn’t always this way, nor does it have to be.

As I’ve touched on above, Asahigaoka is an extremely small town with little to offer in terms of entertainment or leisure. There are no public facilities like parks or beaches, and there are absolutely zero big-box businesses or shops — seemingly the only store in the village throughout the entire show’s run is a mom-and-pop candy store. Don’t even dream about finding a mall to hang out at, or a town square to relax in. All of the conveniences of city life that we take for granted? They’re nowhere to be found in this show’s hometown.

And yet, the characters of Non Non Biyori unlock an astonishingly infectious energy in a place pretty much devoid of conventionally experiential prospects. There's no go-karting or mountain hiking to chase after — there doesn't have to be. Life is an experience; every day offers that very opportunity, and at the end of those days, it's what you and your outlook make of it. The cast's endearing youthful adventures, endless curiosity, and earnest approach to day-to-day life means that even the most mundane of moments have an organic sense of excitement and comfort to them that betrays any feelings of complacency, boredom, or apathy.

Through this anime and the adventures of the main ensemble, we’re reminded of the fulfillment and satisfaction to be found in the everyday — so long as we have the right heart to seek it out. Non Non Biyori shows us that there’s warmth to be had through just simply living, rejuvenating that youthful optimism to enjoy every day as a chance to see and do something new.



The Simplicity of the Here and Now — Living Life To The Fullest

[ img1080() ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJn1F7X6jR8&list=PL85DCZiQaoaWI7cEOcDSlmAJxYnR9pBB&index=5)

Last but most certainly not least, this is what I consider the central pathos of this series, and what is the culmination of all the previously mentioned overarching themes. Above all else, Non Non Biyori creates an appreciation for living in the moment. To accept the transient nature of time and place, yet forever cherishing the present all the same. Because with every episode and every scene, all of its characters are doing just that — nothing more, and nothing less. That's all this series needs, and nothing that it doesn't. A beautiful simplicity that has the privilege of eluding tidy description.

Such an exuberant and excitable childhood most certainly won’t last forever. The streets and scenery you once saw with overflowing enthusiasm may one day fade. The way you see the world will one day change, and will continue changing for as long as you are. Non Non Biyori persists and persists, wearing its heart on its sleeve in telling the viewer that all of this is... okay. It's all going to be just fine — this current moment certainly is, and so too will the multitudes more to come. It’s an exceedingly simple message, but one that is filled with so much love, care, and gratitude for the little things in life.

As expected in a slice-of-life anime, the cast of Non Non Biyori aren’t doing anything world-changing. They’re going to school, playing and hanging out with each other, exploring Asahigaoka for the hundredth time, and maybe even just sitting around just relaxing. But what makes all of what life has to offer for our main four so special is that they choose to view it as such. It might not be world-changing, but the right outlook is life-changing. The poignant silences between dialogue, the serene aspect-to-aspect transitions, the episodic nature of the show; everything about Non Non Biyori all centers on this incredibly earnest idea to live life to the fullest, no matter what it has to offer. It really is just that, but the journey that this show takes you on to convince you of the power of this message is one that resonant, and it's impossible to reject its invitation to imbue this message inside your heart.



Conclusion

I could go on and on and on and on — for hours and days — about all of the various reasons I love this anime so much, and I’ve tried to articulate them in a discursively concise manner. But try as I might, I'll have to emphasize that you, the reader, can only truly relate to this praise and witness these intangibles for yourself by watching this beautiful series.

This review, of course, was aimed at getting you to watch this series that I love dearly, but having finished it and reading everything back, it is above all else my love letter to Non Non Biyori and why I will forever cherish it. I can only hope that some of my words and feelings resonated with you, and maybe you’ll pick up this amazing show as a result.

Thank you, Non Non Biyori, from the bottom of my infinitely fulfilled and full heart ❤️

Thank you for reading:)"
117612,"The anime follows the seemingly uninteresting eighteen-year-old Kazuya Souma whose parents have long passed, with his grandfather being the most recent and last of his direct family members to follow, leaving Souma alone. The anime’s introduction is a lot subtler compared to most of its isekai counterparts, but the very same introduction does a good job of outlining how alone Souma is and why he has little left to live for currently. This then sets up what happens next very nicely.

Kazuya’s mundane life is quickly interrupted when he is summoned to another world by the Elfrieden kingdom, which is in dire need of financial management. The Kingdom is under heavy pressure to grant financial aid to the empire to help its efforts in securing victory over the rampaging demon army. Unfortunately, the Elfrieden kingdom does not have the means to do this, so instead of trying to come up with a solution, they summon a “Hero” to pawn off to the empire, hoping it’ll solve their issue. Of course, Souma prefers not to be used as a bargaining chip, so he cleverly comes up with a solution to gather the necessary funds. He does such a good job, in fact, that he’s promoted from hero to king when the currently ruling king decides he’s more suited for the job than him and even goes a step further by forming a royal engagement between Souma and his daughter (no doubt to keep the royal bloodline).

As you can probably guess, while the anime starts out slow and somewhat unremarkable, it quickly changes pace as our protagonist leaves his homeworld and lonely life behind to start a new one with breakneck speed. Some of Souma’s very noticeable traits are his diligence and logical, calculating mind. The anime shows us how he uses these traits masterfully, like how he quickly assessed the situation when he arrived and how he created a plan that’ll benefit him the most in the situation. We’re then clearly shown the process of how he executed said plan.

Souma easily gathers the aid money by selling off very specific treasures that hold no historical significance to the kingdom, which was a simple yet admittedly brilliant way of resolving the kingdom’s more pressing issue, which is why I like Souma as a protagonist so far. The way he uses pure calculating logic to assess and suppress his problems, monetary or otherwise, is a very desirable trait. As a realist myself, I tend to be more drawn to characters who use their skills in deduction rather than sheer idealism seen with most anime protagonists.

Souma may not look like a hero, but he’s most certainly one. Not one with great physical prowess, broken godly powers, or even a smartphone but one of sheer calculation and wit, and he’ll use those skills to save the kingdom he’s become the reluctant ruler of. We’re shown this in the second episode when he uses his new found magical abilities to do paperwork more efficiently, which I found funny as it speaks a lot about his character.

Aside from highlighting its main character, the anime also gives us a tiny glimpse of its world which is the usual mix of fantasy elements in a renaissance setting not unlike other anime in the genre. However, this is the very same reason I find its world-building to be lackluster since it copies the same isekai tropes we see every season.

As for the animation, J.C. Staff’s character designs are still as expressive and impressive as ever, especially during a funny scene near the end of the first episode. The episode’s direction also does an excellent job of contrasting the two parts of Souma’s life thus far. Overall, How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom is an excellent start to my summer anime season. The premise is original and interesting, and the protagonist is an outlier among others, securing itself as one anime I’ll definitely be keeping my eye on this season."
117448,"Whats up everyone, i wanted to talk a bit about this anime so i wrote a whole review.



If you liked season 1, you are going to like this one. Filled with fan service, some good jokes, op MC, and a bigger harem ofc.

Plot

The story mainly revolves around Lumachina the high priest of the Church of the Divine Beings and how she scaping from a corrupt Paladin sent to kill her, Diablo our MC randomly finds her and after ""defeating"" said Paladin, helps being an escort in the journey of Lumachina.

Lumachina


So the whole season is basically a trip to help citizens exploited by the church and discover why she´s being persecuted, with some other weird sub plots and a Final/Boss Battle. 

Like you imagined for the title (if you havent seen the first season) this anime is REALLY HORNY and for what i´ve seen the manga is a lot more HORNIER. So if you dont like ecchi and stuff like that you are going to despice it. 

Personally i just found myself binging the seasons, its good for people just want to laugh at silly stuff and doesnt want a complex and bigger story.

I´ll admit it.... i was kind of horny at some momments in both seasons

Music

The music is ok, nothing fancy but it does the work. The intro and ending are good ngl.

Character/World Design

The designs of the girls are interesting tbh, the only complain i have in that aspect is that i dont like sexualized lolis, but well this isnt the worst out there by any stretch. The best one has to be Fanis, the leader of the desert town and Rose, Diablo´s Robot Maid inside his Dungeon.

The world although being your average fantasy world has some unique and interesting stuff like:

-The concept of the barrier of the City where Diablo lives, is almost unbreachable if Celestine isnt in danger.

-The design of the dunes and the town, a kind of refreshing look, because most of the series occurs in green zones/cities.

-The looks of the Capital of the Empire, typical but with an interesting design, specially the Church headquarters one of the most creative buildings in all the series.

-The weird but silly Diablo´s Dungeon that looks like a Drunk version of The tumb Of Nazarick from Overlord.

Conclusion

In Summary, a decent series for people wanting a relaxed commedy that doesnt take himself seriusly, filled with ecchi, some interesting world building, weird stuff and other things for the style.

 Perfect for a watch with all the family!

323,"Paranoia Agent is a cult classic series that is primarily known about thanks to its short run on [adult swim] in the early 2000's. Unfortunately, its low episode count, difficult-to-digest nature, and less-than-stellar dub prevent it from attaining the superstar status that other shows like Dragon Ball and One Piece enjoy. 'Tis a sad reflection of the fact that, as the two animated incarnations of Fullmetal Alchemist proved, the audience at large is more interested in arbitrary face-punching than in food for thought. But if I started on that, I'd be at this all day. The point is that Paranoia Agent, as with anything touched by the late and great Satoshi Kon, is anime not only as entertainment, but as an art form.

...

Writing: Those who are familiar with my other reviews already know that writing is by an extremely wide margin the most significant (some might say the only) factor in my judgement of a series. It should come as no surprise, then, that Paranoia Agent boasts damn near the best in the industry. Death Note trembles, Baccano! bows, even Ghost in the Shell must pay respect to the concrete-but-interpretive, grave-but-whimsical, layered-upon-layered-upon-layered narrative of Paranoia Agent. As a series that originated from a series of unused ideas too short to be adapted into films, it's an incredible achievement that Kon is able to work the seemingly-episodic narrative together into a whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Not only this, but such that there's an awesome amount of depth to the delivery such that--on an anecdotal note--I pick up on something new each and every time I re-watch the series, like the significance of the title Happy Family Planning being placed as a brand on a package of condoms as an allegory for the plight of that episode's trio, or the subtle foreshadowing of Tsukiko's secret as early as the first episode.

A good writer knows how to make his plot, setting, and circumstance work for him, and Satoshi Kon does this in spades. As the mysterious Lil' Slugger/Shonen Bat begins to feed on the rumors and paranoia of the cityfolk, suddenly all of their seemingly-disconnected experiences, and even a series of completely fabricated tales of the inline menace, begin to show great significance. Paranoia Agent illustrates flawlessly how even the smallest choices in life are still choices, and choices have consequences. The contribution of humans, as individuals, to a far greater whole affects all of us in ways we rarely think about, and (this is especially apparent in the introductory montage of various people avoiding their responsibilities) we are all individually responsible for the whole that results from our contribution. The series is an anthole: The further down you dig, the more intricacies you find, and the more complex you learn the whole to be.

Animation: True to Satoshi Kon's style, the visual production values on the series are extremely high for its era, and remain well above average today. A generally very realistic, true-to-life art style beautifully animated to mimic the human form, Paranoia Agent is symbolic of what has always been to me the selling point of animation: the ability to portray any world you want to, even the real world, without being limited by the confines of real world physics. Satoshi Kon is historically a master of this, as he employs some incredibly creative and experimental animation and composition techniques [that have influenced the entire film industry](http://moviepilot.com/posts/2705285), taking place in a very realistic animated world not unlike our own, but injected with just a little bit of the supernatural. Movement is fluid and seamless, and the characters all breathe personality without having to be identified by wacky getups.

Sound: As may or may not be common knowledge, I've always been partial to dubs. And like anyone who was introduced to the series through [adult swim], the dub was the first version I saw. My immense respect for the series extended to the dub until my last watchthrough, where I took a step back and realized that the dub is very mixed in terms of talent. The veterans like Michael McConnohie, Michelle Ruff, and Liam O'Brien all bring it home beautifully with stellar performances on all fronts, but much of the show's other talent, and especially the newer folks, leaves much to be desired. There's a big difference in quality between main characters and bit characters, whose voice lines are at times abysmally performed. And of course, because Satoshi Kon's work is so thorough with its animation, going beyond the typical anime technique of nondescript three-frame mouth flaps, the detailed lip movements conflict with the English dialogue at times, creating a Gojira effect. The subbed version is, of course, absent all these issues. There are still some terrific deliveries from McConnohie and O'Brien in the dub, though, so go with your preference.

The music comes from Kon's standby composer, Susumu Hirasawa, and while not the best listening music (I own the soundtrack), fits the show to a T. From the wonky brass to the abstract synth, the strange and unsettling nature of the show's events is captured flawlessly, and with plenty of theme variation, as well. Speaking of, the somewhat infamous theme song is a disturbing earworm if ever one existed, with an opening sequence to match.

...

Satoshi Kon is a legend among anime directors for a reason, right alongside the likes of Hayao Miyazaki and Katsuhiro Otomo. Paranoia Agent is a triumph of animation celebrating all that he represented in his work, and this 13-episode series is required watching for anyone claiming to be an anime connoisseur. It's a psychological thriller like you've never seen before."
126546,"Story
Not a bad story overall but lacking in execution and a bit jarring with how time flows between events. The setup of the plot in the beginning is good even though it differs somewhat from the original source but ends up failing a bit with how the characters behave and how the entire conflict and resolution unfolds, it's very lacking. And the same pattern forms for the rest of the anime where it begins well with the setup but ends up with a very forgettable plot where things are feel like it's happening for the sake of following a script, not a story that's unfolding naturally. Looking back at the entire thing, it doesn't feel like it's a bad story just that it could've been better if it was executed with more care I think.

Characters
I already mentioned a bit about the characters in the story portion of the review which is character behaviour being a bit lacking. What I mean with character behaviour being lacking is their reaction to events and certain scenarios. I don't expect perfection, of course, but there would be times where I would fine myself wanting more of a reaction by the character due the circumstances because it would be more natural but instead they are either too stiff and overly done or made to be too flat, MC being a main example. On a more opinionated comment towards the characters, it felt very cliche and overly done trope, especially for the main female characters. It's based on preference and how everyone perceives it is different but I find it as a detriment to the story when a certain trope is being done that sacrifices character likability and world building, namely the last portion of the anime.

Setting and World Building
This is also another area where the anime seems to struggle but has some good points to mention. The places where the MC visits and gets involved with are nice to see and interesting, a lot of it shown through the art and design which is great to see. However aside from the design, the world doesn't feel contiguous, as in it doesn't feel like it's set in the same world or plane of existence. The MC travels from place to place but we only see glances of the travel terrains which is great but there's no sight of civilization anywhere in those places. The cultures and appearances are well done, it is convincing that it's a different place just by seeing the architecture and clothing of the people in the land. The kingdom where MC starts in is not well done though, it is not convincing that it is a powerful kingdom and it's very difficult to understand how it's so prosperous witnessing all the events that happen around the MC. A princess of the kingdom is kidnapped right under their noses and their nobles run rampant in the capital doing whatever they want without repercussion, not even inside the royal castle are they put under watch even as hired soldiers in the army. To give an example, like Charles being able to execute torture and interrogate the MC even when direct soldiers are dispatched to watch over the kid and not treat the kid poorly, that all happens inside the castle and !even though punishment is delivered it is not only lacking it somehow doesn't even matter because the story wills it so later on without a proper explanation as to how it could've happened.!

Art, Design and Animation
The art is is great, it's exceptional and very pleasing to see along with the designs of the settings and the characters! The animation is only okay, it's not something I would write home about but it's not so bad that I would stop watching it, the same could be said about the fight scenes. I think the art and character designs were the more outstanding points of the anime, it's quite above average with how beautiful, stunning the characters were, yes male characters too, and how attractive and cute they appear.

Sound and Music
This was also an unexpectedly well done part for the anime, it was kind of awkward in the beginning due to how epic the start of the ending song is but the music choices were great, I loved the OP and ED. As for the sound effects and BGM during the anime, they were not disturbing and sounded fine alongside what was happening on the screen.

Conclusion
I think this anime was done fine, it's not something that I would recommend everyone and anyone but if asked for an isekai harem with an OP MC then I would at least mention this one. I found myself just watching the entire anime and not feeling like I want to stop, just up to the last 2 episodes at least where I found myself more annoyed than uninterested with the plot. So if you are looking for something to watch and you like or don't mind cliche stories with cliche tropes then Seirei Gensouki is a fine watch."
20607,"I remember a few years back, when I was discussing anime with someone in a year above mine at my school, that the discussion had turned to what we believed were the worst anime of all time. We discussed the usual that everybody brings up. Mars of Destruction, Boku no Pico as well as the then recently released second season of Tokyo Ghoul. As we kept discussing this topic, the other person, let's call him, ""Light Novel Trash Lover"" (as he kept telling me Infinite Stratos and SAO were the best anime ever made and he even came to school cosplaying Kirito a couple of times, complete with the dual swords and everything; how the hell he was let in was beyond me) then brought up Ping Pong: The Animation as being one of the worst anime ever. Struck with both surprise and curiosity I asked him his reasons why, for, at the time, I had only seen three episodes and had really liked what I had seen. Light Novel Trash Lover then told me that, ""Ping Pong is the worst anime of all time because the animation and art style is terrible!"". And this little story sums up why I believe Ping Pong The Animation is so overlooked within the anime community, which is a shame too, since many are missing out on perhaps one of the greatest sports anime of all time, and one of the best in this past decade of anime. Of course, disliking an anime's art style is not inherently bad, but dismissing the entire show as being bad, based off the art style seems pretty silly. 

Regardless of such, Ping Pong The Animation has recently become one of my favourite anime ever! It's a show less concerned about the sport, and more so a character study of its cast, filled to the brim with interesting and clever allegorical writing and symbolism, from one of the most critically acclaimed and respected directors working today, Masaaki Yusa! So let's grab our ping pong bats, taste some of our blood (as it tastes like iron, y'know) and allow me to explain why I believe this show to be a masterpiece!

""The hero comes. The hero comes. The hero comes. Chant these words in your mind, and I'll surely come to you..."" 

Reciting these lines in his mind, one of our protaganists, nicknamed Smile, fights on in each and every one of his ping pong matches, along with his friend, nicknamed Peco. Both boys have grown up together, bonding ever more closely over their shared passion of ping pong and, after growing older and reaching high school, both begin to play in tournament matches. The show sees them both grow, not only in their ping pong abilities and skills but also more so as people as well, as they influence the players who go against them, who, in turn, also have their own mental hang ups.

Ping Pong's narrative, if anything, will not surprise you with any grand plot twists, and is, at its most fundamental level, a standard sports narrative. However, what makes the show shine so much is its well developed cast of characters, symbolism and amazing directing. Another thing that helps to make Ping Pong so much fun to watch from an entertainment perspective alone is how well paced the entire show actually is. The narrative is always pushing forward in some way, introducing new plot threads and mental dilemmas for its characters while also wrapping up several older ones at the same time, keeping the anime fresh and interesting. Another thing that makes this otherwise standard story so great is the how attached we become to both Peco and Smile as characters, generating intrigue from the audience, and many of the ping pong matches are exciting to watch since the narrative does a good job at creating narrative stakes and tension. The best example of this is the match between Weng and Kazama, where, if Weng loses this match, he will not be able to return to his home country of China, which makes the proceeding absolute beat down of his character in the match all the more emotionally gripping. The entire show is just very tightly written, with visual symbolism and motifs as well as well developed themes and ideas, used in many cases in order to convey more about the characters and what they're feeling without the use of dialogue to masterful effect, which I will be getting more into in a moment.

The crux of the show is certainly the relationship between Peco and Smile, and how each one of them develops throughout the course of the show. What's particularly interesting about their relationship is the juxtaposition of their personalities. Peco is rather upbeat, cocky and is highly motivated to become the best in ping pong while Smile is much more quiet and is referred to as being a robot with no emotions by his peers and the people who go against him in matches. In fact, his name, Smile, was given due to him rarely smiling (which we later learn was actually given to him by Peco after seeing how much Peco enjoyed playing ping pong as a kid). 

Smile's character is all about learning how to enjoy the game of Ping Pong once again and break away from the robotic play style and mould he has been using for many years. The reason as to how Smile achieves this is through Peco's involvement in his life. Thus Peco is Smile's hero; the salvation he needs to enjoy the sport he holds so dearly once again, which results in some fantastic cathartic pay off at the end of the series. The motif of the hero, as well as the idea of flight is a consistent theme in the show and is used often to convey how character's are feeling too, with the depiction of a hero with wings being the representation of Peco. During the final match between Peco and Smile, as Smile begins to break free from his robotic play style, we see an image of a bird flying freely through the sky, representative of Smile's newly gained freedom. 

Peco's energetic play style and massive love for ping pong ends up being the salvation of other players too, in particular, to Kazama, who had devoted his entire life to a strict training regime in order to win at ping poing and to further his career. However, his constant winning also leaves him isolated and secluded, as he frequently finds comfort in hiding in bathrooms before playing a game. In the penultimate episode of the show, we see visual imagery of the hero, in other words Peco, extend a hand to Kazama, before taking it back and smiling at him. Kazama then grows wings himself, and flies after the hero, looking down at the bathroom he used to hide himself in signalling that his character has indeed grown, and he is now able to enjoy ping pong once again, reflected in his changed attitude in the game he is playing. 

More evidence that Peco is indeed Smile's hero comes from the line ""Iron tastes like blood"" which I referenced a little earlier in this review. The idea is that iron and blood are two juxtaposing elements, both representative of the contrast in personalities between the two characters. Blood is something that is alive, something that is moving, representing life, thereby linking into the idea that Peco is a hero and plays ping pong because he loves it, while the iron, which is associated as being cold and metallic is representative of Smile's character and play style. The idea that Peco tells Smile that ""Iron tastes like blood"" could be seen that Peco is trying to make Smile see that he is more human than Smile, and everyone else, believes. Another piece of symbolism used to contrast their characters are the use of the star and the moon, both typically found on each respective person's item of clothing or on their ping pong bats. The star is used to represent Peco, always full of life and shining brilliantly, illuminating everyone around him, fitting into the hero motif, while the moon is used to represent Smile, an object that has two sides to it: the dark side and the light side, representing the change that is going to take place in his character.

Some clever visual imagery is used in regards to Peco's character when he throws his bat into a river, which has the star symbol on it, signifying that Peco's light, and ambition is now no more. And there are plenty of these visual motifs in this show, all of which are used to showcase or add onto characterisation, making for some of the most interesting characters I've seen before in any show, most of which are rather relatable which drives the emotional weight of the characters even more. Each theme and motif in ping pong is integrated into the narrative in order for us to learn more about the characters. Take for example, the motif of the butterfly in regards to Smile's coach, Koizumi, or the theme hard work being crushed under natural talent in the case of Sakuma in his match against Smile. 

Ping Pong also has one of my all time favourite soundtracks with each track fitting the theme and personality of a character perfectly. The opening is damn great and never fails to get me pumped up while, at the same time, sprinkling in some lyrics relating to the motif of flying in the show. Peco's theme is fast paced, frantic and fun, mirroring his character and the motif of a hero, and is used to fantastic effect during his match with Kazama. In contrast, Kazama's theme is foreboding and powerful, representing Kazama's strength, which is used amazingly during his match with Weng, that I briefly touched upon before. 

I'd also like to use this match as an example of how great and imaginative the animation can be at times too. As previously mentioned, this match has a lot of narrative stakes since it is the final chance for Weng to get back into China after being kicked off the Chinese team, so as an audience, we sympathise more so with him, and want him to succeed. However, what follows, is an utterly hopeless beat down, and the entire match feels helpless. Just as much as Weng is feeling desperate, so do we an audience member, and the anime conveys this feeling of helplessness with fantastic visuals of Kazama towering over Weng, signifying their difference in skills and talent, as the ping pong table itself stretches out, emphasising this idea. Not only that, but every time Kazama hits the ball, a streak of purple lighting is used to convey the power and lighting fast reflexes Kazama retains. In addition, we also see him depicted as being a giant, again, referencing his raw strength, but also the colour used is important as well: purple. In Ping Pong, the colour purple is used to represent those respected in the world of ping pong, as both teachers of Peco and Smile frequently wear shirts with some shade of purple and the highly influential academy Kazama attends is also largely purple. 

Taking this idea of purple, and applying it to this situation, makes for an interesting idea when we see Kazama transform into a giant purple dragon. Dragons are typically associated with Chinese culture, the place where Weng is trying to get back to, and having Kazama transform into a dragon is symbolic of his team who turned their back on them and the idea that he will never reach them ever again. The use of the purple signifies that they're respected in the world of ping pong, and the lack of any purple on Weng represents the idea that he will never get there again. 

The entire show is loaded with this much visual imagery and creative metaphors and is so insanely dense that it would be impossible to talk about it all, which is what makes the show so insanely well crafted and interesting to watch for anyone who loves creative animation. The animation as a whole is incredibly fluid and, at times, rather bouncy and energetic. I also love the art style too, albeit, if it can sometimes look jarring or wonky at times; it was never enough to pull me out of the overall experience however. 

When it comes down to it, Ping Pong is a hard series to summarise and talk about because of how dense and how well constructed everything is. I could go on forever about what I personally think the show is trying to say and what each element represents, but I believe part of the fun of this show is trying to piece and make sense of everything for yourself, and if there is anything of what I said, you think is misinterpreted or just flat out wrong, please feel free to tell me. After all, all the analysis is just from my mind. Ping Pong The Animation is a marvel. A great example of what can be accomplished in animation and a true testament that a simple idea can become a wonderful show. It's characters are very well developed and the allegorical meaning behind what each represents are interesting, the music is fantastic, and overall, this is one of the best experiences I've had with a show ever. With that all said and done, thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I'll leave you with my favourite quote from the show:

""We're alive, and that's why we're happy..."""
2993,"Here it is. My absolute favorite anime/manga series, Rosario + Vampire. I've seen this show beginning to end MANY times, and a lot of my friends are confused about why such a low rated anime sits so high on my list (Average score of only 63/100? Ouch!). Here are a few reasons why.


Tsukune Aono:

In absolutely any other anime, this character would be my least favorite and most hated on character ever. He's generic, forgettable, and lacks any defining character traits other than being 'good '. However, there is a method to their madness. Tsukune isn't what the viewers are here for, it's a harem anime. We're here for the BABES. Accepting this and getting this character to the sidelines as quickly as possible while still being understood by the viewer is one of the most important tasks they had in ensuring the focus is on the women. Self-insert and get over it. (This doesn't apply to manga Tsukune)

img220(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20131008195131)



The Babes:

THIS is what we are here for. Honestly, I was satisfied with the selection of waifus avaliable to me in this harem (Of course Inner Moka is the clear winner, but still). All of the girls have at least a serviceable reason for being attached at the hip to Tsukune your OC. The only one I have a problem with personally is the little witch girl. Should be pretty obvious why. 

img220(



Moka Akashiya: 

I love this character. Definitely steals the show, and gets the most love from the writing department. A lot of the drama is only high school level lovers' quarrels, but I feel that the cream of the crop of that is the drama involving Moka (Inner and Outer). The dynamic of 2 personalities in one body isn't something I've seen before in a harem, and although this isn't the place to find any Steins;Gate tier analysis of the idea it is interesting in the show. 

Also, Inner Moka is definitely the best waifu in the show AND the manga. I loved both her depictions and I will continue to announce loud and proud that Inner Moka is most definitely the best girl. 

img220()



Animation and Music:

Animation in this show is pretty good. They effectively communicate the power of Moka's kicks, and the weightiness of the female ensemble's breasts. The backdrops are pretty good too, they feel perfectly in place with the horror charm of Yokai Academy. 

The music and sound design of the show is good as well. I'll admit though, after 7 total viewings of the anime it's begun to wear down on me. I wish there was more of the violin pieces.



Conclusion:

Lets be honest here. Objectively, this show can't hold a candle to any show with intelligent writing worth it's salt. However, I've never seen anything like it. This show is funny, and the charm shines through even in the anime (which is just fan service filler because they could never cram 120 something chapters of the manga into this show). If your looking for light-hearted harem comedy, this is probably the best it gets.

I watched this show as a lonely, depressed, and horny high school freshman, and I can still laugh at it as an adult. There's definitely some heavy nostalgia bias involved, but not the kind where I can't watch it to avoid changing my opinion. I hope there's someone else who knows what I'm talking about."

I've watched this 2 years ago, I don't remember everything precisely so somethings may be a little off

Story

It's not the most original story, but it was well done. the story starts with Rokuro Enmado, who is 14 years old(I think), and an exorcist who quit because of an tragic incident that happened in his past. One day, he meets Benio Adashino, who happens to be an exorcist too. dragged into a fight with a Kegare, an evil spirit generated from humans negative emotions, seeing Benio fighting desperately, he has no choice but to fight.

And those two, according to a prophecy are called ""Twin Star Exorcists"", who are bound to have a child that will save the world and clean off all the Kegare. Struggling between following the prophecy and their desire to choose their fate.
 
The story had some really emotional scenes, and their past wasn't trying too hard to be sad, it works perfectly.

I really enjoyed the character development on these two, they started really dull, developed emotions for each other, Supported each other, cried together, I really liked it.

Art

The art wasn't the best, but it was unique, Studio Pierrot did a really good job on the fight scenes, but my personal favorites were their emotional scenes, the mix of the animation and the sound and the dialogues is really moving and enjoyable.

Sounds

There were really good sound tracks, played at really good times, emotional, funny or action full, Also really good openings, the 3rd is probably my favorite, knowing the story behind the scenes in it makes it way better.

Characters

There're some likable characters, the two protagonists, and there's Rokuro's teacher, Seigen Amakawa, who's proabably my favorite character, his child-hood friend Mayura Otomi, who happens to not be as annoying as all the other child-hood friends, they also get introduced to the ""Twelve Guardians"", powerful exorcists in charge of keeping world peace.

Overall

Overall, it is a really enjoyable show, filled with romance, comedy, action and sadness, really good cast of characters and a good moving plot, I strongly recommend it."
147103,"oh spoilers btw (tldr the show sucks)

Shoujo anime like this are exactly why people have negative opinions of the genre. It is exactly as trite and boring as detractors of the genre say a work like this would be.

I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, but it was mostly for all the baffling writing decisions. The first episode see her in company with Kouji and you'd think they'd be the ones to get married since they have an amicable relationship and he is the only one to love her inspite of her poor status and familial trauma... only for the end of the episode she gets shipped off to some rich mysterious long haired boi and she completely forgets about Kouji.

Kouji is left with the blonde bitch and he still makes it work cause he always does his best why did they have to do my boi dirty :(

Now the show is called ""my happy marriage"" so you'd expect whoever guy she ends up with she's gonna have a great time with and they lived happily ever after. But u need conflict in ur show, like...

-Ur mean older sister wants ur man so ur family closes ur arranged marriage
-Some secret posh relative kidnaps u with invisible men and locks u in his mansion
-Mysterious ghosts start appearing out of nowhere and now u can enter ur husbands dreams for some reason

It's was honestly really funny to see the end of each episode where they look longingly into each other eyes, then cut to some evil guys with a smirk being like ""oh i'm gonna RUIN this marriage AHAHAHA""

It's not like I'm that invested in watching these cardboard cut outs make out. Kiyoka is a rich guy whos awkward with manners and super shy but like totally a cold mature man as well. Kaya is the blonde girl that is a total bitch which is the most american thing a japanese person could write. The elders are either rich old men that want to protect their money and status or super supportive nannies and house cleaners. And the military dudes mean nothing to me because they didn't need to be in the plot in the first place.

The worst offender has to be Miyo, because her entire character is being in love with her husband. Lazy romance writing in general, especially for women, is to make them solely dedicated to their partner. These kinds of tropes need to be left in the past, the experiences of women in media always intrigue me so it sucks that the writers squandered this character only to make just another cookie cutter trad wife.

There's no exploration of her experience in a feudal society, she has no qualms of her being tossed around from family to family like a hot potato, her backstory only retcons her own experience from a lower status by saying ""she was special the entire TIME"" GTFO with that shit.

The animation was good, was made by the same studio that made the Revue Starlight movie, but to what end? It's a shame to see such talent be waste on such a forgettable series.

In conclusion this was fun to laugh at, every scene I just said ""this is SOOO corny"" like I had never seen a show like this before :O so of course im tuned in for the next season. Can't wait for a rich girl to come in an say ""uh i knew kiyoka for like EVER so ur totally not for him"" or some other trite shit

But hey if you enjoyed it, good for you"

Review + What went wrong in this anime:
The anime isn't the best anime but it's not the worst either (only for the ecchi/funny moments). The story is normal, nothing special you might find some plot twist but as I said before there is nothing so special, the anime also covers the background of the characters a little bit. About the characters there is nothing too special about their weapon (except the protagonist having a shield and another one that I won’t say due to spoiler), each of them has strengths and weaknesses. The music is good but only the Opening and the Ending. The soundtracks, sound effects, animation (except op), drawings and visual effects are normal; there is nothing special to tell about it. For me this anime is missing something about the main story that could have been a lot more interesting. I didn’t expect a lot from the first season but I wanted more than the anime showed. They could have made interesting weapons, story and abilities, the only thing that made me keep watching this anime was the funny and ecchi moments (and fanservice), and the anime also didn’t have anything special to make it stand out from the others. Also pretty most of the other characters could have been so much more instead, they are just standing there as punching dummy, fighting or giving some ecchi moment.

Final comment:
 If you want to watch something and don't care about what you want you can watch this (ONLY IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE or if you search for ecchi/funny moments in the anime you watch), but if you want something that is interesting look for something else this is nearly trash. The trailer was good and one of my friends suggested this anime to me when I was searching for an anime to watch, so I give it a try just for this, sadly at the end it was better not to judge a book by the cover. It might be better if a season 2 come out (that won’t come out) with more storyline. If you want there is a light novel and the manga (I didn’t read them) those might be better (MAYBE).

Score for my POV (if you want to see them):
Story: 4/10
Characters: 4/10
Music (Soundtrack, Songs inside the anime, Opening, Ending): 6/10 (just for the opening)
Sound Effect: 5/10
Drawings: 5/10
Visual Effect: 5/10
Animation: 5/10
I can't give more than 50 (this count as 5/10) and I give it just for mercy.

P.S. Sorry if my English is bad, It’s not my native language and if this review is bad in anyway (I usually don't write reviews), anyway I hope this was useful for someone. Thank You for reading this."

Having set the gold standard for action sakuga with [One Punch Man S1](https://anilist.co/anime/21087/One-Punch-Man/), Creator [Shingo Natsume](https://anilist.co/staff/118928/Shingo-Natsume) is arguably one of the most well-trusted talents in the industry today. So here we are presented with something completely out of left field: an original series, written and directed by Natsume himself. Creative freedom is naturally to be expected, yet Sonny blows any and every expectation out of the water regardless. Photorealistic visuals are ditched entirely in exchange for the abstract. The unrefined and sometimes unidentifiable visual aesthetic feels less ""Madhouse"" and more reminiscent of [Science SARU](https://anilist.co/studio/6145/Science-SARU), no doubt due to Natsume's experience with storyboarding under the tutelage of [Masaaki Yuasa](https://anilist.co/staff/100068/Masaaki-Yuasa). The community isn't exactly raving over the animation cuts the same way that viewers hyped up OPM back in 2015. That being said, the free-flowing animation and imagery Sonny manages to conjure up makes for brilliant eye-candy. Sound design adds to the odd ambiance, with a restraint that sneaks up on you during pivotal sequences. It's a weird yet refreshing approach to presentation, and an art style befitting of this cryptic show. Believe me, things are only gonna get a lot more strange from here on out.

An unexpected incident sends a Japanese high school adrift in an alternate dimension known only as ""This World"". No one knows how they got there, nor how to get out. ""This World's"" inhabitants consist only of the students stripped from the real world. There is no adult in sight. In the familiar hallways of their school campus, some people begin developing all sorts of unexplained psychic powers. Such supernatural phenomena govern ""This World"", as well as the many other worlds within this unknown universe. Featuring cross-dimensional space travel, mysterious pocket dimensions, spontaneous clones, physics-breaking landscapes and a chimpanzee baseball tournament; Sonny 's strangeness is imaginative and awesome to take in. Our ragtag classrooms of kids are tasked with making sense of this unfamiliar environment, all while doing all they can to make it back to the one World that matters: Home. Amidst the chaos and disarray is Nagara, the titular Sonny Boy. A withdrawn teenager with no powers, Sonny's got a long way to go in this new, unwanted life.




webm(https://i.imgur.com/nb4XmsD.mp4)



While weird and wild, there is a certain method to Sonny 's madness. Released from the constraints of a real world, Sonny gives a fresh take on real-life concepts through vivid imagery and allegory. Allusions to [Robinson Crusoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobinsonCrusoe) may have you believe that this is a story about basic human survival, but Sonny soon reveals itself to be more akin to a sci-fi [Lord of the Flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LordoftheFlies). The portrayal of groupthink is heavily present throughout the series, as the teens latch onto beliefs and narratives in order to make sense of ""This World"". The introduction of random psychic powers for a chosen few also results in a discussion on class identity. Elite powers that distort space and reality are possessed by the strong and fawned over by the weak. The uncanny nature of certain abilities are seen as likely methods of returning to Earth, motivating followers to hail the strong as Messiah-like figures. Conversely, students who were blessed in their past life but not in ""This World"" have to cope with being valued less by peers. Finally, those who happen to be outcasts in both lives find themselves further shut-out from society. Both groupthink and class hierarchy are a few of the ways Sonny tackles the topic of social perceptions. How we see ourselves, how others see us, and how we want others to see us. The ways in which we influence others to side with us, in order to gain control in a crazy, crazy world. The stories we tell in order to quell our fears and insecurities. The ideals we cling onto, even as the rest of the world mocks our naïve beliefs. The reasons why we choose to help and hurt those around us. Sonny 's certainly a strange show, but not without rhyme nor reason. Rather, the mysteries surrounding This World are designed to take advantage of its creative setting to reflect the chaos and uncertainty of real life. Sonny is as much about This World as it is our own.




webm(https://i.imgur.com/i9QxYM8.mp4)



Instead of a huge arc, the series is made up of individual vignettes, where continuity between episodes hardly matters. Each instalment hits like cold water to the face, reigniting the disorientation Sonny has been known for since its premiere. But while we may start (and admittedly end) each episode wondering what the hell is going on, Sonny manages to impart a series of thoughtful discussions and insights with every subsequent chapter. The series doesn't shy away from thorough scrutiny of personal belief systems, science, religion and authoritarianism. Compelling themes include insecurity, manipulation, war, destiny, and regret, among other things. These broad ideas are tied together with some truly mind-bending sci-fi writing. Natsume's brilliant manipulation of space, alternate dimensions and time gives an immense sense of scale and awe to the many metaphors at play. Even if it's tough to articulate precise meaning behind Sonny 's imaginative endeavors, at least a handful of the series' spectacles are bound to leave you in awe. Watching this social commentary is made all the more fascinating thanks to the psychic society: the strong-willed optimist Nozomi, the spoiled but supportive Mizuho, the freakishly intelligent Rajdhani, the sullen superhuman that is Asakaze, and the shrewd pragmatist Hoshi; all of whom are doing their best to get by. And then we have Nagara himself, whose role is key to fully appreciating this fantastic story.

 webm(https://i.imgur.com/YOZLreD.mp4) 

Alright, I think I have a ton of explaining to do. Sure, I've thrown around big fancy terms like ""social commentary"" and whatnot. But how would you like for me to prove to you that these crazy episodes actually make sense?








!

Episode 1 is all about the ways in which people respond to crisis. We're abruptly dropped into a weird situation where a school is suspended in limbo, experiencing the shock the students must have felt when the Drift took place off-screen. Different characters and cliques all react differently to what happened, whilst we take stock of the situation through character introductions. It's crazy to see just how quickly individuals go from tampering with the fabric of reality itself to winding up with a broom in their hand as part of a cleaning roster. Great power comes with great responsibilities, and the superhuman students are quickly kept in check within a rigid social hierarchy. Discontent, envy and manipulation ensues, as factions clash over power in this new World. The show muses over how this ideal of collectivism struggles under the weight of selfish goals, as the world around these kids literally comes apart around them. Not even autocratic leaders with the sweet taste of kingship can escape the omniscient Rules, but there is a way out. Sonny seems to argue that the solution to this reality is to throw caution to the wind and run free. Embracing whimsy and pure freedom lacks logical sense, but may just be crazy enough to escape the world itself. 

The school finds themselves adrift on an island in Episode 2. This World (2.0) is governed by equivalent exchange, yet inhabited by pupils who attempt to scam the system. Mizuho has the ability to conjure up objects out of thin air. It's magic, but no universe can allow the creation of something out of nothing. This World is correcting this flaw, unbeknownst to the school. Students concerned with material gain are finding their belongings vanishing in entropy and mysterious blue flames. People want their things back, but possessions aren't the only form of power our cast craves. Nagara's neutral observation about Mizuho is rounded off as truth, causing everyone to turn their backs on Mizuho. It's advantageous to control the narrative. After all, history is written by the victors, and Hoshi is a proven winner. He won back during the student elections, when he rigged the votes so that Pony would win. He bested Mizuho when she attempted to uncover the truth, and he appears to be in the people's good graces once more by standing up to an innocent villain. Things don't go according to plan though. Power attained at the expense of others isn't magic, someone else has to pay for the gains. Perhaps then the real magic lies in stepping out of your comfort zone, even if the grass isn't greener. Life for Nagara would be a whole lot easier without having to deal with dying animals. But just because selfish abandonment occurs doesn't justify future selfish acts. It's in Nagara's act of selflessness that stops the world from burning around him, adding value to this strange World.

Episode 3 draws the curtains on society's outcasts. As social beings by nature, we all need each other. Being alone spells disaster, yet seems inevitable for some. ""Maybe the world would be better off without me."" It's a destructive line of thinking which can never account for the limitless potential you could provide in the future. Asakase, the dude who flies around for fun, resorts to putting others down in order to compensate for his failed contributions to Rajdhani's research. Mizuho is the other side of the same coin, a magician who wants to be perceived outside of her powerful abilities. Only through reinforcing strengths and covering for individual weaknesses can we get things done. But the ability to accept help and encouragement comes from within. The light finger dude had the right idea by giving himself an A-List power ranking. Finding value in yourself is the real superpower. Also, this episode gives us the first look at a Power Holdover, a concept I feel was poorly explained within the show. Sonny describes it as ""conquering"" a world, although there isn't really an opponent to these strange encounters. Basically by solving God's puzzles and learning morals, the students receive McGuffins that possibly are a tangible stand-in for knowledge.

Episode 4 has monke. Hehe, monke funni.
Fr tho, the episode is all about standing for personal convictions. Baseball died because the umpire stood by the rules. Once the perfect game was achieved unethically, there was nothing else to achieve. Standing for what is right is beautiful, and gave Nagara the motivation to swing.  Ace and his European (?) gf mention something really interesting about ""not being appreciated in This World."" This goes back to the idea of how unrealistic perceptions can let us down. Whereas Ep 3 was all about how we perceive ourselves, Ep 4 inverses it and briefly touches on how others perceive us. It must suck to be Ace, star of the baseball team in his past life, and the dude with the lamest superpower in this present one. I'd be pissed too if the only trait I had was being able to drink all liquids. The value others see in us can vary based on the circumstances we're in, and it can be painful to deal with the change in expectations. Another undesirable outcome is that of people having unrealistic expectations of you. Nagara didn't ask for his power, nor did he want others calling him a ""Savior."" But alas, that's life. And it's better to live (and occasionally fail) than to do nothing in fear of failure. Otherwise, we might find ourselves trapped behind the curtain…

It's tough to pin down exactly what Episode 5 is addressing here. The most likely target would be religion, since Aki Sensei calls to the authority of God. Alternatively, you could claim the episode is about politics, internet culture or even science. In short, this episode deals with belief systems, and what groups of people deem is right or wrong. These affiliations and cliques exist because none of us knows what the answers are. When the students decide to stand by Aki and against Nagara, it's because they found her argument to be more compelling. No one knows for certain if she's right, but the students certainly believe in Nagara less than they do in Aki. I can't exactly blame the students for siding against MC with the information they were given, because challenging the status quo is what creates progress, and the school has been stranded on the island far longer than they would like. Doubt and innovation can lead to brand new discoveries. Sometimes, the answers don't lie in accepting what other people think, but standing up for yourself can be scary. Nagara would rather be a scapegoat for a crime he didn't commit than risk causing a greater divide among the students.

Episode 6 is all about destiny. The film reels and video editing give a brand new hope for the students. Not everyone is on-board; Hoshi still feels bound by his spiritual connection with God. Oh yeah, and God's just the principal. Nothing important, it's just the way it is. Anyways, the cinema quantum-reality displacement device (a term I just made up) gives our cast the tools to create their own story. The film reel rolling like a spool of thread can be likened to Greek mythology, namely the Sisters of Fate. And that iconography hints at the conclusion of this episode. The school board a 6-sided Ark, and set off for a literal roll of the dice. Unfortunately, fate worked against them, and Nagara lost out on the 50/50. For context, Nagara is revealed to have created This World through his power, and Mizuho was in part responsible for the duplication of her entire school. This is what God refers to when he mentions that they're copies, and this theory is proven at the end of Episode 10, when it is revealed that copies Mizuho orders with her power are immortal. To top it all off, Nozomi stops seeing the Light. Heartwrenching stuff.

Episode 7 deals with submission and the resistance to change. After being captured by a coalition of other permutations of the school throughout time, Nagara finds himself in the Tower of Babel. Like its namesake in the Bible, Babel represents the hubris of man as a fruitless attempt to reach God, and is made even more pointless since the tower is building down towards the ground. It's clearly a false ideal world, and one that Nagara sees through instantly. But the people of Babel have lost all hope, submitting to even the slightest semblance of purpose in life. Change is the answer, which sees Nagara turn the world on his head and leave scot-free.

(Hi, props for reading this far. As much as I'd like to keep going, my goofy ass has a paper to work on as soon as I'm done with this review. I think my point has already been made, so I'll do one more breakdown and call it there.)

A highlight of the series, Episode 8 is a story about regret. It is unclear whether Yamabiko had a power similar to Nagara's and projected a whole new World for Kodama's crew to find, or if Kodama was a figment of his imagination. Either conclusion is grim. The codependency developed between Yamabiko and Kodama takes over his life, to the point where he manifests a dog, which is a statement both derogatory for humans and a sign of subservient companionship. However, refusing to make his own decisions caused the death of the entire town. His battle with regret was one that lasted several thousands of years, which particularly stung for me. War was introduced in this episode, and was shown as an outcast who was never accepted nor understood for who he was. He reappears in Ep 10, no longer flaunting his KDA badges.

Why keep these details hidden? Simply put, I don't think they're essential to Sonny 's core message. Plus, I kinda bit off more than I could chew as a demonstration. I'm more than sure that I've missed out on at least a couple of esoteric insights. Even the stuff that I did ""decipher"" are guesses at best; I'm pretty sure I got a ton of the sci-fi plot devices wrong. The show's design leaves itself open to interpretation, and I've seen amazing fan theories for the details Sonny refuses to say out loud. But even though dissecting Sonny 's indirect storytelling is a major source of enjoyment for me, the same can't be said for viewers who prefer a more passive engagement with their Japanese cartoons. Thankfully, I believe that audiences don't need to work too hard in order to appreciate this series, because none of what I've mentioned within the tags really matters much in the grand scheme of things. The way these metaphors are presented will confuse any viewer, but your understanding of these ideas will not largely determine whether or not you enjoy the show. If anything, there's a case to be made for the lack of explanation actually enhancing how certain scenes play out, such as the jaw-dropping mid-season finale in Ep 6. Plus, there are plenty of individual scenes carried by brilliant execution alone, thanks to an all-round solid OST and unique visual direction. Most importantly, in contrast with the vague modern allegory discussed thus far, the heart of this show is out in the open, and poignantly so. Let's talk more about the Sonny Boy himself.




img100%()



Set to the backdrop of existential dread and socio-political unrest, Nagara's coming-of-age tale brings much-needed relatability and optimism to the series. In this manner, Sonny avoids turning into a nihilist counter-culture dystopia, and instead blossoms into a story of a teen finding his place in the world. Nagara enters This World alone and in low spirits. The peak of his youth sees him lying on the floor, as time quietly passes by. Sonny's never understood the world beyond his ceiling view, and his youth has grinded to an uneventful halt. But Sonny's gonna meet friends, and slowly open up to their kindness. Sonny's gonna accept that even in a world with great thinkers and superhuman idols, he has value. Sonny's gonna believe the positive affirmation of his worth by those around him. Sonny's gonna understand that he has responsibilities - things that only he can achieve, and things he should no longer run away from. Sonny's gonna grow. Sonny's gonna grow up real fast, and learn all kinds of things. He's gonna travel the world (or should I say ""universe""), and meet all kinds of communities. Sonny's gonna observe what it's like to live bound by submission, manipulation, isolation, rhetoric, envy, vengeance, and regret. Sonny's gonna reject those convenient ways of life, and find meaning elsewhere. He's gonna change his habits of running away, seize the moment and move forward. He's gonna repay the kindness he received whenever his friends start to lose hope. Sonny's gonna hold his treasured memories tight to his chest, even amidst grief and setbacks in life. Finally, Sonny's gonna take all that he's learned and run. And maybe, just maybe, Sonny's gonna change this world.

I don't want to be mistaken for a gatekeeper here; if anything, this review is my attempt at begging readers to give Sonny a fair shot. But this written description of my time with Sonny doesn't really matter as much as whether or not you can make a personal connection with this series. People not resonating with Sonny seems to be a common case, given the number of times I've seen community comments along the lines of ""I don't get it"" or ""Should I pick the show back up?"" And I absolutely agree that Sonny is confusing, sometimes to its own detriment. The series frequently jumps back and forth between backstories, without any clear indication that any flashback has occurred. Unknown stretches of time elapse between episodes or even entire scenes, which certainly caused plenty of head-scratching for weekly viewers. Further frustrating is Sonny 's abject refusal to explain details that it deems is unimportant. Stuff can be so surreal to the point of leaving behind only a single reaction: ""Huh? "" The pseudo-science exposited in certain occasions are bound by the language barrier, justifying the fear of details getting lost in translation. And phrases that do make it in can appear cryptic and vague. All this added guesswork demands that audiences stay on their toes, while they may already be struggling to keep up with several of the series' esoteric metaphors. Even if Sonny 's confusion is intentional, that doesn't make it significantly less annoying. There is merit to shows that make stakes easily understood or take the time to explain what's going on, because at least it can consistently be appreciated on some level. Because this series doesn't lend itself to casual viewing, all bets are off. I simply can't guarantee that you will appreciate Sonny to the extent that fans and myself have. Furthermore, the recent letdown of [Wonder Egg Priority](https://anilist.co/anime/124845/Wonder-Egg-Priority/)'s conclusion probably had a part in dooming the reception of a similarly-esoteric anime-original, even if the two shows don't share many similarities aside from this comparison. Look, all I'm asking is that you give the series a chance, while knowing that there is some hidden subtext worth exploring. Probably the most disheartening reaction I've seen towards this intellectual bundle of joy is that of people disregarding Sonny as some Lord of the Flies ripoff devoid of substance, failing to recognize how this series manages to turn a somber dystopian premise into an optimistic allegory for growth and self-acceptance. I respect viewers who wish nothing more than easygoing entertainment from their anime, but Sonny is well-worth the extra effort. There is an order to Sonny 's compelling chaos, and I urge anyone interested to take up the challenge and step out of their comfort zone. Out of all the anime in 2021, no single show rewards attention, reflection, discourse or creative interpretations as much as Sonny.

At the end of the day, I can't attest to fully understanding this show. But Sonny taught me that it's OK to not know everything. The series' subject matter is dense and difficult to parse through. Yet Sonny eludes explanation and ignites imagination, all while somehow making perfect sense. Evocative animation, powerful climaxes and an uplifting story culminate for a unique experience fit for the visual medium. It was... fun.

I don't understand Sonny Boy. But I sure as hell am gonna keep trying to.

At the core of quite possibly the strangest show this year, lies a coming-of-age tale. Sonny Boy revolves around finding purpose in an unfamiliar world. Social commentary marks Sonny 's attempts at trying to understand the world our characters inhabit. Confusion within the series is rarely cynical, since Sonny keeps its head high through telling the story of Nagara's growth into manhood. Shingo Natsume's direction and script make the project truly his own, resulting in some of the most brilliantly executed moments of anime this year. The complex manner in which its ideas are communicated can be daunting to reckon with. But with the animation medium being pushed to its absolute limits, viewers might find that giving this experimental series a chance may prove worthwhile. 9/10

[Castaways, we are castaways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ulJu4cne6Y)... Thanks so much for getting lost with me through this pretentious wall of text. I only hope the journey was well worth it in the end. Before I use my ""Escape"", you know I gotta plug! If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other [reviews](https://anilist.co/user/AnimeDweeb/reviews) for seasons past and present. I also frequently post writeups under my list updates, so definitely take a peek if you'd like to see me mald over anime as they hit the airwaves. Peace"
21364,"Where to start with this anime... it's a ride, that's for sure! This review will encompass season one and season two thoughts because I watched them back-to-back on Crunchyroll (where it's made to seem like one season overall of 24 episodes), so for me it's just one big story.

Do you like military anime? Comedy anime? Harem anime? Isekai anime? Fantasy anime? Well man oh man, if you answered yes to all of that then you definitely want to watch GATE! I can't really pick a specific genre that I'd put it in, because it's just so ridiculous that it doesn't necessarily fit any true standards. I think that's why I liked it so much though, because it is so absolutely out there.

Thankfully, there is [sort of] a plot to this anime. It's extremely loose, but the key element that ties all of this together is Japan is trying to make friends with people from another world who is far behind them in technology. It's not a strong plot line, but it fits well because it thus lets the story develop in fun and interesting ways as we watch the characters evolving [a bit] and facing interesting struggles that come from two very different worlds colliding. It's probably something many of us have thought about, but few anime have really approached. Certainly even rarer that they do so in such an overwhelming way. Regardless this anime is a lot of laughs, a few serious moments, and a few moments that just make you really happy to watch overwhelming force be applied to selfish idiots.

It's not a perfect story, but it's a fun one filled with fun characters. Better yet we have a diverse cast of characters, and even though our main protagonist is surrounded by [beautiful] women, for a change we aren't thrown with the trope that he's a pervert, the women aren't (for the most part) throwing themselves all over him or having jealous fits of rage, and romance is not the actual undercurrent of the plot. It was extremely refreshing, to say the least. After a while you just get tired of the boy-meets-harem-girls-fight-over-him nonsense. There really wasn't any of that here, and in fact many of them harbor a lot of respect for our protagonist as a sort of savior (without devolving into hero worship).

At the same time we of course have our required bad guys, because this wouldn't be an anime with any action if we didn't have that. This is probably the only place that's a bit lack-luster, because the bad guys in this instance are just morons. Straight up, grade A idiots. They're not particularly a challenge, at least not at this point in the story, and that's almost a shame. For me anyways it was still fun to watch the baddies struggle uselessly against our unlikely band of heroes, so why not? Not all anime need strong opposition for the heroes to fight, sometimes you just want to watch the good guys win. And we did, and we knew we would.

Despite it having a loose plot, there are some items that needed to be tied-up that haven't been. This being the case one can only hope that perhaps there will be a season 3, but if there isn't then it's no big loss, either. Thankfully, even with a few unanswered plot points we still get a [relatively] satisfying end that does bring closure to where we are in the story, so one isn't left with an intense longing for more. Another welcome relief, because as nice as it is to get new seasons, it's also nice to not crave them to resolve a massive cliff-hanger (that leaves you on the hook for over a year, the struggle)."
141949,"Sometimes a decent narrative isn't really necessary to make an anime entertaining. Fuufu ijou primarily adopts the overdone love triangle model of a common background mc, a lovely childhood friend, and the school idol, but it does it better than others. Perhaps it's the art, the soundtrack, or the unusual screenplay in this genre. It draws you into the seemingly trivial love tale that is carried by the emotional drama that occasionally wrenches your heart despite the fact that there is probably nothing of significant note going on.

So our protagonist Jirou isn't interested in romantic relationships (mostly coz he knows he has no shot) unless they involve his childhood friend Shiori, whom he's been obsessed with since... well, since childhood. He attends a school that has a highly unusual curriculum (damn, I wish I had gone to such a school) in which students are paired up and live as married couples. Unfortunately, he is paired with the most incompatible partner possible: the school hottie Akari, who has made it obvious (although unknowingly) that she has feelings for the school's hotshot Minami. And who is Minami's partner? Shiori XD. Knowing that they both have no interest in this relationship while they pursue their love interests, Jirou and Akari decide to play lovers in order to make it to the top 5 couples in the course and trade partners. But can this act survive long enough when Akari, who is truly a beginner in love, moves in with our gentle and compassionate protagonist? Oh, the wonderful days of puberty are going to make this a rollercoaster ride.

Well, the premise isn't very impressive, and the narrative that follows isn't much better, but what drives this show are the few instances when these inexperienced teenagers struggle to manage their emotions, always questioning if what they feel is love or just an impulsive reaction. Jirou is your normal background mc, nice and generous, which is why his childhood friend Shiori adores him. Well,  Nice guys do finish last because you can't impose ""niceness"" on someone. Shiori, fortunately, is one of the few who had some imposed upon her because they were childhood friends. Unfortunately, though, mixed-up words and interpretations when she wanted to confess in middle school before she relocated to some other city ensured that we will get this anime. Shiori is your usual nice girl who is also shy... she's nothing special except that she's incredibly pretty. Akari, on the other hand, is a hot gal or atleast she tries to be. The most popular girl at school who would be every guy's fantasy if she hadn't made it plain she only likes Mr Perfect Minami kun. Akari might act as if she's really experienced when it comes to love but in reality she is very pure-hearted and very cute in her reactions to any unexpected romantic situations. And due to the course, she gets forced to experience some of that good ""niceness"" Jirou has been hiding (not in his pants but who knows XD). And I believe Akari is the one who carries this show. I love her extremely emotional monologues... her immensely charming reactions when she receives some of that ""niceness"" or when Jirou makes it known that he, too, is a man. And this theme is common even with other characters since the drama focuses on the emotional issues involving love in the young and I feel the moments involving Akari stand out the most.

Sometimes it can get frustrating how indecisive Akari can be. She almost performs the ""thing"" with Jirou at one point, but she still desires Minami. It can be difficult to understand your feelings, especially when you're going through the most turbulent period of your life in terms of hormones and attraction as you reach adulthood. I still have trouble understanding my emotions as an adult. However, it still remains quite frustrating. But it's this frustration I feel that I find really addictive. Every episode made my heart ache as she struggled with her feelings, trying to find out whether it was love. In my head, I kept yelling, ""Why are you following a guy who doesn't look back at you!"" Because of this, every moment that drew her closer to Jirou seemed so fulfilling. And I have to applaud the voice actors, artists, and animators for making those sequences so emotionally engaging. I questioned why I was even interested in this flimsy plot. But they drew me in with all their strength.

This anime reminded me of ""Kanojo Okarishimasu,"" a hugely polarizing anime I reviewed. Though there is no denying that the storyline and execution in this show are far superior... The emotional outbursts of the characters were what drew me into that show and to this one as well. I felt quite attached to them, and even if the story might be very frustrating... I feel it's only frustrating because you care about the characters and want to see them sort out the mess they're in. People that evaluate media normally deduct points for this, but I like to acknowledge that you did get me hooked and perhaps that is what matters the most.

And that is why, I'd rate Fuufu Ijou Koibito Miman an 8/10. I believe it is closer to a 7.5, but I was hooked and each episode just  flew by. I also really like romantic anime, which definitely makes me biased, so keep that in mind if you want to start this.

 I forgot completely... The ED is a BOP!!"
6347,"Baka and Test was the best comedy I've watched. Despite the cheesiness of it, it was definitely my favourite comedy I've seen. It's one of those anime's one might miss in the scramble, and once picked up, it's impossible to put down. Seriously, I couldn't remember the last time I had this much fun watching an anime. 

Reasons it was amazing:
1. Despite it's target goal of being a comedy, it also showed its viewers a dramatic side, as we see examples through how it talks about characters backgrounds (I would elaborate on this more, but most of it comes from season 2).
2. The overall tone of it was exciting. From its catchy intro, to its entertaining class battles, it never stopped getting better, making every second of it have a feeling that gets the viewer hyped up for more.
3. The characters. I was really enveloped on how a comedy such as this one was able to show its viewers the interesting personalities of its characters, since characters is usually a part of anime's like this one that's blown off. It was just amazing to me how it could be both hilarious and interesting, which is something the anime community could use.
4. The creativity. The creativity of this anime was simply impeccable, in how it was able to show us many perspectives off all the characters, while also progressing its plot. I felt like not a second of this anime was unnecessary. Either the story contributed to the comedy side of the anime, or to the plot progression of it.
5. The action. I know ""action"" isn't one of the tags listen in this anime, but when watching it, you can't help but feel action dripping down from it. Just watching the battles from each class and how Class F always has a plan, fills the viewer with this feeling of motivation. And before you know it, you find yourself cheering for this underdog class to best the top with their strong wit and tactics, even if it is meant to be a comedy.

From it's creativity, to it's hilarious moments, this is definitely an anime I highly recommend watching if you're fairly new to the anime community, or even if you've been around for a while. I feel like it's one anyone with a soul can enjoy, and it will envelope you in its story and plot progression."
20996,"All spoilers in this review are marked
In this review will mainly be focusing on the plot, so many preexisting things like the amazing OST, will sadly be glossed over  

>Gintama is a comedy. 

I don't think this statement is very controversial, and most Gintama fans would agree on this. For its first 300 episodes, Gintama was an amazing comedy with some serious episodes peppered in to keep the show going. For the majority of Gintama, the biggest worry for Odd Jobs Yorozuya is paying rent. Gintama did have some great arcs; season 3 was a shock to many, with it being a jam-packed array of serious arcs. Serious arcs in such quick succession were different to the arcs of the past, that, while incredibly entertaining, had been 4 episodes at most. However, other than that, Gintama is undoubtedly a comedy.

This season is when this changes.

But not immediately, the first arc - the time stop arc- being some of the best comedy I've ever watched, letting the audience know that they can expect the Gintama standard, and perhaps even something better. The third episode is hilarious, developing Yamazaki further, the fourth episode has no development but it's incredibly funny, the fifth and sixth episode are a hilarious arc which gives insight into the backstory of the characters and the seventh is an amazing Hijikata-Gintoki episode

Do you notice the trend?

Every episode is comedy other anime could only dream of; if I had to describe everything we would be here for a very long time but you get the drift. This season keeps the Gintama standard of amazing comedy plus great world-building every episode. 

This season is when we say goodbye to that.

260 episodes. 260 episodes of build-up, some direct, some small, but all building up to this, the day when Gintama flips the switch and becomes serious. I was excited when it was announced at the end of episode 299, but I was worried. Gintama's serious arcs were amazing, but everything was leading up to this, if it didn't work well then it would be a waste of such well-done build-up and world-building. Safe to say my doubts were proven wrong, each episode was incredibly entertaining, with enough twists to fill up a bakery. There are so many good things about the switch flip that I'll have to separate them.

OPs
In terms of symbolism, these OPs are on the smaller side, maybe making it less enjoyable for the OP enthusiast. However, in terms of hyping the viewer for the episode, they are flawless. The only word I can use to describe what the OPs made me feel is euphoria. For the hype junkie, these OPs are up there with the greats
 [The guitars at the beginning of this OP make me jump with joy ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCmdN-Rcqq8&t=0)
[This OP starts of relaxed but an alternate version made after the switch turns it pure hype for what's to come ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiDAnb9PC6k&t=0)
Arc 1
Even disclosing the name of this arc is spoilers so gloss over this and arc 2 if you haven't seen the show. !Now that only the people who have seen this are here, I don't need to explain anything, do I? It's self-explanatory, we both know how good this arc, we both know that episode 305 is an emotional masterpiece, we both know the rest of the arc is packed to the brim with content and we both know that feeling of surprise, despair and bittersweet beauty in the abrupt end to the arc. Most of all, we both know nothing was the same after this. The shogun's death most likely hit all of us very hard, he was known as the mark of quality on an episode. If you saw the shogun in an episode you would smile, and get ready for the hilarious antics that would ensue, which makes it fitting that his death represents the death of the old Gintama... !
Arc 2
! The arc starts off incredibly bleak, following the death of the shogun, we have to see the aftermath. Things look hopeless, with the Shinsengumi backed into a corner, and we have no idea who could survive, we now know nobody except the main 3 were no longer off-limits, you really thought Kondo could die. Everything on the island was great and the shock of seeing Shoyo was practically paralysing. The reveal of Isaboro is also surprising, very well foreshadowed as you notice different irregularities within his character. I don't really need to elaborate on this arc, while I prefer the first, the second is the same quality, and arguably better paced!!

That said, Gintama isn't for everyone, the comedy is different to almost any other show, and some may not like the amount of comedy, I would highly recommend it, but know that some may not like it

Overall, this is some of the best anime you will ever see, in any show, it wouldn't work, but Gintama pulls off a tone shift which any other series could not pull off. Gintama season 4 starts off as an amazing comedy and ends with an epic, spanning through almost like 40-70 of the established cast in order to tell an amazing story. If you have not watched Gintama, or haven't gotten to this season yet, please change that. After this season, Gintama has cemented itself as my favourite of all time"
153845,"“I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in The Real World, Too” enters the realm of straight up horrible and unmemorable light-novel titles, which could be excused if its contents couldn’t be described with the same adjective alongside a few other negative ones added on top of it.

Cheat Skill Isekai follows Yuuya Tenjou who is a highschool student hated by absolutely everyone including (nearly) his entire family due to him being fat, ugly, pathetic, blah blah blah (the show’s words not mine) although he is also extremely kind and nice as his grandfather taught him to be. Besides his grandfather the only person who does not hate him is a girl who he saved from some thugs which taught her he is actually very kind and nice.

The show has absolutely no substance as there is no plot. Yuuya didn’t work towards his current state, instead he just obtained it so there is no sense of progression. Everything good that happens to him after he gets his power is just handed to him with convenient events.

First convenience he gets is his superpower which he gains after accidentally stumbling across the other world behind a hidden door in his grandfather’s place. His superpower virtually destroys any and all character development Yuuya could have had by basically giving him a superpower which entirely deletes his great character flaw. His superpower just makes him jacked and super good looking from what I can deduct. Oh yea now that he is jacked and #cool everyone likes him and is amazed by him at all times.

Remember that girl he saved? She just so happens to be the president of the most elitest and richest school in town and gets him enrolled there. He afterwards just wanders aimlessly with nothing really happening besides convenient scenarios to make girls be at awe with all his new-found amazingness and coolness. In fact I would need several hands to count how many times he WALKS DOWN A FUCKING STREET AND GETS COMPLIMENTED BY COMPLETELY RANDOM PASSERBY WHO NEVER APPEAR AGAIN.

At the start of the show I wondered if this was some extremely cookie-cutter societal critique about how better looking people are generally treated better. But after the end of the second episode I remembered I was watching a show titled “I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in The Real World, Too” and also found out this is made by the same guy who wrote THE FRUIT OF EVOLUTION!??!?!? I may be spoiled right now but most authors try to convey something with their works, but apparently here’s the exception who creates works without even a thought put into fucking basic plot structure, much less an actual theme.

The animation staff probably noticed that the show has absolutely nothing of value (or more likely they just ran out of money) as the season kept going on as the animation quality has a noticeable decline into the depths of still frames of grass without an inch of movement. I do have to give credit where it’s due and say the animation quality is quite good at the start of the season and the art style stands out in a way I do not despise. Although it is not enough to make up for how abhorrent EVERYTHING ELSE is.

This show feels like an experiment to create the show with the least creativity and the most cheap ways to entice viewers. It’s truly lackluster in creating any form of emotion or even fulfilling the simple task of telling a cohesive fucking story. I hate that I will never get the time back I spent watching this. You will absolutely get more enjoyment from being lost in your thoughts while watching paint dry."
4382,"I will preface this saying I have also read most of the Light Novels.
I mean this completely unironically. I like weird shit like this so it was right up my alley. Having it last 8 episodes was one of the ballsiest artistic decisions ever made in any anime production ever and it pays off in spades. It makes Tatami Galaxy’s exploration of a time loop concept blush. This is probably one of the few instances where an anime fleshes out and explores a concept more thoroughly than its light novel source material. It legit bumps it up a number of points for me.
Honestly, I had a blast watching every single one of the episodes in that arc (and I still watch through all of them whenever I re-watch Haruhi). I get that it’s a highly contentious arc, but I genuinely do think it’s an amazing experience and genuinely manages to flesh out even minute character aspects and really puts you in the same headspace as Kyon and makes you understand Yuki that much more - essential for the Disappearance movie to have worked as well as it did.
If you’re really that blasted about “watching the same episode 8 times”, pick and choose, man - Watch 4 episodes, watch endless 8 8 times, watch 8 minutes of each episode in different 8 minute chunks. You will be losing a ton from the intended experience though.
Anime is such an interesting medium with endless possibilities. It’s really cool to see a series that actually took an artistic risk instead of having a more marketable by-the-books production that would no doubt make it more money. I don’t think something like it could release nowadays. The anime industry in the early 2000’s was a time of experimental “throw everything at the wall and see what sticks” productions. Nowadays, with animation and marketing budgets ballooning, with production committees being much “safer” with their decisions, E8 will forever remain in its own class of interesting artistic endeavours that could only happen exactly when it did. 
Honestly, with 90% of shows coming out nowadays being the exact same concepts copy-pasted, which every single season people throw themselves at loving, E8 even speaks to the state of the modern anime industry. Except E8 is an interesting unique artistic decision, while most shows nowadays are bland, safe, and with tropes and concepts you've seen explored with the shallowness of a dwarven kiddy pool time and time again (one could even say endlessly). I don’t wanna see anyone who has ever watched more than a single isekai show or VRMMO show or ecchi show or... talk shit about Endless Eight. 
Other than that, it’s Haruhi. Good stuff. Characters are fun and have surprising depth. Each arc is (usually) a self-contained story that everyone can enjoy.
50 is average, btw. 80 is an amazing score."

”You stumble, through questions
That you could never answer”



By its nature, the third Rebuild of Evangelion film offers no definitive and final statements on anything. Not on Shinji nor any of the other characters. Not on Evangelion-The-Franchise. Not on its genre or its medium. Not on broader philosophies of art or the world. Not even on the literal events of its own plot. It is, fundamentally, incomplete. As much as any piece of criticism attempts to reckon with the film, it must too reckon with this fact. To write on any part of the mainline Evangelion series is to acknowledge that what you are writing doesn’t matter and may well be entirely wrong.

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdG9ZASWoAAdnHw?format=png&name=small)

Yet, for all its incompleteness and intermittent obtuseness, Rebuild 3 does induce a wide variety of feelings in the audience. Largely not pleasant ones, either. Throughout, Rebuild 3 feels, to its core, sick, fake, cynical, wrong. Not in the same shellshocked-to-near-death sense as End of Evangelion. It is more akin to being many years into reckoning with your own neuroses, when even the breakdowns, the severed friendships and burned bridges, the self harm, and the unhealthy coping mechanisms, all of that, begins to feel as much an annoyance as anything else. It is “Oh God, are we doing this again?” in film form.

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdG1zSpX0AArt4e?format=png&name=medium)

What is “This”? As with much well-accomplished art, the Rebuild films are open to broad interpretation. Throughout, I found myself contemplating Rebuild 3’s relationships to the franchise’s broader themes dealing with the bleakest parts of mental illness, but also with the franchise itself. Certain shocks of imagery do, definitely, feel like pointed commentary on What Evangelion Has Become. A few stretches of the film feel downright sickened by the whole thing. Evangelion, in another time and place on the internet, was compared--in terms of influence on its country’s pop culture--to Star Trek. 

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdG-JY6XgAAgOUu?format=png&name=medium)

Parts of the Rebuild films and the third in particular, seem to ask if it’s been worth it. There is a reason the infamous “ME!ME!ME!” music video chose to portray its doomed otaku protagonist as having specifically Eva figurines. Conversely, you certainly don’t have to toss many stones to hit someone who’s of the opinion that Evangelion “ruined mecha anime”, it was something of a stock contrarian otaku take for years. In certain niches of the internet, it still is.

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHAEzhXgAIxKWN?format=png&name=medium)

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHAKYlWkAEbhc9?format=png&name=medium)

Intentional or not, imagery of malformed and damaged NERV logos, empty headquarters, and mass-produced plugsuit gloves cannot help but feel pointed.



Elsewhere, the film lacerates the character of Shinji so thoroughly and mercilessly that it seems to mock the very idea of a heroic narrative. This is especially true toward the film’s end, where Shinji once again fails to learn from his mistakes and once again nearly causes the end of the world. If Rebuild 3 has a major flaw, it’s perhaps that it makes it all too easy to distance yourself from Shinji. Many of us carry heavy weights on our shoulders, but certainly few of us are guilty of causing most of an apocalypse. Twice. The one moment of reprieve he gets--his relationship with Kaworu--ends in explosive death, because he cannot bring himself to trust another person. 

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHTLTIXgAEEV6U?format=png&name=medium)

The magnitude of one’s failures certainly can feel like the end times, so the impulse is understandable, but at some point this starts to all feel a bit like penance whipping. How many times do we need to watch Shinji ground to dust? He’s barely alive by film’s end, literally dragged around by the wrist by Asuka as he finally is forced to leave the tape recorder he’s clung to since the opening episodes of the original series behind. Maybe there is development in this version of the character’s future, maybe there is not. Hell, maybe he deserves all this, for his failure to rise to the occasion thrust upon him, or simply for being an abusive ass in End of Evangelion. In the moment, none of these questions feel relevant. Rebuild feels defeatist and anti-triumphant by design. It’s horrifically reductive to phrase it this way, but it occasionally feels like an evil twin of Gurren Lagann. It is a nightmarish, browbeating apocalypse. A planet, and a narrative, crucified.

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHIYSmWsAE8fDx?format=png&name=medium)

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHN8vOWAAEs3HD?format=png&name=medium)

img880(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHGdwAWoAEEmN?format=png&name=medium)

Evangelion on the whole inspires endless contemplation. Articles, websites, and so on exist that tear the franchise down to individual frames. It is a world one can get lost in, if they’re not careful, and it’s easy to gaze hopefully to the sanctioned creators--the “canonical” source of all this, whether they're Anno or not--and pray for reprieve and finality. But if the New Century Gospel needs a Book of Revelation, it’s not to be found in Rebuild 3. None of this is to detract from the film’s immense artistry. It is, by any conventional metric, a good movie. It’s just not a very inspiring one. Which, of course, is not something every film--or any film--needs to be, but it's not difficult to divine where the sharp divergences of opinion on Rebuild, and this film specifically, come from. It is easier to respect than like and easier to like than love.

The irony is that Rebuild 3’s highs and lows, are, fundamentally the same as those of the entire series. This is an anime about Shinji. I struggle to think of many other fictional characters so utterly damned by their being such. You can play the tapes over, starting from episode 1 of the original series, as many times as you like. The story in them will never change.

After we see this really op skill, Noir gets his hands on another great set of extremely op ones. His master, Olivia gives it to him and it's called Get Creative, Bestow, and Editor.

As far as I know with these abilities you can make anything that's on your mind, edit your and other people's skills and attributes and even give them powers and also get any skills that u want for LP.

Combine these with the Great Sage and you literally can do anything that you want. You could ask what is the strongest ability that you could forge at the moment and there you are.

Just imagine the endless possibilities...

But they use it like: ""Make my stone bullet 40% stronger""

>But we are talking about a harem & ecchi anime

Nothing wrong with a harem genre, I like some good harem from time to time but is it good here?

It certainly takes away from the serious part of the anime, but I've seen much worse.

There is this stuff in the anime called LP (i guess life points) which is like mana for our protagonist when using skills. And you guessed it, you can gather LP by doing lewd stuff. 

Ecchi as well because imagine how could you keep the viewers if not with ecchi? Do you say a good story? Please don't make me laugh the anime community needs ecchi, not a great story.


- - -



If you're looking for an anime to watch while there is nothing else to watch, maybe I wouldn't exactly recommend this one but it's certainly not a bad one to watch when there is really nothing better left.

I've seen a really negative review of this anime. well, he got some points but taking this kind of show seriously is a bad idea. But if you hate harem, ecchi, kind-hearted main characters, and stalling, then that rating would be closer to you.



All in all, I liked the anime more than I say it in this review, and they had some elements that you don't see in every similar anime. And also they got me with something as well because I watched the whole thing.

>And indeed it is a waste of potential, but it's a really good thing that there was potential at all.

135806,"Isekai Ojisan is too good and it's how you write an isekai ! ( Even though it's an unconventional one...)

It's the story of Ojisan, a past NEET who got isekai'd into another magical world and actually got back. He got back for a good reason : he did not enjoy it one bit.


I HATE ISEKAI 

huge bait on this section title, it's to keep you hooked
I have a problem with isekai. To explain it I must first ask and answer two questions :

- What is the point of an isekai ?
Escapism of course ! Forget about your trash boring life and embark on an amazing journey where you'll have everything you ever dreamed of : powers, 'em looks and even an harem ! Everything !

- Now, who is it aimed at ?
Otakus, NEET and hikikomori of course ! (all of them in their objective pejorative initial sense). It's for people who close themsleves off from real world and live in their own delusions. They blame everything around them but themselves, they have to, how could they accept their conditions otherwise ?

From there, you might see my problem with the genre. It helps justifying delusions and the trope setting is similar to the aimed viewers' lives, putting them even more under the illusion, creating a nasty self insertion where the viewer gets all the things he'd like to have in real life without actively working fo it. It's very much like porn. It also creates a dangerous mindset, think about it, why would you have to change if the world changes for you, Isn't it better to assume that it's the world's fault and that you're just misunderstood ? Obviously, society isn't perfect but it doesn't mean that you should cut any ties with the outside world.

I'm not even saying isekai animanga are bad or absolute trash. Tensura is one of the anime I enjoyed the most watching despite it not contradicting anything I said and there's great isekai like Mushoku Tensei that completely defies what I said about the genre. Plus, it's not an isekai-only prolem, slice of life animanga also share the same problem as I disscussed in my Yuugami-kun doesn't have any friends review. And to relativize, ANY piece of fiction can provide bad escapism depending on who's reading it. If I target isekai in particular it's because practically every single one of them PURPOSELY use their viewers loneliness against them just to sell.

Isekai Ojisan does not do that and excels at subversing it.



img600()

One misconception that people have about ""a second chance in life"" (involving time travel, isekai etc) is that they think they would suddenly be complete different persons and by result their whole life would become far better. We live our WHOLE lives trying to be better, struggling hard with our flaws and bad habbits and sometimes they never even fade yet we have the audacity to think we'd just completly change just like that. If you've been a procrastinator your whole life, how would that change if you went back in time? If you went in another world? You can't change yourself in the present so how the f""ck are you gonna do that elsewhere? It's so easy to blame the circumstances but ultimately they always change and that don't necessarily make you become a better individual.

Ojisan's ugliness is metaphor for his game addiction and ""rotted"" mindset. He gets despised and he's being outcasted just like in his original world. His ugliness follows him and it's that ugliness that cause people to react. 

He didn't enjoy the magical world for two things :

The perceptions others have on him didn't change. As said previously, they see him as ugly. It disgusts them and he becomes once again an outcast. Society wasn't softer on him. He isn't excused for being an outsider and this in itself makes it an anti-isekai.

His worldview hasn't changed : Ojisan never was that interested in ""real world"", he always prefered video games. What happend when he gets into another world ? He only thinks about video games and tries to get back to Earth only to play them. He never socialized, what happend when he gets into another world ? He has trouble understanding the feelings of his friends and he can't believe someone genuinely likes him. 

He is human, he isn't a self-insert mc who never talked to someone but suddenly becomes a great nation leader overnight. His internal issues don't magically disappear along with the world he's into, they follow him everywhere and HE has to fix them



CONCLUSION

Ojisan doesn't care about societal cases or superficial things, he treats everyone the same. He knows who he is and embrace it. He lives in his own world yes but that doesn't restrain him to be nice and caring and he doesn't hurt others. He's happy and it shows, despite what anyone thinks. His ""ugliness"" is only how others perceive him at first, when they get to know him, it becomes irrevelant. 

I initially thought the overall message was ""F#ck isekai ! This is real life, even if the world changes, you don't. You can escape your responsibilities, your family, your life but the one thing you'll never be able to escape is yourself.""

But along the episodes I think this message would be more appropriate "" F#ck isekai ! I don't need a perfect utopian world to be happy. Just because I don't fit in your standards doesn't means I'm a degenerate. Wherever I am, I'll alaways be me and that's not a cage but an opportunity.""

In either cases...

F#ck Isekai !

14075,"This is my first review, and I'll try and keep it short and to the point

I stumbled across this anime when I was randomly browsing an anime list to watch as I usually do. I expected not much to come out of it, and it would be some random thing I watch a few episodes of when I'm bored as usual. To my surprise, this genuinely became one of my favourite anime.

(spoilers ahead)

The plot, as I see it, is almost divided into two. And as I see it, most people like the first part but don't think that the second part makes sense when put together with the other one. While I can definitely understand this sentiment, I don't agree with it. I think that they both play into each other pretty well to produce a coherent, overall narrative.

>  The time is out of joint—O cursèd spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!

This is quoted from Hamlet throughout the anime, multiple times. It embodies the overarching theme of the show: chaos. This chaos is something that must be resolved, so that the world starts to be rational again. So that the time is no more out of joint.

Zetsuen No Tempest is a story about getting over your past experiences and traumas. Mahiro and Yoshino must get over the death of Fuwa Aika.

This is told parallelly with the story of the conflict between the two trees. In the start, it seems that one tree brings harmony and the other chaos, but as the show goes on, the true nature of the two are revealed along with the reason for them being there in the first place.

The mystery of Aika's death and the slow unravelling of the truth kept me interested and I was grasped by it throughout the entire show. This is developed alongside the revealling of the true nature of the two trees, the Tree of Exodus and the Tree of Genesis. In the conclusion, the two play into each other to create the final story. To finally solve the mysteries, and give answers. While I can't speak for the faithfulness to the source material, since I have not read it, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the ending.


Aika is the character which bridges everything. She bridges the past and the future, the tale of her death and the tale of saving the world through her death. She is the single most interesting and captivating throughout the series, yet, she doesn't even appear by herself much. It always seems like she says so little but the implications are big. Her beautiful character design and voice capture this very well, and amplify this portrayal of her. 

The character development of Mahiro and Yoshino is definitely interesting as well, including the dynamic between them. I found them quite memorable. The only other character I found particualrly good is Hakaze, and honestly not much can be said about the other side characters.

Mahiro overcomes his trauma and the bond between them isn't broken when revealed that Yoshino was Aika's boyfriend. Yoshino however, only overcomes his past a bit later in the anime. In this aspect maybe I felt that the 24 episodes weren't enough to capture it, but also it worked just fine.

As another reviewer put it, the best way I could describe the character writing of this show is that
> The characters in this show are written as if they were actors in a play

I completely agree with this statement, though I don't hold the opinion that this is a bad thing, as the other reviewer did. and it fits with its usage of quotations from different plays of Shakespeare. Speaking of which, for some reason I saw some reviewers complaining about this, but to me, this was one of the best parts of the show. In fact, even though I am not one to read classical literature or anything, this show made me want to read the plays Hamlet and Tempest.

Ultimately, I was very involved with the characters in this show.

The art style of this is anime is pretty pleasing, and the characters look very nice. I'll say that the fight scenes aren't anything very impressive, but they aren't an eyesore either. They get the job done just fine. The same can be said for the audio design, not particularly remarkable but works just fine.

The animation otherwise is very beautiful and I never felt like anything was 'cheaped out' on. The character design was also something that captivated me. Fuwa Aika left me in love with her beautiful design. The other characters also are very interesting, and nothing feels ""copy pasted"", like they do in some other anime that I've watched. 

The show has its flaws though, don't get me wrong, it is by no means perfect, but it is coherent and good nevertheless.

That about concludes my review of this show. It's something that I think everyone should definitely give a watch, I can guarantee it's something you won't be disappointed by."
8425,"As a kid I spent a lot of time reading Sherlock Holmes. I am a HUGE fan of mystery in general. I am also a huge fan of romance, drama, history and everything foreign. So taking this all into account, this anime immediately caught my attention. This anime takes place in an alternate universe, but I believe it was inspired by architecture near the Swiss and French border. I am honestly a diehard fan of Gosick, my review may seem biased but I genuinely believe this is one of the best anime ever created (I also score things rather high). There is a lot to decompress about this series because, a lot happens over the course of 24 episodes so I will try my best to summarize it.

(spoilers ahead)

Summary: (you don't have to read this, scroll down for my scores)
In what seems to be inspired by pre WWI, a Japanese exchange student Named Kujo comes to Sauville to attend an Academy where many horror stories and tales unfold. He meets a beautiful doll-like girl name Victorique, who is indeed a tsundere but she is a tsundere done correctly, as it is rare you see a tsundere character created, and developed so well. She is extremely smart, and basically through events the two of them solve some mysteries together. They first get stuck on some type of murder mystery ship, and they solve the mystery together and get closer through certain events. The next mystery is a biker getting their head chopped off mysteriously, and Kujo is blamed for the murder. Through events Victorique clears his name and points towards the real culprit (much like in Sherlock Holmes stories). Shortly after, Kujo meets a girl named Avril, and he suspects there is something ominous about her. He asks Victorique to find him a book, (she's a heavy bookworm). Then Kujo is knocked out and mysteriously disappears, while Victorique learns that Avril is actually the daughter of a legendary thief, but is an imposter and the real Avril is being hidden somewhere. After this mystery is solved we go into a character background arc for Victorique. The two go to a small, ancient village named Horovitz, also called village of the Grey Wolves. Victorique goes there to clear her mother's name, who was falsely accused for murder and ostracized from the village for it. This arc is probably the most important arc, because through this mystery Victorique uncovers the murderer in the village, and this murderer escapes and sets the village ablaze. Because there is one exit from the village, Kujo finds himself trapped and must protect Victorique with his life on the line. In the Murder Mystery ship arc, a similar thing happened. Through these events Victorique and Kujo start getting closer and begin to fall in love with each other from this point on. The next arc is a short one, as Victorique falls ill, and Kujo goes into town and attempts to solve a case to help the police. He ends up having to go to Victorique to get help, when he discovers she has already mostly solved it. The next arc is about Victorique reading a book about an Alchemist's tower, and decides to solve the mystery about it. When she goes to the tower, she meets a man named Brian, an acquaintance of Victorique's mother, and he warns Kujo that he should be careful of her father. In the next episode, Victorique's father takes her to a convent in Lithuania and locks her into a room there. Kujo, the almighty hero, of course comes to rescue her with the help of Victorique's mother. Victorique's father then demands that Kujo return Victorique to him, but Kujo refuses and the two barely escape from her father's clutches. The next arc Kujo is away in a nearby town to the school, but Victorique is abducted by her father to solve the greatest mystery of the country. Kujo tries to rescue her and fails, so he helps to solve the case instead. Victorique was not able to solve the case, and is sent back to her tower in the school campus. Shortly after, Kujo is taken out of the country as the king demanded all foreign citizens to be removed. Kujo escapes back, and goes back to rescue Victorique, just to find himself hostage by Victorique's father and is used as a pawn to get Victorique to do what he wants. Kujo then got deported, and Victorique was held in an underground prison. Victorique is one day going to be used by her father to show his power in Sauville for political gain, and her mother switches places with her and exposes Victorique's father's crimes to Sauville. Brian Roscoe then kills the father, and Brian's twin escapes with Victorique and attempts to kill her, but falls off a cliff instead. Then when the war ends, Kujo returns safely to Victorique and they get married happily ever after if you've read a little bit of the light novel

Now for my scores:
Characters- 10
Honestly the character designs are actually breathtaking, Victorique's long flowing dresses and the tailored men's suits of the 1920s are very appeasing to the eyes. The characters themselves have plenty of depth. The two main characters are Kujo and Victorique and their characters are just done so amazingly. There are plenty of side characters too, and they are usually involved in cases and their actions are flawlessly explained and everything makes perfect sense by the end of each arc. 

Story- 9.5
IT'S LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES MEETS TORADORA, or something like that. If you cannot understand the story then you must've missed something, because Victorique explains everything very clearly and concisely. If you like romance, this might take you a bit to warm up to, because it takes about 7-10 episodes for the romance to really start showing. If you like mystery, well there's plenty of it. The romance is not overdone, and it doesn't take away from the main story. The reason i give it a 9.5 is because, I don't think a lot of it was explained in a simple manner, it could take a bit of thinking to understand the plot but it is something you get used to. 

Animation/art- 10
People look at animation for the characters usually, but for Gosick I must say everything in the background is what makes it so amazing. I have never seen Europe portrayed so well in an anime it's seriously something special. Also don't forget about the details put into each of the characters' clothes, it's amazingly done. 

Music/OP/ED- 9
The music is pretty good, not my thing but the OP and ED are really well done. They don't spoil much of any of the plot and are super cute

All in all, I believe Gosick is a genre defining and a genuinely beautiful piece of art. You must watch until the end, as the series only just gets better episode by episode. 97/100"

They're an icon. The symbol of friendship, hope, love, passion, and music admired by those who have seen them. They will show you that enthusiasm and dedication do pay off. They're µ's (""Muse""), an ensemble of nine harmonious members. And they're the idol stars of School Idol Project!

I'll preface by saying that I first dived into the Love Live! franchise just looking to enjoy some catchy songs and CGDCT. Which I did get. All of those are right here in this show. But there's also something else—a special quality that draws a motivational and inspirational angle on what seems to only be a cute entertainment at first glance. It draws me in because it's not easy to find, but once it's realized, we will shoot for the stars.

It is called passion.

For the energetic Honoka, her passion is sparked when her beloved school is in risk of closing down upon a decreasing number of yearly enrollments. To form a school idol group; that is her answer. It's ambitious. It's difficult. It's almost like a fantasy. But she and eight other members will soon find that µ's is their passion. And they will head off on a journey to make people smile, to have fun, and to enjoy being together with those who share the same love as you. Embellished by a rich optimism in a world of musical superstars, this is what School Idol Project is all about.

img()

What brings the best enjoyment out of this show definitely lies in the large cast of cute characters. The story plays it straight with no deep complexities, so it allows us to focus solely on the girls. They're the gears that unify a charming and lovable group. An additive effect. Group antics are entertaining to watch and µ's is basically an adorable embodiment of fun friendship. But not all are just happy moments.

At first, a lot of the members have their own hindering circumstances before they join µ's and the group does face large obstacles along the way. While the resolution is cheesy at times, the roots come back to the one main thing that holds this show together. Their passion. No matter how difficult the obstacles are, no matter the results—success or failure—they will continue to practice hard and dedicate themselves to their dream with smiles on their faces. Even when things seem to change for the worst, their shared passion and love put them back on the correct path. To be passionate about something will always come with reasons. For them, it's not just to save their school. It's also to go up there onto the stage and to perform the best as they can, for themselves and for others. Because in their hearts, they know that this is what they all wanted to continue doing: To be the best school idols out there.

So, when they stand up on the stage to perform a wide variety of spirited songs, you can see their hard work paying off. The mix between 2D and 3D animation might take some time to get used to, but soon enough, it'll become familiar and you can enjoy the dancing choreographs among the colorfully bright atmosphere. Gleaming eyes, enchanting smiles, adorable clothes, and energetic movements. Their emotions sync together with the gorgeous notes from their voices and altogether, all of these features turn their live performance into a stage that's truly fun to experience.

Even when they're done performing, living casually as high school girls, it doesn't stop them from sparkling up with vibrancy. Both the evocative art and the buoyant soundtracks help to give many endearing qualities to µ's. They know how to make me laugh and to make me enjoy their overall enthusiasm. It's simply wonderful. I also have to mention that I lost count on how many times I wanted to say ""So kawaii"" at them. Just so you know they're not only passionate, they're also too sweet for my heart to take.

School Idol Project really went beyond what I've expected from an idol anime. My interest for the appealing songs and the girls transformed into an admiration of their passion, perseverance, and power to pursue their goal through and through. The Love Live! franchise has created µ's, the face of tuneful entertainment, so give it a chance to be their audience. Maybe you'll resonate with them as much as I did.

21365,"Dagashi Kashi has potential, but fails in fully using it. Its cast is way too good compared to the rest of the show.

I feel that the show could have been really good if it weren´t for its focus on the candy - the core component of the show. What we got is a series of 24 minute commercials for japanese sweets with occasional good parts, the moment when the focus was on the characters and not on the sweets. The cast consists of only 5 people with a strong focus on Kokonotsu and Hotaru. There is a reason that Hotaru has more favorites on MAL than the show itself, she is a great character. While it seems at the beginning that she has some sort of higher goal you realize later that while she certainly likes Kokonotsu, she will forever only have one love: candy. As the daughter of one of the biggest Japanese candy producers, she knows EVERYTHING about every candy in Japan. That´s why she wants Kokonotsu to take over the store of his father, he has to operate the store with his own big knowledge of candy. Because Kokonotsu has no intention at all to continue the store while still knowing a lot about it, the majority of the show consists of the two candy pros arguing about candy. That´s the reason why the show is rated so low: It can be quite boring at times to listen to them talking about chocolate for the twentieth time in a row. The real highlight are the times when they meet the rest of the cast, the siblings Saya and Tou: With Tou´s ability to be impressed by the simplest things and Saya´s crush on Kokonotsu and her being constantly annoyed about the childing behaviour of everyone, we have everything we need to have comedy. But the comedy of seeing everyone´s personality clash together is interrupted by candy commercials which can be funny at times, but often feel a few minutes too long.

The character design is good, everyone looks like you would expect them by their personalities while the minimalistic art makes them rememberable(look at Hotaru´s pupils) and the animation is quite good.

Dagashi Kashi is a show that I would recommend for the great characters and the comedy, if you can look behind the bad to mediocre story. Personally, I think that this season should have been a 15-minute short while the second season should have gotten full 24 minutes because they realized that people wanted more Hotaru and others and less of the candy talk."
109298,"Animation is a wonderful medium, isn’t it? The way drawings get put into a consecutive illusion of motion, combining all sorts of aspects of art and color to create spectacles that inspire others to do the same. That’s the power of visual media: creative inspiration. You can look at all sorts of auteurs and visionaries such as Quentin Tarantino and Hideaki Anno, and they’ll tell you their inspirations: anime, movies, tokusatsu productions, etc. It’s the origin story of most in all creative industries. Creativity begets creativity, so it’s all the more wonderful to see works that celebrate it. 2014’s Shirobako was a charming and immersive look into the anime industry from the perspective of 5 friends working in different aspects of that field. 2017’s Re:Creators brought all sorts of fictional creations to the real world to showcase the many sides of what writers and authors are capable of as well as what kinds of influences and intentions their works hold. Now that we’re in the year of our lord 2020, Keep Your Hands off Eizouken provides a charming look at 3 passionate high school girls in different production roles of animation, and how they work with each other to create their own anime.

It’s gonna be difficult not to gush about this show on a level that most of its main characters do, so pardon me. The energy of this show radiates a level of autistic CBF energy I adore to no end as its passion and charm breathe life into me. The eccentric, high-energy nature of Midori Azakusa and Tsubame Mizukashi is precious with how they gush about the technical aspects of animation. Their chemistry with each other and resident penny-pincher and schemer Sayaka Kanamori is a sight to behold. Their no-chill energy might be a bit much for some people, but they alone could be fun in almost any scenario, as the anime shows us. The way they gush over animation techniques and still make it presentable, the way they come up with ideas like a moving logo akin to the Pixar lamp, the way the three casually interact with a mix of hyper and deadpan energy, all make my mind race at a thousand miles per hour! I love how they have to keep thinking about believability in their fantasy before making concessions. I love the theatric air they sometimes put on in their declarations. The show is just a joyous bundle of joy, one with a lot of comedic value such as them praying to the fallen comrade of 30K yen or what comes of filming Azakusa falling off guard rails on the second floor of a building. It also tackles a robot anime while having the characters balance the unrealistic nature of the genre in general with a level of plausibility, coolness, and internal logic in a way meant to harken back to the appeal of mecha in the first place. Needless to say, the mere concept of the arc excited me, and bias aside, the execution delivered!

There are some problems with the show’s pacing. While the arc structure is generally solid, the episodes themselves can feel almost lackadaisical, as if we’re just flowing or cutting from one scene to another with little in the way of escalation. Episode 11 is probably the biggest offender of this, as it ends up feeling a lot longer than it actually is as a result. There are a few examples of episodes that also can’t figure out a good stopping point, either. It’s not the biggest issue in the world, and it being more of a slice of life title does help excuse it a little, but it’s still a problem that exists.

One can argue that these characters aren’t especially layered or complex compared to some of other Yuasa titles such as Ping Pong: The Animation. As true as that is, it might be missing the point as a criticism of Eizouken’s writing. These characters are essentially vectors for this passion for animation that this somewhat dramatic slice of life-esque title presents. On top of that, while one can argue how similar Azakusa and Mizukashi are to the point of being as similar as Carole and Tuesday (from the eponymous disappointment of 2019) are in terms of characterization, they at least have incredible chemistry with one another and with Hinamori. Frankly, this dynamic of friendship is what sells the trio for me, as it’s fun to see them not just talk about the medium or about cash, but about anything else as they just have fun with whatever they’re doing. Azakusa’s definitely a ball of energy who gets too carried away with herself, but one who is otherwise laid-back and socially awkward. Mizukashi’s similarly energetic about a different part of animation --hence the two coming off as similar at times-- but she’s an incredibly sheltered girl at the end of the day, and one who just wants to follow her passions. Hinamori is the tough girl of the bunch, as she’s a schemer always on the hunt for money, and a deadpan hardass to boot. They’re not the most fleshed-out or interesting personalities in the world, but for what they are, the show takes advantage of them and explores their dynamics well. It’s also amusing to see all the little sound effects characters make and that Azakusa is capable of nitpicking and breaking down the believability of settings and ideas in anime, though that’s the aspie and reviewer in me talking, respectively.

The show also takes advantage of how painful being an animator can be. The girls working for free is made for a morbidly humorous comparison to the low wages animators work for. Cuts take absolutely forever and require absurd lengths of time to complete as animators work for what feels like nonstop. Understanding realistic or plausible physics of whatever an animator is shooting for can be downright aggravating, like with smoke, sword movements, or hair movements. Several concessions often end up having to be made for the sake of getting a work of animation done in time, resulting in cost-cutting measures that can look cheap if desperate enough. An example of this is when the characters talk about how to convey the fast movement of a tank rolling around, and they discuss the idea of a background with moving highlights before Mizukashi rightfully calls out how much she hates the technique and they find a better solution. If Shirobako takes a somewhat lighthearted approach to what troubled production looks like, Eizouken does the same regarding the grueling nature of working as an animator, even on freelance projects not commissioned by anyone but themselves. 

I’m also intrigued by the strange, sci-fi school setting. We always see new bits being fleshed out with each episode like how clubs work or what getting lunch is like over there. Student council students are a level of hardass even Kanamori has trouble keeping up with, and club presentations can reach a level of violence where armored guards are forced to step in to protect club members with shitty presentations from getting trampled and beaten. The school itself is this strange hodgepodge of inconsistent elements in its design, as Azakusa points out in the first episode. It’s a chaotic mess that vaguely resembles the real world while having the grandiose and almost bloodthirsty attitude present in say, Kill la Kill’s Honnouji Academy. There’s also this semblance of reality and fiction melting together much like Satoshi Kon’s filmography, as the overactive imagination of characters physically transports them into whatever they’re visually brainstorming or whatever gets shown on-screen. The level of immersion characters reach gets to a point where they react and interact with what isn’t even there.

Then again, with how great the visuals are, hard not to gush about and get immersed in them as much as the characters do. Masaaki Yuasa and his team at Science SARU do a beautiful job of taking the strange and creative world of the manga and bringing it to life. The absurd and extremely emotive facial expressions characters have all of the time are all amusing and ever-shifting. The character designs all feel distinct from one another with different head proportions that still feel grounded in the same world. The colors all pop while still feeling somewhat cool, almost akin to Tokyo Godfathers. This is most exemplified by the drawings the characters make, which radiate this endless, unbound youthful energy to them. Of course, where the show tries to flex its muscles the most outside of its character animation is when the characters immerse themselves in a setting. The beautifully unfinished setting models are just adorable, as pencil marks remain on models that haven’t been fully colored. It captures the setting and design sketching phase beautifully, and it does so while keeping the models consistent. It’s fun to see how the outfits our characters wear change in response to these scenes, and models such as the dragonfly plane sketch our characters envision themselves piloting in episode 1 make for the best use of 3D CGI in a 2D anime I have noted in years. Of course, the level of detail in the animation itself is impressive in terms of fluidity, about as much as when the show tries to recreate Future Boy Conan, one of Asakusa’s favorite shows. The way she gushes over the physicality of the characters’ movements and other aspects of animation are represented perfectly in this recreation of an anime classic. This is all just gushing about episode 1! I haven’t talked about a single thing about the rest of the show’s visuals, the stellar animation showcases that make up the climax of each arc, or about the vibrance present in the OP and ED. That should tell you just how visually stunning the show is, and I didn’t even talk about my favorite moment from the first episode. 

There are several gorgeous scenes thanks to Masaaki Yuasa’s directing as well as due to lovely art direction that works perfectly with the strange school setting our characters find themselves in. Perhaps nothing is quite as artsy as say, Berserk 1997’s shots, but there are still gorgeous moments such as the space scene at the end of the big imagination setpiece of episode 1. Sunsets are as warm as they can be without ever feeling plain like most other anime, and the CG water somehow looks both photorealistic and capable of usually blending in with the environment of the show. It doesn’t always work out and there are a few awkward CG moments, but this is still a joy to look at. There are other details, such as at the end of episode 2 when Azakusa and her family are shocked at a video of her falling that got filmed earlier in the episode. She’s so embarrassed that she’s literally malformed and shittily drawn compared to everyone else in the shot. A lot of the techniques and explanations this show employs get nice visual representations as well. I’m not entirely sure if this is my favorite Yuasa work from a visual perspective, but it is certainly one of the best in this regard. Not every episode quite lives up to episode 1, as there are a few CG problems and several moments that do admittedly look plain. This is to be expected from a contemporary anime production, and what they get away with on a regular basis is still vibrant and imaginative enough to properly convey and live up to the intricacies of the medium it puts on display. The series captures this overactive imagination that I envision every day given that I often think visually, and I love that.

As you can tell, this show is hyper and that energy has rubbed off on me.

If I had to find the weakest link, it would be the OST. This is the first anime OST done by Oorutaichi, and while it fits the setting and vibe of the show rather well, little of it is particularly memorable. The show also overuses certain tracks, as if there is one specific piece meant to be used every time the characters go into their visually-driven imagination setpieces. That said, I did notice how each arc of the show introduces new tracks, all of which are nice enough. I also like the brash and peppy energy presented by the OP, “Easy Breezy” by chelmico. The visuals of the OP have been memed to death thanks to the Drake-inspired dance moves the girls show off, but the song itself is still what I like most about it, though it isn’t especially remarkable. I’m less fond of the ED so that’s all I’ll say about it.

It’s hard to avoid spilling everything I love about the show and what it tackles in detail. This review needs to maintain a level of coherence, after all. The show isn’t this 10/10 hype beast that I adore from beginning to end, but it resonates with me on a level that makes it difficult to get bored or find much to complain about. I didn’t even get to touch on the main conflicts much like with how beautifully and earnestly Mizukashi’s conflict with her actor parents concludes, or go into scenes like when the characters travel to a location for inspiration. The final arc involves the show’s understanding of social media marketing and how star-power gets many interested in a studio’s body of work so that the more invested can follow it thoroughly and deep-dive their catalog. I also never got to talk about the decent supporting cast and how interesting the scenes where they and our main trio come to an understanding are. Barring minor contrivances, everything feels natural rather than forced. All of the conflicts and interactions have this genuineness to their execution. 

There’s so much love and passion for the medium oozing out of Eizouken, and it’s hard not to get invested. Sure, the high-energy nature and how specialized it is in this field can turn some away, but it’s hard not to appreciate just how much about anime the series covers. Its heart isn’t just with animation, as the show has a few beautiful character moments and emotional climaxes of its own. The likable characters and wonderful visuals accentuate the joyful feeling of this show and how much it cares about what it covers. The show does not shy away from the darker and more complicated aspects of being an animator, even though it doesn’t dwell on the grim nature of it all. Eizouken’s simply a treat to watch, and certainly a contender for anime of the year moving forward. It understands, and that’s what allows it to shine so brightly."
117343,"It was the year 20XX. Earth was assaulted by dark and edgy anime, bringing cynicism and grim moral commentary to the hearts of jaded viewers. To counter this threat, they published a light-hearted, wholesome anime: Talentless Nana. Follow the adventures of the kind and heroic Nanao and the lovable airhead Nana as they work tirelessly to help their friends and defend all of mankind. There is even romance in the air and comedic hijinks for good measure. Nana's cute, cheerful smile will melt the icy hearts of critics everywhere. The feel-good anime of the decade.


[And this is where I give the obligatory spoiler warning. There are quite a few.]


The point is: You can't trust synopses anymore. This is already the second series for which I have to say this in a review. This series is actually about good and evil. Not ""the good heroes vs the evil monsters"" kind but the more nuanced kind in which characters sometimes actually think about their moral decisions.

We get something with visceral malice, dysfunctional conscience, effective dark comedy, heaps of deception and irony, and surprisingly interesting dialogue. How despicable actions can you carry out until your conscience kicks in? Anything and everything, or is there a limit? And what kind of strain will this place on your future interactions with people? If you keep lying repeatedly, how difficult it will be to convince someone when you are actually telling the truth? As a result, the drama is actually dramatic and the comedy is actually funny. The quality of the dialogue is also surprisingly high, especially including the protagonist's inner thoughts. It is written in a witty way, juxtaposing a facade of seemingly simple lines with more analytical, viscerally heavy-hitting dialogue that tramples on the appearances. Meanwhile, the plot is regularly throwing twists at the reader, and some of them can actually be surprising, which is not something that happens all that often.

Now, some people call this series a ""Death Note clone"" or ""Among Us + My Hero Academia,"" but I actually think it is something else. Those interpretations may have been effective at spreading word of this series and granting convenient titles to videos on Youtube, but they are also somewhat misleading. This series doesn't have to be Death Note or Among Us. It can be its own thing, and it is better that it is its own thing instead of trying to mimic those other options too closely. For instance, I don't think it is trying to be about outrageously complex mind games with characters somehow predicting dozens of moves ahead. It is more about the moral weight of murder, deception, manipulating public opinion, and exploiting people's weaknesses, and all the long-term consequences that come with those actions.

There is actual moral tension, shifting moral alignments in a relatively believable way, a powerful sense of hatred and malice, dynamic character relationships strained by past deeds, and tons of delicious irony. The character relationships and interactions can be more dynamic than might appear at first. All of this also results in nice dark comedy that goes far beyond the norm. It blends in well with the drama and doesn't feel out of place.

The dark comedy really is very delicious here. I often found myself laughing at the ironic deception, the thinly veiled threats, the outrageous juxtaposition between cheerful and dark thoughts, the dissonance between people's outward behavior and inner thoughts, and the relationships strained by what happened many episodes ago. It hasn't been marked with the comedy tag, but who cares? It fits my sense of humor better than most comedy I've seen in anime, manga, light novels, etc. There is also meta-commentary and subversion of various common tropes. Seemingly generic heroic characters end up as something different, and tropes related to generic main characters are showcased, then brutally subverted.

A few of the characters eat up the vast majority of focus, development, and the best dialogue. But better a few good characters than none at all. And the characters should often be introduced more organically, longer before their main role is played out.

The voice actors did a great job here, Nana's especially. I also liked many of the facial expressions, the color-coding for inner monologue, and some suitably over-the-top visual choices like non-existent wind indoors for a big mental showdown, complete with dramatic music. The opening and ending songs are catchy, the opening especially, and the lyrics for both are very fitting. By which I mean that they are nightmarish in a personal, knife-in-the-heart kind of way.




Now let's discuss a topic people like to bring up: stupid and allegedly stupid decisions by the characters, especially some side characters, and whether this counts as luck, plot armor, or whatever. The answer is nuanced. Much of the alleged stupidity is actually deep ignorance, which is different, and the ignorance has been caused on purpose. It is revealed very early on.

First, a general point: If you follow the full narrative, it is very clear that people irrationally believing in propaganda and other convenient lies is intentional. It is even clearer if you read the manga.

""Humans don't believe the truth. They believe people.""
""People believe what they want to believe and hear what they want to hear.""

It is not a bug; it is a feature. The author is trying to make a point here, and he is not trying to hide it. Call it social commentary if you like. More about that below.

If you abuse existing misinformation and other characters' motives, it isn't really plot armor. It is not as though you need additional coincidences for it, aside from the existence of the misinformation and the motives in the first place. Sure, some of the characters are legitimately too trusting or have issues with their mental health. ...Which can still sometimes be suboptimal writing, but that is different than plot armor. Not to mention, several of the events and beliefs are 1) explained in greater detail later on or 2) setups for future plot points with interesting payoffs. This doesn't apply to nearly everything, but sometimes you should be patient and try to look at the narrative as a whole.

Well, let's go over some points and hope it won't turn into a full essay.


[Obligatory spoiler alert again, though I will try to avoid saying the biggest spoilers outright. There will be many mid-sized spoilers though.]


1) Blaming the Enemies of Humanity

In Among Us and also in Danganronpa, for instance, the players and the characters are immediately told that there are killers among them. That is the premise. Here that is not the case, and there are potential scapegoats, most notably the dreaded ""Enemies of Humanity."" Original name, I know. (Nice troll, author.) 

Anyway, these aliens conveniently happen to be invisible or be able to influence people's minds, or at least that is what many characters believe. And why is that? Because the belief has been perpetuated by decades of government propaganda, all the way down to their textbooks. Often you don't even need to suggest to them that the Enemies of Humanity are at fault; they will recite their textbooks and general knowledge and come up with the idea by themselves. This is a central part of the premise that was established immediately, and even before the events of the series, most of the characters had assumed that these aliens were already on the island, so of course that is their default explanation for problems. In the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, they will believe the alien option. Imagine a story in which the characters genuinely fight against aliens. If a few of them die, would their first assumption be blaming a human killer? No, that would be the wrong genre. Though usually the aliens are not quite as well hidden. 

Is it dumb to believe in government propaganda and conspiracy theories? Sure. It says something about people's poor critical reading skills. But that is only to be expected. Mankind is dumb like that. Look at the conspiracy theories tens of millions of real-life people believe in with far lesser propaganda efforts, not to mention their belief in all kinds of entities without empirical evidence.

Keeping that in mind, they are mostly reasonable in not assuming that there is a grand government conspiracy out to get them. Come on, that can't be real, right? There is seemingly no evidence of it. So if that particular conspiracy happens to be real, they are walking into it blind. Good job with the brainwashing, shady government conspirators. There is a nice quote about it later on. ""People believe what they want to believe and hear what they want to hear. ... How would that benefit them?"" (I omitted a part there to tone down the spoilers.) Incidentally, the idea of mind-controlling aliens is also a setup for a future plot point. It has some ironic payoff that I don't want to spoil too much. 

2) Suspicious alien attack

Stabbed by an invisible alien? Suspicious, right? Yes, but if you have been indoctrinated into believing that invisible aliens are a thing, less so. And there was no apparent motive for the self-stabbing anyway, so figuring it out required several logical steps that indoctrinated people would not bother to take. Still, Kyoya rightfully points out that it is suspicious that it retreated after a single attack, and he isn't wrong, but let's think about it for a minute. If the best this alien can do is a relatively weak stab attack, and the building is full of super-powered humans about to rush in, retreating might not be a bad idea. Even if it is invisible, it isn't hard to guess where it is if it tries to stab people. But maybe it would opt to self-sacrifice to take out the mind-reader, probably a big threat. That would have been an interesting argument for Kyoya to make.

3) Why not reveal everything to the class the moment you learn the truth?

Without evidence? That wouldn't go so well. And they lacked evidence, with the exception of Tsunekichi. (More about that below.) Second, for many of them, it would not have helped them achieve their goals. I am not going to go through each person's motives individually.

4) Just ask her to read your mind

It happens multiple times during the series, and there are plausible ways out of them. And there apparently are convenient limitations to her mind-reading ability. Nana states that she cannot reliably focus on specific thoughts or parse very specific pieces of information from them, including particular strings of letters or numbers such as passwords. Also, the presence of many people creates background noise that can cover the target's thoughts.

And it is not as though the students are constantly badgering each other to show off their powers. Even with a mind-reader it is natural to primarily try to have a normal conversation. Would you really ask them to focus on your thoughts instead of talking? Then they might find out things that you don't want them to, and it would be considered rude regardless.

5) Precognitive photos

Tsunekichi had strong empirical reasons to trust the accuracy of the photos. He had tried to defy them before, but it had never worked. What was dumb was not anticipating what was done with the photos, though it was true that the tampered material had not been handed over voluntarily, which made it seem more plausible. The way his character was written, it seems that his fatalism had turned him so passive and uncaring of anything that he could barely be bothered to take any measures to protect himself. He is someone who had given up on actively living his life for the most part. So I guess you can substitute stupidity for mental illness.

By the way, here is a possible interpretation of how the photos work:

It seems clear that the predictions made by the photos take into consideration how the characters react to those photos. Tsunekichi was refusing to head to the murder scene before the photos were tampered with, and that happened because of the existence of the initial photos. Nothing that happens to fulfill the photos ever seems to violate normal laws of physics. The conditions just happen to be right for the outcomes.

So the events had to progress roughly the way they did because otherwise the pictures would not have come true, and they had to come true. The events played out as they did because the characters are who they are. It is not as though we should assume that people have metaphysical free wills. Their actions are predictable, at least by some superpowers that can make normally impossible calculations.

If Tsunekichi was the kind of person who would reveal the information to the class or would figure out that the fake photo was fake, he likely would not have got the photos in the first place because then the existence of the photos likely would have prevented those events, and he only gets photos that come true. He could have got a different set of incriminating photos though. If this is the case, what actually ruined Tsunekichi was his fatalism because that is what lead him to behave as he did.

Tl;dr: It is all about causality and determinism. (Let's not get into a quantum mechanics fight in this context, please.)

6) Mind-reading the spirits of the deceased

""But that is not how mind-reading works!""

Well, how does mind-reading work in real life then? Let alone in this fictional world? Yeah, I thought so. Also, they were already doing necromancy in the same room; speaking to the spirit of the corpse is only a few more steps beyond that. Some talents can be broad and multi-purpose, developing into slightly different directions than what you'd initially expect. This seems especially apparent after reading the manga further. That doesn't mean that the ability can't be too convenient in that particular situation. That applies to many other talents though, including the necromancy that was literally going on in the same room.

This isn't about tactics, but I did find the irony pretty funny. It is adding insult to injury: first the person gets killed, and then people are pretending to speak on behalf of his spirit.

7) No autopsy

Tsunekichi was running around telling everyone about the girlfriend thing, so her being the victim of blackmail, assault, etc. was very plausible, most of which was actually true. If she had killed him, it would have probably been by stabbing or blunt trauma, but there were no signs of those. And in that case, she would have openly admitted to self-defence. (The method of killing was the reason against that option.)

8) No zombie ""autopsy""

People were crept out by the necromancy and allegedly Tsunekichi's suffering on top of that. The decision comes down to how willing they are to torture Tsunekichi's soul to maybe learn about the Enemies of Humanity. I could see them not caring about him and going through with it anyway, so it is reasonable to argue that it was out of character for some of them. You can call it dumb if you like, or being too kind-hearted. It is not ruthlessly efficient, for sure. Maybe Kyoya would have liked to go through with it anyway, but the others would have dragged him out of the room if necessary.

9) Letting a captive free in exchange for help

Letting another character free in exchange for letting them use their talent to ""speak"" to their loved one beyond the grave. That isn't plot armor though, more like emotionally manipulating people by abusing their romantic feelings and state of mind. First of all, she was not planning to kill her captive at that point anyway, and only decided on that later. Exposing everything to the class wouldn't work because of the lack of evidence. She should have taken more precautions though. Barricading the door, for instance. Though it was plausible, given the state of mind of the person in question. But still, barricade the door. Then they probably would have had to talk their way out of it.

10) ""Barricading"" in a shed

The point of the plan is that it wears the opponent down and makes her easier to find while also lowering the chance of her exposing anything to the class. (Not that she had any evidence, and it would have run contrary to her motive anyway.) The time of sunrise was not a deus ex machina because it is easily predictable. The real problem was whether sunlight would deactivate the zombies. Even though it was very likely that sunlight had some effect, judging by the time of day a particular zombie appeared in school, it was not certain that all zombies are equally affected, and furthermore it was possible that the sunlight worked on the zombies too slowly. If they immediately went on a full assault, maybe there would have been enough time to get something done. There was the threat of a hypothetical trap, but still. 

11) Blindly following the leader

Yes, it is dumb to blindly follow charismatic leaders, but that is what people do. They follow their Great Leaders and trust their words. Look around and read the news. People are actually pretty dumb in that sense.

12) Not seeing through facades in general

Yes, it is dumb to let yourself be too easily influenced by a nice smile, kind demeanor, and convenient words. People are dumb like that. Well, I suppose realism isn't everything in fiction though. Narratively, many of the scenes are supposed to be about emotional manipulation instead of foolproof game-theoretical solutions. And you don't really see the latter pretty much anywhere in fiction; you pretty much only get impossible predictions and unlikely coincidences, with a few exceptions. There is of course room for improvement in the manipulation department too, though it was still very amusing to see. 

13) Too often near the victims

Well, three times as far as most characters think. Still, it creates more suspicion, as mentioned several times and especially addressed during the events of episodes 4 and 8. Not to mention that being the leader puts her in contact with more people, which makes her a likely witness. This was stated multiple times.

14) Michiru is gullible and trusts her friends too much

Literally canon. Even the narrative openly acknowledges it. It was done on purpose because it is used in a few later plot points. In the case of the incriminating photo, there is also the additional point that based on earlier photos, it seemed that they could indeed be inaccurate. It still should have rung alarm bells though.

15) Why not call the phone instead of a body search?

Sounds and other alerts can be turned off, you know. It might be worth a shot though because it is not like there is any downside to it, even if the chances of it working are low.

16) Why don't they simply have the military level the island?

Explained in episode 2. They have to know enough about the abilities first, and even if you ask them first, they won't always be honest. And an all-out assault may be too apparent, and word might get out. It is still an option if all else fails.

17) Why doesn't the school take the deaths and disapperances more seriously?

Remember what the purpose of the school is. Why would they? The idea of having them stay on the island is addressed a bit more closely later on anyway. And they did halt the classes when the corpses of the victims started showing up.

18) Why don't they halt the classes the moment some people stop showing up for class?

Then they would never have class because they keep skipping class anyway.

19) Why don't the students take more action?

The moment victims start appearing, they increasingly go hide in their rooms. Gathering everyone in one place or trying to leave the island would be problematic too. That said, some of them are not barricading in hard enough, and you can see the result. On the other hand, isolating too much can make it easier to be picked off one by one, especially if there really is an alien menace or a third-party killer around. They could set up a system for keeping tabs on each other in some organized way, not that it would be foolproof. If you try to move around in groups, people will be reluctant to do so if they can't trust the other members. This is even more of a problem if there really are mind-controlling aliens who can influence people with weak psyches. Then people really would bunker down in their rooms, whether it is rational or not. Giving Nana some kind of security escort would have been a good idea though.

20) Just go look for the aliens

By wandering in the woods in small groups? Or burning down the woods altogether? I suppose they could do so, not that it would help much against invisible aliens. They could also attack spam in a systematic way and see if they manage to land lucky hits. I think barricading in their rooms is the more likely action they would take though.

21) Should have done more research

This is a great idea, actually. The schemes would have been more effective if they had done much more research into the characters' abilities beforehand. And they probably should have. The downside is that it gives the enemies more time to organize, as was about to happen, but it probably would have been worth it anyway.

22) How about not revealing that you are a mind-reader and leaving the talent question open?

Not a terrible idea because several students do that. It comes with its pros and cons though. It makes you appear more suspicious because people will be cautious of your unknown ability. Though mind-reading is already quite powerful in its own way. Not revealing it also removes the chance to tell people the helpful ""info"" that mind-reading brings. And if mind-reading is only your fallback option, people will be upset that they only learned about it afterwards.

23) The schemes are too simple

Simple schemes are actually more effective. Why would you want your schemes to be so complex that you need multiple flowcharts? In real life, you can't predict other people's actions with arbitrary precision. The kinds of schemes that rely on outrageous predictions against astronomical odds will probably fail. Of course, there are many works of fiction (including quite a few anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, etc.) in which characters carry out such predictions and are lauded as geniuses. But they are not actually geniuses because the works do not present the actual means to carry out those predictions. Here the plans are plausible to construct. 

Here the narrative at least presents plausible and semi-plausible explanations for the events instead of the usual completely arbitrary impossible predictions and very unlikely coincidences. I would rather take flawed human reasoning than the kind of reasoning that is impossible for anyone except the omniscient. Yes, I prefer characters to be fallible humans than perfect (or ""perfect"") god-like entities.



Anyway, in summary, Talentless Nana is a wholesome anime for light-hearted fun. Would recommend."
107067,"Each anime season, however heavy everything else gets, in terms of what I’m watching, I do try to go with at least one romantic comedy anime. For the Winter 2020 season, the rom-com I went with was Science Fell In Love, so I Tried to Prove It.

In spite of the longwinded title, this show is not based on a Light Novel – and sadly nor does it have an abbreviated title, which makes it slightly awkward to talk about – not because of uncomfortable themes, but because the title is so damn long. For the sake of brevity, I’ll just call it Science Fell In Love.
 
The premise of Science Fell in Love follows a group of students at Saitama University, in an Information Science lab. When one of the students, a grad student named Ayame Himuro, confesses her feelings to fellow grad student Shinya Yukimura, Yukimura ends up getting flustered and suggests proving empirically that love exists.

Hilarity ensues from there, with each episode involving the two leads doing a romantic thing, whether it’s cooking dishes for each other, or doing a Kabe-don, or going on an actual date, but done in the context of a science experiment. During this, various other members of the lab will be roped into the experiment and end up commenting on how absurd this whole mess is. The most common commentator is Kotonoha Kanada – an undergrad researching the Travelling Salesman Problem, and who ends up being the main straight woman of the series.

Kanada is also one of our two sources of exposition on scientific concepts over the course of the series. The other is Rikekuma – a grumpy and generally onery mascot bear. The two will go on an interlude at various points in each episode to explain a scientific concept – from how to calculate the margin of error for a study, to control groups, to what particular kinds of research are – making the show actually somewhat educational.

img220()
There needs to AMVs for this show and “She Blinded Me With Science”

As it is, the comedy in Science Fell In Love generally works, being absurdist and generally not-mean spirited. There are a couple of slightly homophobic jokes, which are unfortunate. However, the biggest fault with the show’s humor is that the humor works best on an episodic basis. If you watch a bunch of episodes back to back, the joke will get old very quickly, because they’re all variations on a theme. I came into the show two episodes in and had to stop and take a break after the start of episode 2 because the jokes in the basic premise were falling flat. Coming back the next day, all of the humor landed much better. Consequently, if you watch the show, I recommend you pace yourself.

Love is an existence that is often hard to grasp. It's a human experience that is profound yet fragile, sweet yet bitter, and familiar yet foreign. For many people, it's a powerful source of change in their life. So, when simplicity and mastery combine together to capture the delicate rawness of young love, a beauty is able to bloom among all the swaying emotions; the beauty that we call Tamako Love Story.

Before I express how fantastic this movie is, watching Tamako Market first is highly recommended. Seeing what the characters are like before to what they are like now, along with other nuances and parallels, will make the experience even more beautiful and nostalgic.

With that out of the way, it's time to dive into the heart of the movie. Even though it's not an inventive film, the way the story depicts what love is all about is amazingly executed. Isaac Newton, a key scientist known for the falling apple anecdote and his work on gravity and motion, said this in response to how he can come up with remarkable theories: ""By always thinking unto them."" Now, you might be asking how his referenced quote relates to anything here, but it neatly ties together with the struggles faced by the characters. Just like trying to understand the scientific laws of the universe, understanding love for the first time can also bring in challenges and troubles.

img()

This is why the central characters, Tamako and Mochizou, are able to shine so brightly. They are portrayed as realistic teenagers who have barely scratched the surface of love. Because of their inexperience, we see them stumble and try to find answers—sometimes awkwardly, sometimes painfully—on how to respond to each other's feelings. So much so, that their feelings transcend fiction into our world, creating an emotional connection between us and them. It's what being genuine can do to a story. Their history as childhood friends shows us just how long-lasting their bonds are, and I can't help but to root for their success. Some of Isaac Newton's references, in particular with the analogy to gravity, is also used to metaphorically compare Tamako's whole bewilderment. These small details might be subtle, but they work wonder to construct the characters in a bigger picture.

It's also worth mentioning that other characters complement the main pair as well, especially one of Tamako's friend named Midori. Similar to Mochizou, she too views Tamako as someone more than just friends, but it's made clear her character arc is a bittersweet one. Following her battles against her own feelings is a painful reminder that not everyone will get the happiness they so desired. While it certainly hurts, she's the one who grows with the strongest resolution, making her a character of great contrast.

And all the pieces of the film gradually build up into an excellent ending of considerable impact. I'll just say that it's one that gives us a sense of satisfaction but at the same time, it also leaves us longing for more. It simply is the perfect embodiment of yearning sweetness—just like love.

Obviously, Tamako Love Story has a visual too and undoubtedly, seeing the art here is reason enough as to why Kyoto Animation is reputed to be a studio of high-quality aesthetics. In contrast to the bright TV series, the movie takes on a more mature approach, painting each scene with muted colors and earthly tones. It's a brilliant shift because not only does this emphasize the underlying themes of young love and growth, it's also a reminder of childhood memories—something that is shared by both Tamako and Mochizou. The expressive animation further enhances the character's emotions in a grounded state, making sure to avoid any impractical exaggerations to keep the realism intact. Combined together with the amazing lighting, various photographical effects, and incredibly realistic backgrounds, every shot adorns the film further; earning it the right to be called a gorgeous marvel.

To expand on that, while the colors are indeed more subdued throughout, there are times when the art is not afraid to use visual expressions to communicate a greater meaning, as is the case with the warm flushes in rosy scenes and cold melancholy for the more dejected moments. Visual metaphors, such as the presence of dandelions, convey numerous meanings in symbolic ways as well, and it's great to see how the movie incorporated them to add more layers into the story and characters.

Last but not least, we have the supplementing soundtracks. Compared to the other factors here, the tracks can be said to be a slightly weaker element as they're usually just there in the background, gently playing with quiet nostalgia. But when they stand out, they stand out with profound effects. The song, ""Koi No Uta"", is perhaps the best example as it's a love song composed by Tamako's father to the person who later becomes his wife, and in turn, Tamako's mother. It's the perfect song to show the blooming of love between Tamako and Mochizou; the perfect parallel to send out a wave of emotions. And referencing Isaac Newton one last time, specifically with the title of his book on the laws of motion, is the ending song called ""Principle"". Sang by the voice actress of the pure Tamako, this song pleasantly ends everything on a wonderful note.

Love is an existence that is often hard to grasp. It is, but when there's a movie like Tamako Love Story that knows how to capture the fundamental beauty of this multifaceted concept, what comes out is something that can only be described as being magical. The struggles of the characters, the simplistic and precious story, the breathtaking visual, and the sound of serenity—they all aggregate together into this one beautiful experience.

img520()

Dragon Ball Super: Broly had all the right ingredients to be a success. It was a theatrical release to one of the biggest anime sensations of all time. It featured Broly, an immensely popular character in some circles. It would see oversight from series creator Akira Toriyama, much like Super and the two movies proceeding it. It employed a new art direction said to make movement more fluid. 

It would seem that these attributes of the film were put to good use — Dragon Ball Super: Broly, to date, is the highest-grossing Dragon Ball movie as well as one of the highest-grossing anime movies of all time. That’s not even to mention the critical reception, which has been quite positive.

That’s all fine and dandy, but what do I make of the film?

Well, I really loved it. And it’s not because I “turned my brain off since it’s a shonen anime.” As a fan, I felt the creators really knew their audience as well as the larger universe that this movie belongs to. It was breathtaking and surprisingly emotional at times. I don’t have any qualms about saying that this is the definitive Dragon Ball movie.

One of the things that makes this movie so remarkable is just how important it is. I know this statement might sound vague, so I hope to make myself clear.

img520(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20181108055244)

I don’t want to get into the canon/non-canon debate, but it’s unquestionable that “canocity” is a big part of the appeal with the recent slew of Dragon Ball movies. A lot of the Dragon Ball Z movies could be dismissed because most of them didn’t fit in nicely with the story. Come Battle of Gods, people were excited because Toriyama was on board, signifying that that movie mattered in the larger universe of Dragon Ball. Its events could have consequences down the line. With the release of Super, this was proven true. With Broly, not only was a fan-favorite character going to be canonized, but Goku’s origin and the genocide of the saiyan race as well.

You see, the first third or so of Dragon Ball Super: Broly depicts Broly’s origins as well as Vegeta’s and Goku’s. I really appreciate this. Having two distinct time periods run the risk of making a work feel disjointed, but the first portion of the film ties it together. We get to see why Broly ended up the way he is as well as getting more context surrounding the heroes we’ve been following for so long. Gine and Bardock’s farewell to Goku was surprisingly moving. I didn’t expect it from a Dragon Ball movie. Hell, I probably wouldn’t expect it in the show, either. The first-third of the movie makes it feel more personal than many other Dragon Ball sagas.

img520(

Well, more persona for viewers and Paragus & Bardock. It’s personal for us because we get a glimpse into the lives of the saiyans and it’s quite emotional. It’s personal for Paragus and Bardock because the things they experienced lead them to carry out the events of the rest of the film. Unfortunately, a criticism I have of the movie is that it’s billed — structured, even — as a story about Goku, Vegeta, and Broly’s origins. While it’s true that it’s certainly about all three, Goku and Vegeta combined have a tangential account, at best, of the first half of the movie. This causes the two to feel less central to the plot when we come back to the present-day. In the grand scheme of things, this is relatively minor. Akira Toriyama apparently wanted the movie to be three hours long. While I doubt me and other diehard fans would have minded, that would have made for an abnormally long movie. After everything's said and done, the cut we got was fine, albeit not perfect. I’ll keep my eyes peeled for a possible director’s cut in the future, however.

I also like the “saiyan” angle because it makes it more acceptable not to see the other Z Fighters in action.

img520()

Given that the writers would be discarding the old canon, changes were inevitable. As fans, we’d have to accept these changes either way, but I’m happy to say they were mostly for the better. A big point of worry was Goku’s origin as well as Bardock’s characterization. Bardock’s Father of Goku iteration was immensely popular, and at the release of Dragon Ball Minus, me and other fans were worried that Toriyama was making Bardock too much into Jor-El, Superman’s father. I’m happy to say that, while he cares more about his son than the old version of the character, he still feels like Bardock, being gruff and defiant to the end. I appreciated finally getting to see more of Vegeta’s father and seeing how the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

img520(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20181128104013)

Broly is, in a word, is amazing. The original Broly movie was the only Dragon Ball movie I owned as a kid, so the lunk has a special place in my heart. They overhauled his character and he’s amazing. He’s a truly tragic character and you really sympathize with him. Unlike Jiren, his backstory doesn’t feel hokey — most likely because it didn’t come out of nowhere and we actually experience parts of it instead of it just being exposited. Like my favorite character, Future Trunks, his upbringing really shapes his unique personality —  Future Trunks is so stern and pragmatic due to living in a colorless, post-apocalyptic future; Broly is quiet, somewhat dim, and animalistic due to growing up on a remote planetoid where his only companion was his brutal father who only saw him as a weapon to carry out his vendetta. Come the end of the movie, given everything he’s gone through, you don’t want the protagonists to win. Broly is a good antagonist for the same reason Beerus is — he breaks the mold by being more than a one-note, destruction-craving villain. This version of Broly is probably my second-favorite Dragon Ball character.

img520(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20181005004921)

I enjoyed that the movie still managed to fit in room for jokes; they really lightened the mood and they didn’t feel out of place. Parts of the movie felt like the original Dragon Ball, which I hope some fans will be able to appreciate. I was afraid that, given the events of Super, they were going to damage Frieza’s character, I was pleasantly surprised at how dastardly he still was. It’s even more notable that he can have a complete gag of a wish (he wants to grow five centimeters taller; any taller and it would seem conspicuous) but still seem threatening.

The animation and is certainly different this time around. The scenes with Goku on crew on Earth often have a simplistic style, with less detail and somewhat muted backgrounds.. I wasn’t sure about it initially, but having some time to reflect on it, I think I like it. It makes me think of the manga. I appreciate Goku and Vegeta not appearing as lanky as they do in some Super episodes, while also not grotesquely buff a like some Z episodes. They’re realistic enough that they can make me feel bad about myself. Fights are still beautifully animated except for the occasional weird CGI.

And of course, it wouldn’t be Dragon Ball without the fights, which are breathtaking. The movie was determined to remind me why I loved the original Broly— his immense power. He hits like a truck and the choreography, environmental damage, and the glorious screams of Sean Schemmel as Goku gets absolutely rocked all serve to drive this point home.

img520(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20181108055111)

You’ll go “holy shit” at least once in the movie. Perhaps it’s just seeing Broly in action after so many years. Maybe it’s the depiction of a young Raditz. Maybe it’s when the characters fight through lava or cause a rift in space-time and act like nothing happened. Maybe it’s finally seeing Gogeta made canon as he gloriously dukes it out with Broly. Maybe it’s the end of the movie where Goku tells Broly to call him Kakarot.

The music where someone is chanting the characters’ names might seem campy, especially if you listen to it without watching the scene. But trust me, it works. And it’s awesome.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNDT2wVvIZI)

This entire movie was, excuse my French, fucking amazing.

It might seem that I only liked this movie as much as I did because I was a longtime fan with meta knowledge of the series, but believe me, if you like Dragon Ball Z or Super in any capacity, even if you’ve only watched Super, do yourself a favor and watch Dragon Ball: Z Broly. The plot, characterization, and action are all amazing.

If you're one of the people that don't like Broly's original incarnation, give this one a chance, because he's more than a green-haired psychopath now, and he just so happens to star in the best Dragon Ball movie.

Yet, through life’s odd ironic twists, it is one such force that gets everything moving. Iwakura Mitsumi is late to her first day of high school, lost in Tokyo and not knowing her left from her right. A girl who is driven to succeed has driven herself into a corner. But coming “to the rescue” is Shima Sousuke, who likewise is late to the first day of school, but doesn’t seem to pay much mind to being late. Within this strange encounter from two people with opposite perspectives, they hoof it to the school, Mitsumi tripping. But in one moment of sheer determination, she takes off her shoes and socks, continuing to run as the pavement pounds her feet. Shima looks on for a moment, seemingly taking in the sight of something both physically goofy and, for him, emotionally foreign. He cannot help but run along as well in her wake, and with a more spirited purpose than before. In just trying to get to school on time, both characters are thrown into new beginnings, complete with sakura blossoms.

But as is often the case with entering new social spheres, that comfort zone must be left behind and you step into a new world of possibilities for people, things, and thoughts. It doesn’t have to involve a complete reinvention of who you are, either. There are numerous, tiny ways that the characters in Skip to Loafer express that they understand one another, even if they inevitably will leave some things housed within. The result is a fascinating breed of understanding and familiarity through understanding unfamiliarity, the acknowledgement that being able to read the room with just a touch more awareness makes the metaphorical barriers between people disappear. Tiny moments like these accrue throughout, blossoming the friendships into something that, while perhaps starting tenuously, end up feeling as comfy as an old pair of shoes. In that sense, it is a true ensemble show, and though Mitsumi and Shima’s self-actualization may be at the forefront, the others are hardly out of the spotlight for long.



And that’s what it’s all about.

20812,"Apparently, [working in the anime industry is tough shit.]( https://www.buzzfeed.com/danmeth/this-american-is-one-of-the-only-non-japanese-working-in-ani?utmterm=.slZvE0MM0#.ccWWOZNNZ) [Like really tough.]( http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-11-02/animator's-salaries) Of course, we consumers are oftentimes oblivious to or far too willing to ignore the painstaking lengths the creators of our evening entertainment go to as to keep us entertained. 

Instead, we grovel at whatever’s on the monitor in front of us. Or we change our desktop background to fan art of whatever the flavour of the month is. Or, as I am all too experienced at, we talk mad shit on the internet. 



All of these things are fine. I’m sure any creator would like people to watch and openly discuss their product. The point remains: we frequently only see anime at face value, only to ignore the hundreds of faces behind it. The underpaid work hours, the countless pencil strokes and the many individuals that form the foundation of any anime too often go unappreciated. 

Shirobako pays homage to, recognises and is in many ways [a love letter](https://animethemes.moe/video/Shirobako-ED1v2.webm) to these individuals. 



The story follows five former classmates as they attempt to navigate their way through the anime industry. Each girl aspires for/is working in a different field, from key animation to voice acting. However, the focus of the story is main girl and best girl Aoi, a production assistant at a struggling studio. 



That said, the cast is enormous. There are a ridiculous number of speaking roles as there are multiple characters for virtually every position in the studio. CG artists, key animators, background artists, colourists, inbetweeners, sound technicians, seiyuus, assistants, writers, producers, the director and the general manager – all of them have their moments. Anime is a collaborative effort and Shirobako emphasises this. To top things off, many of the characters are [references to various real life industry counterparts.]()  

You’d think that handling such a massive array of characters would be burdensome, yet Shirobako does it with laudable finesse. Every character has a unique personality. In fact, many members of the secondary and even tertiary cast receive some development. Whether it’s a two-minute segment or a traceable evolution throughout the entire series, nearly every character, regardless of how important they are in the context of the central story, feels genuine. Hell, even [Goth-loli-sama]() gets a spotlight episode. Some are more likable than others, some receive more attention and others are obviously more gimmicky, yet nearly all of them feel like real people. And that’s the point. Regardless of their position and how insignificant it may appear, each individual in the industry is an actual person. A person complete with his or her own quirks, mannerisms, passions, goals and dreams. It’s not a huge revelation, but Shirobako does an excellent job at reminding us of this simple yet often forgotten fact. 



Which brings us to our main five. If I have one major complaint, it’s that the screen time isn’t allocated evenly enough amongst the five. This is because each and every one of the girls is so goddamn lovable. I’m not one easily sold on moe characters, but Shirobako ensures to go above and beyond with its central cast. 



Sure the girls are cute, and that’s a definite part of their appeal. And yet, they each have elements to their characterisation that extend beyond this. Each of the girls shares the same dream: they want to make anime. They all go about achieving this dream in differing fashions, they are all at different stages and they all have their own reasons. Granted some of their respective traits are less inspired than others and none of them are overly nuanced or complex. Ultimately, however, we care enough about each of them such that we actively root for their success.

youtube(7tWrE0freJI)

Aoi perhaps best demonstrates this. She is earnest, conscientious and kind beyond impair. Yet, she has her own distinct faults. At the beginning of the series, she is far too passive and lacking in resilience. Most importantly, she lacks direction in her life. Her goals are vague and clouded, whilst she struggles to identify the reasons that motivate her to keep going. As someone whose future is not as clear as he’d like it to be, this sense of loss and confusion is all too relatable. 



And that’s the thing: Shirobako doesn’t sugar coat the industry, or the adult professional life for that matter. As we’ve established, making anime is no easy task, [especially given how paltry the monetary rewards are.]() Just like in any workplace environment, people get frustrated, people become dissatisfied with their lives and people experience failure. Shirobako reflects this; its characters can and will fail. In a similar vein, it captures some of the internal political struggles within the industry. This includes workplace sexism, intervening corporate interests and [blood-boiling miscommunications between source material and anime creators.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-05-31/polar-bear-cafe-creator-comments-further-on-anime)  

Indeed, the plot, which primarily follows the studio as they attempt to dish out each episode on time, contains enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. The conflict and drama never really feels too contrived. It seems as if the complications the characters face were all experienced first-hand by the folks at PA Works. 



However, the show isn’t really about this doom and gloom. It still leaves us with a hopeful message. As horribly cliché as it sounds, it’s all about clinging to your dreams in the face of this adversity, to learn from it and grow. It’s all so simple, yet incredibly poignant at the same time. It’s genuinely heartwarming to see Aoi endure her struggles, find her bearings and become stronger, and in the end happier, as a person. Likewise with all the girls. 



On top of all this sentimental stuff, Shirobako is an anime about making anime. The series strives to give credit to and show its appreciation for everybody involved in the creative process, and so it presents and explores each part of this process in delightful detail. There’s something humbling about seeing the key animators in action, or learning about the difficulties in accurately capturing animal movements or understanding just how much effort goes into producing realistic sound effects. Even watching the production assistants running frantically from desk to desk and from office to office is eye-opening in comprehending just how much dedication is required for ostensibly the most menial of roles. 

It’s quite the educational experience. 



There is also an omnipresent meta level that only reinforces this sense of appreciation. Keep in mind that people had to make this anime about people making anime. As such, when a character in the show learns about the complexities of feline movement by observing a cat, some poor sod at PA Works probably spent an afternoon scribbling down notes regarding the movements of his/her pet cat. Or when an animator in the show is drawing some key frames, an animator in the real world had to draw both the animator and the frames. Cue the Inception gong. 

Of course, PA Works knows what they’re doing, and this meta self-awareness can get hilariously tongue-in-cheek. 



This ties into another thing Shirobako nails: the comedy. I’ve already talked about the character references to real life industry professionals, some of which are gleefully over the top. There are of course references to countless other anime, including some really obscure titles. 



Like the in-show director comments, you can’t make anime if you’re not a child at heart. Thankfully, it is this very childishness that delivers fantastic gags like the Initial D production assistant drag racing, the fight to the boss room, and rooftop aerobics. 

youtube(qLMB1vtvuuE)

Visually, Shirobako is not one of PA Works’ most impressive shows, but the art quality is consistently good. Character designs are great, even for minor characters. A small detail that goes a long way in adding a sense of realism to the show is the constantly shifting clothing designs. Not to mention, they’re cute as fuck. 


Aoi's wardrobe

Similarly, the soundtrack is not that memorable, but it’s not particularly poor either. Voice acting is on point. Furthermore, it’s fitting to note that for the seiyuu who played Zuka-chan – the aspiring voice actress – this was her first major role. 


There’s something endearing about the characters watching a completed episode for the first time. For many of these people - both in-show and in the real world, the show would have me believe - anime is not merely a source of income. Rather, it is proof of their collaborative efforts, the outcome of years of dedication and love and the realisation of their dreams. Shirobako is for these people. 



But beyond this, Shirobako is dual natured. It also presents a story that even those most unfamiliar with the industry can empathise with. A story about the tribulations of working life, about deciding on and pursuing one’s goals and about constantly moving forward. 



I haven’t felt this strongly about or rated an anime this highly in a long time. I tried to find flaws (it’s kinda my forte) but nothing really stood out. I adored virtually every second of the series. If you’re even a casual fan of the medium, Shirobako provides significant insight into the workings of an anime. If not, then there’s a simple but relatable and poignant story to enjoy."
129196,"I can't say I recommend this. I've been watching this series each season ongoing since 2015 but I'm calling it. I feel insulted by all the exposition, leave some room for viewers to think for themselves and figure things out or at least explain things only once.

No surprise whatsoever. The plot is straightforward, no turning back, no back story, nothing. Straight from an elementary student's writing. 
The story of each episode is quite literally: the party encountered danger, one character showed their power, the problem solved. Then another problem appeared which needs a character to get stronger to solve it, the character gets stronger, the problem solved.

Easily the most brutal and gory season, so much blood and deaths, yet I cared so little. Why? Characters were introduced just to be torn in half within 2-3 minutes. The writer wants gore and deaths yet doesn't want to lose any well established characters. Every death ends up feeling so cheap yet gory and disgusting, it's like watching someone step on insects just for the hell of it.

You can make a fight feel difficult without killing nobodies if you use your imagination a bit more, many other animes managed to do it. You can also go the other route and make it sad by killing people that viewers have established connection with, many other animes managed to do it...

I also have a huge issue with the way they repeat things over and over and over again. Ryuu's past was explained at least 3 times in the last 2 episodes and over 5 times in the season, and the way everyone just stops fighting and listens to the story being told over and over just irritated me.

Many character's do some real frustrating things, for example at some point in the story we get introduced to a character that has an ability to foretell the future in her dreams, yet nobody wants to listen to her, even though her dreams proven consistently accurate.

Bell's actions don't make sense and are frankly... Stupid. A person kills hundreds of people and brags about it in his face, and Bell just decides to spare him and let him go continue doing what he does best, kill innocents.

Bad person: continues hurting Bell and his friends
Bell:

The sound is great. The music fits well and is generally acceptable. Nothing seems out of place and the voice acting is great, with each character's voice recognizable even if without seeing their faces.

You actually have to be high as hell to enjoy watching this, you need to throw common sense out of the window, otherwise most character's actions will frustrate you. You also need to pass out when they explain the same thing 3 times in the same episode, then wake up at the good parts (good animations btw). Probably not watching the 2023 season."

116588,"Oggi vorrei esporre qualche mio pensiero sull'adattamento animato dell'ultima opera di Natsume Akatsuki, autore dell'ormai celebre Light Novel Konosuba(che ha acquisito poi la maggior parte della propria popolarità in seguito all' uscita dell'anime). Premetto che ho adorato Konosuba come commedia, ed è in generale uno dei miei anime preferiti in assoluto, per cui sono molto legato in un certo senso alle opere del sopracitato autore. Cercherò ovviamente di essere il più obiettivo possibile a riguardo, senza lasciarmi influenzare dal nome che si porta dietro.

TRAMA: Come Konosuba, Sentouin Hakenshimasu è caratterizzato da una trama relativamente banale, che però in questo caso si distingue per la peculiarità del protagonista villain, alla conquista di un mondo per conto della propria agenzia, la Kisaragi. Escludendo questo tratto, la trama non è contraddistinta da nessun particolare colpo di scena e quindi il 100% del potenziale di quest'anime (come il predecessore) va visto nella parte comedy dell'opera. A tal proposito ho visto un netto miglioramento di questo aspetto lungo questi 12 episodi. Ammetto che dal primo episodio, le mie prime impressioni erano tutt'altro che positive, forse per via di qualche battuta stupida di troppo. Proseguendo nella storia e introducendo nuovi personaggi però il tutto mi è parso molto più simpatico di quanto non fosse agli inizi, sia perchè avevo già iniziato a farci l'abitudine sia perchè ritengo che la qualità della commedia sia effettivamente migliorata, almeno un minimo. 

PERSONAGGI: Il protagonista è il soldato della Kisaragi Corporation, Combattente n. 6 (Sentouin Roku-gou), affiancato dalla propria assistente, Alice Kisaragi, androide prodotto dalla compagnia. é proprio intorno al protagonista che gira l'evoluzione della commedia di cui ho parlato in precedenza. Dopo aver dimostrato di essere una persona con un IQ superiore a 3, la commedia è migliorata gradualmente. Ho apprezzato molto tutti i personaggi secondari che gli sono stati affiancati, a partire dalla stessa Alice, per concludere con le new entry Snow, Grimm e Rose. Nei personaggi secondari non c'è particolare innovazione nelle personalità rispetto a una classica commedia però le ho trovate comunque interessanti e simpatiche a tratti. Commedia che quindi si appoggia letteralmente su classiche battute e gag a tema sessuale (anche per via del fatto che il protagonista possa acquisire punti compiendo gesti spiacevoli per le altre persone), un discreto numero di reference a Konosuba, una loli androide con un bazooka, una spadaccina che farebbe di tutto pur di avere un paio di dollari in più nel portafoglio, una sacerdotessa sulla sedia a rotelle per via di una maledizione autoinflitta, e una chimera che acquisisce le abilità di tutto ciò che mangia (un po' come Tamaki Amajiki di My Hero Academia o più semplicemente Kirby). Onorevole di menzione è anche una dei generali del Re dei demoni Heine, autentica fabbrica di fanservice (di qualità) dell'anime.

DISEGNI/ANIMAZIONI: J.C. Staff dimostra ancora una volta di essere un buono studio di animazione (ricordiamo che è lo stesso studio che ha animato il film di Konosuba) tramite dei buoni disegni e delle animazioni di medio livello. Certamente non stiamo parlando di Demon Slayer o qualsivoglia capolavoro dell'animazione ma per un anime di questo genere, questo tipo di grafica è più che sufficiente.

MUSICHE: Tutto il comparto musicale in generale non è particolarmente degno di nota. In merito mi limito a dire che ho trovato l'Opening e un paio di OST comunque orecchiabili.

In conclusione ritengo di aver visto un'opera comunque apprezzabile, che è riuscita a strapparmi qualche risata. Se siete interessati a qualche commedia caratterizzata da battute prevalentemente a sfondo sessuale e una buona quantità di fanservice, questi 12 episodi si sono rivelati come degni, seppur non essendo il grande imperatore delle commedie. Nonostante questo tengo sempre a ricordare che la commedia è la cosa più soggettiva che esista, non possiamo scegliere cosa ci fa ridere. 







Today I would like to express some of my thoughts on the animated adaptation of the latest work by Natsume Akatsuki, author of the now famous Light Novel Konosuba (which then acquired most of its popularity following the release of the anime). I state that I loved Konosuba as a comedy, and in general it is one of my absolute favorite anime, so I am very attached in a sense to the works of the aforementioned author. I will obviously try to be as objective as possible about it, without letting myself be influenced by the name it carries.

PLOT: Like Konosuba, Sentouin Hakenshimasu is characterized by a relatively banal plot, which however in this case stands out for the peculiarity of the villain protagonist, conquering a world on behalf of his agency, the Kisaragi Corporation. Excluding this trait, the plot is not characterized by any particular twist and therefore 100% of the potential of this anime (like the predecessor) must be seen in the comedy genre. In this regard, I have seen a marked improvement in this aspect over these 12 episodes. I admit that from the first episode, my first impressions were anything but positive, perhaps due to a few too many stupid jokes. Continuing the story and introducing new characters, however, everything seemed much more sympathetic than it was at the beginning, both because I had already started to get used to it and because I believe that the quality of the comedy has actually improved, at least a minimum.

CHARACTERS: The protagonist is the soldier of the Kisaragi Corporation, Combat Agent Six (Sentouin Roku-gou), flanked by his assistant, Alice Kisaragi, an android produced by the company. It is precisely around the protagonist that the evolution of the comedy I mentioned earlier revolves. After proving to be a person with an IQ above 3, the comedy gradually improved. I really appreciated all the secondary characters that were joined to him, starting from Alice herself, to conclude with the new entries Snow, Grimm and Rose. In the secondary characters there is no particular innovation in the personalities compared to a classic comedy, however I found them interesting and funny at times. Comedy that therefore literally relies on classic sex-themed jokes and gags (also due to the fact that the protagonist can acquire points by making unpleasant gestures to other people), a fair number of Konosuba references, an android loli with a bazooka, a swordswoman who would do anything to have a couple of dollars more in her wallet, a priestess in a wheelchair due to a self-inflicted curse, and a chimera who acquires the skills of everything she eats (a bit like Tamaki Amajiki from My Hero Academia or simply Kirby). Honorable mention is also one of the Demon Lords' Elite Four Heine, authentic factory of (quality) fanservice.

ART/ANIMATION: J.C. Staff once again proves to be a good animation studio (remember that it is the same studio that animated Konosuba's movie) through good drawings and animations. We are certainly not talking about Demon Slayer or any animation masterpiece but for an anime of this genre, this type of graphics is more than enough.

MUSIC: The whole musical sector in general is not particularly noteworthy. In this regard, I will limit myself to saying that I found the Opening and a couple of OST however catchy.

In conclusion, I believe I have seen a work that is still appreciable, which managed to get me a few laughs. If you're interested in some comedy featuring mostly sexual jokes and a good amount of fanservice, these 12 episodes turned out to be worthy, albeit not the Great Emperor of comedies. Despite this, I always want to remember that comedy is the most subjective thing that exists, we cannot choose what makes us laugh.

1482,"Hey, you! Are you looking for a dark fantasy show that also happens to be an amazing shounen? And has a cast filled with complex and incredibly interesting characters? Then it is your lucky day today because D.Gray-man fits this description perfectly! 



This anime introduces us to an alternative 19th century and follows the journey of Allen Walker, a young exorcist, who joins an organization called Black Order to fight alongside other exorcists. The exorcists aren’t ordinary people, therefore they are the ones who can use Innocence, an ancient essence to battle the Millennium Earl and his creations called Akuma who are ready to do anything to destroy humanity. Although the plot might sound very generic, let me assure you that the title gets dark really quick since it raises such heavy topics as what it takes to be human, the pain and agony of inner conflict, and who/what people (and others) care about.



As I said above, the plot does indeed sound basic but the way this anime explores the narrative is very engaging and makes you question many things, not only about the world within that show but also outside of it. DGM narrative challenges and encourages you to think about your own life, your priorities; it provokes you to think critically about who is important to you, who you care about, and what you care about in the show/real life. How does it do it? It’s pretty simple! Throughout the story, we get to follow Allen, and since it is “expected” or “natural” for us to attach to him because he’s the main character, together with him we go through this incredible emotional journey where we see him during the ups and downs which are usually major plot points. Not only that but we also get to see other main and side characters go through these hardships because of how the story continues to grow and becomes darker and darker with each episode. Talking about the episodes, DGM has 103 episodes, ⅕ of which are fillers but the fillers are pretty good because they explore the side characters, they give them that screen time they deserve, and it leads to us getting involved with the story even more. Moreover, it just adds to the overall narrative and supports the world building of this alternative 19th century where everyone is in danger and you don’t know who you can trust. Additionally, we don’t only see the good guys' stories and struggles during the show. We get to see the evil guys’ story too! We don’t get to know every single detail about them but thanks to the incredible narration and all of the twists, all of the battles, all of the story, the viewers, us, get attached to the bad guys too. 

Overall, D.Gray-man starts with what seems to be a simple conflict between good and evil and then expands its story at an incredible but very comfortable speed. It demonstrates that sometimes good and evil, white and black, get mixed and what we get is this scary and eerie ‘grey’ uncertainty in our hearts. The pacing isn’t too fast or too slow, it is perfectly balanced, just as all things should be. The plot gets more and more complex and none of the episodes, including fillers, feel to be out of place. Each time we are introduced to new characters, there is a clear reason behind them and they all have significance for the overall title. For example, a number of them are shown to emotionally involve us, the viewers, more into the story, some of them are there for the story's development sake while others serve a clear purpose of exploring the main/side characters further.



When it comes to world building, DGM does it elegantly, swiftly, and clearly by introducing basic laws and rules right off the bat. From the first couple of episodes, we already know that there are people called exorcists who are chosen by God and can wield Innocence in different shapes and forms. These people, exorcists, obey the Black Order, which is a secret organization. To help exorcists fight, the organization has multiple locations all over the world, scientific departments, and people called finders who assist the exorcists in various ways. We also get to know to some extent how the other side of the conflict works during the very first episode. For example, we find out that Akuma is made by the Millenium Earl, and the exorcists’ goal is to defeat him to eradicate evil from the world. By adding these simple but solid concepts, the world begins to grow around you and completely immerses us in its narrative. These notions also play as dominant factors when it comes to major plot points, specifically the Akuma and the Black Order. 

Along with the rules, we can also see the religious influence within the show that adds to the anime’s charm. The important thing to mention is, although we notice mentions about God, Old Testament, Noah, and many other similar things, that the conflict itself is not necessarily about religion itself. By expanding on these universe rules and fundamentals, DGM manages to build an incredible world that supports the story making it richer, thicker, and overall more exciting for the viewer. However, it should be noted that with each episode we are going deeper and deeper into the core, the heart of the series, which means we become accompanied by many unanswered mysteries. Although we encounter a good bunch of them, they aren’t imposed by force. Rather, they feel normal and natural.



I could write you a whole college thesis-sized paper regarding DGM characters but for the sake of being short, I’ll try my best to be very concise and speak generally about everyone.
Let me assure you, everybody in this show has a personality. Not only do they have personalities but they also don’t feel one-dimensional throughout the entire series. Despite this show being somewhat on the longer side of the spectrum, we barely or, rather, never get tired from the characters that appear on the screen. They can be a good person or a bad person, it does not matter, we still are interested in them or connected to them in one way or another. Their personalities are unique and special. I dare to say that DGM has one of the most natural and realistic cast of characters when it comes to their nature, identities, and individuality in comparison to other shounen series.

As the anime goes on, we are introduced to many important characters that either become main or side ones. As I mentioned above, thanks to the fillers (no sarcasm) we get to explore their true nature a bit more by seeing them engage with their world, people around them, and the overall story. While we are talking about character development, I’d like to mention that yes, my dear reader, it does exist in DGM! Okay, the next bit will sound super subjective but bear with me! Allen Walker, the main character, is explored throughout the whole show for obvious reasons. Lavi, for instance, hits major character development “spot” closer to the late middle-end of the series but we get the start for it way earlier than the end of the show. Lenalee’s crucial character building is divided into multiple parts and is set in different parts of the series. I believe that this sort of “strategy” (I am not saying it exists, it’s just how I interpreted the show!) is a very cool way of exploring multiple characters without overwhelming and distracting the viewers from important plot twists and/or plot points that are not necessarily character-driven.



As with my other reviews, I would like to be honest and mention my artistic abilities which are incredibly low and that is why I prefer to focus on other things other than visuals/audio (and that's why I didn't mention character design). However, I also would like to say that DGM was made back in 2006, so please expect some clunky animation and the gradient background with white/black lines to show action, speed, attack, and other things (but it does get slightly better by the end, I promise). This is probably the only thing that didn’t age that well when it comes to the show. Despite that, the openings do contain spoilers for the arcs, so please be careful when you are searching them up! Regardless, if you can overlook these flaws, you will have an amazing and amusing time watching all 103 episodes. 

The audio on the other hand is truly incredible. Every single OST used was beautifully composed. There is this one specific tune that is played closer to the end of the series, and you will definitely fall in love with it, trust me. Every single opening and ending song is astonishing and, how the kids nowadays say, they all bop and go hard.



D.Gray-man is a brilliant dark fantasy story that balances all of the essential aspects of an anime show extremely well.

I understand how some people may rate this show anywhere between 6-10 due to its flaws and shortcomings but DGM does truly deserve a watch and love, if not more (as of March 2021, I re-watched these series 4 times).  If you are looking for a less stressed and more laid back show, there is a high chance of you getting overwhelmed and  dropping this title because it does get very serious very quick. If you like shounen that twists your brain and makes you question things about the show and yourself, then DGM is for you.

137281,"It’s iyashikei greatness. This isn’t your normal run of the mill rom-com, it’s more a slice of life of two classmates, and then it gets a little romantic. Raido’s vivid imagination and Toubaru-Sensei nose bleeding just makes me smile, and I don’t know why. Maybe I’m just a sucker for deadpan humour, but this was better than some other big rom-coms this season. Yes, I’ll say it, I think it was better than Shikimori and Komi this season. Also, a comedy where the romance actually kinda gets somewhere? Who knew that was possible? This was a joy to watch throughout for sure, not because it became more romantic in the second half, but just how consistently funny it was for me.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 17/25

There’s really not a whole lot going on in each episode, since it’s pretty episodic for the most part, and there’s not a whole lot to talk about in the plot department. Glad that the characters had some development and the comedy was pretty decent throughout though.

ART: 8.2/10

It’s pretty basic, but it is colourful and vibrant, and fits the atmosphere welL.

MUSIC: 8.7/10

Big fan of both the opening and ending. TrySail and Hakoniwa Lily did a great job. The soundtrack itself isn’t too noticeable but from what I heard of it, it fit the vibe of the show well.

CHARACTERS: 17.2/20

This show benefits from having a good main duo, but also a bunch of very fun side characters, which not every show has. Obviously Reina and Raido are fun to watch. Reina is a very small girl who doesn’t really know social boundaries and talks very quietly, but quickly this theme became obsolete as the show progressed. Raido is someone who is also pretty deadpan and doesn’t show much emotion, but has very vivid imagination about Reina’s antics, ranging from thinking she was a killer, even making a Kill Bill reference along the way, to thinking she was a sumo wrestler when Reina ate too much and got fat. The imagination was pretty enjoyable to watch, since it was very different each time.

Now, the side characters. My favourite side character has to be Toubaru-Sensei, since she’s all about esteem, and when Reina and Raido do something cute, or weird, she reacts in the form of nose bleeds, and the sub plots about her and Miyahira-Sensei being together was just honestly hilarious. 

And what’s a rom-com without a little side romance? Futaba and Atsushi’s little thing together was so fun to watch too, and how Atsushi regards Raido as “king” was so funny to me too.

Finally, we got Reina’s siblings. They all look like her. That’s basically the gist of it.

ENJOYMENT: 14.5/15

Even though it’s pretty bare bones in terms of production, I still really enjoyed this show, and it gave me a lot of laughs along the way.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 17/20

The comedic themes were handled great, really loved the deadpan comedy they went for, and it works. The romance themes were a bit sudden, felt like the source material, which I haven’t read, was probably slower paced in terms of romantic developments, but that’s just a guess. Overall, just very enjoyable.

OVERALL: 82.6/100

It’s not the prettiest out there, it’s not a “loud” or “fast-paced” show, it’s iyashikei done very well. The comedy definitely intrigued me more than the romance side of things, but all things considered, there’s not much to complain about. It’s definitely not for everyone, but it was definitely fun to watch every single week.

Oh, one more thing, fidget spinners in 2022? That, I did not expect."
5681,"Ah, Summer Wars. I had no expectations whatsoever for it, but it pleasantly surprised me. Its characters had personality and heart, even if they were nothing but the most inconsequential part of the Jinnouchi clan. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting it so be such an ensemble kind of a movie when I read the summary. I mean, how often do you see an ensemble movie? In that regard, it surprised me in a good way. Everything in the movie worked, even if it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I had only seen one other movie from Director Mamoru Hosoda, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and I could definitely see similarities in style, which wasn't a bad thing by any means, but it's definitely not a standout of his at all.

I think I had really similar complaints with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time in regards to art style and such. That would be that I don't really like the fairly muted color palette that both used. There are so few bright colors that it feel as if nothing really pops out to you visually. Now, all that is a criticism for the real world color palette, but all of the Oz scenes? Those were beautiful. They really used color to another level in those sequences, which I guess was the point, but it still doesn't make me like the muted colors any more.
The soundtrack was there, I suppose. It felt like really generic movie music, if I can be perfectly honest. The ending song is actually pretty solid, it felt like an Japanese, old-school country song. It's a cool little change up.

Can I even have a favorite character for Summer Wars? I felt like the whole family was my favorite character, so whatever lets do it.
Favorite Character: The Jinnouchi clan
img()

I'm not even joking, the whole family was great. Their interactions were so awesome and realistic. Summer Wars probably resonated with me so much because it reminds me of my own big family, in which, I can say that this is an accurate representation of a large family gathering. The banter, the arguing, the competition, all of it. Even to the point where, despite all the fighting, everyone loves each other at the end of the day. Summer War's representation of family is why I loved the movie to the extent that I did. As an aside, shout out to the Baseball Jinnouchi. He was the real soldier, making it to nationals through all of that struggle and  without knowing any of the crazy stuff that was happening while he was doing it. Here's to you Baseball Jinnouchi.

I did have a few issues with Summer Wars, though, and most of them can be traced back to the overarching story and Oz. The whole movie would have been 100% better without the silly Oz drama or any of the Oz sequences. Sure, I mentioned earlier that all of the Oz scenes were beautiful, and they were, but the context behind those scenes was ridiculous. The whole story revolving around Oz is laughable, honestly, and really, I could have done without any of it. I loved the family aspect of Summer Wars enough that I could have watched a whole movie about it, without any of the insanity happening online. I understand that a lot of motivating factors would have been lost, but hey, that's why imagination exists.

For those issues, I do have to drop Summer Wars into the 80s, but it was still worth watching for the family interaction alone. I feel like Summer Wars really missed out on a lot of potential, but despite that, still managed to pull something pretty good together. If you like ensemble casts or family interaction than Summer Wars is a movie for you, but if you're in it for the story, you're probably not going to love Summer Wars."
98320,"Koi To Uso, or LOVE AND LIES, stays true to its title. It is an anime about the protagonist, Nejima Yukari, trying to find love with his longtime classmate Takasaki Misaka, whilst pretending to the government and his family that he wants to stay with his assigned partner, Sanada Ririna. 

Premise: 4/5

The basic premise is that, when a student turns sixteen, they are eligible to receive a notice from the Japanese government that assigns them a partner, whom they must marry (unless they dislike each other enough for it to be cancelled). I thought this was an interesting idea, something of a spin on the classic 'Betrothed to one person, but loves another' trope. It is a little outlandish, since it is set in what seems like contemporary, realistic Japan, but it is explained well enough within the world for me to accept it. Even though it's based in something of a classic story type, it isn't boring, nor is it particularly generic.

Story: 2.5/5:

It does a good job of keeping you until the end, and the pacing is pretty good: just enough happens in one episode for the story to remain detailed, without it being too much to take in. The actual storyline isn't particularly special; it's a little predictable, but still enjoyable. Overall, pretty average. I have to knock half a point off for the ending, which is probably the most disappointing ending I've watched in my rather small anime watching career.

Music: 5/5 

The opening is one of my favourites I have ever heard, and I listened to it long before watching the anime. The ending is also great, and is actually pretty emotional to me. The insert music throughout is good too, and underscores the relevant scenes well.

Execution: 4/5

Most of the time, the visuals are quite pleasant, with good-looking cities, forest, etc, but nothing particularly special. The eyes are really big, which distracts me a little, but it isn't an issue. At times, character movement can look odd, but it isn't anything major. Voice acting is great, with a lot of emotion conveyed through the characters' speech.

Altogether, I would give it a watch. It does a good job of making sure you're invested in the characters, whether you support Sanada or Takasaki (or even a mysterious third character who I shall not reveal for the purposes of keeping this review spoiler free). It also keeps a refreshingly mature view on such a concept as a boy choosing between two girls, with little to no ecchi content, as well as light humour.

Quick talk about the ending in the spoiler tag:

!Seriously, for such an enjoyable anime, I'm surprised at how they ended it. I appreciate that it would be difficult to have Neji choose definitively between Sanada or Takasaki, since it would have disappointed some fans either way, but I found myself experiencing nothing but disappointment after finishing it. I personally prefer Ririna, but I think it would have made far more sense for Neji to just choose Takasaki and be done with it, since that was his goal from the start. Then again, I think I would have been happiest if Neji had chosen Nisaka, since I ship that so hard, and Nisaka deserves some happiness. Either way, I doubt I will ever reconcile myself with it.!"

Have fun reading my first review ^^




Even if you think that everything is meaningless, your life is the proof that people that came before and that loved you gave their best to make sure you stay here and that you'll go down the route that will lead toward your future. 

You can't afford to become a monster, you can't afford to lose your mind. You now must fight for something you want to protect now.

 Fighting  for a past that will consume you it's not anymore your choice. 

So now...stand up warrior. Even if your flesh it's not of an human anymore... you have the right to keep living like one if you still have a mind and a gentle heart.

The words in the previous section...these were the thoughts that flashed straight away in my mind after have watched the epilogue of the last episode of Claymore : 
a dark fantasy, supernatural and gore oriented anime produced by studio [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) in collaboration with
[DR Movie](https://anilist.co/studio/6175/DR-Movie) that aired in the spring and summer season of 2007.

The show is an adaptation of the homonym manga published by Shueisha on Monthly Shonen Jump (2001-June 2007), Weekly Shonen Jump( June 2007-October 2007) and finally Jump Square (October 2007-2014) and that created by [Yagi Norihiro-sensei.](https://anilist.co/staff/97517/Norihiro-Yagi)

So...yes, here we have the first points to make clear about Claymore with the actual information I gave:

This show, even if it has a pretty dark, a little impegnative and also has a pretty decent characterization of its own ""key characters"", obviously from my point of view,...well the magazines are talking.

The anime adaptation that I watched and now reviewing not only covers 11 volumes of the 26 that completes the manga, making it an incomplete anime for the obvious reasons that ended 7 years later (and also to note that the 11 volumes in the anime are like in the manga...so good job to MADHOUSE for the factor ""no fillers"")...Claymore still remains a Shonen 
(demographic target of male teens between 13-17 years old ) and that's a fact that remains for the whole course of the anime experience and that everyone can feel on their skins... but it's still really a good one even with only those 11 volumes and its  ""open ending"" in the anime that yes, it kinda let you wish for more but it's a pretty decent ending that leaves the watcher with actually something at the end.

The structure and the development is on the same line of everything that it was been published from the end of the 90's and the middle-end of the 2000's on Jump...and this is another reason why Claymore amazed me!

I am going to explain myself  a little better: I think we are all too familiar with how battle shonens works.
We just start with an apparently strong character as the main protagonist, that beats everyone ass for the first 3/4 arcs, he mets a big guy, he goes to training, beats the big guy, gain some kinda of character development, go into the next location, etc... the circle repeats itself until there is a tournament or war arc blah blah blah.

Welp... Claymore shares a similar structure.... 
BUT STILL  I found it more than interesting for the simple reason that in Claymore...
more you become strong...more you are doomed to become the painter of the next bloodbath of innocents. More you become powerful...more you are going near the limit where you can't go back and you become a monster.

And not only you have nightmares every night about that inevitable day... but you can't avoid it.
You can fight that urge and try to still remain human... but one day you'll break and that is inevitable.

This concept and the continuous battle non-stop deep inside you to stop your urges is the bread and butter of Claymore and the fact is that gives A LOT of space for this concept and theme in the show even if anyone can see that is a narrative formula that it was used and reused a lot of times.
And this exact contrast that in my opinion that makes it a really interesting concept to give a chance even if you are not a gore/medieval fantasy/shonen type of person.

 This anime has a typical combo of elements from Seinen mangas (demographic target of male young adults of 18-19 years old and more) ... but still keeps the structure of a Shonen, making it a really entertaining bridge for the two demographic categories.

It's an optimal compromise for peoples that are searching a more meaningful SHONEN experience while trying to keep the classical character development formula of this category but with a more adult depth. 

To be honest I started watching Claymore without a clue of what I was going into... but with only keeping in mind 3 words that my fellow otaku bros always told me....""Sam....CLAYMORE > BERSERK"".

And you know what? That's an ERROR that everyone could do now that I lucidly think about it because comparing those two titans of the Gore Fantasy... 
it has no sense, but not because one of the two titles is better than the other from my point of view or one it's the son of the other and has a same base theme (but honestly I would take the side of Claymore in the war... but that's a talk for another day) but cause they have a different demographic target and so they take with them the cliches of their own demographic target for what was required to them at the beginning of their publish. Especially in Claymore case.

CLAYMORE = Shonen
BERSERK = Seinen
They are in different dimensions with 12 years of difference and so they are titans of the genre that  both started in two different eras. I agree that they possibly have a father-son relation with how they managed Guts and Clare...but Claymore has a more standard formula from my point of view but that doesn't actually take control of what it wants to give.

And... the fact is that this creative work  has some ways to wield his sword against a big shot like THE ""Berserk"" and this can tell you that maybe, not the anime but at 90% the manga of Yagi-sensei it's worth a shot if not one, but many affirm this and are still ""happily confused"" on the identity of this work.

But I think I wrote a lot in this section for just only being an introduction.
So let's jump in analyzing the plot.

img720()




1) STORY
In an hypothetical continent in a world in his medieval phase...humans struggles each day with the fear of being torn apart and have their guts been eaten. In this cruel and desperate world exist since humans can remember a race of demon-like predators called ""Youma"". 

img720(/revision/latest?cb=20140106021950)

They have no mercy... man, woman, elders, kids...they just cut them down without any care, eat them and take the forms of humans before starting their cruel killing and torture session again that culminates with eating other humans organs.

No human can stop them... but an unnamed organization offered their answer to the problem...the group of warriors called ""Silver Eyed Witches"" but that are commonly known between the normal inhabitants of the continent with the name ""Claymore "" for the swords that they carry with them.

These female mercenaries are the results of experiments with the objective to let absorb the flash and blood of a Youma into an human... and for this exact reason the Claymore warriors, even if they gave their body to the experiments and became weapons for the sake of humanity, are feared as ""Half-Youmas ""

Our story starts when in a little village in the south of the continent a Youma starts to torment it and to eat people each night. 
For this cause, the mayor decided to contact the Organization and doing so, it sent one of the nearest witches to the location....the Claymore named Clare.

img720(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20140430195629)

Here our heroine will met one of the 2 survivors of the first attack of the wild Youma in the village, the young boy Raki  that, drove by his curiosity and desperate desire of vengeance for his parents killed by the Youma, start to approach and talk to the half-demon hoping that she will avenge his parents instead of him.

img720()

Clare coldly answer to the hope of the boy with  a: 
""It's only a job. I don't care about your vengeance"".
But eventually and fortunately for our now broken Raki, Clare herself will be the woman that will save him from the fangs of the hidden Youma that planned to assault our boy that same night before heading out of the village... but the plans of the demon will be torn-apart by the simple fact that Claymore warriors as half-demons has the ability to feel the Yoki and the Yoryoku a.k.a the stored energy and the released aura that each Youma posses and controls...and so what I can say?
Bye bye to the small fry. The warrior will slash the Youma and she will leave in the direction of a new job.

img720()

But after the end of the job our poor Raki will have no more an home and a place to return and so he will start to wander in the middle of nowhere until one day, in a village near some woods, will met another demon and so a Claymore will again appear...that will be no other than Clare.

The boy after seeing again his heroine save him again, he will not esitate to ask if he could start to travel with her.
He has no home, no loved ones and has no idea to what to do about his life...and so he ends up offering himself to become Clare cook-companion for her journey with the objective to slice down monsters.

Clare past flashes in her mind in that moment... memories of a past where she was still a kid and that she walked along another woman...another warrior...another Claymore.

img720()

And so... the woman will allow the boy to accompany her in her journey.

A journey apparently empty, where she is going to struggle in every battle for still keeping her sanity...with only one objective for our mercenary. 
Cut down the head of the ""horned demon"" of that day of a cursed past... trying to still remain human.

After all... Claymore warriors are also Half-Youma. 
And the limit that separates Rage and Insanity...is made of thin walls of paper.

2) PLOT ANALYSIS
Okay... here we are boys and gals! 
This will be the SAUCE of this whole review and so I want to start kinda weirdly with a maybe stupid question... can we, humans, manage to keep our ""animal side"" inside the limit of our minds?

Well, obviously there are going to be lots of different thesis...but this no end research is a big theme inside this work.

Because I  think you can guess already what Claymore main content is...and so...yes.
Claymore is a tale about vengeance and  how to move on from it , other than having a really REALLY shonen-ish start and not a tale about ""yeah, let's killl all freaking demons/titans/monsters"" like now they use to do. 
The fury of our main heroine, Clare... is always against only one being. Not the world, not the whole demon-race. Just one.

And all the stereotypical training and ""kinda circular"" structure typical of shonens anime and manga is going to be done not because she has a big inspirational dream, want to save the world or noble reasons. Even with the help of our boy Raki... the main mindset will remain the same in in the beginning phase of the show and her deepest desire will always torment Clare in the middle and especially at the end of it.

She wants to see blood run down on her blade without a care and to survive so she can gain the power to cut down who torn apart away her ""sister"". And this mostly generic  formula is surprisingly good in the world of Claymore!

This is the tale of your typical little girl, but that suffered a lot and more then everyone her age should at the point to even fake madness to not be eaten.
And when she  finally find another being, independently if she was a monster or not, that loves her ...she see madness when the monster is taken away from her from... just from another girl but that unfortunately passed through the limit and couldn't turn back anymore.

So... now, you. Seasoned reader or not... you are probably thinking: 

Well my fellow otakus....""the answer is simple"".... it's HUMAN! This is an ""HUMAN AT SOUL "" tale... even when the rules of the story are ""even if you try your best, you are going to become a MONSTER""! 

In fact I bet that more experienced readers might already get it... but the limit I talked about before...It's the limit that an half-demon MUSTN'T AND NEVER go too near to.

Claymores....are not other than ""time bombs"" that could explode ANY TIME and not become just Youmas.
No no no no, you think they are going to become just weaklings??? AHAHAHAhahahah...
...
They are going to become ""Awakaned Beings"", monsters that could kill in a couple of minutes whole towns and slay low ranked Claymores. Mostly only the warriors in top 20 can hope to SURVIVE a battle against them and only the top 5 can do a 1vs1 against one of them.

And if we make a Claymore in the top 5 position an ""Awakened Being""...well we obtain not only the main interest of the HUMAN anger, despair and killing instincts of Clare, but also genocides, genocides, genocides... 
that are actually nothing  if compared to what one of the ""Abyssal Ones"", a.k.a ""Youma kings"" to semplificate the argument, can do.

img720(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20130327224716&path-prefix=it)

And so... this is what hurt the most and that can let you understand why Claymore is so human and sad. 
The fact that the Claymore warriors sacrifice everything they have...to just condemn themselves to become monsters sooner or later for their objective. 

This is no mere power up that you can control with training. This is A CURSE that YOU MUST TRAIN AND CONTAIN each freaking day because if you don't do it... your own sisters  that shared with you the pain of the battlefield are going to chop your head in an instant.

Hate like an human, become a monster for the humans, and hope to die while fighting inside for giving your last breath as an human. And if you become a monster...just hope to have forgotten everything because you are going to realize that you were only a pawn of someone that used you.

And so...i think that now you reader understand the first section under the disclaimer.

These were the mere words of a simple beginner reviewer and narrator... but I think that those were the most accurate words to say to this group of warriors that gave their whole beings to a bloody and desperate past. 

Faintly hoping that something like this will never happen to others... while knowing or not even knowing the fact they could possibly became the next authors of the bloodshed of innocents of a tomorrow.

Realizing it and doing the first step to salvation is the real objective of this show. And what it means...well I guess that only the manga readers knows it lol. UwU





Honestly I wanted to write here  a not really complex technical section with giving an opinion on animation and soundtrack before to closing the review....but I dumbly forgot one important thing in battle shonens and similar: Power Ups and how they are paced!

This aspect is a  crucial one  for the genre and so I need to talk absolutely about this...and how this show doesn't do absurd things with them even going mostly fast with this. And the reason why is for the rule that i told before about:
 More you are strong, more the power is ""heavy"" and more you are possibly near to doom. 

And I must confirm that, yes, power ups are  really simple in this anime and at the same time  freaking powerful ...but it's good like that because they are not actually power ups but like they say more than one time they are  ""techniques"" (except the last one in the last arc of the anime and the awakening powers from other ""Silver Eyed Witches"" like Deneve and Helen ). So it means that they are just basic mastery of one art without doing crazy stuff in most of the cases, thing that goes well with the medieval world where the work is set.

They need to train yes, but this are skills that can be  mastered only with years and years of fighting and slowly reaching the limit. And with years I mean years like decades. 

And actually this makes sense even  with the ""not aging factor"" of the warriors. Also, another thing that goes well is that the warriors for mastering a skill mostly needs just these 3 things:
-Sword Mastery
-Yoki perception
-Yoryoku control
And this 3 stuffs are in posses of basically every half-youma female warrior in the show in lesser or bigger quantity.

The only thing that I don't really liked is the way on how Yagi-sensei kinda cheated when Clare learned Irene technique...but I guess he could have made an huge error with the pacing of the story if he wouldn't made that choice, making it take an huge break that will have lead to a terrible slow down in our heroine development probably.

The pace of Claymore is pretty fast at the start and in the middle. Even when it takes a detour with the flashback arc of  the whereabouts about Clare past it's pretty interesting and not only for the important facts that happens but also because it felt really complete and not rushed from that moment on...until the last arc.

In fact I need to admit that the last arc it went really, REALLY slow and basically it was just only A LOT of fights episodes without many situations in much more depth, except the end climax, but MADHOUSE did a good job with adapting them and at least made them enjoyable and pretty good for that time.

I personally don't have really anything about to say on animations. Obviously they are not absurd stuff but for the technology and techniques of 13 years ago they are really something, even if not the best I've ever seen. I think that animations of studio BONES shows at that time were better than the animations of Claymore, but  these are fluid and not too impegnative for the eye...at least for me.

And finally...let's talk about the sound design...or I would desire to also talk about sound design but  my hears made me dive inside the show thanks to those sounds and that's everything I can say.

There are not crazy tracks (except the battle themes) inside here but they knew how to make the right atmosphere every time, even if there were not a big variety in the tracks.

They completed the story and the action really well and except some electric guitars in battle they were not too invasive. So REALLY GREAT JOB with sound MADHOUSE.

So...what can I say anymore?  We finally reached the end. 
But before to jump in the final thoughts section, some ost samples here:

The other was pertaining to its original source material. Leaving the thematic content aside, NieR: Automata is an oddity among hack-and-slash, as its elements are more than simply in the service of telling a story. They have a habit of encroaching themselves on the relation between the player and the game; the game’s menu itself becomes susceptible to manipulation and corruption and the UI tinkers with both space and gameplay, leaving things to unfold in ways that defy common video game convention. Since the whole was envisioned as a game first with this form of presentation inherent to the experience, any adaptation would need to wrestle with trying to transfer these qualities into television format, or revoke them altogether and buckle down purely on television presentation principles instead. Honestly, it’s an undertaking as vast as the environment’s scope and as thick as the plot. It has to find its own mettle and forge a justification to argue why it’s a worthwhile addition to the dystopic science-fiction universe.

As an entity, NieR: Automata Ver1.1a could best be thought of as a story that underwent its own character arc over the span of its twelve episodes, and in juxtaposing where it was to where it finished, I cannot help but be pleasantly surprised at the change that resulted. Watching the first episode felt like an insult, a carbon copy of the game both in image and dialogue. Whether it was directly lifting the iconography of the tutorial or using the original game’s soundtrack, it had no blood. Flying down an empty corridor is far more thrilling as a gamer trying to dodge pipes than as a passive observer watching. At the most cynical, it felt as though NieR: Automata Ver1.1a was doomed to be an adaptational zombie, simply executing the pre-programmed motions of the whole via autopilot and not having anything to call its own. This was to say nothing of the end of the episode, which took 2B’s famously existential soliloquy and had to transform it into something romance-laden to make it more relatable. Perhaps the series was inadvertently utilizing one of the central concepts of the story – the supposition of human culture to fill the lack of culture for machines. All you’d need to do is replace a couple of words in that last sentence and you’d be all set.

You have unlocked ending [A].



…though, perhaps I’m looking at this the wrong way, so let’s try another angle instead: this is a production that, in more ways than one, should not be what it is. Every sign at the start seemed to hint at an impending implosion, yet through small miracles, it patched itself and learned in an effort to achieve self-actualization. Because it could never understand or explore the totality of it all, it chose instead to be the most “thing” that it could in the time that it had, however imperfectly. In that vein, it might actually be the most-NieR thing of all. 

You have unlocked ending [B]."

I told myself when I watched it that I wouldn’t review Rebellion. It’s a dense, dark, intimidating thing from any critical perspective. Both a tweak and coda of the series that spawned it, a look into the minds of its creators, sure, but something that somehow feels bigger than any of that. This is a film that gets compared to End of Evangelion a lot for a reason; they don’t just fulfill similar roles in their respective franchises, they’re about as hard to come up with anything new to say about.

Yet, here’s a thought. What if I simply didn’t?

img880()



Call this a thought-knot. Observations and musings and stray ideas. Critique as poem or the other way around. Call it half-coherent rambling. Call it pretense, if you’re so inclined. Writing a core thesis about Rebellion is an impossibility, at least it is for yours truly.

Yet the form demands structure. Let us begin.

It feels pedestrian to talk about Rebellion’s plot. Parallels to Paradise Lost and its knotty worlds-within-worlds setup have been discussed to death. Thematically, trying to untangle the twine ball that is whatever the hell this film is trying to say feels like a lost cause. Many, many, many factors went into Rebellion’s writing, from the deliberate to the incidental, from the deeply profound to the shamelessly practicalist. Allegedly, the film’s big twist in its final act came about at least in part simply because there were aspirations to make another film after it, and well, you can’t rightly have something end in a happily ever after if you’re going to follow it up, can you?

To talk about Rebellion is to destroy it. This is what “deconstruction” used to mean, in another time. Or at least close to it, the man who coined the term was clear that it was “not an analysis or a technique”. Yet, here we are.

img880()
Here ever we are ever.



It has been about a week since I finished Rebellion. The day I saw it, I thought the film might be good except for its finale. The day after, I thought maybe the finale was one of the most genuinely shocking I’d ever seen. Today, I think the entire thing might be brilliant, but not the sort of auteur brilliance that is generally associated with the sort of admittedly “lowbrow” anime criticism I usually traffic in. There is something sort of wickedly sublime about Rebellion. The way its paper-shapes are arranged all wrong, the light that leaks from every source that emits it. 

It’s well documented that the film’s first third is a pastiche (some might say parody, others, less inclined to give Urobuchi and company the benefit of a doubt, may say skewering) of a magical warrior-style mahou shoujo series. The symbolism even in this part of the film has been analyzed front-to-back for most of the last decade. Even taken on a base level, it gives us some of the downright coolest henshin sequences the genre’s ever seen. A thought I certainly have about the film is that an entire series done in this style would be absolutely flooring. The currently-airing Magia Record is great in part because it occasionally is that.

img880()
Forever is a long time.



In part I think what Rebellion unintentionally reflects is the difficulty of grappling with Madoka Magica’s own legacy. The series itself has grown, witchlike, into a long and crooked shadow. Every magical girl anime after Madoka has that shadow cast upon it. I’ve made this point before, but it’s worth reiterating here because Rebellion in some ways feels like one of the first “post-Madoka” entries into the genre. Despite being a part of that same franchise in terms of characters and the like, it’s not unreasonable to read the entire film as a thesis on what you even do when you’ve made something like Madoka.

Rejecting it all and burning it to the ground is certainly one option. It’s the option many of Madoka’s absolute worst imitators have taken, but if we take what happens here to be that, it’s put to different ends. Spare a thought and a tear for the character of Homura, a personage so skewered by the tragic narrative she finds herself in that her self-destructive tendencies bring the whole universe down around her. Spare two prayers too for Madoka herself, probably the least interesting character in the main series, here, her character is given a subtle glow that actually does make her feel like the ur-mahou that the original series’ finale tried to paint her as. It’s a subtle, subtle difference, but it’s there.

img880()
Cure.



Of course, what even is a magical girl? 

That’s a shockingly tough question. People both far more and far less qualified than myself have weighed in, and there is no consensus. The history of the genre (beginning with Himetsu no Akko-chan, it’s generally agreed) is well-documented, but as for what a magical girl herself should be. What qualities she should have, what kind of femininity she should embody--if “she” even needs to be a girl at all--what abilities, what demographic is the work she’s in aimed at, all of this is the subject of ongoing, sometimes fierce, debate, in all forums of art discussion among people who care about anime as an artform. 

Rebellion feels like an earnest engagement with the genre--moreso I’d argue than its parent series--by virtue of offering no definitive single statement on the subject. 

img880()
”If an answer is given, offer no question. Let no one else define who you are.”



Madoka, the omnibenevolent goddess, is as much a magical girl as her counterpart Homura, the selfish devil. They act with the abilities they have to their own goals--diametrically opposed as they are. Certainly so are the other Puella Magi (this movie marks the first time the term is used in-universe). The mahou-ness is a hard quality to quantify, as hard to hold as water. Magical Girls are known when they are recognized. This is what sets Madoka Magica apart its least imitators; series that create no earnest engagement with the archetype, instead content to simply play dress-up.

What else is there to say?

Well, on a pure craft level, the film is basically untouchable. Gekidan Inu Curry and Akiyubi Shinbou are masters of their medium(s) and Rebellion is an arguable peak of all their powers. The film is bowl-you-over gorgeous.

img880()

img880()

img880()

Specific sequences need no mention beyond brief descriptors. There’s the gunfight. Sayaka summoning Oktavia. Homura breaking out of her prison. All of this a haunted choir.

One thing to be said in the concrete: Rebellion is a film whose reputation has changed over time. It will not, I think, ever truly settle. That long crooked shadow has only recently begun to be broken up by new lights. By series who have taken this film’s tone, one of the least ambiguous things about it, as something of a challenge. By series also, who seek to build on what it has accomplished. Art begets art. Influence begets influence. Madoka has a thousand and one daughters, [some of whom](https://anilist.co/review/5208) have daughters of their own. I call it like I see it, and I see brilliance.

Who, really, is dreaming?

20729,"If you have been watching anime, be it a few months or several years, you might be familiar with the Battle Shounen genre. Boasting the largest and most popular titles in modern anime/manga such as the Naruto, Bleach, Yu Yu Hakusho, My Hero Academia and so on, it goes without saying that their influence and presence over the medium is here to stay. At conventions, it is often the norm to see people break out into their favourite finishing moves, cosplay as their favourite characters, defend their favourite fights and moments vehemently. It is one of the foundations on which the modern industry is supported, serving as the channel of entry to new fans. I was also one such fan, starting my journey in the medium with Dragonball Z back in 2000, albeit lacking knowledge of anime at that point in time. And while my current attitude to the genre is cold to lukewarm at best, I won’t deny that it is close to my heart.

And why wouldn’t it be! Despite my changing taste, fights like Rock Lee vs Gaara, Kenshin vs Saito, Yusuke vs Toguro and so on, are moments that I revisit from time to time, indulging in a sense of nostalgia that only this genre offers. These characters and their struggles feal real enough, despite being in different worlds or time periods and I can’t help but egg them on as they strive to achieve their potential and personal goals. With all that said, the genre is not free from flaws. While it might be filled with great moments, the lead up to a lot of them, often tend to be underwhelming. Crumbling under the weight of bloated casts, which only keeps on increasing as the series goes on and resorting to cheap resolutions in the form of power of friendship or power creeps which render existing threats, toothless. It is a genre which has had no sense of direction and innovation since the late 90s (exceptions do exist as is always the case) and people who have known me long wouldn’t help but agree with my disdain for the genre due to the aforementioned reasons.

Enter World Trigger, the focus of our review today. World trigger is set in Mikado City, where an organisation named Border must protect the city and its inhabitants from visitors from another world, aptly called neighbours. These neighbours are here to kidnap the residents in order to fuel their own economies and society in the other world. It is up to Border and its employees to stop them and ensure life continues as normal. The story focuses on three main characters, as they fight and grow in the organisation and strive to achieve their goals. Stock standard battle Shounen as they come.

Where it differs from other BS is in terms of how it approaches the whole world vs characters dichotomy. While the characters are the main focus of the series, the world is an overwhelming presence and the cast must keep that in mind as they navigate around Border. The series maintains a level of mystery to it and we along with the cast are offered titbits of information at appropriate times, which enriches our knowledge of the world and its systems, without overwhelming us with aforementioned information. The cast and us, the viewers, then have to process this new information and adjust our understanding of the world. And in that, it is very reminiscent of how Oda, of One Piece fame, presents the world to us, the viewer/reader. 

World trigger also offers a rather grounded power system, unlike its other Battle Shounen counterparts. The power system is called trion and functions somewhat similar to other systems like Ki or Chakra, in that, there is a finite amount and it requires time to recharge it. Unlike the other two, the big differentiator here is not how large the trion reserves are, but rather how efficiently it is used to meet combat goals. And I say combat, because that is how the series approaches conflict. Not a lot of silly 1v1s centred around pride and showboating, but rather conflict with respect to principles of strategy, implemented through astute tactics. It is not out of the ordinary to see concepts like staggered columns, defeat in detail, supply chains, logistics, combined arms, etc rendered in a Shounen mold. Series like Naruto alluded to it, but World Trigger fully embraces it and I can’t help but admire it for that.

On the cast itself, the trio (Mikumo, Kuga and Chika) are like any upstarts trying to make it big in their world. Their motives are not as ambitious as leads of yesteryear Shounen series, but is still admirable. They are a likeable bunch and I can’t help but support them as they aim to achieve their goals. The series also boasts a large supporting cast, as is the case with a series focused on the world building side of things. I was pleasantly surprised in terms of how it managed to flesh out the supporting cast and make them damn likeable. They were individuals in their own right and were not presented only to be undermined by the lead trio. Reveals of the world also affects them and impacts their own personal equations and this is only bound to be richer as time goes on. The series is also not afraid to show what really is the top of the world, in terms of power. We, the viewers know what to expect from the lead trio once they reach the top. Just smacks of confidence from the creator and I can’t help but appreciate that. The character dynamics is great and love how the characters bounce off each other.

Honestly, I could go on for hours why I love the cast and world, but that would make this review too unwieldy. So, let’s move onto the shortcomings of season 1. While this was technically a rewatch, I won’t deny that the earlier episodes are somewhat of a challenge to get through for someone new to the series. The series takes a lot of time in setting up its world and characters and that might irk a lot of people. It also doesn’t do any favours that the art and animation is underwhelming. This series is an example of Toei at its absolute worst. Often spending 3-4 minutes in recaps of the previous episodes and having the opening at weird times, be prepared for a tough start. However, the good writing kicks in and would only make the ride even more enjoyable. The music is serviceable, without being tiring. Oh, and do skip 49-63, which were fillers. They don’t add anything to the story and does everything that the series isn’t about. 

With that said, I’m glad I got around to rewatch the series and derive so much enjoyment from it. Hope you, the readers of this review will get the same. And for people who have already seen s1, go on ahead to read my reviews of the subsequent seasons!

20652,"Durarara!! ended with a subtle, open-ended conclusion that left me craving more. The original series wrapped up in a way that hinted at further stories yet to be told, and my anticipation for a continuation was high when the second season was announced. However, I harbored some skepticism about whether it could maintain the same level of quality as its predecessor. From the moment I saw the opening sequence of Durarara!! x2 Shou, I knew this new chapter would be a satisfying return to the beloved show. Studio Shuka's transition from Brains Base was executed with finesse, making the shift almost imperceptible, though there were slight improvements in the animation quality. There were a few rough edges in some animation shots, but these were minor issues that did not significantly detract from the overall experience.

As a direct continuation of the first season, Durarara!! x2 Shou requires viewers to be familiar with the events of the prior season. It picks up right where the first season left off, making it essential to either have watched the first season or at least remember its ending. The storytelling in Durarara!! is known for its complexity and character-centric focus, which can make it challenging to dissect individual plotlines without seeing how they interconnect with the larger narrative. This season continues the trend of splitting the plot among various characters, making it difficult to fully grasp the importance of smaller stories until later episodes reveal their relevance. While this approach can make the season feel incomplete if viewed in isolation, it helps to break down the intricate narrative into more digestible segments.

The second season of Durarara!! introduces a broader range of characters and storylines, expanding the show's universe. Many of the new characters bring their own quirks and add an extra layer of enjoyment to the show. However, some new additions receive excessive focus and could have been better served with less screen time. Despite these minor missteps, the season excels at maintaining the show's hallmark themes of unraveling a complex web of plot and character interactions. The show remains engaging and fun, with a dynamic cast that keeps the narrative fresh and exciting.

In summary, Durarara!! x2 Shou is a welcome continuation of a series that not only needed a second season but truly deserved one. While it may not reach the dramatic heights of the first season, it offers plenty to explore and enjoy. The show continues to have fun with its characters and adeptly navigates its sprawling plot without losing sight of its core story. The second season reinforces the series' reputation for intricate storytelling and character depth, ensuring that fans of the original will find much to appreciate."
20849,"God Eater is based not off a manga or light novel, but a game of the same name. The animation studio is Ufotable which you should know are the same guys who did Fate/zero, and Kara no kyoukai. But unlike them this anime is done completely in CGI......and it looks BEAUTIFUL.


The story is the weakest part of this anime as its very similar to attack on titan.......the remnants of humanity living behind a wall, protected from creatures known as Argami who are impervious to all conventional weaponry and can only be killed using weapons known as God Arcs, the ones who wield these weapons are the God Eaters.
The story was initially a turn off for me and I was gonna drop it after watching 1 episode because it looked super generic and cheesy and a clone of AOT but luckily I ended up watching a couple more episodes and I got hooked. The story is not the main reason why though although it gets a lot better when they start explaining the origins of the aragami, the god arcs and the backstory of the characters.
But the one flaw that remains is the lack of much realism......our protagonists basically being superhuman when they fight, their weapons doing pretty impossible stuff and lenka surviving and fighting after sustaining what should have easily been fatal wounds
Story: 7/10


The first thing the main character says in the anime is ""I want to kill the aragami"" and I was like oh another Eren, But Utsugi Lenka is a much more cool and composed main character. He doesn't talk much, isn't very stupid or headstrong like other shounen heroes, and is more mature and likeable.
This goes for every other character too, none of them falls into any generic anime trope though you might have seen some of their traits before, they feel so much more real and fleshed out in this anime. Especially Lindow, Johannes and paylor. Alisa started off a really badass character but they turned her into a little bitch and that alone makes me angry.
Characters: 9/10

Like I said, the entire anime is CGI and its the best looking CGI I've ever seen. And being CGI, you can do these really cool tricks with the camera which lets you zoom and pan without the animation going to shit and they use it plenty in fights to really good effect and gives it that live action movie feel. Most of the time you'll see CGI faces end up falling in the uncanny valley but ufotable manges to pull it off somehow and the characters look really good. I saw some inconsistency here and there but its forgivable. A side effect of having such nice looking characters is that all the female characters are very much used as fanservice.But I can't take a point off of it for a reason like that. The level of detail in some scenes is also amazing...like this for example.
img220()
Animation: 10/10


I'm no expert on this but I really enjoyed the songs that were used here, they were mostly English and always complimented what was on the screen. It was both hype and emotional when it wanted to be. But this is topic most subject to opinions so I'll leave it at that. The opening is nice but a little forgettable.
Soundtrack: 8/10
 

Final opinions: Over the top fights, explosions, sexy female leads, shallow (but not bad) story, amazing visuals, the linkin park esque music......yes if Micheal Bay made an anime this would be it. I would watch it till episode 3 before deciding weather you continue or drop it because ep 3 is what blew me away. I would definitely say this anime deserves a better score than what MAL has given it."
21719,"That moment Shirou decided to use Archer's arm. That was where the non-stop action started. Connecting his present self to Archer in the future, he saw a mirage of Archer challenging him, ""Can you keep up with me?"", to which he refuted, ""No, can YOU keep up with me?"", followed up by the powered-up green Trace On coursing through all his magic circuits. 

Story: 9.5/10
I thoroughly enjoyed the pacing and the prose. While not nearly non-stop action as I'd have hoped, the slow paced moments were like the silence before the storm. It keeps you on your toes, and many a time I had expected Tohsaka to cower and die then and there - what a brave girl! - but she didn't. There were so many touching moments, such as the entire Shirou vs Heracles scene, where he traced all the way back to Illya's and his past; the trust between Shirou and Rider, leading to the combination of Rho Aias + Rider's Noble Phantasm, which I'll leave it up to you to discover, and Illya's reveal at the end. 

The ending did feel a bit rushed though, and slightly anti-climatic, but other than that it was perfect. 

Art: 10/10
No qualms here. I wish I could draw well enough to illustrate what I saw, so that everyone else can appreciate just how epic it was. I was blown away by how a simple exorcism(?) of Zouken could look so peaceful yet so cool. 

Sound: 10/10
Every bgm fit and nothing felt out of place. I particularly appreciated how the sfx illustrated how deadly each attack was, and yet act as a fitting backdrop for those scenes where a character expresses shock or sadness. 

Character: 10/10
Heaven's Feel is the arc where everyone reaches their max potential. We're given development for every character, including Kotomine Kirei. During the fist fight with Shirou, he revealed his true motives that he has been reiterating for ages. Not only did they mutually accept each other - something which Kiritsugu couldn't do in Zero - no dirty tricks were used, which was very unlike the Kirei we have been shown.

The same goes for Tohsaka. We're shown how she is unwavering, seemingly uncaring and knowing the right thing to do, as well as fully committing to it. But yet in the end, at the crucial moment, she couldn't. 

Similar for Shirou - he was willing to give up everything just to save Sakura. But yet, his wavered before he was about to conjure his final projection, instead choosing ""I want to live on"", 

Enjoyment: 9.5/10
It was a rollercoaster of emotions. What dies might not say dead, and people do not simply die when they are killed. No matter how dead they may look. The final master did his job thoroughly and skipped past the True End into the Good End. All's well that ends well, and we're even given the cameo of some characters from the Clock Tower. There were no plotholes, but maybe just a tad too much plot armour. 

Overall: 10/10
I'd recommend everyone to watch this movie. There was also a present at the live screening, which is related to the upcoming FGO movie - stay tuned for the trailer which should be released soon!"
112300,"If there’s any one anime, any one popular anime in particular, I could say is feasibly written by an AI scrolling the algorithm, it would be The Irregular at Magic High School. Why so?

Because the show does not have a spec of human emotion in it.

Ignorance is the word of the day here folks. It was fairly apparent in the first season of Mahouka, and somehow even moreso here. Every aspect in this season, from the narrative, to the soundtrack, to the characterization, to the tension, to the worldbuilding is divorced from what’s commonly viewed as respectable. It’s not quite as insultingly awful as Season 1, but it does repeat a lot of similar failures, and even amplifies other parts. It saddens me that out of every show in the mostly dead genre of magic high school power fantasies (except perhaps the Index franchise), THIS ONE was the breakout hit that came to spread holiday depression by amplifying all its worst traits.

To say this season has a “plot” would be massively overselling it. Things “happen”, but very little lasts to any degree. An American secret agent girl named Angelina Shields drops in to stop “vampires” from draining magic from faceless NPCs in a world we’re given no reason to care about. She uses a disguise, and the show tries to build intrigue of what’ll happen to her and her rivalry with Tatsuya and Miyuki. Which might’ve been something………….unless of course you watched the film, which came out three years before this season, immediately giving away what happens to her. Oops. Oh, and then the last two episodes try very badly to make some point about discrimination with the worst racism allegory since RWBY’s White Fang.

Many fundamental problems with the core premises of Mahouka return this season (except the magic system issues that’s just ignored), and they tend to affect the new elements when it wants to branch out a bit. The new element they want to highlight the most is Angelina. A top ranked American superspy with a secret identity, the show actually tries to give her feelings, and a goal she wants to accomplish, something seemingly foreign to Mahouka. But what’s the show’s reaction? Treat her like an absolute joke.

Most of the “comedy” revolves around her constant incompetence at her job, mostly the lazy chibi comedy that feels bafflingly out of place for how solemnly serious it wants to be. The show can’t go one episode without having Tatsuya, the All-Knowing Übermensch, snip out that she’s sus, yet the camera still focuses on her devious smirk. By Episode 4, she duels Miyuki, and is on the verge of handily losing, Miyuki portrayed like an imposing villain by the direction. Then, for the rest of the arc, Tatsuya and Miyuki effectively do her job for her, rather than giving her the chance to actually grow or change with any renewed confidence. A show with thought or effort put into it might’ve made her seem more like a competent rival, or at least have compelling payoff for running into Tatsuya and Miyuki, but no! Can’t let anyone get anything out of Tatsuya and Miyuki, the incesty power couple of modern anime. 
No one wins here. Fans of her character don’t get to see her actually prove her competence or get meaningful development, and fans of Tatsuya and Miyuki don’t have some sort of rival that can in any way enhance their growth. And it makes America look stupid for having someone like her headline their team.

Not that Tatsuya and Miyuki look any better. Oh, the show tries to FOOL you into thinking there’s character development, but it’s lies that mean nothing. Miyuki is still one of anime’s most poorly written characters, with no personality besides loving her brother and being jealous of anyone else who gets near him. This could work if she was an antagonistic figure that stretched her love for her brother through drastic actions they take against the world, but no, deuteragonist keeping the status quo. The show will claim there’s an arc of her losing attachment to her brother by having her monologue about it, which bears no fruit, and is partially demonstrated by the camera ogling her. After all, the chart says that fanservice sells, why not show more of the female and none of the character?! 

Mahouka: We're a super serious science conspiracy anime about secret agents, political drama and magic parasites!

Also Mahouka: Let's have two separate scenes of women undressing for the camera, once for goofy comedy and once for drama with no foundation or worth that's really just fanservice anyway. Also let's give a tagalong girl no personality whatsoever besides being another tsundere for Tatsuya with inexplicably magic hair beads. that's just perfect.

Aniplex: Perfect! Get it into production immediately!

The ignorance never ends.

Tatsuya smiles more, but he’s only slightly more tolerable than the previous season. In Episode 5, there’s a plot involving a rogue parasite that the show tries to act like has tension, but the cast has the answer to every hitch there could be. Tatsuya admits he could've solved the problem for good, but didn't, thus prolonging the runtime. Genius. Another episode tries to act like he missed some detail about Angelina, but he gets the info he wants almost instantaneously just by phoning a few people. It’s lip service to the idea of conflict. The obvious worship continues; a parasite powering a robot by someone’s love for him clings to him like they’re trapped in a spiderweb, Miyuki and Tatsuya feeding off everything else; ironically for a plot about stopping possessive parasites, that’s exactly what the leads are, the algorithm too ignorant to admit it. Less than two minutes after losing his arm to a power blast, he instantly gets it back. We can’t have TWO MINUTES of tension in this show. And don’t worry about the vampire plot; it’s solved instantaneously when the utterly unmemorable leader shows his face and could quickly be put on hold for a Valentines’ Day episode, which is the only time the show has a pulse of life in it. 

As if the cherry on this shit cake wasn’t done yet, you get the last two episodes. Radical magicians forming in response to discriminatory boycotts from the ordinary humans who claim (race) superiority enact terrorist attacks against magician slavery……something never ahown and of no value since all the main characters are magicians reaping the benefits of the system's high class. Of course, none of these terrorists have any actual point that causes the main characters to question anything, or have the charisma of say, the villains in Die Hard. This would be like if The Hunger Games was from the perspective of the capitalists on top….....…………............................................do I even need to say what’s wrong with that?

Everything else? Well, Erika’s the only returning side character allowed to have half a personality but it doesn’t matter any, and no one else even gets that much. The animation is decent; nothing exceptional with no memorable action, but it fixed the first season’s color grading issue, and the soundtrack is poorly mixed. Most of it is unmemorable dubstep techno, but Episode 9 tries to have a rap go along with it that’s super drowned out by the dialogue and action sfx. There’s so little to attach yourself to in this series.

Mahouka confuses me, it really really does. I’ve seen bad anime aplenty that set clear goals for themselves and fail at them, but I’ve hardly seen an anime be so antithetical to everything about basic storytelling. Even series like SAO can pass off as fantasy adventure stories with kernels of depth and the occasional bit of earned emotion burdened by some icky scenes. Mahouka can’t even do THAT. It’s a bevy of mismanaged priorities and “things people like” stuck in a perpetually constant status quo with protagonists that have such a foothold over everything else that they’d be great villains in another work. I try to imagine the visions of the creators and there’s nothing here. A super serious science anime with botched attempts at political drama, that’s also stuck with incest pandering, fanservice, and childish comedy. It wants to be everything at once but throughout the 4 and a half hours, accomplishes nothing. Appeal exists in media, even bad media, but Mahouka stands as a narratively backwards empty shell only notable by its ineptitude."
9656,"I have now completed the second season of Kimi ni Todoke: Reaching You, and I can confidently say that the second season is just as amazing as the first!.

The second season begins immediately almost after the ending of the first season, and overall brings the series to a satisfying close while utilizing everything that made the first season great. First, let me get the bad out of the way. I've seen a lot of romance anime. In almost every drama/romance there is almost always the third wheel in the love triangle, who the writers intentionally make you hate, or if it's a good show, relate to. In Kimi ni Todoke season 2 this character is Kento Miura. While this was trope was present in the first season with Kurumi, it was vastly different. Kurumi was relatable to most people in the audience who had ever had longstanding crushes that they could never make a move on. Kento gets introduced in the first episode and by !episode 5 he's already confessed to Kuronuma!. This all just moves way too quickly for the viewer to even understand who Kento is besides just this random guy who is there to progress the plot and for the viewers to hate. And believe me, I do hate him. 

This season turns the shoujo - slice of life into a complete shoujo drama. While there are the occasional bits of comedic relief towards the beginning of the season, in the latter half of the season, it is all feels and drama with hardly any time for anything else. I am very happy with how they paced the relationship between Kuronuma and Kazehaya in this season though! I think that it had one of the most moving and heartfelt confessions I have ever seen in an anime and changed everything about the confession scene that Toradora! should have. Before I knew it, I found my self realizing just how much I had grown to like the characters, from the main two (Kazehaya and Kuronuma) to the side relationship (Ryu and Chizu), to even Kuronuma's parents! Overall, if you are reading this you have probably seen the first season and you should definitely watch this one as well, as it is the best possible way that the writers could have ended this story (I know the manga goes on further, but the way the anime ends is satisfying in its own right). I give this an 85/100, because while it is an amazing finale, that's all it really serves to be. A finale. When placed as a standalone, this anime may fall apart but the connections between all the characters that finally unravel and intertwine make this as great of a sequel as it is.

-10 points for non-fleshed out Third wheel trope
-5 points because some parts seem unnecessarily dragged out just to make sure the two don't kiss or get together too early"
150075,"You know that extremely annoying character from KonoSuba? The one that is annoying all the time and that I hate with all my heart? The one who ruins every scene that character is in because of every stupid thing that character says? Yeah, that character is Kazuma, thank God he isn't here. But sadly, that is one of the only good things I can give credit to this series, because this series lacks basically everything that made KonoSuba endearing.

This series is a spin-off about Megumin and how she was before she was part of Kazuma's group. There is a little problem with this, and that is that Megumin's personality in the main series is entirely based on ""explosion"" and that's pretty much it, in this series it is even worse, as half of the series is focusing on her trying to get levels to cast explosion magic. You see, this is a problem in general, because KonoSuba characters aren't actually fully fledged characters, Megumin isn't actually a character on her own, she is part of a set of characters that when they aren't together they come out as pretty boring and feel empty. The banter between Kazuma's group is what made this series oh-so-funny and endearing, the characters in this series are completely uninteresting as the only characters who we actually care are Megumin and Yunyun, and as I said, they are an incomplete part of a set when going alone.

Take for example the first couple of episodes of this series, when they are in the school, there are these characters that are copies of Megumin look-wise but with big to huge breasts, but it is impossible to recognize who is who unless you memorize their breast size, I honestly remember them that way, however, they are no part of the set created to fit for Megumin, so they fall flat in interactions with her, the jokes don't land because these characters are uninteresting. Which leads me to say that Megumin doesn't fit in a leading role, I know I said just above that Kazuma is someone I dislike a lot, however, he works as a main since he is the person who keeps on check the other characters while doing his own banter, he does in fact have some personality and while paired with the other girls it makes it work, even if just makes the series work as a meme more than as a story, meanwhile, Megumin has Yunyun to be her ""straight man"", and she just doesn't work for that role. We also have what is basically a repeat of stuff that happens in the main series, the episodes in Arcanletia with Axis Order are basically the same as the ones that were in the second season, doesn't matter if these happened chronologically before.

Thankfully, despite the studio change the series looks pretty much the same, so you can feel better if you were worried about it looking different. All in all, unless you are a big fan of Megumin, who I am not, then this spin-off is basically something completely uninteresting, so if you like the series just wait for the third season.

Thank you for reading."
159322,"Bleach TYBW came back onto the weekly scene with a bang in Fall 2022, and you might've thought ""It can't get TOO much better from here right?"". And I thought the same thing, we would have been in the same boat. But this cour took my expectations and threw them out the window (In a good way if you couldn't tell)

Starting off with the thing that is arguably the most important part of the series considering it's a battle shounen, the fights. The fights this cour were EASILY better than the fights last cour in my opinion. Cour 1 I think was more of a set up season, it mainly focused on Ichigo coming to terms with himself and his background, finding his true strength, and setting up the stakes and danger that the Quincies posed. If we focus on the more psychological aspects of the show then Cour 1 does take the win there, however I think it also lacked in fights, the only notable ones being Yamamoto vs ""Yhwach"", Ichigo and Yhwach's short spar, and Zaraki vs Unohana. This season however, we were treated to spectacular fights all around. From Toshiro and Rangiku vs Bazz-B, to Komamura vs Bambi, I don't think I have a major complaint about any of the fights. Even Soi Fon and Marechiyo had a moment where I rooted for them, and they're both some of my least favourite characters in the whole show. Episodes 4-7 were, I think, perfect battle episodes with great choreography, interesting powers and deserving power ups which showed the result of training or sacrifice wonderfully. Also this is the first cannon season where RENJI ACTUALLY WON A FIGHT AGAINST AN OPPONENT OF SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH. I nearly shed tears of joy when he came out on top against Mask, he has come so far. For this one feat alone, cour 2 has to get serious serious props from me

Oh my days. When I say this has been one of the most visually appealing seasons of anime I have ever seen, I am not joking. Every moment has been carefully sculpted, drawn with love and care for us fans to enjoy. Studio Pierrot was really in their bag with this one, and because of that this story that Kubo created and had a vision for has been enhanced to the max. Best example of this has to be Rukia's bankai. Pierrot could have just given her white hair, a white garment and blue eyes and called it a day but nah, they said it's all or nothing

LIKE YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS DOESN'T LOOK BEAUTIFUL

Obviously it is a lot better than the original season, but I also think it is a slight improvement from cour 1 too, at least during the peaks anyway. Expressions in this cour were also top tier, I'm mainly talking about Ichibei during episode 13 tbh his facial expressions and emotions were so fluid.

This cour brought us a lot of new abilities and a lot of development from old abilitites, and pretty much all of them were extremely cool. Renji, Rukia, Shinji, Rose all showing off their Bankais, Ichigo's true shikai and Getsuga Jujishou (Crazy how he was fighting a 5v1 with only his shikai and still had to hold back to avoid killing them), the Sternritter Schrifts and Squad Zero's general fighting proficiency, since they don't really use the full extent of their zanpakutos. Had to give a special mention to Squad Zero, specifically Oh-Etsu, Senjumaru and Ichibei. All three of them were wonderful and their abilites genuinely had me on the edge of my seat seeing how they would act next. Senjumaru's Bankai might be the most powerful one we have seen so far aside from Yamamoto's, I can't to see it fully explained next season. I really can't believe that the last two episodes of this season shifted entire power scaling tier lists because Squad Zero and the Royal Guards are just those guys.

Consistently great, has been since the original series and will be forever. Special mention to ""Everything I Lost"" (Shinji's Bankai theme), might be my new favourite track in the whole OST and if not it is up there for sure. One thing I think they disappointed on was the music for Ichigo's return, ngl the new remix of Number One they used was ass, they should have kept the Bankai remix instead.  

With every amazing show, there must be some flaws too. My main one is that in the fights, the loser will lose purely because the plot demands it or becuase they were stupid asf during their fight. I don't think you understand how annoyed I was by Rose, like the Vizards are disrespected as is by Kubo as is but during his fight the anti-plot armor was BADD. Rose really did not need to explain his Bankai to Mask, and if he wanted to he should have waited until he had confirm killed him. But instead Rose gave a step by step breakdown on how his shit works, and he got hard countered and one shot for his tomfoolery. Kensei at least put up a decent fight even after his explanation but again the Vizards are done so dirty, throughout the whole show tbh. Shinji as well, he got a whole anime exclusive scene to show off his banned bankai, only to get countered after he tries chatting to Bambi and one shot very swiftly. 

Is it bad of me to say the last two episodes kinda let the show down a bit... Squad Zero being stronger than the whole of the Gotei Thirteen was absolutely fire, but the prerequisite being that three of them have to die before the last remaining one can access that power is a bit cheap imo. It feels a bit like wasted potential, but at least it was Senjumaru that tapped into her full power. Ngl Kirio and Tenjiro are filler members in my eyes, they exist purely for support. This season's cliffhanger was quite pointless, especially since the final couple of minutes which they could have used for the fight or more lore was taken up by KON. Like I do not care for him, he had his time in the original series but now is not the place. Giselle is also mad creepy I'm tired of seeing her I mean him. Finally, I feel this season set us up to get a lot more from it that we just didn't get, like I thought Adult Toshiro and Ichigo vs Uryu would be this cour coz they appeared in the trailers, but thats a personal thing tbh.

Overall, I love Bleach. I have had so much fun watching this season weekly and speculating about characters and lore every week as we get more immersed into the story and this whole war. I really cannot wait for Cour 3 and everything it will bring to continue the story. I already know its gonna be HEAT"
5630,"Takizawa Akira finds himself in front of the White House, naked and with nothing on him except for a gun and a cellphone loaded with a lot of money. Worst of all, he doesn’t remember who he is or what he is doing there. He witnesses a girl being in trouble, and this is how Akira and Saki meet. Akira wants to find out why he has no memories and who he really is.

What would you do, if you do not remember who you are, where you are from and what happened before then?

We, as the viewers, only get the information at the same time as the characters do, which makes it easier to identify with the characters. I was really thinking along with Akira of why he erased his memory or what the purpose of those special cellphones was. The story is unpredictable, and yet flows very nicely at a steady pace. It’s actually a pity that this anime only has 11 episodes, as they could easily have made the plot more elaborate and thus made the anime longer if they had wanted to. I admire them, though, for being able to present such a complicated and ingenious story in an anime of merely 11 episodes.

Higashi no Eden had just the right amount of characters: not too many to make you lose count, but not too few to make it boring. The male main character, Akira, is extremely interesting: you can never predict his actions or what he is going to say. This makes him so very enjoyabe. 

There were quite a lot of insert songs, and all of these fit the theme of the anime. I also liked the fact that they used a song by Oasis as the opening theme, instead of choosing a Japanese pop song. The instrumental background music complemented the anime nicely. Before a major event was going to take place, you could already feel the tension building up through the music that was used. The voice actors and actresses were wonderful, especially the seiyuus of the two main characters.

What a great anime. Even if it had a small amount of episodes, it still left a deep impression on me, and I won’t forget about this anime for a very long time to come. Higashi no Eden did everything right: interesting and well-paced story, fascinating characters, beautiful art and great voice actors. Each episode felt as if it was over in the blink of an eye, which resulted in me watching one episode after another. Really, what more do we, the viewers, need from an anime? Don’t hesitate to give Higashi no Eden a chance, I’m sure you won’t regret it. 

This review does not take into account the two films that came out after the anime, so it is important to see if you want to continue with the story."
2593,"For my first review on AniList, I will be reviewing the first Kara no Kyoukai (The Garden of Sinners, also known as Rakkyo in Japan) film. Kara no Kyoukai is a movie series based on the webnovels by Nasu Kinoko of Fate/stay night (and all of its innumerable spinoffs and AU stories) and Tsukihime fame. After five chapters were published on the dōjin-based website owned by him and long-time collaborative partner Takashi Takeuchi, Takebōki , the final two were ultimately sold at Comiket 56 in August 1999. Although this would not be the last time that the novels were published as dōjinshi (the duo would do so again by featuring a portion of the novel on the TSUKIHIME FAN-DISC and at Comiket 61 in December 2001), it wasn't until August 2004 that Kodansha picked up the novels for commercial publication. 

KnK is widely considered by TypeMoon fans to be Nasu and Takeuchi's earliest published work despite it having mostly being written prior to TypeMoon establishing itself as a corporation around the time Fate/stay night was released in January 2004. It is officially the first series to be considered part of the fan-coined ""Nasuverse"" meta-franchise, which includes all of the works penned and commissioned by Nasu such as Fate and Tsukihime (although he has stated that Kara no Kyoukai takes place in an alternate universe but that's neither here nor there). 

After the success of the novels, in 2007 Ufotable began releasing the film adaptations with this film,  Overlooking View. The structure of the narrative intertwining these films is in anachronical order, which is polarizing to even the most seasoned anime fans, as well as those for TypeMoon and movies in general. 

I very much enjoy the films for this that I have seen and don't have an issue with the structure myself, so I ultimately decided to rewatch the first two before writing this review (and also because I was in the mood given the return of the collaboration event in Fate/Grand Order going on now).

Overlooking View is an odd film. Clocking in at only 50 minutes, it wastes no time in throwing the viewer into the world of protagonist Ryougi Shiki who fights ghosts and other supernatural entities while investigating the paranormal for a mysterious detective agency led by Aozaki Touko (all while struggling with an identity crisis involving her split personality disorder, though she doesn't seem to do much of that in this film). Since Overlooking View  takes place before the events of the fifth film, Paradox Paradigm, many things about it will not make sense (including the nature of her abilities and condition) until the viewer has seen several more of the films.

It took a few viewings for this film to ultimately click with me, but there's a lot to like about this movie. It's a very tense piece heavily reflecting the Lost Decade when Nasu initially wrote the webnovel that can't only be watched once, and has stellar direction by Aoki Ei who is excellent at building an atmosphere when it ultimately counts. 

Ufotable's composite and art direction is simple and favors orange and green-blue palettes. But its all very effective at conveying the desolate vibe and the decaying architecture of city Shiki lives and works in, and the solitude she faces when her partner Kokutou Mikiya is not present due to being in a comatose state. 

Kajiura Yuki's score completes the set ofc, striking the perfect mood. Were it not for all of the obtuse philosophical musing and the events in this timeline being out of sequence, this would be a somewhat easygoing yet no less engrossing film to watch. 

The ultimate adversary of this film, suspected to be the cause of the schoolgirl suicides Shiki is investigating, is Kirie Fujō. As a terminally ill bed-ridden patient with the powers of astral projection and possession (heavily resembling the Ikiryo, a Japanese ""living ghost), she expresses extreme loneliness which prompts her to possess the schoolgirls who died and put Mikiya in a coma due to her infatuation with him. After Shiki fights and ultimately kills their ghosts and Kirie's astral projection while confessing her crimes to Touko, Kirie commits suicide by falling from the building she haunted. 

When I initially watched this film the first two times, I kind of felt like her case wasn't ultimately solved in spite of her explanation and her passing on. Now on my third viewing, I see that it actually was, although I still have questions regarding her backstory (keep in mind that I have only seen the first five films). 

All in all, despite its inextricable connections to continuity and an occasionally verbose screenplay by Hiramatsu Masaki that for the most part only bogs down the pacing in a few moments, Overlooking View is a solid first film for this series. However, don't expect to have context for much of what is shown here before having seen the other films. 

I still believe that the mysteries Nasu provides us with are engaging and well thought out enough for people to stick with the series to in order to get more answers, but that may not be the case for everyone. Still, hopefully the tone and atmosphere of this film is enough to satisfy viewers, as the following films do not let up on what made this one work in the slightest.

However, I do find the next film, Murder Speculation Part 1, to be a far stronger film overall. It also serves as a better introduction to the series based on it taking place 3 years before Overlooking View, although some mysteries around Shiki's condition still yet remain. 

I will be reviewing that one later though, so if you liked this review, look forward to my next one!"

SPECIAL WARNING: This review contains extensive spoilers for the reviewed material, and assumes familiarity with it and the remainder of the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise.



 In a very real sense, this is the end of something. Neon Genesis Evangelion has existed as a series since 1995. Long before it became a ""franchise"" as such, there were those original episodes and the films that followed them, most famously End of Evangelion. The Rebuild movies, always controversial, serve as a way to rewrite and redefine Evangelion, which has remained true through the rocky first, the astonishing second, and the burned-black, emotionally deadened third entries in the series. That Thrice Upon a Time, the fourth and final, will spawn mountains upon mountains of discourse is only natural. This is Eva. One can talk forever about its influences and its impact, but there is nothing else that is truly like it. Twenty-six years of history come to a stop here. Welcome to the end of an era.

Let’s start not at the beginning, but at the end.

After the harrowing of the soul that was You Can (Not) Redo, Thrice Upon a Time concludes as the only iteration of the Evangelion series to receive a wholly unambiguous happy ending. There is no room for confusion here. Shinji Ikari is all grown up, and accordingly, this movie will make you weep like a proud parent on graduation day. For a certain kind of Eva fan, this is a claim to be met with skepticism. Eva derives no small part of its immense reputation from being a truly withering under-the-microscope look at depression. But it’s important to clarify our terms here: Thrice Upon a Time does not rob Eva of that accolade, it reinforces it. After twenty-six years of spiraling, Thrice assures even those of us in the darkest pits of misery that yes, there is a way out of this. As a kind of anti-End of Evangelion, it is an open window disguised as a trap door.

img880()

Which is to say, having a happy ending and being a happy movie are two different things. Getting to that ending is quite the ride, a fact only enhanced by Thrice‘s incredible length, clocking in at two and a half hours. Improbably, it earns every second, but one could be forgiven for wondering.

After some action-focused eye candy to start things off with a bang, and which mostly stars Mari, the film refocuses on its protagonist. We open with Shinji in near-catatonic burnout. He is entirely non-verbal for the first forty minutes of the film, and the first words anyone says to him are an accusation that he is a spineless loser. When, at one point, he gets a look at Asuka’s collar, has a PTSD flashback, and vomits on the spot. This, just so you know, is what we’re dealing with here. That he manages to, in the course of only the film’s remaining 110 minutes, go from there to where he is by its finale is nothing short of astonishing. If Thrice Upon a Time did not have two and half decades of cachet to lean on here, it probably wouldn’t work.

Over the course of Thrice Upon a Time, we see Shinji make sustained and–this is key here–permanent character growth for, arguably, the first time ever. His character actually changing in a sustained way, the way one’s character is supposed to change as they grow up, rather than simply shifting. Where You Can (Not) Redo seemed to bitterly mock the very idea of ever growing as a person at all, Thrice demonstrates that it’s possible with nothing more than some genuine care. Village 3, the town of survivors that Shinji, Asuka, and one of Rei’s clones are based in for the first third or so of the film, is a place where people are forced by the aftermath of the near-Third Impact disaster to work together.

img880()

It is in this environment, shepherded by two of his old friends; the now-adult Kensuke and Touji, that Shinji is finally able to make real, positive changes to himself. Village 3 shows Shinji what he does not have. His friends have become adults, started families, and, in the way that their circumstances dictate, become healthy and productive people. Shinji has none of that, and although he never says as much out loud it’s clear even early on in the film that he’s keenly aware of it.

img880()

But he’s not alone, here. Asuka stands at a distance from Village 3–as she always has from everyone–and the Clone Rei, naïve as a newborn, rapidly integrates into it, only for her to die near the film’s one-third mark. This could easily send Shinji spiraling, but the fact that she appears to die happy seems to spark something inside him, which Kensuke in particular helps nurture, and this becomes the catalyst for his growth.

img880()

It’s tempting to map out his entire emotional journey here, but a fair amount of it feels so natural that doing so could be an article unto itself. If we skip ahead to near the film’s climax where Shinji is suddenly not only able to face Gendo but do so unafraid, you could be forgiven for thinking a natural transition impossible. Yet, it simply does, there is no explanation for it beyond the built-up credibility of Shinji’s long history as a character. They make sense because he’s Shinji.

Further in, the middle stretch or so of the film is a clash of dazzling surrealities. Massive battleships slug it out in conceptual spaces, nonce terms like The Key of Nebuchadnezzar, The Golgotha Object, and The Anti-Universe gain biblical significance fitting their names.

img880()

It’s all wonderful, and all Extremely Anime, in the genericized sense of the term that commentators like myself tend to avoid using. Explosions, giant robots and monsters, incomprehensibly vast scales of combat, and of course the plethora of proper nouns. Asuka pulls a plot-significant item out of her eye at one point, you get the idea. Rarely is this done as well as it’s done here. Somehow all of the disparate parts make perfect sense, and one would not be wrong to invoke one of Eva’s own successors in the feeling of how. There really is a bit of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann in it.

img880()

img880()

img880()

But, yes, the key thing. Shinji fights Gendo. He fights Gendo bravely and while wholly accepting himself, and this lets him question his father in a meaningful way for the first time. As the two’s bout turns from physical to conversational, Gendo reveals what we’ve all known all along. He is, beneath his monstrous acts, beneath his abuse, beneath the mad scientist and would-be godslayer, a deeply lonely man willing to go to inhumanly great lengths to see his late wife again. The most evil men tend to be simple, and Gendo is no exception. Shinji defeating Gendo is an entire generation conquering shared trauma. The sort of solidarity that is direly needed in an era as grim as ours, and the sort that means even more coming from Evangelion than it might almost any other series.

It’s prudent to take an aside here to say that the film is of course not perfect. There are faults to be found, but they’re minor and mostly on the production side. Studio Khara’s CGI-heavy, live action film-influenced visual style has always been divisive, and it will never be moreso than it is here, putting the capstone on what is far and away their most well-known series. For my money, I’d say it works in some contexts better than others. Truly disturbing and otherworldly imagery, like Asuka’s loss against Unit 13, or a bizarrely photorealistic, haunting echo of End of Evangelion‘s “floating Rei” are excellent.

img880()

img880()

In other places, especially in certain battle scenes, one can’t escape the feeling that there’s a grandiosity that these fights should have that they don’t always quite pull off. Mostly in the form of the sheer scale of the actors involved–especially the battleships–not always coming through. Still, these criticisms are easily offset by the other, aforementioned visual merits.

On a slightly more substantial level, one could argue that limiting the film’s perspective to mostly Shinji limits its impact. The death of the Clone Rei relatively early on being the example I suspect many will glom onto. But I think this is the wrong tack to take. Shinji, despite everything, has been all of us. Which is not to say he is all of us. Some folks, even some who love Evangelion dearly, have left that particularly dark phase of our mental illnesses long behind us. But we have all been “back there”, where every room is suffocating, and any activity is a distraction from our mind’s attempt to eat itself. And the fear of going “back there”, of possibly hurting yourself or worse, hurting others, is very real. Which is the exact thing that makes it so cathartic when, pushing back against twenty-six years of history, his own initial characterization, and the countless reductionist depictions of the character as a spineless wimp, Shinji wins. The Son, finally understanding his Father, vanquishes him without further struggle.

img880()

The new world he creates, as he is made able to do, is not some perfect paradise. It is a world not unlike ours, though I suspect, perhaps, a little brighter. Of course any distance between the two is a mere illusion. After such a long time clawing at one’s own soul, any daylight is welcome.

If the film’s climax seems to leave some questions unanswered, they simply don’t feel relevant. It’s Mari who pulls Shinji from his rapidly-fading sketch world into the new universe he’s created. The ending scene depicts Shinji, now an adult, living a truly, peacefully, ordinary life.

img880()

And so, the Sun shines on a world without Evangelions, and, for us, without Evangelion.

I am reminded by Thrice’s finale not so much of any other piece of Eva media, or indeed any of Gainax’s other marquee properties. Instead, my mind turns to the finale of the largely-overlooked Wish Upon The Pleiades. In that series’ finale, which marked the end of Studio Gainax’s time as a going concern as a producer of TV anime, no words are wasted on complicated, overwrought goodbyes. Instead, as here, it’s simply on to the next. The next universe, the next adventure, the next dawn, or, if you prefer, the neon genesis.

img880()

The final remarkable thing about Thrice Upon a Time is that it puts Neon Genesis Evangelion on the whole in the past, and at the same time, immortalizes it for the future. The end of an era, but the beginning of a new day. It is over, but it will be with us forever.

The manga of Record of Ragnarok was one of the first Manga I've ever read. Although it was very short and the read lasted a couple of hours only, I was completely mesmerized by it. The art is insanely addicting and beautiful. The dialogues pack a punch and leave an impact on you. Some of the character designs are weird ( compared to their mythological counterparts) but fit the Manga Perfectly. Keeps you at the edge of your seat when reading it and leaves you wanting more. That was how the Manga left me feeling.

Note: I've only watched 3 episodes in full, and speed-watched the rest, and haven't added them to the list since I don't consider speed-watching actual watching.

The anime doesn't come close to the manga. The character designs were butchered, and do not portray the characters perfectly. The anime doesn't compare the many expressions that Brunhilde makes. 
img600(
The anime has bland faces. The Voice actor does a great character depicting Brunhilde's emotions, but that effort is wasted over expressionless faces. 

The anime also butchered the character designs. You just say Brunhilde above, and now you can see Brunhilde literally looking more like Baki than any Baki character.
img420(

Other than that, take a look at other fan-favourite characters. 
img370()
Poseidon (bottom left) used to be one of the best-looking characters in Record of Ragnarok. But they messed his design with a longer than usual nose which feels out of place, and Rigid hair, which is nowhere as good as the flowy hair he had. 

Similar issues with Adam (middle right). Too long of a nose and a chin which makes him look like a different character. His hair looks way too rigid, instead of the flowy hair feminine Adam, that we had in the Manga.

Yeah, I agree that anime cant do the exact same designs as the manga but this is just a mess at this point.

Let's talk about Sasaki Kojiro ( bottom right). His nose is longer than what the manga had which already makes him look off. Similar issues with the hair, but it's less noticeable in Sasaki. One HUGE, by huge I mean Really Huge thing they changed in the anime was his facial expressions. Sasaki in the anime always had an innocent smile, which depicted his beauty. While in the anime, he looks like one of the evil characters who lust for blood. One reason for this is the eyelashes and the forced smile that he has in the anime. The smile in the Manga Looks much more natural and just feels right.

Thor and Lu Bu had issues as well. They were just too rigid in the anime and their expressions were restricted to their faces. They didn't capture the essence of the manga quite right in this fight. 

Zeus( middle left) is another thing they messed up huge. We still see the rigid hair, like in every character.  Other than that,  they didn't quite capture Zeus' comedic design. They changed his face structure which made him seem more 'normal' which he is everything other than. They just couldn't get him right. |

 

Pacing issues

 RoR is already pretty short, with barely 50 chapters as I'm writing this. And the chapters aren't extremely long, average around 50-60 pages. There isn't much dialogue between characters, but rather a lot of narration. The anime overuse reactions from the crowd and the gods, and only covers 3 fights (around 19 chapters) in 12 episodes. They use a lot of unnecessary reactions, especially from characters who weren't even of much importance in the Manga. Like aphrodite (who was only shown like 3 times at maximum in the Manga)
img450()
Well, it's pretty clear why they use her too much in the anime. Simply, FANSERVICE.

Animation issues

On one look, it isn't too bad. This arc lasted 5 minutes, although it was only a few pages in the Manga. And this whole 5 minutes was a literal slideshow with a compilation of colored pictures (they aren't even colored, just brown) and whenever there is an animation, I'm being honest to god right now, It never crossed the 4 frames per second mark, I could literally look at every single frame those 5 minutes.

This one too, ^^ please watch these gifs. 

They just look choppy, rough, unnatural, and in short, bad.

Other issues are the whole anime being a CGI fest (I have nothing against CGI, except when it looks dogshit)
Every moment they could use CGI, they did. 
img350(
More issues are how th(e subs for the anime were 'censored' When I say censored, I mean like something as Vulgar as this above, was subbed as ""This is the perfect moment to smash their smug faces in as they scoff at humans"". This isn't the only scene, there are countless remarks that got censored like this. Completely lost the impact. It's basically like 4kids censoring. Well, that's to be expected from a Netflix Exclusive. 

 
Overall, a completely dissatisfied watch. It was honestly shit. Couldn't compare to the Manga. Pains to see the first Manga that I've read get ruined like this. Hope it doesn't happen to your favorite manga. In the end, a shit adaptation that shouldn't even exist. A bad studio that shouldn't make anime."
155907,"-This review will contain plenty of spoilers, so either go to the last part for the TLDR, or if you just want a quick opinion, then mine is that this show is worth a watch. Agree to disagree but for me, this show is better than Spy x Family. Hell, if you did enjoy Spy x Family, you more than likely will enjoy this one.

-I shit on Spy x Family so much that you may even think this is a review for it. I can't apologize , so just a heads up. I am going to be comparing them a lot.

-When watching this show you may have to apply suspension of disbelief towards some of the stuff that happens like: avoiding bullets with a tray, or dodging a shit ton of bullets coming from both front and back, all while running and carrying both a toddler and a grown ass man.

If someone asks you what the plot of Buddy Daddies is, show them this.


The sole reason I wanted to watch this, is because I knew I hated Spy x Family, but I liked the concept it had. I wanted two not so good people, to for some reason have to raise a kid on their own, and to watch them struggle while doing so. Why? because it is fun to watch people try to do things they've never done before and Buddy Daddies felt like a second chance to have that, after having my fantasies ruined by the boring sitcom that was Spy Family (the X is a pain, I'm gonna remove it from here on out). Before  the show even aired, there were a lot of people everywhere saying it was just the gay version of Spy Family, a cheap copy, just another way to make money after something that was successful. Boy, were people wrong. I cannot deny Spy Family being an inspiration to this show, I am not in the production commitee after all, but it is very obvious when a show has been given love. If this was simply a copy made in hopes to rake in the money by following the footsteps of the Forgers,  you would be able to tell. There was a good amount of love put into this. I can tell they tried to tell their story the best they could with the resources they had. It is a story about two men, who either lost love or didn't know it, who got a second chance to start over after meeting a tiny girl. 

The main reasons I enjoyed Buddy Daddies, is because the characters feel like real people, things actually happen, the comedy is pretty good, and because the amount of BS was minimum. Spy Family issues for me were many, among them: NOTHING ever happening, no repercussions for people's actions, hollow and cheap war speeches whilst never showing me how the war was affecting their world (the only reason I can think of it sucking is cuz they are in like the late 50's or  early 60's mind you, not because of the show particularly showing anything for its claims. Want an actual good speech about war and to see how war affects a whole country? Gintama, a fucking gag manga written by a Gorilla did it better.) It is boring, dull, and majority of characters are just walking tropes. Not even good ones mind you. That grey haired woman was an even worse Mikasa. How the fuck can you be worse than the worst? and Anya is just a fanservice character (fanservice isn't always titties and nipple-less sculpted male torsos. I know, amazing.) All of this added up for a very dissapointing watch after episode 1. Feels good anime doesn't have to equal mediocrity. You can't just slap three people smiling on screen and call it a day.  In contrast to this, in Buddy Daddies  a lot of what I hated in Spy Family was unexistent. Things happened, characters were for the most part fleshed out, people faced repercussions for their actions and we got to see the consequences of Kazuki and Rei's job, being hitmen. There are no speeches about war, just two dudes trying to take care of a little girl, and facing ordinary real life struggles, like having your partner not help with chores, and dealing with annoying paperwork. I was very happy to get to watch an episode of this every Friday, and even looked forward to it. I would love for this show to have more episodes. It feels like they needed either more time, or better direction to make the story flow a bit better.

I very much enjoyed from episodes 1 to 10 , but in episode 11 I think it is when I felt things were being rushed, hence my reasoning for why I think more episodes would have helped. Miri's mom, Misaki, is one of the key parts of this story. She is very important. Unlike many people, I cannot dislike her. To me, she always felt like an abused woman, and even after her speech on why she hated Miri, I just couldn't hate her, I pitied her. She was neither right nor wrong. Did she want to have Miri? Was she assaulted and Miri was the result? did she have her at a time in her life when she was not in a good mindset to raise a child? I don't think it is ever really confirmed, but that information would have helped so much to see where she was coming from. Misaki was a character that the staff could have done a lot with, and it feels like they honest to god gave up on her. Her coming back for her daughter in episode 10 didn't feel odd, what did was her crying about not being a good mom for her and cooking and caring for Miri in episode 11. I don't think a show has to spoon feed you on a character's growth, but this is a woman who when we last saw her, was dating a jackass and who looked very miserable and heartbroken over being a mother, even saying that her ""dreams were ruined"". It would have made more sense if we had seen her at least make a change while on screen way earlier, not to just say she had cancer, and then kill her off two episodes before the finale. There was so much wasted potential for her character, truly a pity. As a result, when she passed away I didn't feel much for her. What I did feel was a sort of sadness for Kazuki, who once again was seeing a woman dying in front of him, and because of him, in a way.

The cast of characters is not very big, which is fine to me, but I wish we had more time with side characters like Miri's teacher Anna or Kyutaro. They seemed likeable and interesting enough. This is not to say that our main people are bad, because honestly the main joy for me in this show were both the dads, Kazuki and Rei. On the poster, I thought Kazuki would be that good guy with the doormat personality who was a complete airhead, and that Rei would be the dominant personality who would solve everything. I didn't completely guess. Kazuki does have some clumsiness but he also seems to be the one in charge, while simultaneously being a total drama king and very naughty, like when he was flirting with the casino prostitutes early on. Rei surprised me by being a sweaty gamer who had no real life social skills, and being the actual airhead of the two. It is a very nice feeling, when the cliche you expect, turns out to be something completely different. Both of them were able to have character growth and it was done very subtly with each episode. It was fun watching them cry and yell at simple things like sewing or having to play with a baby, to then see them slowly but surely catch on to what they needed to do. Small actions like Rei wanting to cook for Miri, or finally helping Kazuki out with both Miri or the house brought a smile to my face. Seeing the character change while on screen feels rewarding, but so is seeing two people, Rei and Kazuki, who have probably never known what a family is, to be experiencing it for the very first time. Miri saved part of their soul. They did things after meeting her that they would never have done otherwise. Kazuki let go of his grieving to try to achieve normal happiness. He was afraid of change, of ""being fullfilled by something else"", in this case his newfound family consisting of both Rei and Miri, after the heartbreak that he went through of losing his girlfriend and unborn child. In regards to Rei, he as he says, was like a statue. Not truly living, never even trying. It was a very big win in my book to see him be, for the first time, the one to take charge and say, "" I want to do this. I want to try, and we CAN do it."" As the saying goes, ""Being deeply loved by someone gives you strenght, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."", I think this can sum up Miri, Kazuki , and Rei's bond. 

All I will say in regards to the animation is that the quality of the artwork is nothing to write home about, average I guess, but sometimes the characters looked a bit too wonky for my taste. The opening and ending theme are both very nice and the music throughout the show isn't bad, minus Misaki's song. As for Kazuki and Rei's past actions, AKA, being mostly responsible for the deaths of Miri's parents, I think that their repentance and atonement was raising her. Them dying would have been too easy and would have also left me with a bad taste. It is funny, but almost all of the P.A. Works shows I've tried, I've dropped at the first episode. They feel lacking. This is one of the few that I think I will remember and for good reasons. Despite only having 12 episodes it gave me 3 characters who I love, and whose happiness I very much wished for. It made me laugh, it made me sad, it made me cry, and above all it gave me what I wanted and never got from Spy Family. Three people who in many ways, saved and helped eachother. No games, no stupid bravado, no hollow morality choices, and no dumb character tropes. Spy x Family could never. You can't pay me to watch another season of the boring Forgers.

TLDR; Buddy Daddies is a story about two killers killing a girl's dad, and then raising her as their own daughter, and learning how hard parenthood is while also changing their ways, and it has a banger song as the opening theme. If you watch it I hope you have a fantastic time just like I did.

Their smiles survived. I am overjoyed."
104722,"I guess Assassin's Pride is a good enough example of anime being wasted potential. It's been nothing but a downward spiral toward the abyss. Well, it did catch my interest by the first episode, and I am a sucker for these underdogs kind of story, as I have said many times in the past. So I can't help being a bit open and positive to start off since in my case, it had all the ingredients to turn out a decent fantasy anime I could kill my time with. I mean its abundantly evident, AssPride is as cliche as you can get, but honestly, If there is entertainment to had, what points is there to be so brutally focused on such other useless things? But Instead, I was hit with disappointment which intensified as the episode went by. Thus It sadly ended up becoming a chore to watch this anime as a result, which was rushed to absolute oblivion, and the importance of context was thrown out of the window.

There are so many things that are lacking connection here, which makes no sense, and these things form a plot-holes, that could've otherwise be avoided. It's not too hard either, you just had to follow the source material - light novel or the manga that I personally took a small peek off. Since I knew if there is one thing I could count on, it would be the source material, and in some cases, manga doesn't fall that short either. So there was this one scene where Kufa, our main character, confessed to something slightly heavy, and the influence it made on me, I definitely felt it. It was real and felt truthful. While the anime took that same scene and made it feel so forced and uneventful. It's like the people behind this mess adapted everything as they would like it. No thought or consideration went into, the direction or the execution at all. Every arc felt random, and it was like I was watching, several episodes worth of content like I was meant to know the context behind it prior.

 On top of that, all our character, the main for one Melida's development as well as power progress, was quick, and not efficient at all. She went from zero to a hundred way too fast, and we didn't have a chance to appreciate her growth properly. But the biggest issue is undoubtedly the terrible pacing. There were so many arcs, which would feel important and substantial to the overall story. Still, it was just cringe-inducing to watch, and I couldn't take it seriously one bit whatsoever. At least, there was still some few things that come out from this trainwreck of an adaptation. Because the art-style actually looked very clean for a short while and polished, it was so appealing to the eyes, I really liked the colour pallet they used here. Also, the animation had some decent sakuga in the beginning, the action bits were at the very least satisfactory to myself. Too bad, it didn't last all that long, as you could clearly see the downgrade in production over time. Until it looked like your where rubbing sands in your eyes, and it becomes an outright abomination of a derp fest, and started looking all stiff and iffy all over. 

But if there is one part, I would give praise to AssPride it has to be the opening first off. It was something that I personally started out disliking, but it did grow on me tremendously, and now I love it. It's such a unique style which plays in all kinds of the way with the camera angles, and scenery. The song nicely complements it all and fits the overall song and visual properly. Opening prepares your soul and body for horrifying experience. While the ending is also quite beautiful and is a great way to heal your aching soul after a terrible episode of AssPride. It's too bad it's wasted on this absolute mess. Overall, I really don't recommend AssPride to anyone out there, and you can do so much better. Sure, there was some potential here, but the studio made sure to throw it in the trash before it even begins. You will not find your new next, generic fantasy here, only lots of horror and pain, which for me is finally over. I am so glad to be done with this trainwreck, and never again have to lose my common sense over it. It starts out with a decent start showing lots of promise. But each episode after that brings it closer to the abyss, until its thoroughly soaked in there, and it never tries to find its way back. Absolutely terrible, and a waste of time."
9969,"This review will be directly tied to my Gintama season 1 review, so make sure you read that before reading this. Considering I’ve already covered all of the bases for Gintama, I’ll just go over them in my overview here, and then write about characters and episodes I like.

Img800()


Gintama Season 2 is more Gintama, to put it simply. A refined Gintama, but more of it nonetheless. They removed the persistent, nagging flaws of the more awful episodes and generally created a more rounded product with the second season. Bar some arcs that had major issues, this was far neater as a show; I’ll get into short specifics as to why.

On an animation note, I feel like leaving the 3:4 aspect ratio was symbolic for the quality shooting up. There were far less animation errors and weird frames in the second season, making the original style lose a little charm, but certainly being a welcome change.

As for the comedy, I feel like the formula was perfected here. They did everything season 1 did but better, and cut the fluff. Everything was super concise bar a bit of redundant filler; I had some of the greatest laughs from the series so far in this season. I’ll go into specific examples to prove my point later.

One thing I felt was very unique to season two, is the Four Devas arc. Never has the series had a moment with such political development, and I’m incredibly excited for more— as I’m sure we’ll get in later seasons. The culmination of two-hundred episodes subtly building Kabukicho made for a satisfying political struggle. It felt like a playground for Sorachi to test the water before he enters the serious world-wide political struggles.

With that in mind, let’s get into the specifics!


img800()

Four Devas was interesting for me. We get immediately introduced into the arc with a comedy episode following a girl named Pirako, who seems to be a murderous psychopath out for revenge. The episode is pretty fun, as several stupid antics ensue— but we can feel a storm brewing in the background the entire time. There is unrest in the town of Kabukicho, and soon it’ll boil over into war. Which is, exactly as you would guess, what happens. Now, perhaps the most initially impressive thing about this stretch of the story is the pay-off to 200 episodes of subtle political world-building coming to fruition. I’ve already talked about this before, but I can’t press enough how fun it was to see the 4 Devas of Kabukicho in action.

Now before moving onto plot lines and their messages, it’s time to cover the biggest folly of this arc— tonal whiplash and Otose’s death. We see Otose get brutally “murdered” by Jirocho, Gintoki blooming into a furious rage in response; this hits hard, not only to lose a lovable character like Otose, but to see our main character lose his goofy demeanor and devolve into a monster. More appropriately a devil, I suppose. The scene that proceeds this literally shows all of the main cast mourning over her as she dies in the hospital bedroom, creating a somber scene and an incredibly serious tone. However, this is trampled upon by the revival of Otose, leading to a far more comedic escapade than what was initially set up. So, while I don’t think what they ended up doing was bad, it was tonally jarring to go from mourning and revenge to laughing and friendship. As a side note, Otose literally comes back as an old woman who has been hospitalized and somehow fights.

Getting into the things I found more impressive about the arc, let’s get into the character of Jirocho. Jirocho’s mystery was well set up, as we try to understand his motivations for what he does— and the conclusion is very understandable and satisfying. The idea of taking responsibility for a broken promise and Jirocho filling the role of diseased friend was great. He wanted to protect the people he loved, and in this we see a lot of parallels to Gintoki. This is well set by some of the framing forcing them to fight against the Harusame in a parallel position, really driving the idea home. Their philosophies are similar, but they just go about things differently. This sets up Jirocho to feel like an older Gintoki, naturally making us sympathize and rationalize with him. Finally, his character conclusion is very sweet. Making up with Otose was good to see; Pirako finally getting the family she so longed for was heartwarming. A great ending to a great character.
 
The other major thematic point of 4 Devas would be the unification of Kabukicho. We see the concept of the entire town banding together to mourn the death of a dear friend, creating an inspiring moment of the cliche but still potent idea of doing good will always come back to you. The people the Odd Jobs helped paid back the favor and got over their differences in an attempt to save the friends and town they love; I think it was nice to see. My only complaints would be them reviving Otose for this reason, and some cliche dialogue. I feel like this arc would benefit from giving weight and levity to Kabukicho’s battle, having the characters genuinely fight for a lost friend. It wouldn’t really thematically detract from the arc, either, considering the unification could still be pulled off.

So, in summary, 4 Devas was a great installment in the series despite its flaws; I can’t wait for later serious arcs.

img800()

The Renho arc is in a weird position that isn’t quite serious nor quite comedic, but most cement it as comedic due to the ending. I don’t know if I particularly agree with this notion, but I suppose it doesn’t really matter. The arc had an awful start, as they introduced our female lead for Renho-- Fumiko. They drove sex joke and her being a slut super hard, which just didn’t work. The jokes were simple, uninspired, and just mood killers. Then, on top of this, they introduce the Elizabeth clan of Renho to be a Star Wars rip-off-- which was fun, but got a little too much focus as a joke. I think the reference was subtle and cleverly implemented enough to not detract from the story, but the episodes already lacked jokes in the first place, and relying on references made it feel cheap. The things that ensued were of relative fun, though. The concept of a society of Elizabeth’s is hilarious; it’s only made better by them just eating SNES cartridges. Antics like the game of Uno were used to great comedic effect while also serving the dual purpose of furthering emotional beats, reflecting upon the times Katsura and Elizabeth played Uno together. I also loved how we got to see Sakamoto’s peaceful philosophy of trade and business-- his philosophy of looking into the future come into play. As for the ending, Fumiko’s orgasmic conclusion was a bit strange but not that bad all in all. The villain being the planet was a decent twist, and the battle was fun. Though, as you likely know, that is not the true ending. The after credits scene unveils the fact that the entire goodbye Elizabeth sequence was focusing on Monday Elizabeth, a temp-Elizabeth that filled in for normal Elizabeth upon Elizabeth’s Monday absences. Fucking genius.

Perhaps one of the funniest arcs in Gintama, the Scandal arc has a genius premise. Gintoki wakes up after a party with a huge hangover, forgetting the events of last night only to find out he supposedly laid all of his friends-- even Madao who’s male. The natural conclusion is to date every single one of them to take responsibility, living in the same apartment rows with each one of them, attempting to balance their daily schedules. As a parody of ecchi, this is funny as fuck; it’s one of the best concepts I’ve ever heard for an arc. It ended up delivering upon the idea as well. The gags that ensued were absurd and surreal, as we Gintoki gets into a moral dilemma attempting to live with everyone-- culminating into a chaotic ending that I smiled all the way through. The ending twists were well set up and hilarious, even if I predicted both it being a prank and the Madao one being real. I don’t have much to say, and it’s not as clever or smartly written as Popularity Poll-- but god damn this was funny as hell.

img800()

Thorny was a fun serious arc focusing on the Shinsengumi that I don’t have too much to get into, but would like to note on. To start, Tetsu was super cool. He has a funny introduction, and his arc of completely changing himself bottom-up was neat. It was simple, but well conveyed, and makes Tetsu a grounded and somewhat inspiring character. The rapping thing was fun as well, especially when put with a serious character like Hijikata. Good chemistry; it got better when they made parallels with them both being “Thorny”. The whole thorny thing was a fun gimmick, and it led to some epic dialogue lines— like pushing through the thorns or being a thorn in one’s side lmfao. Kinda cheesy, but it was used to effect in the show. Hijikata’s backstory on being “thorny” was fine. It led to a nice, simple conclusion that was pretty wholesome. I don’t know how to feel about Tetsu’s conclusion in comparison to Hijikata for this arc, though. He was basically just forced to move on lmfao. His brother wanted him dead; that was never resolved, and I guess it couldn’t have been. It was just ironic looking at how Hijikata’s brother’s wife was talking about the bond of family. I guess one can take Tetsu finding a place and family in the Shinsengumi as he tries to change as the replacement, and put Hijikata in the role of his true older brother character guiding him along life— but he’s irrelevant after Thorny so I’ve heard, which is just a bruh moment,

Isaburo himself was alright. He was a typical elitist villain, with a good contrast to the more rough-around-the-edges Shinsengumi squad. He didn’t learn anything this arc aside from the formidability of the Shinsengumi, though. I hope we see him blossom with an arc of his own later, as I’m sure he has potential. Nobume was cool as well; I liked her dialogue and relationship with Sogo. She was interesting and entertaining on screen, if not a little ridiculous with cutting up buildings and whatnot. That’s hardly an issue considering the world establishes people can be that powerful beforehand. What I did feel like was a bit of an issue was the goofiness of the serious scenes in the arc. For example, Hijikata got shot 5-6 fucking times and stabbed through like twice— and then went through an entire fight scene and battle unhindered. He moved perfectly fine; no, adrenaline would not biologically allow that. Then he conveniently collapsed after the arc was done lmfao. I wish they would have pushed a bit more into the idea of it being an ideological motivation keeping him up, but nah.

Also, the arc is so cliche it almost looks like a parody lmao. I mean cliche with the action, like I just described. Then there was the joke with Hijikata eating from his hotdog while the helicopter crashed behind him, which is what made me want to note this. I don’t know, it just lacks self-awareness for a Gintama arc. It would have been so much nicer had they called out some of the bullshit. 

As a closing note, I loved the color palette having overtones of red for part of this arc— it set atmosphere super well.

I’d like to briefly go over this considering it’s my favorite episode and general part of season 2. It’s not quite as good as 188 from S1, but it’s in a similar vein and is honestly phenomenal. It uses Madao trying to remember the answers to questions on a gameshow to bring up Madao’s lost memories, which all connect to tell a coherent story. This is an incredibly funny, creative, and effective way of conveying a story-- and god damn do I have to give Sorachi props for coming up with this shit. Of course, also similar to 188, the story is surprisingly emotional and relies on dark humor for a lot of the comedic beats. As to which it’s almost hilarious. Of course, the ending lets us see Madao’s samurai soul shine through, as he wins the game show and forks the money that could save him to a family in need-- making for a initially inspiring and emotional moment that quickly turns into laughter, as they reveal that the debt the family needed to get out of tripled that of the prize money. It was seriously one of the most effective uses of 20 minutes I’ve ever seen; I look forward to episodes similar to this. 

img800()

For sure the most disappointing arc of the season, the jokes here were incredibly redundant and uninspired. While it wasn’t horrible, they often relied on saying “Jugem-Jugem Shit Throwing Machine Shin-chan’s Day Before Yesterday Underwear Shinpachi’s Life Balmunk Fezarion Isaac Schneider One Thirds Pure Feeling Two Thirds Worried-Over-A-Hangnail Feeling Though Betrayal Knows My Name Or Does It? I Know The Unknown The Cuttlefish Tastes Kind Of Different Than It Did Last Time Because It Was Caught Near The Pond And Served With Oil From A Hoofed Mammal, Pepepepepe Pepepepepe Runny Diarrhea.” as a punchline, with slightly different variations on the name. They even made a rendition of the joke into a song. Overall, it just felt like Family Guy repeating the same phrase for a few minutes level humor. It was lazy and repetitive, even if they introduced some funny jokes occasionally-- like when Madao started slinging shit. This arc seems to just have bloat and pacing issues in general; It;s even reflected in jokes like the Isaac Schneider segment. The arc wasn’t awful, but it’s a huge let down compared to the rest of season 2. (Also, yes, I included the full name to get my point across-- you probably skipped over reading it.)

Before I wrap this up, I should clarify I didn’t cover everything I loved-- just what I thought needed a write-up. In fact, I didn’t even talk about the second best episode of the season, the Hedoro bath episode. It’s not a big deal, though, and if you have any thoughts or questions hit me up. Gintama season 2 was Gintama season 1 minus the rough edges; I loved it. Can’t wait to take the plunge into later seasons, and I suppose I’ll sign out.

[Next review— Gintama Season 3 ](https://anilist.co/review/13892)"
20981,"Not that it’s a bad thing or anything, but director Mamoru Hosoda’s films tend to be fairly similar in subject matter and design. I’d argue that his greatest strength and an underlying thread that connects all his works is his minimalistic approach. 

Simplicity is the key. From his sparing character designs to his straightforward but often powerful camera movements. Even his stories usually address simple but no less meaningful themes through the ordinary lives of his ordinary characters, save for a minor fantastical twist here and there. 


Hosoda has built a career on being a minimalist. Even he’s acknowledged this:

>""Back when I was first given the chance to make a film at Toei Studios, it was much more about making these really cool films. Films that were really hard-edged, slick and stylish. Gradually, I changed my mind about that… I don’t think the point of filmmaking is to make slick films like that. I think I’m now looking to make something more orthodox and more simple."" 

Which is why The Boy and the Beast somewhat confuses me. 


Ren’s divorced mother has died in an accident. With his father nowhere to be found, he runs away and stumbles into the fantastic, parallel world of the Beast Kingdom. There he meets Kumatetsu, a crazy strong but crazy irresponsible manbearpig, who eventually raises Ren as his teacher and surrogate father. 


While Wolf Children addresses motherhood, The Boy and the Beast deals with fatherhood. That said, the symbiotic nature of the parent-child relationship in Bakemono is a lot more pronounced. From the outset both Ren and Kumatetsu are very obviously flawed characters, if a tad generic. Like father like son I guess, as both are loud, obnoxious and selfish. And yet, there is sufficient reasoning for these traits as to make the pair considerably nuanced and well-developed.



Ren is resentful and lonely. Having lost those he cares most about, he feels trapped and abandoned by the world. It is this same sense of abandonment that drives Ren, making him determined to become strong such that the world can never hurt him again. 

Kumatetsu’s irresponsibility stems from the fact that he lacked a parent figure. In order to survive and grow stronger, he needed to be selfish and had no room for philanthropy, nor was he ever shown any. With this in mind, he is still good-natured at heart. 

Both father and son have much to learn. And, as expected, they learn from each other. But it is this relationship, watching the two grow together, and their charming interactions and how their similarities and differences meld and clash that is the film’s most gratifying aspect. It is fun and fulfilling, complete with banter and feelsgoodman training montages. Ultimately, as predictable as it is, seeing both father and son transcend their original self-centred goals and personalities, and only with each other’s guidance, is uplifting. 


As such, it’s both confusing and a little disappointing when the film drastically deviates from this central relationship. This occurs most notably upon the introduction of the main villain. In short, everything about him is ham-fisted. From his one-dimensional, cartoonish portrayal (cue manic laughter) to the god-awful, tacky Moby Dick motif that is sledgehammered into the viewer’s face, it all feels so bloated and unnecessary. I understand his role as a parallel to Ren such that Ren could conclusively resolve his inner-turmoil and complete his coming-of-age, but again, it feels so awkward. 



As opposed to introducing a rushed and caricatured external source of conflict as a means of resolving their inner-conflicts, I felt as if the film would have benefited from a more climatic, internal struggle between Ren and Kumatetsu. Not only would have this allowed the film to keep to its strengths, it would have also provided more screen time to develop the pair’s relationship. 

And here’s the problem: by over-complicating the story and introducing these extra, ham-fisted characters and plot points, time that could be spent further developing the main characters and their relationship is wasted. And this shows. Despite its merits, Ren and Kumatetsu’s relationship simply lacks the emotional weight present in Hana’s relationship with her children, which is much more acutely focused on and developed in Wolf Children. 



The side characters are forgettable. There’s this subplot introduced in the second act that, although sporting an understandable purpose, doesn’t really make an impression. 



Hosoda also forgoes his signature simplicity with the film’s visual presentation, specifically with the use of crowds. Come to think of it, I don’t think there have ever been so many people concurrently onscreen in any of his other films. He uses some pretty ugly CG models here, and although I’ve definitely seen worse, they could have been done without (especially as this is a big-budget movie). 

Some IG approved CGI right here

Earlier I mentioned how Hosoda is generally both proficient and efficient with his camera movements. For some reason, the movements in The Boy and the Beast are really noticeable and jarring. I’m not sure if Hosoda was doing things more liberally, or if I was just noticing it more because I was distinctly aware of his usual proficiency with the technique. Regardless, it felt like there were a tonne of pans and rotations that didn’t really add anything. Of course, some moments are pretty neat, like when a character was teleporting around and the camera movements helped establish a sense of playful confusion. 

Other than that, the art is pretty solid. Colour wise, there is a nice contrast between the dark and artificial Shibuya and the light pastels of the Beast Kingdom. Character designs are neat and simple, like always. 


I feel as if Hosoda was too ambitious with The Boy and the Beast.  The film loses focus of its core relationship and instead introduces too many forgetful or otherwise plain frustrating elements. If Hosoda had stuck to his guns, further exploring the magic and depth of the very simple yet emotionally stimulating relationship between Ren and Kumatetsu, then I think the film would have been much more rewarding. 



While there are still plenty of feel good vibes to be had from The Boy and the Beast, that’s all you can really get from it. It overstepped its bounds when it was all going so well. Ultimately, it lacks significant weight and fails to make much of an impression. I’ll never look at Moby Dick the same way again."
99425,"A visual feast and a high-octane journey. Far and away TRIGGER's best production to date, and excels on its own and against its peers as if it's not even breaking a sweat. The sheer, lush visual spectacle on display takes what is otherwise a story steeped in cliché to a completely different level.

img()

Anime films are kind of on a different scale. It's easy to get enraptured by the higher production value that's allowed to a cinematic piece. Everything is going to look better and feel more cohesive than a typical television anime, because more is banking on getting people in the doors of the theatre and paying the ticket price. 

That needs to be stated to emphasize just how above and beyond Promare takes all of its baselines. The art and animation on display here is basically indescribable. Every scene is in motion, a natural consequence of a theme surrounding fire. But they took that mere concept of motion, and applied it to every scene. The swinging cameras on the CGI fights give an incredible sense of scale and momentum without disorienting the viewer's vision, and every fight feels coherent, even when the entire screen is awash in explosions, fire, and tumbling figures. It really needs to be emphasized that words can only do so much to explain any of this. The level of what is shown rather than what can be told is on a totally different scale here.

img()

The presentation and animation itself is just inventive, when it comes down to it. Beams of emergency lights that extend out in lines rather than as light. Lens flares given a transparent, square-like pixel quality. Fire that's essentially moving fractals to create the sense of motion. Into the Spiderverse levels of camera swings and perspective shifts around 3D models. Dynamic character-name cards that erupts stylishly whenever someone is introduced, even sometimes interacting with the rest of the scene and getting knocked out of frame or burst by the action. Promare brings an insane level of creativity and panache to the table. If a series like Violet Evergarden can capture the beauty of nuance in a scene, Promare takes that same intricacy of animation and concept in the complete opposite direction to just show how COOL everything can look. The film has a few lulls in the story, which are necessary for the breakneck speed the film, giving the audience a much needed break before the next 20-30 minutes straight of uncompromising combat. But even in these slower scenes, the visualization of a room with brightly coloured triangles, capturing a simple life before a flood of chaos, or a heartbreaking moment of camaraderie that is as fleeting as the last embers of a fire, the remarkable level of detail and creativity is immeasurable. 

img()

img()

Another thing that's required to mention is the daring color palette present. Fire is so instinctive for our eyes to see, but Trigger went with a very bold choice of choosing a mix of magenta/turquoise, and pink/blue for any fire on display. This, along with some expected color theming on display in any good Trigger production, and you get something that is purely and unabashedly unique in all execution. Lush really is the word of the day, as the entire film is a visual feast, with so much to visually take in that it can be a little exhausting. Couple that with the heart-pumping music of Sawano, and you get a visual and audio explosion that can't be shred from your mind. 

img()

The story, surprisingly, is the film's weakest point. This is mostly due to the stiff cliché of its basis. Although the world-building is extremely creative in its imagining of a science-fiction world altered by a tremendous fire-war, all of this design is surface level. You can easily forget what the importance of the city is beyond something to be lit ablaze and to have tons of buildings ripped apart during the action set-pieces. 

img()

The characters are also fairly weak in design, but this tends to work in the film's favour. Galo is simple, dim-witted, and the generic protagonist (let's not mince words, he really is Kamina from Gurren Lagaan, even though that's just a meme). Lio is sassy-naughty boy who wants the world to burn at any cost. But despite these one-note characters, they act as idealized foils for one-another, both to compare and contrast each other's views at different points during the film. The central premise hidden in the film is fairly predictable as well, but because of the two lead protagonists being extremely fleshed out in their clichés, any other characters simply need to bounce off of their strong personalities for instantly fun dialogue or action. There are also a surprising amount of side-characters, and although none get fleshed out, all get a moment or two in the spotlight, which is all that's really needed to advance the plot forward. 

img()

In the end, complex storytelling is not what Promare is about. Promare is about seeing just how far anime can push the medium of animation and execution in every sense of the word. And what small faults exist are completely eclipsed by the sheer magnitude of adrenaline-fueled action and artistic talent on display. It takes a simple premise, and let's it blaze like a supernova with its raw energy, and leaves you with nothing but its unrivaled passion where its fire once stood."

After the finale of Kaijuu No.8, most were likely thinking that the next season was going to be devoid of good action sequences and good shounen material, in general. Boy, how wrong we were. Wistoria took shounen lovers by storm when its first episode aired, showcasing a combination of a simple, yet satisfactory setting and breathtaking combat animation. I kid you not, there was choreography, there were angles and even impact frames. Action-wise, couldn't be better. However, the only flaws came with the writing.

Will Serfort (VA is Kouhei Amasaki who also voices the goat Otto Suwen from Re:Zero) is a student at a magical academy in a magical word where the majority can use magic. The sole problem is that he can't. He's constantly persecuted for being a no-talent and a laggard among his colleagues. His path is a hard one, but he desires to reach the top of the tower, the place where the best of the best reside, in order to reach his gifted childhood love. Remind you of anything? Isn't that the whole premise for Kaijuu No.8? Ain't that Asta's (Black Clover) issue? Now, I might be reaching, but there's more.

The show took a lot, and I mean A LOT of inspiration from other popular series and implemented some of their aspects into its own. There's really nothing wrong with that, albeit, in this case, it felt annoyingly cheap. It was first obvious during the Grand Magic Festival. I mean, come on. The whole thing was just Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire, infused with some elements of the UA Sports Festival (MHA). A giant dome full of students watching, tiny balls flying around (golden snitch). Then you got a race to the dome and a battle inside it. Not convinced? What if I tell you that Sion and Will's relationship, and Deku and Bakugou's relationship ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. A cheap copy, if you will. Sion hates Will for being a laggard who never gives up, and hates himself for being so pathetic. Will who was born without basic powers, works hard and easily surpasses Sion. It's THE SAME THING. Dwarves are looked down upon, Will is a squib. Hell, Edward is just Severus Snape and Aizawa.

And what's with the designs? Fire users got red hair, ice users got blue hair, elves have green hair? The fiesty teacher has dark hair and black clothes, while the nice one has white hair? A child can create these designs.

Now that I'm done calling out the bs writing, let's praise the production, shall we? Will is a no-talent in terms of magic, but he's a prodigy when it comes to physical combat. This makes for a perfect formula for high-speed, exilerating, close-range action sequences. Incredible work by [Actas ](https://anilist.co/studio/60/Actas) and [Bandai Namco Pictures ](https://anilist.co/studio/6116/Bandai-Namco-Pictures). Incredibly fluid action sequences week after week, never dissapointing. That, combined with the mystical atmosphere and the satisfying medieval-esque soundtrack did not fail to provide chills. There is actually a plot to follow with the whole barrier and Albis Vina thingie, certain characters to be explored a bit, a setting that attracts fantasy genre or medieval theme lovers, and a love triangle.

Episode 11 was simply gorgeous. The beautiful soundtrack, the sword engulved in flames, the alluring atmosphere, the title drop and the credit roll instantly reminded me of Demon Slayer. Almost as if it was Wistoria's version of KNY Episode 19 (great ep btw), the execution was stunning. Let me know if it reminded you of other episodes. I don't mind if it takes inspiration for execution purposes, but you have to be original in building your world and characters. I just hope that once the barrier breaks, the outside world is worth exploring.

webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/Wistoria-ED2.webm)

Maybe it's due to the poor pacing or execution by the studious when adapting, but another subpar thing about the show is its inability to effectively explain the concepts. Nobody knows anything about the world of Wistoria, and yet, they persistently slap new information about the magic system and special items directly in our faces without elaborating. Sure, the commercial bumps sometimes specify these questions, but a lot of the times, they don't.


A solid 7.5 to 8 anime. Highly recommended for action and battle shounen lovers, but it's definitely not for everybody. You can't expect any depth or organized writing from this, but if you just enjoy it for what it is, then the hype train is bound to roar.

21860,"Surprisingly good anime despite it's popularity, hence the title.
This anime is brought to us by rather unfamiliar studio, Satelight and C2C.
I had some expectation going into this anime since I have read the Light Novel; however, with an unfamiliar studio and voice actors, my expectations weren't as high as it should have been. Anyways, for the ratings!

Animation: 8/10
Unique way of animating the characters, it has a good mix of the classic 90's pencil sketch style and 3D rendering. Action scenes are not comparable to recent fantasy/action anime; however, it's decent enough for the viewers to be indulged in the moment. Scenery and characters go easy on the eyes, and is pleasant to look at.

Music: 9/10
Songs/OST are what really hits you and lingers in this anime. The placements of the songs are almost perfect (almost as good as Anohana/Guilty Crown), and it plays just the right tunes at the right time. Despite, great OP/ED, what really sticks with you is the track ""Always in my Heart"". This song is what will drives you nuts even after completing SukaSuka.

Plot: 6.5/10
Very interesting World building/setting. It was a good breath of a properly built dark/fantasy world. A really good break from the generic isekai anime world that's been dominating the anime market. Not a major plot hole or disturbance, however, the world could have been elaborated and explained a little better so the viewers don't have to second guess what is going on. There was no proper closure to the anime and the ending that was foreshadowed throughout the anime came very abruptly. This is probably due to the fact that there is a light novel sequel and we only got 1/3 of the content ""animated"", nevertheless, in my humble opinion, an end to a season should at least wrap up it's own arc. Lastly, the story only focuses on the Chtholly arc and skips the other side stories that the light novel has hence it's deemed difficult for a sequel anime to come out with so little explanation and plot devices set for next season.

Character Development: 8/10
Does a decently good job at expanding on the main characters and their drive to carry out their motives. It was nice to see side characters get some spotlight and development in the show. !Heavily due to the fact, the main characters for the sequel (SukaMoka) are the side characters.!

Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10
I Really enjoyed it, it was something different. Watched it with a friend, and! it kinda destroyed us in the end so job well done? I suppose.! Again, a really good break from those generic isekai, ecchi, harem, shonen or what not. Very down to earth dark/fantasy boy meets girl anime with mix of creators originality. If only the ending was spanned out a little longer so the viewers could drown in the emotion the rating for Personal Enjoyment and Plot would have been slightly higher."
126213,"Banished from the Hero’s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside 
Composite Rating 10/10

This was going to be an 8 or 9 for me. But the ending pushed me over to a 10.

Animation/Design 9/10

I personally loved the animation. 

Characters 10/10 [Spoliers]

Red and Rin are the best. They are such a humble and warming couple. I also feel like they complimented each other soo nicely. Considering one came from the Heros party and the other is/was a princess, they were made for each other. I also like how they took their relationship slow, but that it actually developed as the show progressed.

Ruti was also great. At first, she reminds me of Gowther from the seven deadly sins. But the character develops nicely towards the end. I also love how she breaks bounds in a work that says you have to follow your Blessing gift. Very inspirational. 

Tisse may have been my single favorite character. She was really the Hero's greatest friend. The way she saves Red's life, knowing that if she has let Ruti kill her own brother, She would have never forgiven herself. and the way that she was always there for Ruti even after she renounced the Heros blessing. I also 

Lastly, the town folk: The town actually felt alive. There were many notable townspeople that actually played a part in the story. And ones that you even want to know what happens next. All in all, I think that they were all great.

Audio/Soundtrack 8/10

The music was nice and fitting. I personally loved the intro.

Synopsis (background information and description)

The anime is based in a world where everyone is born with a 'Devine blessing'. This is like their class, it determines what skills they will get and what they will be inherently good at. The main character Red's sister has the Hero blessing. They are in a party with some others including the Sage. One day the Sage says that the Red is holding them back and that he should leave the party without telling his sister. The nice guy Red is, he leaves the party. He goes far away to open an apothecary. He does odd jobs to get enough money to build an apothecary. On the first day, someone walks in. Rit, a girl he has worked with while being in the Hero's part. She convinces him to let her work at the shop, she helps him with the business side of things and around the shop. She also insists she moves in. From here their romance blooms. They help the town out where they can and get into other mischief.... There is more ... you'll have to watch!

Conclusion:

I love this anime, honestly everything about it. The fact that it was a slice of life that has romance, action, and fantasy. The characters were one of the best parts for me. Red was not a cocky MC or a wimp. He was powerfull and yet humble. And I liked the fact that he knew that he was stronger than most, and not that he was too nieve to see it. Overall, I liked the story and how Red and Rin's relationship developed over the course of the anime. Great show, great development, great ending. 10/10"

Two years ago, I said (in a piece whose relevance will quickly become apparent), that the best anime leaves you feeling like it's changed your life. O Maidens In Your Savage Season is the latest from Mari Okada, a divisive writer known for scripts that absolutely burst at the seams with emotional intensity, and I can definitely imagine it changing someone's. It's that kind of show. 

I’ve seen Okada's work called “melodramatic”, and I actually think that’s a very apt descriptor. What she understands is that melodrama is not an inherent negative, it’s a tool--like any other tone--and can be turned toward productive ends. Maidens, before it is anything else, is a wildly successful threading of the needle in that regard. Make no mistake, it is melodramatic. Sometimes extremely so, but never for no reason. Okada is very, very good at making you feel for her characters. Maidens is that skill cranked up to 11. Through all the awkwardness and mistakes, you really feel for these characters.

Okada is prolific enough that people first encounter her work in different ways--I was introduced to it via [Black Rock Shooter](https://anilist.co/review/2325), which I remain convinced is one of the decade’s great underrated television anime. Maidens is not as aesthetically out-there as BRS (it’s not an action series, for one thing), but they share that same tendency toward emotional rawness. 

But to emphasize just that aspect of Maidens would be a mistake. The show is sold as a rom-com, which is not strictly correct (way too much happens for that to be the beginning and end of its genre classification), but it is, in addition to its bareknuckle emotional intensity, extremely funny. 

The first half of the series in particular is filled with a lot of A) dirty puns and B) absolutely stellar pull-face gags. In regards to the former, HiDIVE’s translation team deserves some credit here, for managing to creatively rework the fountain of sex jokes that the show’s first half throws down and still keep them funny.

There’s also what quickly became Maidens’ first signature scene--protagonist Kazusa streaming down the street in the first episode, screaming at the top of her lungs in frustration at her inability to turn off her own dirty mind. That downright FLCLian scene is what ended up selling me hard on the series, but there’s a lot more to Maidens than just that.

img880()

Like any good dramedy, Maidens lives and dies by its characters. Our core cast consists of the five members of a high school literature club. There’s Kazusa, our female lead, and the “everygirl” of the cast. There’s Rika Sonezaki, the prudish (and secretly very maidenly) head of the club. Hongo, an aspiring author with a cybersex hobby. Niina, a beautiful former child actress who the other girls find a bit aloof and mysterious, and finally, there’s Momo who…well, we’ll get to Momo.

Each of these girls have their own character arc, and contrary to what might be expected of a standard single-cour-length 12 episode anime, they’re actually woven together pretty well. The show does not really delineate these arcs episode by episode, instead often cutting between them and divvying its episodes up into a number of different segments. Together, these congeal and tie the girls’ individual arcs into a wider whole. This is how Maidens can be the story of five girls in a literature club and also a broad commentary on the trials and tribulations that teenage girls in general face. There’s a lot going on here, suffice it to say.

It’s tempting to try to plot the arcs out one by one, but the show’s structure inherently frustrates that impulse. Take Kazusa, by far the most straightforward member of the cast, as an example. Kazusa’s arc revolves around her relationship with Izumi, her next door neighbor and childhood friend. In what ended up being another of the show’s signature scenes, Kazusa ends up wandering into his room unannounced in the first episode, and catches him masturbating. This sets off a domino effect that ends with her realizing she has feelings for him, and she starts pursuing him romantically.

That’s all well and good, but that’s only the first third or so of the series, and it’s here where the straightforwardness ends. See, to keep talking about this plotline we have to rope in Niina, who initially gets into a misunderstanding where Kazusa thinks she’s trying to steal Izumi from her. Niina, subjected to a lifetime of people assuming she’s trying to steal their man, plays into Kazusa’s assumption, and ends up actually falling for him too in the meantime. 

That’s just one of many ways that Maidens twists its characters plotlines together, and this kind of interlocking is actually surprisingly rare in the medium. 

None of the character arcs present here would really work without the others with the possible exception of Sonezaki’s. Her arc, where she (among other things) learns to get over her prudishness, ends up falling for and then dating a boy in her class, and reconciles with a gyaru she fought with in the first episode, is probably the one least connected to the other girls’, though even it’s not entirely separate. Plus, that gyaru gets pregnant in the show's penultimate episode, returning only in the epilogue--happily living with her partner. Maidens doesn't even let minor side characters not be involved in its main themes.

So what’s the point of all this knotty, complicated relationship stuff? Well, in a way, the knottiness actually is the point. Maidens is primarily a portrait of the infinitely multifaceted experience of being a teenage girl. The focus is demographically fairly narrow (all five members of the core cast are roughly the same age, are Japanese cisgender girls, all go to the same high school in an urban area, etc. etc. etc.) but the experiences here resonate incredibly well. One of Okada’s talents as a writer is using the specific as a signifier of the general. Melodrama transfigured into genuine pathos.

For example: Niina’s arc involves a lot of internalized misogyny, she’s dealt with an entire life of people assuming awful things about her and the way she copes with that is by willfully falling into a “bad girl” role and actively thwarting attempts to help her by putting on an air of maturity and of being above the situation. The specifics include her past as a childhood actress and a history with a pedophiliac director 

who is up there with Suishou from Granbelm as far as being among the most actively hateable characters of the Summer 2019 season. The generalities--that internalized misogyny, pretending to be above the things that go hand in hand with your own age--are going to be broadly relatable to many people, and it’s on that intuitive level that Maidens marks its first major success. You will end up seeing yourself in at least one of the core cast, if not many of them.

The other element to all of this is the direction. Maidens’ visual symbolism is so strong that it’s occasionally on-the-nose. There’s an absolute ton of train symbolism. Kazusa’s main squeeze Izumi is absolutely obsessed with the things, and while his railfan characterization is endearing on a surface level, picking that method of transportation in particular is not an accident. Using trains entering tunnels as a visual metaphor for sexual intercourse dates back to the censorship-happy postwar era of Hollywood, if not farther, after all. It’s here we have to shout out director Masahiro Ando too, because while this is ultimately Okada’s brainchild, it’s Ando who makes all of this work in the moving world of anime. 

Both quiet one-offs like Kazusa literally reflecting in a mirror while reflecting on her actions, and longer setpieces--Niina walking hope as a barfly drunkenly sings in a nearby karaoke parlor, the entire finale in all of its blunt color symbolism--work incredibly well, and the show wouldn’t be half as engaging without the strong visual element backing it up. That the animation comes from the still-young Studio Lay-duce (who last year also threw their weight behind RELEASE THE SPYCE) makes me hope they get more projects like this. They’re damn good at it. 

Visual side note here: all of the cast are great, but Hongo (whose plotline where she ill-advisedly plays a game of what [This Week In Anime columnist Micchy](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2019-09-10/.150934) called a game of ""sex chicken"" with one of her teachers is the boldest risk the show takes, that's a hard line to walk) probably has the best expressions. Not bringing this up at all would feel like a crime.

There’s one last thing we need to give Maidens credit for, which is having a canonically queer character in a show that’s not specifically about that. Momo’s arc--to greatly simplify things--involves her coming to the realization that she’s attracted to Niina, and, consequently, girls in general, not boys. Maidens is not really “Momo’s story”, but the show makes room for her regardless, and that she’s focused on at all really makes the series’ inclusive message hit that much harder. That she’s a great character on top of that is just icing on the cake.

To put it plainly, Maidens is the second anime in as many years to fall into a very specific, very exciting archetype. Shows driven primarily by women as creative forces, about the experiences of young women, that effortlessly transcend the confines of the genres they initially appear to be. For last year’s A Place Further Than The Universe, that was the school life genre, which it discarded early on to blast into a full-on adventure series. For Maidens, the transition is quieter. By the time you realize that it’s no longer playing by standard romantic drama rules, it’s already got its hooks in you. Maidens takes a similar tack to Further in its relation to its parent genre. There’s nothing in Maidens that scans as antagonistic to romdrams, but it sets itself well apart from them.

The show’s finale, an explosion of colors both figurative and literal, is one of the most spectacular to come out of anime in 2019, never mind the fact that it has the sheer gumption to end on what’s essentially a title drop. The final plotline, where our girls stand up for Sonezaki through dramatic action, is what Maidens' real core is. No matter what life throws at you, young girls are strongest together, emotionally honest with each other. To throw back to an old truism: there's no force in the universe stronger than a determined high school girl.

img880()

As far as left-of-the-dial, emotionally-resonant storytelling, Maidens has not had a lot of competition this year. But the truth is, even if Maidens had dropped in a much stronger year it’d still be exceptional. I’d say you don’t get stories that hit this hard very often, but, as mentioned, Maidens actually does have an obvious, fairly recent bedfellow. Perhaps, then, this is the start of a trend. I’d certainly love for it to be, you can never have enough things like Maidens.There will always be a need for stories like this, for as long as there is someone to hear the messages they put into the world.



And if you liked this review, [why not check out some of my others here on Anilist?](https://anilist.co/user/planetJane/reviews)

Edit Note, 3/29/24: This review is old enough that some of the images in it have broken. I don't have the original files here anymore, so I've removed them entirely and left the ones that remain. Unfortunate, but probably necessary."
97886,"I was looking for something similar to Durarara!! to watch, as my current mental state needed a show that was entertaining, fun, aesthetically pleasing, graphically satisfying, and rich in characters. I followed the suggestion to start watching Kekkai Sensen, and I have to say that I liked this sequel a lot more than the first season. However, I still believe that the prequel is nevertheless a necessary starting point for getting into the mood of this urban fantasy scenario. The animation is great, as well: all the action sequences look incredible and exciting!

The city of Hellsalem's Lot is a crazy landscape, and unbelievable things happen all the time. It becomes the norm for the characters, and for us too, which doesn't mean that it's boring but rather familiar and almost ""domestic"". This single aspect simply makes the series really special: the whole ""one for nonsense, all for nonsense"" thing may become cringe or predictable episode after episode, but it never does. Instead, it becomes the most powerful weapon of this show: everyone generally hates spinoffs, but in this case, they are relevant, interesting, funny and their reason to be is basically the freedom with which the show entertains the viewer. They tackle different motifs and leverage on various feelings, in order to resonate with every kind of viewer and his/her personal taste. Even the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary (?) characters have distinct personalities and unique features that distinguish them from the others, which makes the viewer empathize with the weirdness of events and the characters involved. 

What I absolutely adore about this series is the tone employed to alternate between lightness and heaviness: I would lie If I wrote here that never have I ever felt sad watching an apparently light-hearted and funny anime, but those moments were either unexpected in an ocean of amusing events, or skilfully balanced with said circumstances. Leonardo, the main character, endures a negative condition that endangers both his beloved sister and himself. However, I never felt like his constant self-loathing or deeply felt affection made the show more demanding in relation to the emotional weight of his frame of mind. I mean... this season's first episode recaps what happened in the first one with a rap song...

What I personally valued the most in this season is the time that some episodes took to portray the backstories of the members of Libra: there are episodes about Chain's part-time job as a spy, K.K.'s struggle to make her private and working lives coexist, and also the short introduction of Steven's secret organization that I believe will be explained further in the following season(s). I felt like these details were kind of overlooked in season one, and I'm super glad they were not actually forgotten.

It is really hard for me to criticize this show, but if I really have to point something out... the only weakness, may I say, that also made me appreciate the second season more than the first one, is the shallowness of the ""main"" evil characters: apart from their fond love for chaos and the attempt to steal Leonardo's eyes... what other reasons do they have to act as they do? Femt is pretty interesting, as I believe he genuinely just acts out of boredom, but the absence of a plotline that involved White, Black, and William really made me feel relieved. It tried to add substance to boring characters and though I appreciate the attempt I didn't get drawn in their story."
113311,"Just finished this show and wanted to write a review (minimal spoilers).  Instead of writing long paragraphs, I just want to jot down a few points that struck me about this show:

What I liked about the show
 This show is about a father and his daughter.  The scenes between them were touching without being overly dramatic.  Show was wholesome.
 The story portrays parental sacrifice well, as the father is an ordinary ""Joe Blow"" but you can see how much he cares for his daughter.
 The show combines comical sequences with more poignant scenes well.  In other words, the show is not just entirely ""ha ha"" funny but also not entirely a tearjerker like some other similar father/daughter slice of life shows.  I find both the comedy and poignant scenes to be done well.
 I particularly liked how the show can be a tearjerker for some, but it doesn't just pile on misery after misery to ""make"" you feel sorry for the characters.  They try to live normal lives.
 The vignette style of the show is also good.  An episode usually has 2-3 vignettes, so there is bound to be at least 1 or 2 that you would like.
 The show also has an element of mystery, as most of the show was set when the daughter was around ten years old, but every episode had a few scenes towards the end that were set more in the ""present day.""  The ending scenes point to a bigger mystery that needed to be solved.  Without spoiling the ending, I can say tha the mystery was resolved in a satisfactory way (i.e. the solution can be attained by thinking and did not come out of left field)
 The story is coherent - it has a clear beginning, middle and end.  It is not like some other shows where you must read the manga to ""get"" the story.
 I generally liked the opening and ending music for the show.


What I don't like about the show
 Some of the side characters were annoying at times.  Particularly, I have seen quite a few people not like the father's boss, finding him particularly annoying.  I think the boss was ok, but rather hit and miss.
 The art style is rather simplistic but is run of the mill for a slice of life anime.  It is certainly watchable, though.  Just don't expect KyoAni, Ghibli, or Shinkai level visuals.
 Some of the character designs were rather similar looking.
 Some plot points were never fully resolved, but those plot points are relatively minor.  

YMMV
 A recurring plot point is that the father is hiding an important secret about himself from his daughter.  The secret (i.e. what the father is hiding) is pretty much revealed in the first episode.  I found the recurring theme of the secret to be ok, but I can also see others be like ""What's the big deal?  Why doesn't he just tell his daughter?""  However, you can judge for yourself after the first episode if it is something you would be interested in."
100722,"Right off the bat from where we ended, it started pretty nicely with the firs four episodes being Natsumi's arc. It had a great dive down to her storyline and how she felt whenever she gets judged for her appearance. Gotta say, what we have was a generic anime with complete mindboggling and sad realization in the middle part, a funny yet hectic moment in the first, and complete fanservice in the end. For the record, try not to get caught while watching the last episode if you don't want some ahem judgmental eyes, if you know what I mean. Another thing to add about this great of an anime sequel is that, you may see your favorite waifus vying for the protagonist's attention. This anime is all about chad protagonist, but in the end, it became chad girls trying to make him swoon. If you ever want to see what the new spirits look like, then look no further for this is a perfect anime. If you want lolis, you got it. You want big onee-sans, you got it as well. If you want a wholesome waifu that you know you will never ever get, then watch this. This is the show that makes me think ""Oh man, I think I'm smiling all over again and can't stop doing it."" Note: Spoilers may spoil you. If you do not want that, then ask Kurumi to use Yod Bet to make you travel to the past that would prevent you from reading this in the first place.

For anyone looking for the synopsis:
Episodes 1 to 5: Main Protagonist is dealing with the 7th spirit codenamed ""Witch"" that tends to be attractive when turned into an adult version, and much more like a Yoshino when in her regular form. The girl has disillusioned self-worth, loathing herself to the point of destroying anyone's life if someone saw her original form.

Episodes 6 to 11: Shido is dealing with the past of 5 years ago, the time where Origami fell into the hands of DEM and became a spirit codenamed: ""Angel"" as her normal codename, and ""Devil"" for her inverse form. This is the moment where things may sound complicated due to the fact that we're dealing about time and space continuum and how things may change if the history was rewritten back in the future.

Episode 12: Wholesome, hectic, yet fanservice. Yes, that's all I have to say to this episode. Mainly because that they're trying to swoon him over, to the point of going such extent as putting something questionable into his drink, trying to tempt him and make him think of ""innocent"" actions, and basically giving us a wholesome moment of him and Tohka in the end.

Overall, I say that this is one anime that I would probably want to continue. Can't say that I'm not highly expecting the same with a bit more wholesome moments with the spirits. With this in mind, I may or may not have to have a great sense of taste."
105914,"I should start by admitting that I don't think otaku pandering is generally a bad thing. One of anime's strengths is its instantaneous hook from maximized aesthetic appeal in character design, so wish fulfillment entertainment is simply a natural progression. Nonetheless, there are many ways for an anime rooted in pandering to go wrong, one of which Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is a pretty good example. 

Our protagonist Nakano is afflicted with a general malaise from being overworked by his office job, and playing opposite is Senko, a fox spirit who decides to become his housemaid as a means of alleviating his exhaustion. There's nothing especially unique about Nakano. Aside from having an affinity for Senko's fluffy tail, being an average exploited Japanese salaryman is Nakano's defining characteristic. Neither Nakano nor Senko feel like fully realized characters, rather they act as commensal concepts. Hence, the essence of the show lies in a emotionally fulfilling atmosphere (often described as ""healing"") enkindled by Senko's caring for him. Nakano exists diegetically to be pampered by Senko; likewise, Senko's main purpose as a character is to care for Nakano. There is another fox spirit, Shiro, who befriends Nakano, but she never really aggressively competes with Senko for his attention, instead functioning like an alternative texture.

Having outlined the mechanics, we can now ascertain how its narrative falls apart in several aspects. Firstly, since Senko has no personal motivation to act as Nakano's housemaid (the canonical explanation that he resembles one of his ancestors who previously had a rapport with Senko means that her interest at first is a matter of happenstance, i.e. any inciting attraction is negligible), there is no real chemistry between the two. This is aggravated further by their strictly platonic interactions, and although there may be sexual/romantic undertones, any development in this direction is repeatedly extinguished by Nakano's contradictory inner remarks about how Senko both looks too young for his taste and acts too maternal for him. The show falls flat here since it's mostly focused on their relationship, or lack thereof.

As there is no foundational attraction between the two, the weight of Senko's motivation to nurture falls onto the circumstances surrounding Nakano's unhappiness. This is actually the show's biggest misstep. As the emphasis shifts to Nakano's abuse at work, Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san evolves from flaccid slice of life into something much more sinister. 

Japan's work environment is an unignorable cultural dilemma. Extremely long hours, unpaid overtime, and unused vacation days are common realities experienced by Japanese salarymen, often leading to stress, depression, sleep deprivation, and, at its extreme, karōshi (overwork death). ""Death marches"" and ""black companies"" are serious issues facing Japan, and the nightmare of actually working as an animator in Japan is pretty well understood by fans. But what does this have to do with the show? 

To help illustrate why this is a narrative problem, let me pose a question: Why Nakano? Surely, he isn't the only salaryman suffering as a result of his exploitative company. So where is everyone else's Senko-san? What did Nakano do to get his own fox spirit housemaid? Of course, we know the answer, and we already know it to be facile and convenient. Nakano had no decision in his ancestry, and there is nothing particularly special about his victimization. Thus, the answer the show provides is also its general prescription for the salarymen at large: moe escapism. Instead of identifying a cultural emergency that the government has even been taking action against, Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san sees an opportunity to exploit for its own benefit. Why bother questioning the circumstances of stress, isolation, and disconnection when you can just watch anime like Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san and self-insert yourself into faceless leads like Nakano? This is unintentionally egregiously harmful social commentary, and in a culture in which a man married a Vocaloid character to escape loneliness, this is unacceptable.

Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san doesn't need to be a show with deep social commentary; the most frustrating thing is that the perfect adaptation already exists in the form of the post-credits ""Super Senko-san"" scenes. These segments showcase the real spirit of the show stripped down to its essentials. They reimagine the episode without all the fat, without the self-insert character, divorced from any social context, as a first-person POV one-sided dialogue short à la One Room. It's a format that works. But this was not the choice made, and the final product is merely a coddling vulgarity meant to fill a gaping demand in Japanese culture for domestic and emotional sustenance, abetting unethical work-life balance norms like convenience stores selling clean shirts for office workers unable to return home for the night for the sake of its own existence. Maybe this is ""wholesome"" entertainment for some, but the social implications are too glaring for me to find any iota of worth."
163146,"Intro

This quick review aims to focus primarily on the aspect that has sparked the most discussion since the very first frames of this second season: it’s unacceptable for a manga like Blue Lock to receive such a superficial adaptation.




Plot 8/10

As a manga reader, I really appreciated the idea of dedicating an entire season to the U-20 arc. Even the ""14-episode format"" felt somewhat acceptable, considering the actual length of the events. However, the overall quality made it difficult to enjoy the less significant parts — essentially the entire first half of the season, which only shines in two or three moments.

The real Blue Lock Season 2 only begins with the U-20 match, a well-written arc that seemed almost impossible to ruin... and yet, they almost managed to do so.

Characters 8/10

Though I'm not particularly drawn to Shidou's character, his presence becomes fundamental throughout practically the entire season. In the first episodes, he almost feels like a protagonist, capable of scoring innovative goals and, most importantly, saving the otherwise dull Third Selection. Without him, it would have focused solely on Reo’s new abilities, which would have been underwhelming.

On the downside, Yukimiya and Otoya serve as perfect examples of ""how not to introduce new characters."" Initially presented as the “fresh meat” for this new arc, they ended up being practically irrelevant once their primary playstyles were showcased. The fact that they were ranked in the top six still feels completely unjustified. Karasu, on the other hand, fared a bit better. He was consistently involved in the critical plays against Japan and proved to have a key role in the midfield.

The 8 out of 10 rating is largely thanks to Sae, who remains one of the coolest anime characters in the football genre. However, it’s a shame his plays weren’t properly represented.



Graphics 6/10

We’ve now reached the critical point. I won’t beat around the bush: the animations aren’t always terrible, but they only exist during the key moments of the match against the U-20 national team. At the end of the day, you could say the season was carried entirely by !Nagi’s goal, Shidou’s double!, and the final goal. These goals were, of course, peak in the manga as well, so it’s pretty clear that we can’t excuse the animation studio (or whoever is responsible for this mess) just because they didn’t ruin four scenes in an entire season.

As for the earlier episodes, no one can honestly say the animations were good, because it would be a lie to say the animations existed at all. The only saving grace of the anime, as I mentioned, is a handful of scenes that are so inherently epic that even fan animations manage to do them justice. In my opinion, they butchered so many other goals.

One thing needs to be clarified: adding brighter colors doesn’t equate to “quality"". Please, don’t be fooled so easily, or Season 3 will end up just as lackluster.

Audio 7.5/10

I also have serious complaints about some of the OST choices, which made certain moments downright embarrassing compared to the hype conveyed by the silent panels of the manga. Just take Sae’s very first counterattack as an example—but there are dozens of similar scenes. In my opinion, these moments weren’t ruined, but they certainly weren’t represented to their fullest potential.

The opening, however, earns its respect, and the overall quality in this regard is upheld by solid, if unremarkable, voice acting. Oh, let’s be honest: that “On your knees, Blue Lock” from Kaiser at the end really should have been delivered in proper, satisfying German ;)

img220()

Experience 7.5/10

In conclusion, I have to say I was quite disappointed with this adaptation. Yet, somehow, when you’re a football fan, you find yourself able to watch anything that features a ball. That said, I’d like to highlight how Blue Lock is, without a doubt, one of the most innovative sports anime in recent years. As such, it truly deserves an adaptation worthy of its manga. Hope that something changes with the next season."

 - Odysseas Elytis

""Erotic."" If I had but one word to describe the subject of this review, this is what I would come up with. Of course, some may point towards more popular descriptors, such as ""pornography"" or ""hentai."" But to side with the consensus and deem this show as the trashy intersection between anime and hentai is to disregard well-crafted worldbuilding and thought-provoking commentary. This ambitious project transcends those aforementioned labels and confronts headfirst the very concept of sex itself. Strap in, let's take a light-hearted look into the erotic insights of Ishuzoku Reviewers.





img550()


This never-before-seen analytical framework will aid us in our comprehensive study. Ishuzoku is often misrepresented by what is seen at first glance. But just like the illustration above, there is so much more lying underneath the surface. A tangled web of tangents withholds a series of truths reserved for only the most tenacious and cultured of minds. Due to the sheer scale of our investigation, we'll be unearthing the many insights Ishuzoku has to offer in stages, as we procedurally edge towards a satisfying climax.




img100%()






img100%()


Alright amateurs, let's begin with the basics. Ishuzoku is set in a medieval-fantasy setting, filled with an assortment of magical creatures that live alongside humans. The world is brimming with diversity and magic, and the red-light district is no different. Brothels are run by ""succu-girls"" and cater to all species and desires. With so many places to choose from, each appealing to different tastes, the Interspecies Reviewers have come to the rescue. A gang of day-time adventurers, the Reviewers spend their evenings at various ""succu-joints"" and write about their experiences. Ishuzoku documents their erotic escapades, dedicating much of its runtime to exploring the distinct services succu-girls offer. Where this show differs from your standard TV ecchi is in its explicit depiction of sex.

It's amusing how one small change to the status quo can catch so many weebs off guard. Anime watchers everywhere are no strangers to fan service, yet no one was prepared for what Ishuzoku brought to the table. Far from your standard beach-episode teases and unresolved romantic tension, here we have a mainstream anime series showcasing full-blown sex with prostitutes in every episode. Ishuzoku's brazen antics can get out of hand rather quickly, with intricate setpieces putting most softcore hentai to shame. With all this controversial infamy to its name, surely Ishuzoku really is just a high-budget hentai? Well, not exactly. Media containing pornographic content doesn't necessarily constitute pornography, it all depends on the intent of the work. Theatrical movies with sexual scenes aren't considered pornos, and the same line of thinking extends to Ishuzoku. Aside from the explicitness of the material, the show gives us little reason to believe that sexual stimulation is its sole purpose. Were someone to compile all the NSFW scenes into a highlight reel, they would end up with a decent OVA spanning roughly 20 minutes. But even that conservative estimate would still be less than one-tenth of the series' runtime. At times, Ishuzoku's sex scenes can come across as afterthoughts, when a quick few seconds of a still image and a moaning VA gets squeezed in before the commercial break. One could feasibly repurpose these sequences for personal pleasure. But as we're about to discover, Ishuzoku's ambitions are much higher than that of the average Queen Bee production.

The series must be commended for playing around with its ideas in ways that are equal parts perverted and ingenious. Granted, each sketch can be briefly summarized like so: ""Stunk and the gang sleep with [insert species here]."" But Ishuzoku doesn't need hentai-length sex scenes because it doesn't merely rely on the surface-level juxtaposition of its premise. Instead, the series spends time building detailed environments around its absurd ideas, through the use of creative writing and visuals. Take the first half of Episode 5, for example, in which the Reviewers visit a cyclops succu-joint. The uninitiated patrons try requesting for the most attractive worker available, only for the brothel's receptionist to bring out a cyclops with a disproportionately large eye. As we soon learn, the cyclops are a race which bases their beauty standards on the size of their pupils. This homogeneous value is so ingrained in their culture, to the point where an otherwise conventionally-pretty succu-girl at the joint is characterized as insecure over her relatively small eyeball. Ishuzoku often structures its jokes in this fashion, utilizing the mismatch between expectations and reality as a means of worldbuilding. Every succu-joint is unique, thanks to the cultural practices that define them. Ishuzoku embraces the diversity of its succu-girls and organically integrates implicit worldbuilding into how they carry out their respective services. This leads to novel considerations between both f#cker and f#ck-ee; such as whether two part-time partners have compatible mana (magic) properties, or if a given species (ex. fairies) is able to share intercourse with others in spite of disparate body sizes. These considerations are not readily apparent to the general public, and this makes the Interspecies Reviews rather valuable. Each sketch, our group of writers take turns sharing their subjective experiences. The script takes pains to ensure that each Reviewer's input is valuable and adds to the discussion. Comments offered by these critics are often constructive and open-minded, as the Reviewers offer recommendations based on the preferences of other species. For a show about guys who rate hookers, there is a surprising degree of thought put into executing its R-rated concepts. Ishuzoku's ridiculous ideas feel plausible within the internal logic of the show, without skimping out on the shocking laughs. Humor here is so below-the-belt that you actually get to see what's below the belt (uncensored Ishuzoku is the only way to go.) Production values are superb for a show of such explicit nature, allowing the series to make the most of its setting with fun visual flair. The show is packed with everything from crass metaphors to pop-culture references. Each unique succu-joint feels alive, in large part due to the fluid animation and visual effects. At times, Ishuzoku pushes the boundaries of what the staff could get away with on broadcast television; I recall few memories in my life as vividly as the image of a gelatinous slime-girl stimulating another female's genitalia from the inside-out through her mouth. Ishuzoku is easily a treat for the eyes, while bearing some nuance alongside bare breasts. We'll talk more about the show's creative commentary in due time, but first we'll cover a few brief observations about our entertaining cast.



img100%()


Keeping in line with the themes of diversity and personal preferences, our resident reviewers are simple characters that come from a variety of backgrounds. Stunk, the head honcho, is a rugged human adventurer. He traded his life of comfort as a lord's son for one of quests and casual debauchery. Zel is an elven mage who accompanies Stunk on his many trips. Being several hundred years old, he greatly dislikes sleeping with ladies older than him, instead choosing to spend his time with more ""youthful"" succu-girls due to their mana properties (even if they happen to be elderly human women.) Recurring cast members include Kanchal, a halfling with a thing for BDSM, and Brooz, a brooding beastman. As mentioned before, each of their reviews act as a great resource for other potential patrons. These Reviewers lend just enough of their subjective viewpoints so that their voices feel distinct, while paying enough mind to others' taste. As an amateur reviewer myself, it's a delicate balance that I appreciate greatly and intend to accomplish with my current and future projects.

Easily the most fascinating character of the bunch is Crimvael. Stunk and Zel first encounter Crim while on one of their regular quests, and decide to take him under their wing. Crim is an angel who broke his halo and is stranded on Earth until it heals. The angel embodies both divinity and purity, as evidenced by his childlike innocence and delicate demeanor. Crim's halo is an open-ended metaphor, and I greatly appreciate the ambiguity presented. One may see that as a symbol of the degradation of morals, and how a life of sex corrupts this impressionable fallen angel. On the other hand, I believe that the halo represents a lack of direction not dissimilar to those often encountered in the midst of pubescent adolescence. Adding to this interpretation is the reveal that Crim possesses both male and female genitalia. Hermaphrodites are a rather rare fixture in anime. This element in Crim's writing very likely references Gren, a character featured in Sessions 11 & 12 of Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop. Fun fact, the creator actually acknowledges this homage during an interview with the reputable anime-journalism outlet, Clickhole:

Returning to the topic at hand, Crim's sexual duality further informs us of his spiritual uncertainty. In order to remedy this internal conflict, Ishuzoku posits that Crim's solution is to partake in sex as a means of self-discovery. This is a very bold position for the show to take, and is elaborated further in my favorite episode, which we'll be discussing now.

Man and Woman have historically found it impossible to understand one another. Each brings a different set of skills and sensibilities to the table. Both ends have long desired to see what things are like from the other side of the fence, and Ishuzoku decides to tackle this age-long ambiguity in Episode 3. Stunk and his partners-in-sex visit a succu-joint which offers temporary gender reassignment. By consuming magic potions, the boys will no longer be boys, instead turning into females. This sketch is evidently a homage to Beyoncé smash-hit song, ""If I Were a Boy,"" in which she muses about being in a man's body, even just for a day. Ishuzoku gives the singer a writing credit for the episode, as you can tell from this 100% credible screenshot:

Ishuzoku's ingenious writing shines through in this arc. Early-on, the show explains that our converted critics are unable to leave the premises, due to past instances of customers having intercourse with other men who are unaware of their true gender. Instead, consenting succu-girls from partnering succu-joints would have to come down. The script does a great job of establishing in-world problems and providing feasible solutions, which is further proof that the series is more than just a hentai. The gang then proceed to have lesbian sex with a variety of different dominant succu-girls, leading to some naughty setpieces (the slime-girl sequence comes to mind.)

Crim gets a good dose of character exploration here. Upon taking the gender potions, the male genitalia recede in place of female features. Things were no different for the angel; as a predominant male, Crim was left with only his female half. While the other Reviewers were enjoying feeling themselves up, Crim was eager to properly explore a different side of his being. As documented in his review, he was greatly appreciative of the opportunity to let his partner take the proverbial wheel, and come to terms with a part of his identity mostly hidden by his enormous phallus. The hyena succu-girl Crim spends the night with turns out to be one of his favorites, because of the beautiful soul-searching that accompanied the sex. Seeing such magic leave a sizable impression on our fallen angel makes me wish that the potion existed in real life. I imagine that the potion would be a therapeutic means of coping with gender dysmorphia, or a risk-free approach to understanding what it's like to transition. Ishuzoku defining sex as a means of self-discovery is a recurring theme throughout every sketch, emphasizing the importance of diversity and trying new things. It's a powerful, optimistic message, and one that continues to develop in subsequent instalments.

With all this heavy subtext worth exploring, it might be easy to forget how capable Ishuzoku is of satisfying our carnal cravings. In Episode 4, the Reviewers stop by a succu-joint situated near a volcano. It's a restaurant run by a salamander, offering grilled meats and steamy sex. The girl is flaming hot in more ways than one, as her body naturally emits high temperatures. Crim is the only member with enough heat-resistance to sleep with her, but that doesn't mean the rest of the Reviewers are completely left out to dry. Instead, the gang are treated to a fun reinvention of a barbeque dine-in, feasting on dishes cooked on the salamander's bare body. Aside the idea of fresh beef being coated in fluids not typically associated with cooking, Ishuzoku is bringing life to a real-life practice rooted in Japanese culture. Dating back as early as the Edo Period in the 1600s, nyotaimori or ""body sushi"" is a very different sashimi-eating experience. Nyotaimori parties involve near-nude models lying still for hours at a time, as guests eat off their bodies. It's a tradition that persists today, now mostly reserved for the rich. There's no sex involved in this transaction, but is primarily a culinary experience blending sensuality and fine-dining. But enough talk about eating food off a model. What if you wanted something more intimate than that - partaking in a piece of another person?


In Episode 7, the Reviewers decided to find out what entering an egg-laying amphitheatre was like. The succu-joint in question isn't quite a brothel like others in the past, with girls laying eggs in front of an enthusiastic live audience. Guests can then bid on the freshly-laid eggs, presumably for personal consumption. It's one of the few Ishuzoku sketches that doesn't feature intercourse, which initially was quite puzzling to watch. Stunk and the gang weren't too hyped about the whole thing either, having come here on a whim. It's immediately apparent that watching creatures laying eggs isn't exactly the most exciting prospect for most patrons looking for some ""action."" And yet, the performance still finds fervent fans in mer-men and reptilian audiences, as they cheer on one of the penguin-girls for laying more eggs than expected. The atmosphere was a largely positive one, and leaves us with a convincing example of how fandoms function. Fandoms are defined by a group of individuals with a strong shared interest for a specific object or person. Nowadays the term ""fandom"" can come with negative  connotations, which can be justified given the prevalence of abnormal behavior. Purchasing weird forms of produce certainly isn't an idea exclusive to the world of anime; on July 1st, 2019, infamous Internet star Belle Delphine sparked wide-spread controversy by selling her used bath water online. I'm not denying that fandoms can look strange. I'm also not suggesting that this show advocates for the more harmful implications that result from the parasocial relationships developed between fan and public figure (i.e. unhealthy expectations and unruly behavior from fans, mental duress on celebrities, etc.) Instead, Ishuzoku chooses to paint the topic in an optimistic light. Watching people hatching eggs is about as niche an interest as it gets, and services that supply this demand are consequently tough to come by. Being able to enjoy something in spite of its relative unpopularity adds a degree of passion and admiration for the unsung heroes who made that something possible. Novelty can deepen a fan's relationship with a person or object, and that's really cool. Ishuzoku celebrates the idea of finding something that individuals enjoy on a personal level, and such a message could not be more relevant today.

In Episode 2, Stunk bumps into a representative of the Demon Political Party. He requests the Reviewers to drop by and make an article of their local brothels. The race is largely frowned upon in the public eye, perhaps due to implied national attritions afflicted during an earlier time in history (the Japan allegories are somewhat strong with this one.) The demon delegate informs the audience that he aims to change the general perception of the race, and aims to do so by stimulating tourism with the aid of a good review score. What Ishuzoku tells us here is very interesting: that sex can be used as a tool to pursue discrete agendas which are far larger in scale than the simple set-up of two people spending the night together.

Once again, Ishuzoku is best understood by exploring its place of origin. It's an open secret that Japan is one of the least sexually-active nations in the world, which has led to declining birth rates that have only continued to plummet in recent years. The idea of relationships and courting within the country is often perceived as ""troublesome,"" a sentiment spawning from a [stringent work culture and religious ideals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex). But the culture is shifting towards developing a greater interest in sex. After all, there's a good reason for why love hotels contribute nearly 40 million USD to the national economy! [This fascinating documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fso4yjbgceY) gives insight into the different ways love hotels convince customers to stay as long as possible, with several amenities and pricing options to choose from. Love hotels call to mind another sketch in Episode 11, where the gang visit an enticing leprechaun succu-joint. It's a tourist trap which offers a free flow of alcohol and the company of chicks to say ""Cheers"" with, turning out massive profits in the process. The show makes an effort to tell us about the joint's stoic bartender, who tallies a long bill each time that a customer touches a girl. Similarly, love hotels offer cheap alternatives to other business accommodations by offering low hourly rates, before ramping up prices through additional services. But the most enticing attribute of these establishments are a much-appreciated sense of anonymity and privacy. Not only do the businesses manage to make plenty of money, but the customers receive a peace of mind, which can have a positive impact on how the public view sex. I believe the series does a fantastic job of demonstrating how the sex industry can affect culture and operate in a commercial bubble.

A large chunk of Ishuzoku is devoted to exploring future possibilities of sex through the fictional sandbox of its inventive world. Let's do a ""lightning round"" of sorts, quickly going through the various topics and their real-life implications:

- In Episode 10, the Reviewers visit the Magic Metropolis, a polished city disguised as one big succu-joint, even though there are no brothels in sight. After paying a low flat fee, customers get to receive a 3-day session with a succu-girl. It's an all-access pass with food, accommodation, an escort/tour service around the city, and so much more (intercourse is on the table, of course.) This is because every succu-girl is a clone, modelled after the looks and personality of the Archmage Demia. Not only was this one of the more entertaining plotlines introduced in the show, but it also posed some serious implications. Public figures could hypothetically profit off their own bodies, either through cloning technology or the more-feasible application of deepfakes. A.I. has been making it easier to superimpose one individual's face onto another. With the technology for that being readily available, people are taking notice of the ethical conundrums deepfakes present. The stand against the practice began with [Reddit banning r/deepfakes in 2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16982046/reddit-deepfakes-ai-celebrity-face-swap-porn-community-ban), and tech companies are developing resources to detect and prevent deepfakes from happening without consent. Issues of identity theft, manipulation and other ethical concerns stem from this realm of possibility, making this an interesting subject to keep an eye out on. Ishuzoku itself does a great job of establishing solutions to these issues that make sense in-universe.

- In Episode 6, Stunk and his crew visit a golem joint. Initially it sounds like the Reviewers wouldn't be the only ones rock-hard, but the appeal does manage to surprise the viewer. Rather than sleeping with sentient stone monsters, the ""golems"" are actually sex-dolls that have yet to turn sentient. Customers can customize their desired sex partner, before magic turns them into realistic replicas that's close to the real deal. Hilarity ensues when the gang all choose to design their dolls after a waitress in the pub they frequent, which does leave some sobering thoughts about whether it's permissible to bypass consent with this service. Similar to the Magic Metropolis episode, the theme of customizable sex persists throughout the sketch. If that is the desired end goal of the industry, how far could companies take this concept?

- In the final episode of the series, the gang visit a mysterious succu-joint on New Year's Day, only to find that the succu-girls from past escapades have met up in one place. The gang proceed to enjoy the ""first f#ck"" of the year with their favorite girls thanks to this cool happenstance. As it turns out, the succu-joint is run by dream-eaters, who make simulations generated from customers' past memories. Once more, there are some really interesting questions to ponder on. Would the allure of better times hold us back from making new experiences in the present? What if this cool hobby turns into an unhealthy addiction that leads to disillusions in real life? Is the perfect permutation of sex paramount to its utter obsolecence? What would a civilization chained to its memories look like? Would we find purpose in anything? Heck, can we find purpose in this satirical overblown review that I'm putting up on the Internet??? OH god the questions are making my head hurt my hea-

Hi, Real Dweeb here. Apologies for this experience so far, a really convincing imposter decided to kidnap me in order to put together a half-baked thesis about Ishuzoku. He didn't live to finish his review, due to just how many contrived questions he attempted to introduce. However, he did leave this message behind in his notes, which should be the conclusion to this strange saga. I think I owe it to you all to leave the raw summation here:

> Ishuzoku, for all its brazen innuendo, is ultimately a call to action. Sex represents personal pleasures, and those desires vary from person-to-person. Whether you're cisgender, bisexual, or even asexual; Ishuzoku urges us to find ourselves in the things we enjoy. The show is not free of caveats. Much like the medieval setting, the show feels antiquated and primitive, due to its reckless objectification of women. Furthermore, it paints prostitution in a wholly-positive manner, paying no mind to the idea that some people have no say in whether or not they want to choose this line of work. Finally, the argument Ishuzoku provides is single-minded and simplistic, with claims that sex is the only means of exploring one's self. While there is still room for improvement, it's also a good place to begin discussions. Ishuzoku will always be a pioneer in the world of anime, not only with its brazen content, but with its powerful message. The series encourages all of us to seek out our desires, and find our true selves along the way. For when we do discover who we really are, does there exist a truer Heaven? Live young, free & hard - let's go to Paradise.

Jeez, what a weirdo.

OK real talk now, I want to take this final portion of the review to be completely transparent. Even if you found any of these ironic observations remotely convincing, I admit that much of it was rather hyperbolic and exaggerated. Believing my points is a lot like me putting a condom over my massive reviewer chin-chin - it's a bit of a stretch. With that confession out of the way, believe me when I say that I really did have a fairly good time watching this series.

Within the anime community, Ishuzoku doesn't appear to get its fair due as a show. The MAL vote-brigading antics of YouTuber Nux Taku is a major culprit. Despite Lord Nuxanor's best intentions, the notoriety of his prank on Funimation and MAL far overshadowed the show's own merits, cementing this series' general perception as a seasonal Meme-of-the-Month. Ishuzoku's fate is a [prime example of how pushing personal agendas by artificially inflating numbers can distract from constructive discourse surrounding anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfcUkr0RaeQ). Adding to this are the (ahem) loads of taboo content, which led the uninitiated (myself included) to dismiss the show as formulaic trash. Only after putting these negative stigmas aside did I come to understand how thoroughly enjoyable the Interspecies experience was. Pretty much all of the comedy was overtly sexual, but I can't deny that the shocking punchlines were more effective than those of other comedies. I was prepared to write half-hearted BS as a meme, but the show's abundant creativity gave me so much material to work with, while inspiring me to double-down with some cheeky nonsense of my own. The production values are not to be sniffed at either, and I salute the production committee crazy (and cultured) enough to make this happen. Ishuzoku impressed with a novel comedic concept, despite my typical disdain for pervy fan-service. Even if ecchi's not up your alley, I'd say that Ishuzoku's execution is more entertaining than most, and highly encourage you to give the first 2 episodes a try. Who knew I'd end up with a genuinely good time, Nice. 6.9/10

166794,"A Sign of Affection is rather trite shoujo fare that ends up suffering from many of the pitfalls the genre-demographic is known for while doing little to differentiate itself. Despite the characters being university aged, the show is still very much shoujo rather than josei with its storytelling and themes. Instead of any real examination of the characters like one would expect given they are all entering adulthood, it is still intent on idealising partners and relationships which at best leaves everything painfully shallow. The main gimmick, for lack of a more precise and polite term, of having a deaf viewpoint character does not amount to much. Although it is unreasonable to expect entertainment to have the same depth and advocacy as a non-fiction think piece, A Sign of Affection still feels inadequate since it gives only passing attention to other elements of the experience beyond sign language. Much of the show’s efforts are instead invested in appearances, mild juvenile drama and the fluff of the relationship. While this is pleasant enough to watch, there is still little in the way of connection or chemistry between the characters beyond looks and surface level gestures. It leaves little to sell this as a mature relationship or evoke a strong response in the audience. What is present quickly becomes saccharine and at times even jarring with how much of the framing appears more appropriate for early high schoolers. There are some dubious moments and dynamics between the characters, but those are more so the product of the usual idealisation of romance instead of anything genuinely egregious or distasteful. A Sign of Affection ends up lacking too much to be anything more than passable as a change of pace or first-time introduction to the genre, both of which are highly relative experiences that cannot be used to speak to its absolute quality.

While A Sign of Affection does not bill itself as a josei series, the setting and framing of the show by its text does necessarily set up the idea that it will be more mature about its approach to romance. If anything, it necessitates this since it is presenting itself as a grounded series, the believability of which then hinges even more on the relationships between characters reflecting something closer to reality. In this, the relationship the show attempts to present between Yuki and Itsuomi feels incredibly shallow, lacking the meaning or connection a more mature narrative usually strives for as the whole point of its existence. Much of the relationship between them is built upon gestures of physical affection like holding hands on being pat on the head, something that might understandably be awe-inspiring for younger teenagers but represents only a surface level attraction to older you get. Even if one does argue this is true to life, that there are many of such shallow relationships, it is simply not a compelling narrative to watch two people infatuated with each other because of their appearances while framing it as if it is something deeper. To be fair, Yuki’s naïve and sheltered outlook is believable given her disability drastically changing the experience she had growing up. Though this seems to merely be used as a justification for the very tired and poorly employed shoujo trope of having the male love interest take the initiative with everything for the benefit of a female protagonist. The attraction, even fantasy, of this dynamic is plain to see, and there is nothing necessarily wrong or off-putting about it. Yet A Sign of Affection does not do anything interesting with this or give it any additional depth or richness above what is found in most mediocre shoujo narratives.

Part of this is due to how heavily the show plays into this dynamic with a vast majority of the initiative being left with Itsuomi, which is then compounded by the narrative choosing to have him as a walking mystery box. While there is some merit to this characterisation and framing, with some other shows arguably giving too much away about their non-point of view characters too soon, it makes him almost utterly opaque to the audience. There is little understanding as to why Itsuomi has feelings for Yuki beyond her appearance, with even a grandiose declaration in the latter half of the season being ironically substanceless when one thinks about the contents of what was actually said. This is not to say there must be some “rational” justification for romantic feelings, but alternatively there is an almost complete lack of chemistry between Yuki and Itsuomi which demonstrates these feelings as some kind of innate connection. Much of this is done to play towards the fantasy of a mysterious guy swooping in to take the lead in the relationship combined with Yuki’s shy and passive character making everything feel stiff. There is a certain endearing and even sweet element to this, but it is still all surface level interactions that cannot be the convincing core of a relationship. If love is admiration, there is nothing much beyond looks until the very end where the show only then starts showing some basis of chemistry and emotional connection between them.

There is the incredibly nebulous implication that Itsuomi’s connection with language is what draws him to Yuki and that there is something more expressive and genuine about her precisely because she has to communicate so much non-verbally. Though this is frankly a viewer trying to assume a plausible and logical theme instead of a strong inference that A Sign of Affection sets up for itself. To the show’s credit, there is some intelligent use of cinematography and diegetic sound, or in this case the lack there of, to demonstrate how different her perspective is. But most of these are the obvious means of trying to convey deafness to a viewer instead of any truly striking moments. The narrative elements are also not particularly graceful with Itsuomi polyglot talents feeling more like character trivia to make him more appealing and a justification for him being able to pick up sign language quickly. This is part of a larger pattern of frequently mentioning pieces of character information that could amount to something more complex but is then never tying any of it together. It leaves a lot of these instances feeling like they are one note attempts at characterisation that clumsily serve no additional or deeper purposes. There is little that intentionally hints towards Itsuomi’s love or affinity for language stemming from his desire to communicate or understand someone, and correspondingly there is little indication that Yuki yearns to be understood. The show is ripe for these connections, but for most of it feels like the viewer filling in massive blanks using genre expectations for the benefit of the show instead of being provided the means to see some kind of deeper depth or potential. The show eventually does present a surface level summary of this idea, but it is treated as a capstone of sorts that is literally told to the viewer instead of demonstrated these past twelve episodes. This ends up feeling much more like a retroactive justification than something that can be seen prior to this in smaller actions that built up to the moment. It is convincing enough when paired with the eventual semblance of chemistry at the very end of the season, but it feels more engineered than expressed by the writers.

In fact, all this even prompts this bizarre idea in the viewer to view Itsuomi with suspicion given how little is known about him and how surface level his attraction seems to be. While no show should reveal everything about their characters the moment they are introduced, the extent of mystery and opaqueness around Itsuomi feels inappropriate since it is normally used as a tool to build and highlight tension around the unknowns of the character. With the only thing known about Itsuomi being that he is a polyglot globetrotter, an astute viewer wonders if he is just using Yuki as a means to learn sign language given the show mentions how difficult it is to retain proficiency in a language without someone to speak to. The tone and framing of the show as a feel-good, idealistic shoujo romance end up clashing heavily with the what the actual text relays to the audience. Again, this could ironically be something the show might have unwittingly set up with how many of its more thematic ideas just exist in isolation from each other. Yet it still raises the issue how suspect a lot of this would appear if the viewer were not privy to Yuki’s perspective and thoughts.

This mismatch is unfortunately common in a lot of media, shoujo in particular, that idealises relationships while trying to extract drama from a conflict. Many of these dramatic gestures, and occasional petty antagonism when the love triangle is involved, often end up coming off as rather dubious when the framing and veneer of the show is peeled back. This is most apparent in episode 4 where Itsuomi and Oushi have their first confrontation. Much can be said about the trite and somewhat petulant characterisation of Oushi, which does not do the show any favours either since it is a transparent attempt to set up an obvious loser in the love triangle. However, despite the show framing him as the immature, inferior choice who has squandered his relationship with Yuki, it also tells the viewer directly that he is a known quantity who is familiar with her and does care about her wellbeing. While Oushi’s behaviour and suspicions about Itsuomi are framed as prejudice, petty jealousy or at worst being a tiny bit possessive, the actual text shows him to have rather justified suspicions. In their first confrontation of sorts, Itsuomi prevents Yuki from reading Oushi’s lips during their brief argument. Although we are told she is not alarmed by this and is internally comfortable around Itsuomi’s presence despite her stiff outward appearance, one cannot help but be astounded by how this would look from anyone else’s perspective. Itsuomi would appear as if he is attempting to isolate Yuki from someone she knows in a rather sinister manner by using his physical presence. It’s certainly not the same as strong arming someone, but it is still depriving her of the knowledge of Oushi’s points and letting her decide for herself. This is somehow worse than having a trite and juvenile argument breakout over Yuki since at least that cheap display of drama would have her aware of what was happening. Though it was not as if the rest of the show lends much importance to her agency either, framing talking like she is not present or Itsuomi being her spokesperson as nothing to be perturbed about. While likely none of this was the intent of the writer since later episodes have unambiguously affectionate moments between Yuki and Itsuomi, this is an extremely blatant example of the show’s framing not matching its contents. It makes one wonder how much of A Sign of Affection is being propped up by being framed from Yuki’s perspective and giving the viewer access to her thoughts. It gives the impression that if this were told from a male perspective like Itsuomi, it would come off much less favourably with many actions appearing presumptuous, ignoring Yuki’s agency or opinions, or even as petty bravado in the few confrontations between men the show has.

It did not necessarily have to be this way since the show sets up a reasonable premise and inciting incident for Yuki’s infatuation with Itsuomi. In a world where most people are callous about the difficulties faced by the disabled, it is easy to see how someone more idealistic like Yuki would be deeply moved by Itsuomi’s act of kindness. The problem is then that the series does very little to explore anything about the experience of being deaf or any of the challenges or unique experiences of being in a relationship where one person has a disability. There is only lip service paid to some of these elements like the challenge and even danger of lacking situational awareness due to being deaf, or how difficult it makes it to find employment. Most of the time these seem to amount to almost a checklist of sorts, quickly brushed aside to return focus to the romance instead of being used to explore anything about a core part of this show’s premise. And at worst, they feel like an excuse to have Itsuomi show his care and concern for Yuki by gallantly pulling her away from danger. Again, the idea or fantasy of this scenario is understandable and there is nothing inherently wrong with it, but it cannot help but feel a bit cheap with how little effort is placed into examining anything else around being deaf. It is certainly unreasonable to expect the show to be some kind of primer on the experiences of the deaf, but it has reached the point where it could be argued that Yuki’s deafness is a mere accessory or an aesthetic to a trite love story, hardly a praiseworthy impression to make. 

Ironically, the show does set up an interesting opportunity to explore its premise, just with a character it seems to have no interest in beyond being drama fodder, Oushi. A Sign of Affection does a surprisingly good job of building up the complexity in his character despite it being barebones with every other member of the supporting cast. The show demonstrates an uncharacteristic level of subtlety when it points out that beneath his prickly and petulant behaviour towards Yuki, he did learn sign language to communicate with her. The show later complicates this further by giving the viewer some insight into his reluctance to simply be nice to Yuki in that he does not want to give the impression he is doing it out of pity or pulling his punches so to speak because she has a disability. This even has the potential to make the shoujo dynamic of a shy and reserved protagonist interesting since it would introduce another layer of complication to a relationship with a disabled person. While a more fiery character might see through the rough exterior and come to appreciate being treated “normally”, it raises the question of how a gentle character responds to this and if Oushi might be doing it more for himself and what he views as patronising instead of what Yuki as an individual would like to see from him. This all sounds quite compelling and involves actually exploring ideas around disability and having it be a major part of a relationship, yet the show is far from realising this. Like many other shoujo series, it has the problem of the losing leg of the love triangle being the most compelling character but having the least narrative presence. Often because they are the only one with flaws that could give them any depth and are placed in the position of most conflict which inherently gives them the most interesting choices to make. Even if it does eventually elaborate on this exact idea, it speaks more a misguided mentality of saving “the good stuff” for later when it should put its best foot forward and further problematise its ideas from there. Instead, what we have now is A Sign of Affection relying heavily on fluff and the human mystery box of Itsuomi. Ultimately, all this will be too little too late with how much the show currently hinges on a surface level relationship, taking a whole season to set up what should have been its baseline themes and dynamics.

Overall, A Sign of Affection has the barest inkling of interesting ideas while being almost an overwhelmingly trite shoujo narrative. It does little to justify its premise of having a deaf protagonist, though it is certainly not to the point of being egregious, harmful or even fetishistic like some detractors have alleged. Most of the shortcomings stem from issues that can be found throughout shoujo such as having a passive protagonist instead of something unique to having a deaf character. Though what is a problem particular to this show is that despite the grounded and mature image it presents with its university aged cast, it is still intent of being more parts idealising or fantasizing instead of a real yet sanguine look at relationships. With little in the way of connection or chemistry in our lead’s relationship, and little exploration into the premise of a deaf character, it is hard to give this show more than a 5 out of 10. It is still an endearing enough watch, and it might show some depth eventually, but it is simply lacking too much to be considered anything more than a mediocre shoujo entry. None of that is meant to disparage shoujo but is more so an indication of how far the titans of the genre have surpassed this level of storytelling."
185,"""Initial D is a good series. Please give it a try. Don't let it die as a ""good meme"", it deserves more than that."" - some random ass dude in the youtube comments.



Not often does it happen, that the running gag of a series overthrows the show's presence as a whole, but Initial D has done it. The reputation and general popularity it has among the Japanese community couldn't transfer to the West, but it has gained some sort of exposure over the last few years. Exposure that came in form of an unmissable Deja-Vu and car-crashing meme, which was undoubtedly hilarious at first. However, this gain of popularity only marginally increased the number of people actually watching the series, which I think is a grave mistake. It speaks volumes that the YT-comment mentioned above receives only a fiftieth of the amount of likes the top-comments obtain, which only talked about the meme or how hype this song is (which it is, no question about it). Unsurprisingly, having the image of an ultimate joke of a series in my head before starting to watch it out of pure boredom was inevitable for me, but the ride was substantially different to what I expected. Not that it wasn't hilarious and over the top, which was already proven by the time episode 1 ended, but it had more to offer. More to offer in form of solidly implemented character ambitions, naturally developing relations and dynamics, an overall great eye for its audiovisual style and a lovable cast of background characters, which round the experience up by quite a lot.

Each progressive race tends to lessen the overwhelming grip of the meme surrounding your mind and creates a continuously more exciting time as it progresses. Actual thrills and goosebump moments appear, something that was not to be expected, judging by the start of the series. However, the show's style itself doesn't change, the involvement tends to increase drastically as Initial D progresses. It's more than obvious on which aspect the show gradually improves upon and that aspect lies in its character department. Takumi, the resident protagonist and spaced-out teenager, and his dynamics with his friends and love-interest Mogi undergo various simple, but effective little steps. More prominently, his initial rejection of the street-racing scene despite his massive talent promoted by his father doesn't simply change for the better, his mindset gradually develops over time and he naturally grows on each opponent. Of course, that alone isn't an absolute milestone of good writing, but it's a decent foundation and definitely supports the anime's quality. You can really feel through the little interactions he has with his father and Mogi, that a change of mind about a certain aspect influences multiple sides of him and doesn't feel isolated in his character development.

Without Takumi, character development feels a little dry. I'd actually say it's non-existent most of the time. Not that it necessarily has to be a thing, as the rest of the cast and his eventual rivals take a backseat most of the when time their arc ends, they're still prevalent from time to time and it feels good to see them again. Knowing that its source material is a huge long-running manga, one season of an anime adaption can only do so much naturally.

Speaking about its long-running source material and subject at hand, comparing it to long-running sports series like Hajime no Ippo or Haikyuu is inevitable. They share a lot of similarities, but Initial D takes advantage in shifting the focus from school-life to the much more stylish and underused street-racing scene. It actually manages to get the underground racing scene right in terms of style and mentality, which contributes a lot to its visual appeal, mainly through character designs, outfits, and little details at the side. The character designs, in particular, look sick as hell and benefit from it's western influence for sure. Without those and some of its self-aware ridiculousness during its racing scenes, there wouldn't be a way to really defend it from looking horrible at times. The good use of lightning and darker colors during its adrenaline-fueled night races on different mountain passes is accompanied by its CGI, which is barely an optimal display of animation skills and feels more like a PSP game. Thankfully, it was hardly bothering me at the start and it was easy to get used to as time progressed, due to the overall solid directing during climaxes.

What actually makes these racing scenes as thrilling and furious to watch is the soundtrack, which originated the original Initial D meme through its ingenious choice of basically reviving Eurobeat. It's hype as hell and I don't care when anyone says it doesn't fit, as it clearly does complement the series' ridiculousness in that aspect. It's impossible for me to imagine a world without the howls of engines, the squealing of tires overtwisting and flashy headlights going down the streets without cheesy, overblown dance music in the background. It is that memorable, be it in an ironic or unironic way. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. Don't even @ me.

Conclusion:

Initial D was a solid surprise in quality, but it was more than a solid surprise to me personally. I subscribed to its style in almost an instant. Be it because of its stylish exterior, meme-worthy musical choices, bits and pieces of actually great character development or its wholesome dynamics as a whole, Initial D has managed to get a sweet spot in my favorites. It was almost like it somehow delivered a full-package without me asking for it. For fans of sports anime or avid fans of racing in general, Initial D is a notable thing to look out for. It has its fair share of problems, it tends to lose some momentum from time to time, but it also has a full-package of charm within it, waiting to be unwrapped.


At the end of the day, the main thing I wanted to get out with this review is: Goddamn it, quit memeing with Initial D related stuff and get to frickin' watch it, you might find something that fits your taste perfectly.

101310,"If you've watched Zetsuen no Tempest, you'll know that anime adaptations of Shakespearean works are nothing new. But Boarding School Juliet appears to pay homage to its inspiration purely at the surface level - the anime as a whole seems little different from most other generic romantic comedies of its ilk. It's a straightforward, unabashed dash towards the finish line, comprising a barrage of characters that constantly get bounced off the impregnable relationship between the two destined lovers, coupled with a dogged unwillingness to stray from the beaten path despite its potentially fascinating concept.

Ultimately, the show's stubborn refusal to commit to one of comedy or romance means that it ends up being neither, a slipshod amalgamation of poor pacing and uninspiring cast members that relies on its excellent audiovisual spectacle to keep viewers entertained. This vagueness of narrative culminates in a climactic final battle that is both farcical and unsatisfying in equal proportion, which fittingly sums up Boarding School Juliet in general. The series can be - and surprisingly often is - good fun, but the lack of overall adventure and ambition comes back to bite it in the posterior.

(Ratings for each aspect of the anime are given in brackets.)

Premise (3/5): Dahlia Academy is composed of two school houses: one that represents the country of Touwa, the quintessential traditionalist caricature of Japan; and one that represents the Principality of West, a.k.a. a puritan and bastardized microcosm of Western, and in particular English, culture. The school serves as a proxy battlefield of sorts for their host countries, which are only held apart by a tenuous peace treaty. The respective dorms engage in regular, fruitless skirmishes in order to decide a ""victor"", despite the fact that there's really nothing on the line except for quasi-nationalist pride.

The more the events of the story unfold, the less the anime resembles a rehashing of Romeo and Juliet, and the more it feels like some of Shakespeare's other works - particularly Much Ado About Nothing, which shares Boarding School Juliet's emphases on initially opposed lovers, jealousy and betrayal, sibling problems, and the notion of a big deal being made out of what essentially amounts to nothing in the eyes of outside observers. Everything about the premise screams absurd comedy, so it inevitably feels quite jarring whenever the story tries to take itself seriously. Nevertheless, the setting is fascinating enough on its own, though the rest of the anime doesn't exactly do it many favors.


The beginning of something special... or not much in particular.

Characters (1/5): The conflict that lies within the genesis of any romantic comedy spawns from, amongst other things, the standardization of its characters. A rom-com must in some way kowtow to the array of cliches laid out for it, otherwise it would not be able to draw on what attracts people to rom-coms in the first place. Yet if it doesn't try to experiment with those characters, you get the constantly creeping sense that you've seen it all before, and that there's nothing more worth watching.

Boarding School Juliet's characters are bestowed with some color by the quaintness of the story's premise, but outside of that they're exactly as bland as you would expect them to be. Inuzuka Romio is the strong, hard-headed, awkward beast of a man that you would want to lead a dorm house called ""Black Doggies""; Juliet Persia is the petite, blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty who can do everything you ask of her - except, of course, for cooking. Surprise, surprise! Char and Hasuki are the envious childhood friends whose unspoken loves for their targets of affection are doomed to remain forever unrequited. Scott is the devoted, self-appointed servant who transforms into little more than cannon fodder by the end of the show. Inuzuka Airu is the older brother whose straight-arrow approach to everything estranges him from his sibling. And so on, and so forth.

The love between Romio and Juliet blossoms inexplicably out of years of conflict, though those years of conflict in themselves are barely explored at all, whether via flashbacks or other indirect means. Persia mouths vaguely about wanting to change the world in order to please her father (or whatever her motivations are supposed to be), and Inuzuka haphazardly goes along with it. It's the sort of thing that would only feel inspiring if it had any substance to back it up, and there's regrettably a clear dearth of any such foundation in this series. Above all, what the characterization suffers from most is a lack of development - each and every character remains essentially the same person throughout, with little room for elaboration or transformation save for the shallow and superficial realization of mutual love.

The more I go on, the less interesting it gets... and that's exactly the feeling I had as the cast eventually revealed themselves in full. When you've seen it all, you've really seen it all.


Love isn't blind, but it sure is myopic.

Audiovisuals (4/5): Even though the characters are for the most part monochromatic puppets with no redeeming qualities, you really have to hand it to the animators for making their designs look appealing. Persia, in particular, is one of the cutest-looking creatures in recent memory. Everything she does, from her elegant strides to her puffy pouts, reflects her personality - and her emotional turmoil - to a tee. The minimal fanservice is relatively tasteful; the background art is of an average quality for an anime, which means it's pretty damn good. The action sequences are quite well-done for a comedy series, although many scenes suffer from ""single-frame syndrome"", where a single picture is displayed for ten seconds whilst the sounds of people yelling and beating the shit out of each other blare out from the background. Still, you can only go so far with the budget you're given, and Boarding School Juliet does a good enough job with the visuals.

The soundtrack has a few nice touches to it - if I'm not mistaken, one of the tracks is an approximate rendition of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet ballad - though it isn't always appropriately used, with dramatic scenes sometimes being overlaid with comedic music and vice versa. The OP is by fripSide, so it's guaranteed to be a good listen; the ED I admittedly didn't pay much attention to. Overall, the audiovisuals are the standout point of the series, fulfilling their roles and then some.


Visually comedic where it needs to be.

Execution (2/5): It's hard to fuck up a rom-com if you don't try to do anything special - read ""stupid"" - and throw the whole show off balance. In this sense, Boarding School Juliet is the least fucked-up rom-com I've watched in a long while. But given how weird and abnormal the premise appears to be, it just doesn't feel right that the overall narrative structure reads like an algorithm. Inuzuka and Persia go from one tribulation to another in exactly the same fashion, with Inuzuka trying too hard to please Persia and inevitably screwing up, but somehow making Persia fall for him even harder in the process. It's all give-and-go, all rinse-and-repeat. It would be harsh to say that this is an example of lazy storytelling, but a rom-com should never give off such a lackluster aura.

In the end, this show feels like Much Ado About Nothing in name just as in substance - it's a stream of pointless, mindless misunderstandings that fail to really get the story's feet off the ground. As with many rom-coms, Boarding School Juliet tries to make mountains out of molehills in order to make you laugh, but if you keep digging in the same spot, you eventually run out of things to excavate. The humor in isolation is good, and I did enjoy the show when it was actually being funny, which happened more often than this review might make it sound. Unfortunately, the series peters out with a whimper after its cringeworthy climax, and its strengths are ultimately somewhat forgotten.

Thus without a kiss, Boarding School Juliet dies.


Much ado about nothing, indeed.


(As an aside, I anticipate that this review will be downvoted into hell because people don't appreciate it when you criticize their favorite cookie-cutter rom-coms that totally aren't carbon copies of a million other different shows. To that end, all I have to say is: ""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet."")"
120646,"English Version:
My senpai is annoying is one of the hidden gems that can be discovered in this anime season. By how it was marketed, both its name and its posters suggest that it would be a more mediocre comedy anime; But this was not the case at all. Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi  exceeds its expectations in an incredible way, both in it lightness and it development and focus.

It is a light and happy romantic comedy anime, which reassures you and makes you think of something else. It makes you rest a few minutes when daily life is very stressful. Regarding the romantic ambit, in the anime it is very childish, although the characters are adults with office jobs, being a bit frustrating or disappointing when it comes to showing  affection. Although, it can be excused when speaking of the stereotype of Japanese people, who are very reserved with this subject.

This show follows the current trend of romance anime, being a mature romance with childish touches, that is because of the attitudes of the protagonists. Here the experience of the protagonist, Futaba Igarashi, in the beginning of her romance is captured to the spectators. 



It has a good pace, each element is well laid out, and there are no exaggerations or misuses means regarding comedy. They don’t rush it, they expose the story with small snippets of interactions, which make sense, and this does not bore the viewer. The main emotions that it emits, when seeing these events, is tenderness, since they make a good development of the situations raised.

Although the main theme is love, the unrequited one, it is not the only one that is exposed in this anime. There are a number of arguments that get focus on this plot, which are very easy to relate. A very interesting one is how to deal with loneliness and that as an adult you have to live with it sometimes, without feeling bad or sad. And having to learn to have a good time with yourself.

It is not a flat show where only the story of the protagonists is contemplated, it extends to the relationships they have with their friends, what their stories are and the evolutions they have outside of the relationships with the protagonists. It has well-defined and deep characters, they may have some signs of being stereotyped, but they are not flat or unpleasant.

Img400()

This anime shows the two faces of what is expected to be the Japanese reality, that is, not only respect, shyness and discomfort, elements that are represented. But also the jokes with friends, the over-protection and many other actions that show a closeness and tone of warmth that the characters have.

They introduce themes of trust, responsibility, and the importance of doing a good job into the story. Regarding respect, they do not explain it only in the work environment; they promote respect in both a loving and friendly relationship. The anime talks about protection and people´s respect, taking the protagonist as a victim when extra characters approach, but she defends herself and other main characters help her.

My Senpai is Annoying is an anime that can go unnoticed by many, but it must have the recognition of being a program that can take the viewer out of their stressful daily life, being able to make them laugh with its tenderness and calm pace. Also, showing that an office romance, or the beginning of an unrequited love, can be just as entertaining as any other.

Versión en Español:

My senpai is annoying es una de las joyas escondidas que se pueden descubrir en esta temporada de animes, ya que por cómo fue mercadeada, tanto su nombre como sus posters, daban a entender que sería un anime más de comedia mediocre; pero esto no fue así. Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi supera las expectativas de una manera increíble, tanto en su ligereza como su desarrollo y enfoque.  

Es un anime romántico de comedia ligera y alegre, el cual tranquiliza y hace pensar en otra cosa. Da unos minutos de descanso cuando la vida diaria es muy estresante. Respecto al ámbito romántico, en el anime es muy infantil, aunque los personajes sean adultos con trabajos de oficina, siendo un poco frustrante o decepcionante a la hora de mostrar afecto. Aunque, se puede excusar al hablar del estereotipo de los japoneses, que son muy reservados con este tema.

Este show sigue la tendencia actual de los animes de romance, siendo un romance maduro con toques infantiles, como antes mencionado, es que es por las actitudes de los protagonistas. Aquí se plasma, a los espectadores, la experiencia de la protagonista, Futaba Igarashi, en el inicio de su romance.

img400(v)


Tiene un buen ritmo, cada elemento está bien distribuido y no hay exageraciones ni malos usos de recurso con respecto a la comedia. No se apresura, van exponiendo la historia con pequeños retazos de interacciones, que tienen sentido, y esto no aburre al espectador. Las principales emociones que emite, al ver estos sucesos, es de ternura, ya que hacen un buen desarrollo de las situaciones planteadas.

Aunque el tema principal es el amor, el no correspondido, no es el único que se expone en este anime. Hay una serie de argumentos que tienen foco en esta trama, con los cuales es muy fácil de poder relacionarse. Uno muy interesante es como lidiar con la soledad y que como adulto hay que convivir a veces con eso, sin sentirse mal o triste. Y el tener que aprender a pasar un buen tiempo con uno mismo. 

No es un show plano donde solo se contempla la historia de los protagonistas, este se extiende y se presencia las relaciones que tienen con sus amigos, cuales son las historias de estos y las evoluciones que tienen fuera de las relaciones con los protagonistas. Tiene personajes bien definidos y con profundidad, puede que tengan algunos indicios de ser estereotipados, pero no son planos ni desagradables. 



Este anime muestra las dos caras de lo que se espera sea la realidad japonesa, es decir, no solo el respeto, timidez e incomodidad, elementos que si se encuentran representados. Pero también los chistes con amigos, la sobreprotección y muchas otras acciones que muestran una cercanía y tonalidad de calidez que tienen los personajes. 

Introducen en la historia temas referentes a la confianza, responsabilidad y la importancia de hacer un buen trabajo. Referente al respeto no lo explican solo en el ambiente laboral; fomentan el respeto en una relación tanto amorosa como de amistad. Habla sobre la protección y el respeto a la persona, tomando a la protagonista como víctima cuando personajes extras se acercan, pero esta se defiende y otros personajes principales la ayudan. 

My Senpai is Annoying es un anime que puede pasar desapercibido por muchos, pero debe tener el reconocimiento de ser un programa que puede sacar al espectador de su día a día para poder hacerlo reír con su ternura y ritmo tranquilo. Asimismo, mostrando que un romance de oficina, o inicio de un amor no correspondido, puede ser igual de entretenido que cualquier otro."
129188,"God, this feels like the most disappointing seasonal of Fall to be honest.

I thought the first season was pretty fun, not perfect, nor anything to grant it a stay in the minds of weebs after it was over, but an entertaining piece with a very interesting idea that executed it perfectly with decent animation and a very exciting DOOM-esque soundtrack. 

The most stay it had on people, mostly Twitter, was the ""controversy"" of the first episode that displayed the depravity and violence of the goblins, ignorant of the fact that that was the point, and what made the first appearance of the Slayer memorable and important, which allowed the show build on a proper foundation and premise. It was a scene made to make you demonize goblins and sympathize with the Slayer. It didn't matter though, because that was the kind of publicity a relatively unknown show like Goblin Slayer needed, after all, there's no bad publicity, as long as you say the name right.

That said, it came as a shock to me that at the start of the first episode, and every episode following afterwards until the end...came a warning about the violent themes and scenes that might trigger people.

This to me, while at first may seem fairly harmless, is one of the first signs of how the show got sterilized. For what reason, I do not know, it still has a 17+ rating, and from what I know of other shows of that rating, they didn't need a blatant warning like this. The other reason, comes from the animation.

White Fox did a good job animating the first season, all things considered. The combination of hand-drawn animation and CG, combined with the immaculate sound design, and context given by the  Slayer and first-hand experience of the Priestess, led to perfectly delivering the cathartic violence and horror the show got known for. It makes sense why they were good at delivering that violence, as they had experience with other shows of similar rating, like Akame Ga Kill. 

Liden Films however...has none of that experience. While they have animated some lesser known shows that have explicit violence, it's clear that they're more comfortable with lighthearted shows or shounen shows that aren't as explicit or gorey like Goblin Slayer. It's clear that the animation and visual design has taken a drop in quality evidently by just looking at the character designs, but beyond that, the action scenes lack the dynamic energy that the first season has. The action feels more hollow, less gorey, less viscera, and less energy, with even sound design taking a nosedive in quality as the main theme is overused without any good execution. As a result, this diminishes the quality of the show, and turns it from a R18+ show to something akin to a 12+ show, something it clearly isn't, but clearly masquerades as.

Thankfully, the story is fine...ish. I think the first half of the story was fine (a bit lacking though), but the second half fell flat on it's face when it picked up the pace. I think it did a good job in trying to expand Goblin Slayer as a character. The first season concluded by finally getting to know the man behind the mask, his backstory, why he does what he does. The second season starts by getting to know the man personally, with all the nuances, his ambitions, his life, his regrets, and how he improves socially. Where before he was socially outcast among adventurers, here he has talks with fellow, more experienced members, and his own teammates. He gets included more with guild activities, and he helps new adventurers personally, and by the end, he is left happy, a clear, coherent sign of character development that I enjoy. 

By the second half however, it decides to pick up the pace, or at least it tries to, until it's too late. The elven kingdom arc feels half-baked, with a climax that has a lot of potential for development for the Priestess, but never goes anywhere. It seemed like a filler arc without any substance or development, sure, it helps with the worldbuilding, and we have a touching moment where a survivor interacts with the Slayer (it was executed pretty poorly, however), but it could've been omitted without any loss of meaningfulness, and it's clear that a lot of stuff was cut from this arc to save time, if the terrible animation and combat scenes didn't make that evident enough for people. Time that doesn't even feel like it amounted to anything, because the final arc of the season is over and done by two episodes, without any emotional impact, or any proper conclusions, as if it was another enemy of the week Slayer and crew had to deal with. It even omits characters that were thought to be of some importance, like the Swordsman who had the same glow in his eyes like the Slayer, which I found ridiculous to say the least, why would you tease a character and then give him only a cold open's worth of screentime? It just doesn't make sense.

Overall, Season 2 of Goblin Slayer was a disappointing mess, and an example of how not to handle a sequel properly by an animation studio, either by indifference or inexperience. I believe it has some qualities of the first season still in there, but they're more or less muddled by the drop of quality everywhere. 

Ironic, the scene that gave the show a chance in the spotlight is what ultimately doomed the sequel, whether it liked it or not. Sterilization, a fate many a shows mired with people that can't conform to disturbing themes have fallen into, and many that can't recover from.

If there will ever be a third season, let's hope they won't fall prey to the same mistake twice."
104454,">""Ey, so we saw that these IP's are pretty popular, what if they collaborated with eachother so that we can give eachother exposure and we can make more money of from eachother?""

This mentality is nothing new to anime. The Fate franchise has been doing big collaborations for a decade now. Gacha games constantly collaborate with big IP's, even manga artists occassionally make chapters for eachother featuring eachothers manga characters. It is one of the most expensive and timeconsuming but most fanpleasing way to make money. It just doesn't cost money to create these collaborations, the licensing of popular IP's is very hard and expensive too. This is why we don't see full on collaboration projects like full-length shows or movies, these are mostly reserved for collaborations between IP's owned by the same company.

So one day, Kadokawa, a company with a stupid amount of IP's under its name thought: "".... oh we like money."" And greenlit Isekai Quartet.

That's right, four of the most popular Isekais in anime ever, Konosuba, Overlord, Re;Zero and Youjo Senki, teamed up together to create one massive (?) collaboration anime. The plot follows all kinds of different characters from these four anime get teleported to school and are forced to take classes with eachother. With so many different kinds of colors of personalities together, ofcourse tons of hijinks ensue. The story stay mostly light, with brief moments of mystery about why the characters are all here.

Like my review description said, this anime is pandering as all hell. Characters intermingle and go off from eachother, and the cleverness of the comedy doesn't really evolve beyond what you would expect in fanfiction. There are some surprising matchups that work surprisingly well together, like Fiore and Beatrice. But in the end, the main characters of the four shows get the most screentime because, well, they are the main characters. And I personally really enjoyed the relationships between Kazuma & Subara and Ainz & Tanya. 

Let's discuss serious negatives of this anime: When you ask the detractors of this anime, you will hear the main reason that they don't like this anime is because it is cheap and doesn't really take advantage of its premise. 

The cheapness is definitelly hard to ignore. The artstyle is very chibi, a big departure from the 4 respective anime. Due to this simple artstyle, the animation is also really simple. Some actions scenes look alright, but this anime is far from a powerhouse in production, which is not really a bad thing. The main focus of this anime is its comedy and characters, so better production values would only distract from those aspects. What also feels cheap is the animes runtime, which is only half a full episode (12 minutes). For an anime with as much potential as this, only giving 12 minutes each episode really leaves little room to make all kinds of enjoyable interactions. I personally don't really mind this runtime, since making it longer would probably make the comedy fall flatter on its face.

Now for its potential, which in theory I think is not taken more advantage of. Interactions that could be gold, like the Emilia and Megumin interaction (both characters are voiced by the same person), are just not taken advantage of from some strange reason. Instead, the anime does less skits and more big stories, a problem that only gets worse in season 2. I also feel like the main cast of Youjo Senki is not fit for this anime. I love Tanya and I am surprised that the other Youjo Senki characters have some good moments (they are actually better then in the main show), but they feel so tame compared to everyone else, being mostly used to be the straight man in each situation. 

You know, all these criticisms don't actually matter all that much. Because in the end: It is just amazing to see my favorite characters interact with eachother. When this anime hits with its comedy, those hits are multiplied by ten for just the neatness of having my favorite characters do them. I can actually compare this anime to Konosuba the most, with how it really feels as a sitcom at times (maybe that's why the Konosuba characters have the best moments in Isekai Quartet). 

All in all, I love this anime, even if it is flawed. It is pandering as hell and the pandering works for me. If you enjoy any of the anime featured in this show, check Isekai Quartet out."
104325,"Despite how this show may appear and what you would gather from the synopsis, this is actually a surprisingly wholesome show. What, you don't believe me? I don't know why you wouldn't considering that this show definitely doesn't have scenes where a student gets into a ridiculously compromising situation with his young, hot teachers. No, there is definitely nothing like that in this show. 

You won't be finding scenes where a student takes his teacher on a piggy back ride that causes her clothes to slowly fall off and for her naked body to end up being pressed against his back, no, not in this show. 

You won't be watching scenes where a small hermit crab latches itself onto a teachers nipple, prompting her to get her student (that she is vacationing with) to grab it but he gets the wrong nipple and gropes her instead.

There isn't a scene where a student and a teacher get stuck in a cave together and the student gets sick, causing him to go a little weird which makes him suck on his teacher's teet and eat her out for no real reason. If there was a scene like this than I wouldn't feel comfortable showing this show to my teachers at school so luckily there isn't anything like that in this show.

This show also absouletly does not have a scene where a teacher is scaring students in a bear costume, is caught by her student who somehow ends up inside the bear costume with her, face first into her under-area which happens to be bare since she decided not to wear panties that day. That would be shameful and disgusting and has no place in a show like this.

There definitely also isn't a scene where a teacher wants to give a student a chocolate but the chocolate falls and splats onto her breasts causing the student to say: 'Surprise Chocolate Fondue!' and then having him fall onto her breasts and eat the chocolate off of her teet. That would be weird and perverted and thankfully this show is free from anything like that. 

Overall, this is a very wholesome romance anime that has some of the cutest and least perverted scenes I've scene in anything recently. If this show was raunchy and perverted then surely the teachers would get fired for sexually harassing their students and constantly putting themselves in sexy and compromising situations. But it's not so I don't have to worry about logistic problems like that. Even if it was I wouldn't complain. To conclude, this is a very sweet romance anime that is perfect to show your parents, younger siblings and especially teachers. Hell, I showed this show to my cousin who was in love with one of his teachers which inspired him to act on his urges which ended with him in a juvenile detention center and the teacher serving five years in prison. 

Hmmm, you know what, this show might actually be extremely perverted and raunchy. Well, honest mistake."

Do you just want to know if you should watch the darn show?
Me too.

This will be a review of both Kiss x Sis OVA and TV because the watch order involves switching between them.
Watch Order:    OVA 0-2,    TV 1-9,    OVA 3,    TV 10-12,    OVA 4-11 [(link) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watchorder#wikikissxsis)
Note: OVA episodes are numbered starting from 0, TV are numbered starting from 1
Note: There is an after credits scene in the finale of the OVA

I can’t believe I’m saying this but I enjoyed Kiss x Sis. I enjoyed the hell out of it. A super lewd, super hilarious, and super enjoyable experience. I consider this to be the S tier of ecchi shows. 

The story revolves around 16 year old twins Ako and Riko trying to seduce their 15 year old step brother Keita. Ako and Riko are definitely the main girls, but others such as a teacher, a loli, and a big oppai classmate appear often. 

This show has a plot in the same way that the video I watched last night of a naked girl getting stuck in the washing machine had a plot. Practically not having one is a good thing though because it means there’s more time spent showing Keita getting peed on or licking peoples’ sweat. There’s definitely something for everybody in this show. I didn’t have every fetish it catered to, which hurt my enjoyment of some of the scenes, but all in all I was surprised by the variety of scenarios they came up with.  

Don’t just expect panty shots and accidental boob grabs. While these do exist, most of the ecchi scenes in this are explicit as hell; they constantly toe the line between hentai and anime. I’m turned off when shows are creepy with their fanservice (see SAO Season 2’s lingering shots of Sinon’s cameltoe), but Kiss x Sis manages to cram in tons of raunchiness without making me feel like a predator while I watch Ako and Riko make a good luck charm out of their pubic hair. The ecchi scenes were super erotic and watching them was very… enjoyable.

Whoever made this show tried their hardest to include as much as possible without getting taken off TV. I honestly don't know how they got away with showing some of the stuff they did. In general, the TV version is less explicit than the OVA, and the following picture is from the TV version. I had to censor it but I hope you can see what I'm talking about. 
!img500()!

Most characters’ personalities can be summed up in 5 words or less, one of which being “horny”. But it’s not a problem because they all have distinct personalities and mesh super well with each other. One of Kiss x Sis’ strong suits is actually its comedy, and a large part of that is due to the many character types present in the show. Each one has their own charm and none felt like a dud. All of the girls are really fun to watch even if Keita isn’t present, meaning they're unique and likable enough to stand on their own. Parents are usually irrelevant in anime, but this show flips the script by having them not only be aware of their step childrens' weird relationship, but actively encouraging Keita to bang his stepsisters.  

There is no character development unless you count Keita slowly succumbing to his horniness.

the importance of family :)

Not much to say here. Character designs are alright, although it was actually very refreshing to see females that don’t have breasts the size of planets. Riko always wears a bandage, which I found kinda cute. Other than that, the artstyle and level of detail are about average. The show looks slightly dated, which is expected since it started airing in 2008. The animation is also average most of the time but was quite good when it needed to be. The TV version's ED features some of the worst CGI I have ever seen, but little to no CGI is used elsewhere. 
img()

The music is pretty average. The OPs and EDs are mostly catchy but generic J-pop songs, although the OPs are sung by the voice actresses, which I like. The soundtrack is good and the songs used for the steamy moments greatly enhance the experience. However, there isn’t much variety and you end up hearing the same songs over and over again. 

The voice acting is top notch. Some of the sounds that come out of these actresses' mouths… whoa mama. The high quality voice acting brings the ecchi scenes to the next level.

If all you’ve watched is Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer, stay away from this. If you’ve seen hentai before, or if you're into ecchi shows, then check this out. You don’t necessarily have to be into incest or have any weird fetishes in order to enjoy this.

If you liked Kiss x Sis, check out [Aki-Sora](https://anilist.co/anime/6987/AkiSora/). The concept is pretty similar except the main characters are a shota and an onee-san. They’re actual siblings too.

Another incest show worth looking into is [Yosuga No Sora](https://anilist.co/anime/8861/Yosuga-no-Sora-In-Solitude-Where-We-are-Least-Alone/). This one also has a relationship between actual siblings.

This show was really good. I don't mean good as in good writing, themes, plot, character development, or animation. I mean good as in it has a clear goal in mind and executed it almost flawlessly. It knows it's trash and becomes the best trash possible. Without a doubt, Kiss x Sis belongs in the S tier of trashy ecchi anime. I genuinely enjoyed watching this. Comedy was great too. Lord forgive me."
6675,"Ah, Redline, the industry’s loudest bomb. A bomb so explosive, so meticulously crafted and vibrant its aftershocks can still be felt today from all sides of the spectrum, from the painful lack of risks maligned in today’s time, to the cult following that spawned from the ashes. A decade later, and the film’s still one of the biggest spectacles in the business, so it may have just won in the end.

Before I gush about the obvious, how ‘bout we get the specs on the writing, or rather the mainframe holding this bad boy together. Protagonist JP is one of the freshest mother fuckers in the business, with enough style and charm to rival the likes of Char from Gundam and Lupin from the III. His crew’s pretty alright and Frisbee’s subplot ends in the coolest way you can think for that kind of rigged mafia sports story, but apart from JP and the galaxy he races in, the real stars are the competitors: the racers and the Fun Nazis that run Roboworld. Nothing’s deep about them other than the fun ways the film lets us in on their pasts, —Travistila and Dezuya’s rivalry following their fallout in their military days being the highlight in this regard— but the likes of Sonoshi and Metalhead are captivating love interests and rivals respectively, and Johnny, Lynchman, Shinkai, and Todoroki make for gloriously badass comedic relief. Seeing this absurd yet damn well-constructed galaxy thrash about as the Roboworld Fun Nazis fuck themselves and everything with them up is a sight to behold, even if that whole subplot does leave a few loose threads hanging.

The madness doesn’t stop there, as when you can see it, you can hear the adrenaline. Heart-pumping tunes such as “Yellow Line” and one of the many examples of leitmotif on display: “Redline” drill into your ears as your heart prepares to explode! Matching and even surpassing the ear-candy tunes by James Shimoji is the dub. Recognizable A-list VAs such as Michelle Ruff, Doug Erholtz, Keith Silverstein, James K. Price, and our main protagonist Patrick MoFUCKING Seitz give it their all to bring all the style to each bombastic character, in a damn valiant effort to match the flowing, flashing attitude of this stellar rush of awe. Not a single performance falls short --not even those of lesser-known VAs such as Joey Morris and Laura Post-- allowing this dub to go down as an underappreciated beast worthy of the godlike warhead of a film it’s attached to.

As this lavish atom bomb blew, onlookers were greeted to one of the most monumental spectacles in animation and film in general. Forget eye-candy, this is a king’s feast for the eyes! Through the fiery hells of a 7-year production line at Madhouse, animator superstars and madmen of the industry such as Hiroyuki Imaishi and Hiroshi Hamasaki, and madman director Takeshi Koike created an unstoppable juggernaut of some of the most fluid, bombastic, and detailed sakuga in the market. Every second of every race, every shoot-out, fight-scene, and scene in general is crafted to utter perfection, as to squeeze the life out of your red, blazing eyes as they somehow manage to perfectly parse all the earth-shattering action going on. The wonderfully vibrant colors, car designs, mech designs, and especially character designs Katsuhiko Ishii, and every aforementioned and unrecognized name crafted are as gorgeous, expressive, and or unique as it can possibly get in such a small yet galactic showcase. Each setting is as majestic and even destructible as the last too, and my god, even gushing can’t do it justice! JUST LOOK AT THIS SHIT! FUCKING LOOK AT IT, AND TELL ME THIS ISN’T ONE OF THE BEST-LOOKING THINGS YOU’VE EVER SEEN!!!

It left me feeling like a kid riding a roller-coaster and going down a waterslide while on a sugar rush. My holy-shit quotient broke by the middle of the final race, reducing me to a gibbering mess of hype trying to feast on the visual splendor at hand. The raw style and energy on display are borderline unmatched in this industry, as something like this has never been attempted since its painful crash in ‘09. Amidst the fires still stood a proud work of boisterous art, an exhilarating monument to the sheer passion plugged into this industry, and the sheer level of glory its patrons express! And some bastards say some risks never pay off! Fuck ’em, now what about you? Think you can handle a little test drive?"
20632,"MINOR SPOILERS FOR ALDNOAH.ZERO

""Alright! It's time to watch some Turn A Gunda- WHAT THE FUCK?!-"" CBF back in 2016.

So, can we all agree that Aldnoah.Zero (the entire series, not just this first season) is probably the worst show Gen Urobuchi had an active role in? If nothing else, it's certainly the most polarizing work his name has been attached to, even if he didn't do much beyond the script for the first few episodes and a few other ideas in the preparation phase. Now that the man hasn't made anything big in the industry since this piece of crap, why don't we look back and ask ourselves: why did I review season 2 before season 1?

Oh wait it's because season 2 was more memorable on the sole basis of being an absolute dumpster fire. Remember when this show was popular? It's ok if you don't; that's probably for the best.

The first few episodes aren't too broken, but they suffer from lacking characterization, a problem that will plague the series for sure. The first half isn't too riveting, even with its many action sequences. Sure, seeing our stale bread protagonist Inaho out mech weaknesses via science is neat in theory, but when the solutions are so obvious or farfetched, it nullifies any satisfaction that would grant. Those only really last until the halfway mark, anyway. When Slaine, the deuteragonist representing the enemy's point of view, helps him take down one of his own, the fucker just blasts him and leaves him for dead. Not only did it cause Inaho to go from a lifeless hunk of tofu to a genuinely erratic character, but it marked the shark-jumping point for the series as a whole. I understand that Slaine was still technically affiliated with the enemy, but he was clearly defecting and trying to get in touch with Inaho and his crew, so it would make so much more sense for Inaho to at least communicate with him before just shooting him down. No one even confronts him about it. The whodunnit assassination plotline isn't done well, and when the villain reveals himself, his motives clash heavily with his methods in a way that the show doesn't take advantage of. Even amidst the blatant plotholes and arbitrary decisions characters make towards the latter half in particular, the biggest slap in the face has to be the ending which opts to shoot Asseylum and Inaho in the face to play the whole ""protagonists are dead"" card. It's a series of obscenely melodramatic contrivances and cliffhanger situations for the sake of throwing the audience into a frenzy. Geass 1 finale, this is not.

So, outside of our dismal protagonist, who do we have? There's his rival, Slaine, who might as well be the embodiment of ""trauma conga line."" His trauma throughout the series gets so brutal and frequent that it honestly becomes comical. He quite literally only exists to highlight how awful everyone on all sides is, especially the antagonists he works for. Every single person who interacts with him screws him over in some way, including our protagonist who just backstabs him after receiving his help in a previous mission. He literally doesn't do anything to deserve the shit he gets, and his characterization pretty much boils down to ""good boy gets obliterated and jaded"". The only one who doesn't directly bend him over is Asseylum, and she's just a boring ""good girl politician"" character with a terrible love triangle with Inaho and Slaine. Everyone else is honestly as bland as Asseylum, outside of a few of the side characters with potentially interesting backstories that the show does nothing with. They're better than the antagonists who are just a bunch of mustache-twirling bad guys because only the good guys are allowed to have any kind of nuance, as little as there is to begin with. The only exception is the main antagonist of the first season, Count Saazbum, and his motivations clash with his actions in a way that the show doesn't take advantage of. Outside of that, he's just an evil villain because we need more evil villains being pure evil.

With most of the negatives out of the way, we finally reach a more positive tone for this review, at least for now. This joint production by A-1 Pictures and TROYCA is honestly fine from a visual standpoint. The CG mechs are somewhat jarring and clunky, but there are a lot of weather effects and surrounding objects for them to maneuver around. Not only does this allow for more dynamic and energetic sequences that have some semblance of weight to them, but it makes the quality of the models less noticeable. The actual character designs are better than the models and designs of the mechs, and the artwork tends to be rather solid. There are a fair number of sequences that blend 2D and 3D animation together in a way that lets both feel kinetic, like when Asseylum's bodyguard drives her around and fends off the battle taking place in the first episode. Ei Aoki's direction is also rather solid at times, highlighting the state of panic most of the characters are in early on. It stops being noticeable as time goes on, but it's never noticeably bad either.

The music in the show is honestly A.Z's strongest asset. The vocal tracks, while overused, are still pretty good. ""No Differences"" is the biggest standout, and the background tracks often carry a sense of epicness that Hiroyuki Sawano has become famous for. One of my favorite Sawano tracks actually appears here. The opening isn't as exciting as most of the other songs present here, but it does showcase a sense of urgency and ambition that this project was obviously filled with. While the first ED isn't anything to write home about, ""aLIEz"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki, is one of my favorite ending themes of the decade. The sheer bombast on display is one that I don't think they have topped since, with one of the loudest and proudest displays of the ""Sawano Drop"" and howling vocals in their discography after such an inviting yet cold tone the first half set and built up. 

This could have been something. It wanted to be something. Instead, it ended up being a worse version of Mobile Suit Gundam and Turn A Gundam, shows which actually deal with politics, romance, and war between earth and space dwellers in a manner that makes sense. I still remember how my moderate enjoyment of the series turned into crushing disappointment by the second half, though there isn't much else particularly memorable about the show despite the plethora of big sequences it had. While it's not a complete disaster, Aldnoah.Zero isn't much more than a disappointment that turned heads half a decade ago, remembered only for heated conversations surrounding its love triangle and cliffhanger, not for being a compelling narrative people cared about even a year after its conclusion."
114065,"At the start maybe we all thought that this was just a generic situation where the main character, Kyouya Hashiba, who was an adult with no job had a chance to redo his life so that he can change the future. These kind of situation where main characters get to redo their life and change themselves are not rare, 90% of the isekai animes have these kind of plot. However I find this more unique. I am not skilled enough to write a review without spoiling but I will try to minimize the spoilers as much as possible

Its the year 2016. Kyouya Hashiba, a working adult choose the easy life. Although he was able to get into art school he didn't take it because he was afraid of the risks and decided instead to just go to business school. After finishing university, he went around doing some jobs while picking up some skills such as web design, composing music, simple programming knowledge etc. One night on the way home, he saw a depressed looking women who looked like she was about to jump off a bridge, he stopped her only to find out that it was all a misunderstanding. Be it fate or not, the women, Kawasegawa Eiko, was in charge of a big project by a game company. They were partnering with the Platinium Generation, a group of creators who were popular that time. Coincidentally Kyouya was a fan of one of the Platinium Generation member's artworks so he was excited to meet them some time. Eiko was stressing over that a important person had left their project and they needed to find someone to fill in the slot so Kyouya offered to take up the role as he had some experience in game developing. Kyouya made a contract and worked at the company temporary until the project is finished. He quickly exceeded Eiko's expectations with his speed and dedication towards his work, however some time later the project was cancelled. With no job and money Kyouya moved back in to his parent's house. ""Man how I wish I can turn back time"", Kyouya thought before waking up in the year 2006. He joined art school and has the chance to work with his fellow housemates: Tsurayuki Rokuonji, Nanako Kogure and Aki Shino. Later would he know that things would get more complicated than he could imagine

I like that although Kyouya had the knowledge of 10 years ahead of time. He wasn't your typical op main character that everyone admires. He also lacks knowledge in a lot of fields but what really made him stood out was his problem solving personality. Whenever a hard problem would come up most people would think ""there's nothing I could do"" rather than trying. However Kyouya did his best to lead the team, its like that one guy who does everything during a group project. Everyone admires him and they trust him a lot. Kyouya, who was a nobody became a somebody that everyone could rely on, I believe this is most people's ideal life. But there are no smooth seas, becoming relied on and solving everyone's problem became something normal to Kyouya. It wasn't that he didn't enjoyed it but he doesn't realize that he is spoiling them too much, its like a parent preventing their child to not fall when they are learning to walk. Since the team hasn't actually experienced failing at something before, making Kyouya handle everything has become a norm to them. Slowly but surely they start to lose their individuality and eventually will feel worthless or burned out

After realizing that it was too late to solve anything. Since Kyouya had solved all of his friend's problems, there was nothing for their friends to do. This might sound contradicting but there are some problems that are required to be solved but there are some problems where it will solve itself

There were some plot holes that were never explained but I still like the overall story. I won't say I like this anime but I don't hate it either"

100049,"The Frozen Bond, a Re:Zero OVA/film, is criminally underrated! Coming off the heels of Re:Zero's first-half of its first season, everything that Frozen Bond has to offer is a huge change of pace from the central premise of the series, and in all of the best ways possible.

img()

This prequel to Re:Zero focuses on further developing Emilia and Puck as central characters. It gives the essentials of both of their backstories, as well as what their lives were like predating Emilia's inclusion into a more noble, refined life. The emphasis here is focusing on the discrimination Emilia suffers due to her being seen as a terrible witch, and for the terrible magic that she holds within her.

Such a long, dedicated runtime allows for good introspection, and the film makes sure that any topic they touch on is with a deft hand. They reveal just enough to keep the viewer intrigued, without giving firm explanations, making things both clear while leaving a layer of mystery yet to be uncovered. Rather than just dumping backstory and lore, this film is more about contextualizing the relationship that has already been developed in the main series. 

img(v)

What makes this stand out above its own source material, as well as other anime of a similar caliber, is that its self-contained narrative holds on its own. Not only is little context needed from the main series, but instead, the context given in the film only enhances your knowledge of the main series. Because of its deliberate separation from the main narrative, it's free to flex its narrative muscles and explore in any direction it wants, telling a fantastic fantasy story, tinged with levity and heartache. 

The main series is always mired in its edgy tone, and Subaru's ignorant perspective, and his never-ending cycle of fail and repeat until success comes his way. Emilia takes the reins of protagonist quite deftly, having full ownership, character depth, and character development, perhaps even deeper than her original presentation. 

img()

It is not without faults. The art and animation is fantastic throughout, as is expected of a series of its stature. But because of its simple setting - snowy forest with little variation - the backgrounds can be a bit dull. The OST features some unique music as well, but a lot of it is largely forgettable, and struggles to stand out in any way, especially compared to the absolute bangers in the series' soundtrack. 

Also, don't you dare watch the other OVA included as a part of this: Memory Snow. It's a straight-up fanservice episode, with some goofy scenes and memes of light comedy. But while Frozen Bond is edging just shy of a masterpiece, Memory Snow is criminally stupid, should be avoided if you value your time, and has almost no redeeming qualities. 

img(v)

Any criticisms offered, however, are demonstrably nitpicks on what is clearly a stellar display of storytelling within the Re:Zero world. This is an easy recommendation for anyone already interested in the Re:Zero franchise - much watch material! - but also a good recommendation for those who may be intrigued by the series overall, but are a bit put off by Subaru as a protagonist, or the darker themes of the mainline series. Frozen Bond captures all the best aspects of the Re:Zero worldbuilding, with essentially none of the faults or lag that comes with its source."
14967,"Personal feelings aside, I'll keep this short. Essentially, this season carries on seamlessly from the previous season - same animation, music, voice acting and general tone. One thing they seemed to do away with was the ecchi quality of the first season, not that it had much prominence there either - so no nudity and half-time eyecatchers this time around. Anyway, as a light, high school based comedy, this series does fairly well. It's nothing you won't have seen before in such arrangements, but Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga sukunai is nonetheless a fun watch through both seasons. If that's the type of thing you're after, I'd recommend trying it. This is a series more than that though, and it's at this point I become less eager to recommend it.

Yeah, don't watch this for the romance. Well it's your call, but having seen it through to the end, I personally wouldn't rewatch this series purely as a result of how the romance plays out. I'm aware a large portion of romance fans favour satisfying romances, even if there isn't a happy ending - I'm certainly in that camp, at least - and Christ is the romance in this series anything but. As throughout the first season, romance is more or less left to simmer. That is to say, for most of the runtime, nothing really develops beyond what we already knew regarding how certain characters feel about Kodaka.

But okay, the first season was based more on romantic subtext, hardly aiming to develop any such relationships - at least beyond a certain point - and that worked fine. However, that direction works because it sets the expectation that eventually, romance will see a place in the limelight. Bear with it, it implies. So you wait and wait, and... wait, this is the tenth episode!? How will all this romantic potential between characters tie together in just three episodes?

When romance finally begins to get the anticipated spotlight in episode ten, it feels like it's too late. Surprise surprise, it is. At least, the story doesn't bother trying to cram it all into three episodes. Instead, it draws upon the plot point you thought had been succeeded long ago - friendship. As soon as the club members were all present in the story, this theme seemed all but redundant. Sure, they hadn't yet acknowledged it, but as far as anyone could be concerned by this point, they're all friends. Although resurfacing occasionally, this theme began to lose its grip more and more as romantic expectations increased through the story's progression, so when it suddenly tightens in the final straight, I was left thinking ""what was the point in the romantic setup?"". 

So, that's the romance. There are other things usually covered in reviews but I didn't really set out intending for this to be so thorough as to cover all bases, so onto the summary. First, this season specifically. As mentioned, it carries on well from the first with perfect continuity, but leaves far too many loose ends. Now, the series overall. If you're seeking romance, look elsewhere. If you're interested in this series for anything besides that, you'll likely find this a fun, engaging watch, but since romance is an inescapable aspect of the plot, you'll end up having to face it one way or another."
21639,"Are you tired of reading wall after wall of pretentious text?
Do you just want to know if you should watch the darn show?
Me too.

Take the classic sports anime formula and replace the beautiful men playing volleyball with beautiful women pounding each others’ asses with their own asses. Keijo with eight exclamation points is an amazing, balls to the wall experience that manages to hide its flaws by turning the ridiculous meter up to maximum and then destroying the emergency off switch with a “Steel Lance Ass Attack”. 

The plot of Keijo is definitely its weakest aspect. If you ignore its gimmick of super sexual swimsuit sumo wrestling, you’re left with a surprisingly standard sports shounen story. The show is obviously supposed to be a parody of the genre, but followed the same underdog formula as most sports shows with little to no changes: 

The plucky and optimistic main character saw an amazing match as a child that inspired them. With big dreams of becoming the number one player, they enrol in a school with the goal of learning the sport. The protagonist, who was nobody special at the beginning, manages to showcase their potential and forms a loyal group of friends. Through hard work and determination, they slowly train and improve their skills. At the end of the show, the main character and their teammates compete in a tournament against the best school in the country. As you can probably tell from this summary, there is no creativity to be found in the story side of things.

But let’s be real. Screw the story. You’re probably here because you want to look at tits, ass, and tight swimsuits. I won’t judge, so was I. If that’s what you want, you will walk out of the experience happy. There isn’t any explicit nudity (nipples or genitalia) but the whole show is built around using one’s butt or boobs to knock their opponent over, so you’ll see tons of body parts that are technically censored or covered. Swimsuits get damaged during matches, special moves often require “powering up”, and the show’s page on the Anime Bath Scene Wiki has some great screenshots that I’m not sure I can include in this review. What I probably can get away with though is a picture of the main character harvesting radishes with her ass. 

The main characters consist of the outgoing, determined protagonist with a lot to prove, the cool and composed friend, the shy one who’s actually really smart, and the idiot. Some of the supporting characters include the horny one, the really buff one, the one that speaks in engrish, the loli, and the tomboy. 

This description might sound like the cast of every show ever and you’d be right in thinking that. There’s definitely not a lot of innovation in the characters but they do the job. Despite not being super unique, they still made me feel hype during the hype moments and sad during the sad moments. Their victories felt like my victories, I was invested in their growth, and I wanted them to succeed. Honestly, all this show needed was average characters and nothing more. The whole point of Keijo is to deliver good, dumb fun and this cast absolutely provided that. 

The show normally looks pretty average but that’s only because the studio saved their budget for the matches. Keijo matches are more like fights than sports matches, and are super dynamic. They’re filled with insane effects, bold outlines, great animation, and tons of movement. Every attack has weight and speed behind it and you can really feel the impacts when they land. 

img()

Attacks have ridiculous names such as “Vacuum Butt Cannon” and “Butt Missile Stance 5: Anal Probe Missile” with visual flair to match. They also reference other anime with moves such as “Buttack on Titan” and “Gate of Bootylon”. The fights in Keijo were both epic and hilarious as hell to watch. I lost track of how many times I burst out laughing from how absurd it was, and the high quality of the action scenes really added to the atmosphere the show builds.

The OP rocks and got me pumped up for the episode but wasn’t super memorable. I definitely wouldn’t listen to it outside of the anime. I personally would have liked it to be more insanely hype and loud, which would have added to the epic over the top vibe that the show tries to go for. All in all though, the opening song is good enough and I can't fault it too much.

I just mentioned that I wanted super over the top sounds to match the rest of the show, and the sound design during fights does exactly that. Every attack that could possibly benefit from having sounds thrown in like robotic stomping, impact noises, dogs snarling, and explosion noises has them (this is supposed to be a wrestling anime btw). It’s impossible for me to do it justice by just writing about it, but listening to the fights was just as enjoyable as watching them. 

If you’re in the mood for some lighthearted, dumb ecchi fun and don’t mind a very traditional sports shounen storyline, you will enjoy this show a lot. It also helps if you appreciate a good fight scene or two.

I unfortunately haven’t seen any of these, but shows such as [How Heavy Are The Dumbbells You Lift](https://anilist.co/anime/107226/How-Heavy-Are-the-Dumbbells-You-Lift/), [Iwakakeru Sport Climbing Girls](https://anilist.co/anime/117757/Iwakakeru-Sport-Climbing-Girls/), and [Food Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/20923/Food-Wars-Shokugeki-no-Soma/) fit the bill of ecchi/sport or ecchi/shounen shows and probably scratch the same itch as Keijo. 

Keijo is great. It kind of fails as a sports shounen parody because of its plot and characters, but more than makes up for it with the butts, fights, and absurd premise of the sport. This shit is absolutely idiotic and my primitive chimpanzee brain was hollering with delight from start to finish.

585,"""When you become an artist, you are like that rock. You are in a raw, natural state with hidden gems inside.You have to dig down deep and find the emerald studs way inside you. ""

Crossroads. Something we're all familiar with, especially during our adolescent years where expectations may give us the impression that we're running out of time. It doesn't help seeing other people progress  whilst we're still unsure on how to really approach the near-future, the lingering fear of disappointment begins to weigh some people down. 

Whisper of the Heart is a charming coming-of-age story wrapped around an adorable romance. For some, this Studio Ghibli addition may serve as a warm embrace, reminding viewers that they're not alone in their feeling of doubt and that it's perfectly fine to go at your own pace. This addition is also one of the movies by the studio to not be directed by Hayao Miyazaki but instead by Yoshifumi Kondo, who unfortunately passed away 3 years after it's release.

This movie is one of the more grounded narratives from Studio Ghibli, the hurdles which the main character has to overcome are hurdles which we've all had to face or for some of us, still facing. The movie follows a 14-year old girl who aspires to be a writer as she struggles to transition into a different stage in her life, a stage built upon independence and ambition. A boy who seems to possess a mutual interest in literature is introduced and the two begin to slow-dance around their feelings for each other.

The hand-drawn animation style paired alongside the honesty which the narrative is presented with evokes a nostalgic feeling. Whisper of the Heart successfully comes of as a sincere and thoughtful watch, it is the embodiment of all of Studio Ghibli's intentions regarding the art of film. It exists as a safe space or a pit stop in this long road of existence and self-discovery. We as humans are forever growing and forever discovering the gems which reside within us therefore this movie will forever be relevant. 

Overall, Whisper of the Heart is definitely worth the watch and is almost guaranteed to lift your spirit. This story of teenage love, passion and self-discovery is, in my opinion, the greatest movie to come out of Studio Ghibli."
16662,"Miyazaki and magic go together hand in hand. All of his films have some sort of magical element to them. So when Miyazaki and Takahata were to make a double feature (that ended up never happening since Tale of the Princess Kaguya was delayed), they did the reverse of Grave of the Fireflies/My Neighbor Totoro: Takahata made the magical film while Miyazaki made a non-magical World War II film. And I think it's his second best film.
There were two things that I found out about the film right before I watched it. The first is that the audio is in mono, which I honestly would not have noticed either way. The second is that every sound effect was voiced by a human. This really helped put a lot of moments into perspective. When I couldn't tell if it was a voice or not, I was more impressed by what the human voice was capable of. When I could tell, it put a smile on my face because I was able to hear the man behind the art, which might be the message of the film.
I had planned to watch the film dubbed, as Ghibli films are the only Japanese animated films (excluding movies that are based on TV shows that I watched dubbed) that I would watch dubbed, for either their all-star cast or just simply nostalgic reasons. It wasn't until I read this David Ehrlich quote that I reconsidered:
""[Of all Miyazaki’s films, it is most imperative that you see this one in Japanese.](https://web.archive.org/web/20131022022459/http://www.film.com/movies/the-wind-rises-review)""
Now I don't make decisions like this solely because of what some critic says but it did put this to light: If I am to watch ANY of Miyazaki's films subbed, it really should be the non-magical down to earth serious film.
Also the main character is voiced by Hideaki Anno, now if I had known THAT prior to watching the film there would have been no hesitation to pick sub over dub. I'll be sure to watch the film dubbed on my guaranteed future rewatch.
I had known that the film was about a man that designed planes used by kamikaze soldiers in WWII and to my surprise, and in hindsight gratitude, they only hint that they were kamikaze planes once, at the very end. This is not about the war. This is not about the planes. This is about the man's life while making these planes and it's absolutely beautiful.
I know Miyazaki is out of retirement because the anime industry is in shambles or something like that but I think it's most fitting that he ends off his career with this. I want to say that he can't top this, but it was after coming out of his retirement post-Princess Mononoke that he delivered his magnum opus Spirited Away, so I'll keep an open mind."
101281,"potentially vague and mild spoilers for a show I don’t recommend

Carole and Tuesday is an empty shell. It’s fundamentally at odds with itself as well, given the narrative of the show and the contemporary feel it oozes in every direction. You can smell the corporate in the air here, which is probably the most bizarre thing to say given that this is a Shinichiro Watanabe anime. The man responsible for stylish classics such as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo is one of the main people who crafted something that’s at the crossroads of trends from both the popular anime industry and the popular music industry. That sounds epic until you realize that both industries are formula and trend chasers, meaning this show is the culmination of all that. It certainly hits home with the American crowd, much like his works always do. This time it feels even more designed for them than before.

This leads to the first major problem with the anime: its setting. There is no reason for it to be set in Mars. There’s not a single thing this anime does to really have a setting that couldn’t have easily taken place on Earth without anything changing outside of where Carole comes from. The only thing they do with it outside of lame space politics is “Mars’ radiation tampers with people’s hormones” because they couldn’t just let trans people and androgynes be in the show without some kind of crazy explanation that raises more questions than answers. The space politics are done in a way where you could just replace Mars with America and Earth with a third world country, and it wouldn’t have made a difference to Carole’s backstory or the world. If they wanted this to be an allegory, then it needs to justify why it makes its setting based on real world events instead of just setting it where it’s pulling from. The show doesn’t tap into anything regarding the planet and what kind of climate you’d expect a city on Mars to have. It doesn’t really do anything regarding space travel. It’s just a futuristic show that happens to take place on Mars while having a suspicious number of American talent and ideas from the 2010s. 

Frankly, I’m left wondering why they didn’t just make this show take place in a futuristic America. The main characters have decidedly English names. One of our main characters is light-skinned. They have a plethora of both light and dark-skinned people in this show (compared to most anime, anyway), and even some lesbian and transgender characters. There’s more English than the recently finished El-Melloi anime which sprinkles in random English/Engrish words and phrases every chance it can get. The show has Denzel Curry and Thundercat, on top of some other American artists. Hell, the main music genre the show uses is pop music, one of the most American genres out there (there’s hardly any J-pop in this show). Why didn’t they set it in America? Would it have made too much sense? They ignore the most obvious idea for a setting and do nothing with what they actually chose! Sure, there’s a fair amount of world-building regarding the music industry and the technological advancements (even if some of the AI concepts feel underutilized) but this is still baffling beyond belief!

Then we get to one of the show’s ideological conflicts: AI vs human music, or rather the divide between humans and people. The conflict between AI and human music and how one just sounds artificial and corporate and lifeless and whatnot falls on its face when you realize that the show's just using generic, melodramatic pop music for the human side. Just about everyone seems to love the typical pop music Carole and Tuesday put on (as well as the dismal chorus Angela showcased in episode 5) and I just don’t see it. I can’t see it with these vocals, let alone some of the lyrics. I’m no Anthony Fantano but I can’t help but roll my eyes at lyrics like “Can you feel my, can you feel my tear drops of the loneliest girl”. I understand that pop music has a lot of repetitive lyrics and tackles contemporary/relatable subject matter in a relatively melodramatic fashion, but this is just too much. Angela’s aforementioned song in episode 4 just features the chorus which primarily is about her moving mountains, and I can’t bet behind the lyrics or the voice. Another case of bad voices is the song Carole and Tuesday perform in episode 6, which often sounds off-pitch. Not all of the songs are terrible (I find the song capping off episode 5 to be sorta decent, and most of their songs are just mediocre) but still. They’re often cloying beyond comprehension.

The characters treat the concept of AI music as artificial and lacking in warmth before we even get to hear it. It takes forever for us to hear proper AI music unless you want to count the terrible electronica that pompous fuck Ertegun pumps out almost every time he is introduced (as well as episode 5's chorus to one of Angela's songs that are written by AI). We just have to take the show’s word for it for more than ¼ of the show’s runtime while putting up with corporate, boilerplate pop music. In this regard, the show is at odds with itself, fundamentally speaking. 

There is a lot of commentary on the shadiness of the music industry with regards to how labels and producers often treat their artists like shit and try to control them, as well as how several of these producers are terrible people with several recorded acts that will ruin them if exposed. Even some of the more harmless producers have a ton of shit other characters threaten to expose them for, and there’s a ton of blackmail from or between producers in this show regarding exactly that. If only that amounted to anything beyond there being a shady corporation man working with our main antagonists for profit in the final quarter.

Another problem is with Tuesday, specifically, her fear of getting noticed and sent home. It's one of the main things about her and yet it barely even gets brought up during that time everyone tried making a music video, or when she and Carole were backup performers at an event with over 10K people. Though the show treats this as some sort of looming threat until she develops past that after a single pep talk in episode 7, it doesn't feel like one. It doesn't even happen during an episode when one of her family members is in the city she is so he can look for her. Almost no one in the public or the media seems to make a big deal about it or look into it further anyway, which is utter nonsense given the show’s attempts to look into the industry and the connections of people inside it. It's not like her storyline amounts to much more than a worse version of Pokemon Sun and Moon's (even Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon's) storyline, anyway. That and the issues with the setting are the main problems with the first ⅓ of the show since honestly, the actual writing, for that portion of the show isn't all that bad. Outside of a detail that dismantles the 4th episode because they couldn't figure out how to do dramatic irony in a way that doesn't make the characters come off as utter morons, that's basically all I got. Unfortunately, sometime during the Mars Brightest competition, the show decides to create contrivances for our main duo to be separate for an episode, and for Angela to have a temporary conflict with her latest manager who was introduced several episodes ago. This is all by the halfway mark.

The rest of the show is where the main conflict regarding human music VS AI, issues with the music industry, and issues with politics and capitalism take center stage. They’re so basic, one-dimensional, and on the nose about all of this to the point of absurdity. To think, the self-defeating conflicts about human VS AI music and the warmth of one vs the artificiality of the other wasn’t enough for this show. On top of that, while criticizing the music industry, they have our main characters train under someone that continually forces them to do upwards of over 52 takes until he is satisfied. He is overworking them to dangerous levels and that’s a combination of comic relief and an uplifting montage. That and the fact that the AI vs human music disappears completely by episode 21 should tell you everything about how this show handles these ideas and commentaries. Here I was thinking that the AI and people divide in general was supposed to be relevant with how much they brought it up.

Admittedly there is this nice plot point that pops up in this latter half regarding Carole’s parents which the show had been building up to. It’s delicately handled, and it provides another genuinely good character who sadly won’t get much screen time in this anime since that whole plot point concludes by the end of episode 14. There’s also episode 16 which has a decent, bittersweet tale with some pretty nice songs by our main duo. That and a sorta decent episode knocking down and building that egotist Ertegun back up caught me by surprise. The second half of the show seems more character-focused despite also doubling down on the points that damage the show. When it focuses on the elements that are promising and true to its characters, it somewhat works, and when it doesn’t, it really doesn’t. It really goes to show you that the show’s writing isn’t all that terrible on paper, and that with some tweaks as well as a change in destination, this could have probably been a compelling anime. It’s just those critical logic, setting, and idea/commentary blunders among other issues that kill the script.

The characters aren’t great either, even with a few cute moments here and there. It’s never a good sign when the two main leads in your show tend to feel virtually identical outside of their pasts and how they react to a deranged superfan/musician who goes mental around Tuesday. Carole is more of the tomboy type while Tuesday is more of the girly girl type, and that’s basically the main thing differentiating them...when it’s noticeable. Simply put, Carole and Tuesday don’t have much chemistry or anything interesting in their personalities or interactions. Their manager is ok. He has some interesting bits regarding former friends and his former lover and another former partner, but that’s about it aside from being a bumbling tough guy looking manager. The last member of the main quad squad is Roddy, who is just a shy guy with connections, and nothing else. I suppose he’s better than the myriad of stereotypes we meet in the Mars Brightest show such as the rapper stereotype. The worst has to be the insufferable Instagram boy always saying shit like “pow” in the most obnoxious way possible because clearly making a character out of zoomer stereotypes was a great idea.

Honestly, the most engaging character was that one guy named Skip from episode 6 who gave C&T some wise words of encouragement before talking with a former love and then playing the song “Unrequited love”. The latter conversation in particular is one of the few times where the show just uses strong implication and actually good dialogue to convey what’s going on. This is a character who feels more tangible and engaging than the actual characters in this show, and he doesn’t reappear until episode 14. He doesn’t even play a major role in episode 6, and I was excited to see him return! Sadly, the show abandons him and his guys shortly thereafter when they could have easily filled the roles some non-entity characters fill in during the final ⅓ of the show. This anime does seem to abandon a few characters, like Angela’s female manager at the end of the first half. She’s absent for an incredibly long time, and all because of contrived, surprisingly vague circumstances.

The anime does try to have some of the stereotype characters flesh out their views and whatnot so the show can feel more lived in, but none of them are particularly engaging. Even then, that only goes for the Mars Brightest stereotypes, not the political stereotypes. Tuesday’s mom is especially lame as she’s just a typical amoral politician created by fusing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton together with the spell card Polymerization. She even drops a line about deporting illegal immigrants cuz this show likes to be very on the nose about its commentary and conflicts. She’s also influenced by a typical scheming advisor because of course she is. The show needs a main antagonist, even if he has nothing to do with our main leads beyond a few actions that indirectly impact them. They do get into some conflict by the end because the mother has to be redeemed at all costs, but that’s not enough to make this worthwhile. It all devolves into a bout of sugary, exceptionally rushed nonsense bin the last two episodes, anyway.

I also get the feeling that we’re supposed to like Angela. Despite the show making her out to be a complete bitch at every turn, we’re supposed to feel joy whenever she wins something, and sympathy for her just because of a scene that implies that she was abused by one of her parents (if only the show’s dialogue was more consistently clever). Yet she talks about actively abusing her managers for fun as the reason why she doesn’t want an AI manager. This isn’t an Asuka from Evangelion situation where we’re supposed to understand the character as she gets peeled back regardless of whether or not we like her. We’re supposed to like Angela, especially when she determines that she wants a fair match against C&T instead of her winning cuz of them getting sabotaged. We’re supposed to like her when she tells her cold, AI-loving manager, Tao a bit about her past thanks to circumstances regarding his AI programs knowing everything about her. We’re supposed to fear for her when she gets targeted by a stalker and feel for her when we know that she’s doing everything for her mother’s dream at the cost of herself. Seeing what becomes of her in the final act is interesting, so the show does have me on her side by the end in terms of character writing. I just wish the presentation was better.

For an anime prominently featuring and referencing music, the show’s songs are unfortunately hit or miss. I am somewhat ambivalent on the first opening, and I absolutely hate the second. However, both C&T and Angela have a song that I actually kind of like, that being their respective ending themes: “Hold Me Now” and “Not Afraid”. Otherwise’ I’ve gone over enough of their tracks for one lifetime. The other pop artists/characters such as Lauren Dyson’s performance as Crystal or J. R. Price as Pyotr the Instagram boy don’t do much for me either. The fact that they make up a majority of the songs in this show hurts because not only does an actually nice OST by Mocky get pushed practically out of existence by the 8th episode, but I do like a majority of the other songs. Maika Loubte’s (Cybelle) “La Ballade”, Thundercat’s “Unrequited Love”, Madison McFerrin’s (GGK) “Milky Way” and “Gravity Bounce” make up some of the many nice songs the non-pop singers perform for this show. The production for these songs is a lot more interesting and varied, and while not all of them have necessarily interesting lyrics either, they’re a lot more engaging and memorable than Angela’s or C&T’s songs. Even the latter’s songs get better over time anyway, so there ends up being a few tracks from them I actually find decent to listen to. If nothing else, this anime does provide a gateway to a variety of interesting artists, so I can appreciate that fundamental aspect of the show. I just wish that Mocky’s OST wasn’t mixed so low after a while cuz I actually want to hear more than just the eyecatches track and the piece that plays during the 30 seconds of recap at the start of every episode.

Carole and Tuesday's contemporary, unadventurous feel even extends to the visual presentation. This doesn't feel like a Shinichirou Watanabe anime. I don't know what goes into being chief director, which is his role in the show outside of original creator, but I'd assume that there would be some real ambition or flare in the camera work of this show. Instead, it feels like just about anyone even remotely competent at anime direction and cinematography could have made it. That's probably because Motonobu Hori was the regular director credit for this show. He does do a fairly decent job, but there aren’t many moments that feel particularly enticing in terms of cinematography and presentation.

The visuals by studio Bones are about as solid. The anime sports a vivid, varied set of character designs, often with different types of heads and faces that still mostly feel like they all come from the same world. There are some dazzling light show sequences as well, like with GGK, a contestant in the Mars Brightest talent show who has her outfit synch with the moving galaxy patterns in the background. I can't deny that outside of some dodgy CGI sequences and instruments, the show looks rather good, especially when they're able to pull off that aforementioned sequence on top of having overhead crowd shots that don't contain CGI. Still, even with generally solid, sometimes exceptional visual presentation, I can't help but feel jaded in context. It doesn’t help that the production does go downhill for part of the show’s third quarter thanks to less overall polish and further reliance on bad CGI instruments and objects. Even in the early episodes, we see our main duo's awkward CGI hands and instruments, so it's not like the production was ever that great.

Where did it all go wrong? You'd expect an original anime, especially one with Watanabe as one of the credits, to showcase a ton of ambition and creative freedom. This feels the exact opposite, with only the vibrant city and character designs having any sort of flair. Unlike previous works like Macross Plus or Bebop, there isn't that same creative drive here. It's more about mass appeal, which Watanabe had already excelled at without even trying to. As a result, Carole & Tuesday feels empty and artificial, requiring dismal writing and uneven music to fill the void that ambition once filled. How fitting then, that it embodies the sugary, overly melodramatic, trendy pop music it employs so often. That said, even pop music tends to have a clear goal it wants to commit to. Carole and Tuesday has a bunch of ideas and concepts it merely pays lipservice to before barely going through with any of them. If nothing else, I hope Shinichiro Watanabe and his wife are satisfied with this product. I wish I could be.



By the way, since we’re getting political, I have to ask: where are my hispanics at?! You’ve been tackling the deportation of illegal immigrants via a Trump x Hillary character, an issue that affects my people, yet we get no representation in the show outside of arguably the guy Denzel Curry performed as. What the fuck? I say “arguably” cuz we don't even know. At most, he dropped a line about speaking Spanish. That’s it! You got all sorts of white and black people, as well as a bunch of LGBTQ+ characters and people of other ethnicities and whatnot, but not us while you’re tackling our issue? Piece o’ shiet!

10161,"Firstly, do I recommend No.06? In a word, no.

With that out of the way, let me explain why this show isn't worth your time with a list:

- Bone simple characters
- Forgettable side characters in general
- Lazy world building
- Weak overarching plot

No.06 takes place in your typical ""1984"" dystopian future where the government controls every aspect of life. I myself am a sucker for this type of setting with 'A Brave New World' being a particular favorite of mine. Speaking of which, No.06 is basically 'A Brave New World' and '1984' rolled together, but with boy-love thrown into the mix. The main character is a handome male youth named Shion. One day, Shion meets a strange outsider of society named Nezumi who also happens to be a handsome male youth, they instantly bond over their shared youthful handsomeness. Sadly for Shion, Nezumi departs and leaves him with the government's Thought Police on his doorstep.

Several years pass in the story and Shion is now living in a favela outside of the city having been kicked out of the 'utopia'. There is now a unexplained bee plague that has popped up and is now terrorizing random people by rapidly aging them. Shion, having learned of the plague is kidnapped by the Ministry of Love, but is then rescued by Nezumi who has returned. Together the two handsome youthful heroes decide to find the source of the plague against the Ministry of Truth's wishes. Also, it's revealed that Shion has the plague, but doesn't instantly die like everybody else for some reason.

There you have it, a summary of the first two episodes of No.06. No, you did not misread that, two episodes. This entire show is eleven episodes long. Perhaps I should have mentioned that No.06 is based on the light novel series of the same name by Atsuko Asano, which itself totaled nine volumes. Nine volumes, eleven twenty-three minute episodes, that adds up to an entire novel for every twenty-eight minutes of animation. It is no wonder that the characters, plot, and world building are so watered down and poorly executed here. Unfortunately the story goes rapidly downhill with too many characters being introduced and then disappearing immediately afterwards with no explaination or closure with a shoddy crap-shoot ending to cap it all off. If you are familliar with false-utopia sci-fi novels, then you can probably tell how this story will end right from the get-go, it's got all the tropes.

I have to admit, it has been a while since I watched No.06. I seem to remember the environments and backgrounds looking pretty and animation in general being well done. Character designs are above average and are well executed in motion and long-shots as well. Sound is hard to remember, so I'll put that down as forgettable. Overall dispite having a million things happening every episode, you end up forgetting all of it because the characters are paper-thin and the pacing is insane.

Art - 6.5
Sound - 5
Story - 3
Enjoyment - 4.5

Watch 'From the New World' instead. It's got a similar false-utopia setting, but it has its own identity and will keep you hooked from beginning to end."
99424,"SSSS. Gridman, what an adventure.  I'll try to make this review as spoiler-free as possible.
From the show's relatively humble beginnings to it's grandiose end, it's was excellent all the way through.

SSSS.Gridman is an amusing blend of genres, putting one of the spotlights on the school life aspect of it's main cast but driving itself forward through both elements of Mecha and Kaijuu tokusatsu shows. It's the perfect transition to animation an original Henshin tokusatsu show could ever ask for.

Every episode is littered with great cinematography, art and animation accompanied with high energy tracks that compliment the production.
It's filled to the brim with 2D sakuga and fluid CG animation which shows just how passionate the staff was about the whole show.
The atmosphere's carefully crafted by the proper use of soundtracks and effects combined with the cinematography consisting of airless, sort of confined shots of the blistering summer heat and oppressive cloudy rains. It gives the show a sense of an identity that a lot of recent anime just can't seem to grasp.
The sound design is especially amazing at giving audio feedback during these scenes, a vehicle being crushed, the ground crumbling under a monster, and all of the attacks sound so visceral and lifelike.

The story is rather formulaic as it sticks to a Monster of The Week format but the archetypical structure of the format is broken down in a few places, making way for an actual overarching plot within the setup.
Every plot point the show setup was unveiled at a proper pacing, and while the characters lacked development outside of Akane, the underlying themes still got through and eventually culminated into it's fantastic ending which saw Akane finally facing herself instead of finding fault in everything else.

The entire roster is colorful and visually distinct, making them easy to remember, and potentially iconic - someday, down the line.
The development for Hibiki, Rikka and Utsumi did feel kind of miniscule in the grand scheme of things and they should've gotten more screen time addressing their personal characteristics but the main focus of the plot didn't really require much on that front so they can be given a pass.

Overall it's a great show that's totally worth everyone's time and attention."
162670,"Pour cette fois-ci je ne vais pas résumer par ordre chronologique mais par ordre global mon appréciation quant à cette nouvelle saison de Dr. Stone

➜ Pour moi, il s'agit désormais de la meilleure saison de l'anime, moi apprécie énormément l'oeuvre de base, cette saison m'a énormément touché. 

A commencer par les retrouvailles entre la majorité des personnages, un bien fou lorsqu'on a terminé la partie précédente avec seulement une poignée de personnages encore présents. Peu importe la situation, leurs caractères ne changent pas et c'est très appréciable.

Un des moments m'ayant le plus marqué restera le reveal par rapport à la pétrification du grand patron, on apprend finalement que la plus haute autorité est Ibara puisque celui-ci manipule tout depuis le début. Un moment assez choquant bien qu'assez devinable, mais ça a son charme et ça permet de comprendre qu'on a pas affaire à des idiots mais bien à des guerriers réfléchis. 
Je parlerai évidemment de ces personnages : 
- En commençant par Ibara, ce mec est juste trop intelligent, il manipule presque tout le monde depuis le début, il sait utiliser sa tête et est loin d'être mauvais en combat. Il aura su donner du fil à retordre à nos protagoniste en ayant anticipé bien des choses. Entre son introduction où il m'a carrément fait flipper dans la partie 1, à sa fin durant cette fin de saison, grand respect sur ce mec, qui ne sera sûrement jamais dépétrifié. A part ça, on voit bien que le mec s'en fout des autres, jusqu'à tout pétrifier, on pourrait limite assimiler ça au fait de vouloir devenir le roi du monde. Dommage pour lui, il est tombé sur plus intelligent que lui 
- Ensuite, on a Mozu, quelqu'un de très réfléchi, qui est littéralement neutre prêt à trahir son camp tout en annihilant l'autre, un personnage dangereux qui nous aura offert un peu de stress et des beaux combats, un personnage très réfléchi qui a compris les manigances qui se tramaient, difficilement manipulable, ça aurait été sympa de le voir plus à l'oeuvre, mais finalement tant mieux, ça ne créera pas d'abus à cause des écarts de puissance, car on peut le dire ce n'est ni Magma ni Kinro, ni même un autre personnage qu'on verra plus tard qui l'aurait terrassé.
- Finalement, on a Kirisame, personnage assez décevant, même si dans la finalité je l'apprécie, c'est l'exemple parfait d'une grosse tête manipulée par l'antagoniste, un personnage amené comme méchant mais qui finalement est la plus humaine d'entre eux, ne croyant qu'à son véritable chef, en espérant vivre sa vie. Aucun combat dans cette saison, et une trahison digne de ce nom, mais un grand apport à nos protagonistes, une guerrière supplémentaire à ajouter au royaume de la science, ça fait plaisir, surtout qu'elle a l'air loin d'être stupide.

A part ces antagonistes, on va passer à quelques personnages qu'il est important de noter également : 
- Le retour de Hyoga, un personnage que j'attendais, et quel plaisir c'était de le voir sortir de sa cage, il nous aura donné un beau combat contre Mozu. Exemple même de la neutralité, comme Mozu, il décidera de prendre le parti du royaume de la science en affrontant Mozu, Il se fera dominer la plupart du temps, et son combat terminera sur une égalité, malgré un petit avantage récupéré à la fin, même si ce fut court, quel plaisir de l'avoir revu combattre, plus aucune trace de pétrification au visage un plaisir. J'espère qu'il sera dépétrifié, j'imagine que des antagonistes forts feront leur apparition dans la dernière saison
- Comment ne pas parler de Tsukasa, bien que vu un seul petit épisode, celui-ci ne change pas et reste le même, et quel plaisir aussi de le voir, bien qu'il ne fasse pas parti de mes personnages préférés, le voir fait chaud au coeur, j'espère le revoir à l'oeuvre durant la dernière saison
- J'aimerai également parler de Soyouz, un peu de mal avec lui au départ, mais c'est un vrai frère finalement, grâce à lui la science possède un nouvel allié, et c'est trop cool, un peu triste de le laisser là-bas mais bon, c'est la vie
- Dernier personnage, qui celui-ci est une déception, Matsukaze, j'ai carrément du copier coller son nom, il sort de nul part pour apporter une nouvelle quête, ça permet juste de donner une espèce d'importance à Ginro alors qu'on s'en fout, il sort de nul part, et il ne change rien à l'histoire en elle-même, un personnage inutile qui m'a un peu lâché de l'épisode. 

Sortons enfin des personnages, parlons des actions en elle-même.
- La première, la pétrification de Kohaku, une belle idée de sa part afin de sauver Ginro, bien qu'il s'agit d'un désavantage considérable surtout en terme de combat, elle sait utiliser son cerveau afin d'assurer sa survie en croyant en ses amis, et cette scène, sur le toit de la maison du grand patron, m'a touché, je m'attendais à voir un mort cette saison, finalement non, mais cette scène m'a amplement suffit
- Une autre scène que j'apprécie, est l'idée du drone, bien que farfelu de sortir ça d'un coup, c'était bien pensé. 
- On a enfin Médusa dans la poche, et voir qu'un outil aussi simple d'utilisation et dévastateur existe, fait froid dans le dos, bien qu'assez déçu à la fin quand on apprend qu'il manque un câble d'iphone pour le charger, ça signifie sûrement que plus personne ne sera pétrifié, ou du moins pas avec celui-ci.
- J'ai bien accroché à l'assaut du bateau et à sa conclusion, la pétrification globale m'a beaucoup touché et l'idée qu'ils ont eu est très sympa avec le délire d'équidistance, même si je trouve que c'est anormal d'y penser dans cette situation. 
- La confrontation finale j'ai adoré, entre la bataille de cerveau contre la montre de la pétrification, le sacrifice du goat Ryusui, pépite, ça met fin à la racaille Ibara
- Une des scènes finales, j'ai failli chialer, seul au bord de la falaise en recevant l'appel de Ruri, incroyable comme scène et très beau

A part ça, hâte de voir la prochaine saison, à peine arrivés qu'ils sont déjà repartis, j'espère juste que ça ne se terminera pas trop vite vu le nombre de chapitre qu'il faut encore adapter."
98635,"The anime portrays before us the two realities that marks the transformation from the life of high school to the life of an adult who is basically a NEET and condemned by the society for not being able enough to work his/her way out. 
The portrayal of the two dimensions of the life and the very nature of the RElife experiment shows that how the shift in the attitude of a person takes place when the transaction from the life of a high schooler to adulthood takes place. The straightforward and friendly person like Kiazaki suffers from betrayal and the cruel and harsh treatment of the society forgetting the fact that other person is also a human and needs help and reliance on others. Hishiro has completely independent personality and since she does not know how to get along well with other people, she gets bully for being too self-centered instead of helping her to get along with others just like in high school. The stark contrast has been shown between the two worlds and how reliving the moments of early life can bring drastic changes in the personality of the individual. It is perfectly okay to enjoy the moments and make as many memories as a person wants instead of overthinking about the future. Living in the moment is the best possible solutions to every problems that comes with worrying about the future and its consequences. Making best use of the present time and enjoying and feeling both the happiness and the sorrows of the life are important components of the life. The anime highlights this feature of life a lot that it is okay to be interested in anyone, it is okay to feel sad and dejected sometimes, the feeling of enjoying and living and making the best part of your every moment is what matters and the people may vanish from the lives but memories remain and can be lived and relived through experiences. It is okay to not rush through things but feel them naturally, confirm them for one’s own benefit and act on them in a natural way learning and growing each and every day of the life. Even though the person will vanish and the present moment is only an illusion but it is definitely okay to let it have a chance and live the moment to the very fullest. I really like the way Hishiro is trying to understand herself and says that another emotion is spurring inside her when she was avoiding Arata to confirm her own feelings and gain a different perspective. The moment she decided to ask Arata for date was cute. The message were too formal to be perceived as asking for date.  Arata and Hishiro are always trying to carry things out from other person’s perspective to not harm the feelings or destroy the memories of the other person which is a really thought provoking perspective of both of them.  But personally I think that the experiment in its very nature reveal the cruel fact that with the passage and sweep of time we tend to forget the most important people in our lives that make the most part of us. But we should never give up in connecting the dots together and trying to understand things while living in the moment at the same time. Good things are bound to happen because time is not always bad. The one thing that piqued my interest was the reason Kaizaki took the job to work in the experiment as well to make the people who have given up on themselves to be liberated from their sadness and make them relive the moments they once cherished, giving them the confidence they once had."
97592,"Demi-chan wa Kataritai ( Interviews with Monster girl ) is an anime released in winter of 2017. An anime released by A-1 pictures With the genres of comedy, slice of life and supernatural. Demi-chan wa Kataritai is the 9th most popular anime in winter 2017 and the 8th most highest rated in winter 2017. To be honest, i used a  [random anime generator](https://www.randomanime.org/) and chose a random anime from my anilist planning list and Demi-chan wa Kataritai was the anime it chose. I genuinely looked forward to watching it as it was about monster girls.

This story follows 4 female Demi-humans ( Demis ) and one male protagonist Tatsuo Takahashi which I feel that he is the most main character. Takahashi is a biology teacher who comes across 4 demis. As much as he wanted to interview for his research, he later finds out about the problems they face or they may face. So he takes charge of counselling them and to provide them support they need. Because of that the 3 student demis became best friends and the succubus teacher who tries to avoid interaction with Takahashi became friendly with the bunch as well. The demi students who tried to avoid interaction with the norm broke out of their shell and became friends with a lively bunch of humans as well.
But I feel some spices were missing such as a good plot twist near the end. All the major plot twists were solved by Takahashi at the beginning and it was a smooth sail from then and it didn’t feel good.
Story 80/100

As mentioned before, this anime wraps around 5 main characters. 

He is the main protagonist in my opinion. He's  a biology teacher at a school who wished to learn more about Demis. Lucky for him, at the start of new year 4 demi students joined the school as well as a demi teacher. This was a huge jackpot to him. He started hanging out with them and asking questions to each of them purely out of curiosity. However  later he finds out about their struggles and he starts to help them personally. 
To be honest when I made my first impression on this anime I thought it's going to be an anime with a harem of an old teacher and students but it turns out that he is just a normal teacher who turned out to be super cool. Although some demis had crushes on him it did not go beyond that. 

Hikari turns out to be a vampire, but the impression of a classic vampire and Hikari is totally different. As a vampire one of her weaknesses is the sun, but it's not like she sleeps at day time like a classical vampire. As the summer heat tends to wear her down, Hikari hangs out in Takahashi’s office where its air conditioned. She gets blood to drink from the government. Hakaris character can be described as clingy and very joyful.

Machi is a dullahan. A dullahan is a fairy tale character in which their head is separated from their neck. Most fairy tales describe them as knights in shining armor . Unfortunately there are only 3 dullahans left in the world. Machi had an insecurity with others as her head was separated, but Takahashi helped her to get over it. She also had a crush on Takahashi but it did not extend further than that. Having a crush on a hot teacher in high school is i think pretty normal for some people but i never saw anyone like that. However they did go on a date but for Takahashi it was an experiment. Hikari was the mastermind of the date.

Yuki is a snowwoman. She had a serious social issue as she was too self conscious of being a snow woman, she had the horror idea of freezing others around her, so she kept her distance. One day he overhears some students gossiping about her in  the bathroom. This caused her very much pain but Takahasi solved her problem and she became friends with everyone. 

Satou is a succubus. If you don't know what a succubus is, then you're missing out. I feel for you. As a succubus Satou restricts herself from contacting the other gender. When a male touches he has a eromatic feeling for her. To avoid such situations she takes the first train and the last from work to home. She lives in a jungle out of people. One day she accidentally touches Takahashi and her aphrodisiac did not work on him. At Least that’s what she thought. She eventually got a crush on him and went her way out to get him.
Characters  100/100

The anime had great visual quality in my opinion. There were nice scenes in the anime like the starting is super nice. A-1 pictures achieved to show different emotions in different scenes with the power of visuals. In general i don’t have a bad opinion about the visuals.
Visuals 100/100 

It had a nice op and ending songs. The characters had kawai voices that fit them perfectly. 
Audio 100/100

Demi-chan wa Kataritai has a bunch of funny moments. As a slice of life, it showed us the life of a High school. The way that comedy was mixed with the daily life situation is super hilarious. There were moments I burst out of laughter.
Enjoyment 100/100

This is a great anime. I really recommend Demi-chan wa Kataritai to new anime watchers. This anime is a good mixture of sad and happy and comedy moments.its well balanced and i think that's the best type to watch when you start out."
10162,"The slice of life genre can be described to some as a parallel to the reality of an average person appealing to the naturalistic side of ourselves; whether that’d be hardships through life lessons, growing up and facing the real world, or experiencing something for the first time that leaves you in awe. It can also be viewed by others as a display of mundane experiences lacking conflict and development for the story and characters, solely presented to 'tug the heartstrings' of a person. It's a challenging idea to demonstrate for a wide variety of audiences who have their own preferences of what slice of life has to offer, simply by the fact that everyone is unique, and will experience different aspects of what life has to offer as they grow up. 

Usagi Drop manages to create a fine balance of what slice of life anime should strive for; showcasing realism told through a strong narrative. Usagi Drop is about what it means to be a family, and how raising a child has its merits and challenges. We are presented with something that has a mature feeling about each situation Kawachi Daikichi, the main character, encounters when put to the task of raising Rin Kawa, his grandfather’s illegitimate daughter, taxing his already stressful life of being a single, working man. Usagi Drop doesn’t try to woe you with pretty aesthetics or complicated characters to analyze, it’s trying to showcase an event in our lives that will happen to most people: parenthood; as well as time management, dealing with no duel income, stress when things don’t go your way, and normal things that eventually pile up and happen to us.



Usagi Drop isn’t just solely based on a parent’s perspective of life though, we also get to witness what the children in the anime are feeling as well, with Rin specifically, on how losing a loved one and moving in with a stranger you just met from the same family has an effect on you psychologically. Presenting two perspectives on the same situation of starting a family is a sign of a strong narrative, as it can relate to two different types of people watching the anime to get a better idea on the greater thematic value the show displays through realistic scenarios each of these characters go through. Maturity in the story-telling is what made the immersion and enjoyment so much more enjoyable than your typical run-of-the-mill anime. Not once was disbelief suspended, nor did I have to go back to understand something that didn't make sense the first time around due to flawed logic. 

Charm in not only the story, but characters, is a frequent occurrence that makes Usagi Drop differentiate from majority of Slice of Life anime. Daikichi is the perfect example of how to write a realistic character, and in fact, a dad. With popular dad characters like Shou Tucker, Gendou Ikari, and Gamino, perspectives on what a fatherly figure is positively shown is a rare occurrence. Daikichi is a loving, compassionate, and hardworking fatherly figure that supports Rin’s transition into his life and will go to any lengths he can to make sure she’s comfortable and gets the proper necessities, while also spoiling her. Awkward and laid-back, but brimming with motivation and determination. Rin is a believable child character. With a side of independence and maturity, she also has a childish side to her who eventually learns to open up more and love her family that once shunned her. Masako, Rin’s biological mother, takes the role as the typical ‘I don’t want anything to do with my child’ role, but has a unique personality and traits of a stressful, mangaka workaholic who never could possibly have time to support Rin. The supporting characters, the Nitani family, are very similar to Daikichi and Rin with a single parent raising one child. Both the mother and Daikichi, as well as Kouki and Rin, become friends that help each other when dealing with later occurrences, while also learning from each other.

Scenes incorporating the right use of music to enhance the overall mood, as well as visuals to enrich the beauty of the anime were all very solid and consistent, never breaking off or diminishing in quality. While the anime is beautiful on its own, and setting up the mood helps make scenes and story telling more influential through visuals and sound, it's important to not pay too much attention to these sort of details in Usagi Drop's case, as what really shines is how the narrative and characters connect to make a grand experience of witnessing life.

What kind of an effect did Usagi Drop leave on me? It made me realize the importance of family and how important it is to stay in touch with them. Falling outs with family members is tragic and unfortunate, or with loved one dying. It’s a situation where you as an individual need others to help coupe with such feelings that friends may not be able to understand clearly as much as family members do. It made me realize how life is moving fast, and at any minute something can happen which can result in your entire perspective on life changed in an instant. Treasuring moments now instead of waiting for what’s in store for the future will help you better understand what it means to live and start a family. Now, I’m not a father/parent, nor was I adopted. So I’m sure that people who actually are can relate to Usagi Drop on another level. Even so, that didn’t hinder my outcome on what the core message Usagi Drop was trying to showcase. Anyone can see the value and beauty in such a heartwarming, telling narrative, recommended for anyone who wants a realistic approach on what your future might be like when raising a child."

Once again, the Index series continues on with its story between the two great divisions of mankind: religion and science. Bringing the old and the new together, the second season expands its world of supernatural powers with greater proximity. There are indicators of something huge brewing right around the corner but quite frustratingly, the ever-present narrative issues are still there to dent the story's full potential.

Compared to its predecessor, the second season follows more or less the same formulaic method as the first season, except now, we have some hints to a bigger story. Having a core that holds each arc together gives everything one more level of significance. After all, this is a world where religion and science coexist with one another. It's definitely a story idea full of potential.

But like I've said already, a couple of negative factors sadly bog down the story. The biggest perpetrator is the mishandled pacing that felt too fast here and there. Especially for a complex world like the Index series, a rushed pacing will not bode well at all because it's synonymous to a jumbled-up story. And when you have a jumbled-up story, you will have an awkward time trying to process the many information, interactions, and fights that are present here.

img()

So, how about the concepts of the story? Well, it's clear that there are more substantial movements going on in the religion side with various Christian sects such as the antagonistic Roman Catholic Church making their move. Touma, along with his mysterious right hand and other existing and new characters, must prevent their hostility from affecting the fragile balance of the world. In terms of the characters, the antagonists make up a pretty poor group of people driven by weak reasonings. When combined with their little screen time, they aren't that impactful to the story. They can be entertaining, but you will only reach the bedrock if you want to dig deep for any three-dimensional qualities. Character development is still not a very important factor for this series and as for the unlucky Touma, while he has his tendency to just shout idealistic lines and punch faces, his generic aspects serve as a good dichotomy against the diverse religious and scientific workings, like a litmus paper that functions under different conditions.

The last few episodes, thankfully, brings this season off to a solid conclusion with the focus on the Dark Side of Academy City along with some huge conflicts looming between the religion and the science side. Accelerator, the strongest esper who is also the face of Academy City's darkest secrets, gets more anti-heroic attention here and is put into a parallel comparison with Touma, highlighting their similarities and differences. This neatly ties in with the multifaceted viewpoints of the Index series and is definitely the strongest dynamic for this season.

Another good factor I enjoyed, albeit in the lighthearted zone, is the slices-of-life, usually constituting verbal dialogues that are clever in their humor. There are not as many of these compared to the first season, but they dampen up the inharmonious main story when they do appear. Basically a nice breath of air every once in a while, though the fan service ones are still not that tasteful.

Artistically speaking, the visual is now cleaner with better line work and this results in an environment that is pretty much more polished in all aspects. Particularly, the backgrounds deserve a shout out just because of the high-quality glints that emit through the screen. A lot of the blue vibrancy in the backdrops brings out the magical and supernatural tone of this show, so it's definitely a cool complementary effect. As for the animation, it tends to be inconsistent but once the final climax of the fight comes in and Touma grips that right fist of his, the animation is amplified to noticeable levels. You might get a kick out of seeing all the close-ranged shots of faces getting punched to oblivion. I sure as hell did.

Then we finally have the improved line-up of soundtracks. Of course, the upbeat electronic music with fast beats per minute is still there to pump up the fight scenes but there's a distinguishable presence of angelic soundtracks as well that really fits the religious theme. The diverse range of voice actors further contributes to the entertaining factor and especially for the antagonists, the expression of various personalities is the definition of eargasmic. Mami Kawada also knows how to sing cool opening songs while the second ending theme has a gentle melody that is a treat to listen to.

All in all, the second season of the Index series is a passable continuation. The anime suffers the most from a rushed pacing which left out quite a bit of relevant information from the light novels, affecting how the characters are treated and decreasing the enjoyment value. But religion and science have finally collided with each other this season. What happens next will certainly be bigger than anything we've seen so far.

img600()

Things can get worse. They can always get worse. Ordinarily I don’t actively go out of my way to watch bad anime or things that clearly are not going to appeal to me, but I do make an exception on occasion. At the start of every year I challenge myself to complete an anime that I just know will be so bad that I’ll walk away with a new sense of what bad truly means. Some might call this masochism, some might call it a waste of time. But honestly there is a value to doing something like this. It can make me look back at other anime that bothered me and start appreciating things about it. It can make me go through a new seasonal anime and think “yeah this isn’t good, but at least it wasn’t like that”. It’s the same kind of logic as standing next to an ugly person to look hot. So in a way watching a piece of trash has its perks. But don’t let that fool you into thinking that what we have here isn’t one of the worst things I’ve ever had to see. Just when I thought things couldn’t get worse, they did. “Black Butler II” is the 2010 follow up to 2008’s “Black Butler”. While the first season adapted content from Yana Toboso’s manga and then split away doing its own thing, the same cannot be said for the sequel. It’s all original content for the anime as written by the screenwriter for season one, Mari Okada. So you know who to blame. Fans will often discourage people from watching season two because its filler, but while I think that’s along the right track for why this is terrible it doesn’t quite capture the problem. The issue isn’t simply that they didn’t adapt Toboso’s story. It’s that they could have done anything they wanted and went with the most aggravating, the most tasteless, the most mind numbing thing possible. Get ready, we’re in for a long ride.

“Black Butler II” starts us out with a boy named Alois Trancy who has made a pact with a demon named Claude Faustus. Both characters created for the anime. Alois is the arrogant and violently abusive heir to the wealthy Trancy estate while Claude has the emotional range of a brick. One night a strange figure that is obviously Sebastian Michaelis appears on their doorstep carrying a suitcase. He’s allowed in and after a while makes his way through the mansion and finds a tin of tea that results in a fight between him and Claude. Eventually the suitcase is opened revealing the unconscious body of Ciel Phantomhive. Sebastian manages to escape with Ciel and the tea which is revealed to contain Ciel’s family ring. Once he places it on Ciel’s hand the boy wakes up, but it’s discovered he has amnesia and cannot remember the majority of events that took place during season one. How I wish that was me. As the episodes play out Ciel and Alois’s stories intertwine and we experience a tale of lies, revenge, schemes, and very uncomfortable sexual fanservice.

One of the biggest issues I had with this anime was its writing. It feels like Mari Okada just made the story up as she went along without having a coherent plan in mind. The first episode spends all of its time with Alois and Claude, but then the next several episodes only vaguely make mention of Claude until he appears again in episode four to invite Sebastian and Ciel to the Trancy estate for a costume party. As much as I disliked their characters it still felt strange placing so much importance on them only to just dial it back to showing Ciel and Sebastian solving mysteries like they did in season one. And when your anime is only twelve episodes long you can’t really waste time like this. You would think the subplot about Ciel’s amnesia would be something sufficient enough to make those episodes interesting, but it isn’t. The way it’s handled makes for a rather confused viewing experience. Sebastian told the other characters to just roll with things and act like nothing is off with Ciel. But the way the anime handled that ended up making it feel more like the show just forgot the events of season one. For example, Lau and Ran-Mao are back and alive and nobody reacts to this. And we aren’t told how they’re still here until literally the last six minutes of the final episode. Once we do bring Alois and Claude back into the forefront it actually gets worse. Episode five is the point where I just knew the anime was never going to redeem itself. There we see Alois force his maid Hannah, who’s eye he gouged out in episode one because she looked at him when he intentionally spilled a drink, to strip off her clothes in a moment of male gaze fanservice so that he can go about his costume party dressed as a girl despite having other dresses to choose from. He manages to get Ciel alone and waxes poetic about the deep blue of his eyes and then licks his ear so that he can distract him long enough to steal his eyepatch while I feel my brain turn to butter.

The shota fanservice in this anime is really horrendous and believe me we will talk about that later.  But as things transpire from this point until the finale everything just gets so convoluted and frustrating. Conflicts that you don’t care about because you know it isn’t canon, drawn out backstories that disgust you instead of move you, reveals that feel like unnecessary padding more than anything. Things that you’d expect them to expand upon feel glossed over, like why Claude cared enough about Ciel to steal his soul at the beginning, and then we waste a lot of time on things that ultimately impacted nothing like Grell. It quite honestly winds up becoming an incredibly stupid anime that never feels like it has a clear sense of what it is doing and why. It just knows it wants you to see grown men kiss pubescent boy’s feet. Anything else is inconsequential. 

Not only is this a mess on a story level, the dialogue also needs mentioning. You see this isn’t just a dumb anime, it’s the kind of dumb anime that still somehow thinks its saying something. Characters will often speak in dramatic monologues using all kinds of metaphors that give the impression that something worthwhile is supposed to be said, but it just ends up feeling like listening to someone drone on and on because they like the sound of their voice. 

img600()

img600()
img600()

And yet despite that the anime still takes it upon itself to explain incredibly obvious things to the audience, just in case you don’t get it.

img600()
img600()

So we basically have a show with its priorities all over the place with dialogue that suggests it thinks it’s smarter than it is, but that you the audience are too stupid to understand obvious things without them telling you. And yet so many plot significant things feel underdeveloped or get explained in a blink and you miss it style moment. This is probably the worst thing Mari Okada will ever write and frankly it’s not surprising to me that she didn’t bother returning to write any of the other installments after this. 

So we need to talk about Alois. His character ends up becoming one of my biggest issues with the entire anime, but it isn’t because he’s annoying and made incredibly unlikable from day one. I mean, he is, but that isn’t the only problem. The problem is his character feels like it exists for the purpose of pandering to shotacon and anything else is just pretense. Literally the first scene of the entire anime is us finding him bruised and naked in bed with the elderly Earl of Trancy. Because the mark of his contract with Claude appears on his tongue we regularly get shots of him licking his lips, then as we observe him through his interactions with Claude we get a strong sexual vibe with them. The scenes with him and Claude are very uncomfortable to look at. Alois’s attachment to him is so creepy, but the anime just treats it as another outlet for fanservice. The worst though comes when we get to his backstory. Alois was born a poor boy named Jim Macken who lived on the streets with his little brother Luka. One day everyone in the village including Luka dies and he is kidnapped and taken to the Trancy estate to be a sexual plaything for the Earl. He overhears other boys who’ve been brought to the mansion talk about how a fairy will grant your wishes and this leads to his first encounter with Claude. Afterwards he has decided to actively seduce the Earl to become his favorite and he acquires his new name and status and eventually takes over after the Earl’s death. From there he is shown to be either an abrasive tyrant who hits women, a sniveling crybaby who needs Claude to function, or a sexual object.

img600()

You got all that? Because you need to understand that this was so unbearable for me to sit through that I got a headache.  Seeing him seduce this fat pig of a man and have it be framed like “check it out he’s taking back control of his life through his sexuality” was disgusting. It does not matter how hard Okada tries to push the idea that this child is in control of the situation, he is still a kid being raped by an adult man. And there feels like no awareness to the fact that in this situation he is still a rape victim, he is still a child being taken advantage of by an adult. Just because he is intentionally trying to win the favor of the Earl it doesn’t mean he has the power that the anime thinks he does. And it’s all for the sake of contextualizing the way he’s sexualized throughout the anime. This isn’t some kind of portrait of a person internalizing their own trauma and falling into similar situations because they don’t know another way. That is giving this anime way more credit than it deserves. This is all just an excuse for the anime to show off that they made a sexy twelve year old. The fact that it made me write that sentence already makes me want to die, but knowing that it never thinks twice about doing such things makes the anime just reprehensible. The shota fanservice was present in season one, but not to this same degree. Ciel was sexualized, but he still felt like he existed for reasons beyond that. Alois doesn’t and given his importance throughout the anime it makes sitting through it nauseating. 

img600()

The other characters aren’t much of an improvement. Ciel was never that interesting to me, but he manages to be the best character in season two purely because everyone else was so bad. Sebastian is a boring character that the anime tries very hard to hype up as interesting, but I just didn’t care about him and Claude’s competition for Ciel’s soul. The fact that he’s created to always be perfect at everything just makes watching him dull. Claude basically has no personality outside of being a sexual predator. The sexual overtones to his character aren’t subtle, you can hand wave all you want and say “no, no, he just wants to eat souls because he’s a demon” it doesn’t change the fact that there’s an obvious sexual layer behind how it’s presented. And it’s the closest thing to an identity he has. And while I know I just spent a lot of time talking about Alois, Claude ends up being the worst character in the anime because the predatory aspects of his personality are all that define him. I was going to call him Diet Sebastian, except that would be unfair to Sebastian. Walking talking cringe compilation Grell Sutcliff is back and this time her role consists of two things: wanting to be Sebastian’s toothbrush and reaping Alois’s soul. Except she doesn’t end up doing that. Claude steals Alois’s soul and then she does her best Ryuuk impression by telling him that she’ll just observe from now on because this is interesting apparently. Anything after that is just Grell following Sebastian around with a camera and getting hot over the sight of his ankles because this anime has a foot fetish. As I mentioned before Lau and Ran-Mao appear despite that they were killed off in season one. How are they alive? They faked their deaths and Sebastian let them get away. That is your only explanation. That is all you get. Finny, May-Rin, and Bardroy provide some mild comic relief but barely show up. Lizzy appears a few times, but she doesn’t really amount to much of anything. The most prominent female character in this anime is Alois’s maid Hannah who spends majority of her scenes being abused and degraded for fanservice while wearing a passive expression. Even when it’s revealed she’s this powerful demon and serving more of a purpose to the story I still am left feeling like she was a wasted character who’s purpose was to be abused since hurting women is the laziest way to show someone is evil. 

And the animation. We have got to talk about the animation. You might be thinking the screen caps I’ve been showing don’t look so bad, but they aren’t good representations of how it looks in motion.  The quality is all over the place. I know this was before A-1 started raking in all that sweet “Sword Art Online” money, but this feels particularly abysmal like they didn’t care. The animation is stilted a lot of the time and then when it tries to do something more action packed that requires a more skilled hand it just gets laughable. But even during scenes that aren’t focused on the action it gets bad. Trust me.

The anime itself just has a very cheap feel to it. I’m not sure if the money went towards getting the GazettE to do the opening song or towards the seiyuu cast, but clearly the priority was not good animation. Speaking of the seiyuu, my goodness was this cast wasted. Maaya Sakamoto, Daisuke Ono, Nana Mizuki, Takahiro Sakurai, Jun Fukuyama, Junichi Suwabe, Yuuki Kaji, Emiri Katou, and of all people Aya Hirano. How do you acquire a cast this strong and not use them to their fullest potential? Well you designate certain seiyuu to side characters that don’t do or say much or in the case of our leads you give them terrible dialogue and roles with little personality to work with. I love Takahiro Sakurai, but as Claude he just sounds like he’s speaking words. This is a man who has been able to convey charisma without playing characters with huge extroverted personalities, it’s not as if he needs to be playing a Reigen or an Osomatsu to emote, so I’m thinking with Claude he just decided to phone it in or the direction was bad. Nana Mizuki tries to make Alois work, but unfortunately she can only do so much with a character this badly written. It’s a pity.

If I had to describe a good word for “Black Butler II” it would be exasperating. I felt so drained by the time I was done with the anime. When it wasn’t pandering to a lowest common denominator audience I’d sooner bite than shake hands with, it was just meandering around with no real sense of what to do with itself. One of the big questions I asked myself after finishing the show was “is this worse than the other anime I hate” and my answer is a definite “yes”. I hated anime like “Desert Punk”, but that anime knew what it wanted to be and stuck to it. I hated “No Game No Life”, but at least that had a very alluring visual style. This anime is even worse than things like “Twinkle Nora Rock Me” and I’ll explain why. “Twinkle Nora Rock Me” has the excuse of clearly having no budget, it’s incredibly inept but it obviously wasn’t working with much. This however was made by A-1, they have money. Mari Okada is a prominent screen writer who has written for anime like “Toradora”, “Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans”, “Wandering Son”, and the “Aria” series. You had money and talent behind this, yet this is what we get. It truly is baffling on every level. And honestly the “Black Butler” fans deserve better. Assuming they haven’t already skipped to the bottom to read my score and give me a down vote I just really want to say that I feel sorry that this is the anime you were given. I didn’t like season one, but I can see why it drew in its audience. And having watched season two I can see why a lot of that audience wants nothing to do with it. It’s offensive, it’s trashy, it’s stupid, it’s lazy, it really is bad on every level and I felt actively insulted by it. Usually when I watch an anime I don’t like I don’t bother reviewing it, I try to move on, but with this I just felt like I had to. There’s only one reason why you’re being reviewed “Black Butler II”. One simple answer. You pissed me off.  But for what it’s worth having completed something as disastrous as this I know there’s no way I will see anything worse throughout the year. “Black Butler II” is a complete failure of an anime, but it did help create a new standard for what I consider a failure. Some people are out here still acting like “Sword Art Online” is the worst anime ever and while I never agreed with that its seeing anime like this that make me realize what truly makes a bad anime bad."
268,"First Episode Impressions:
Although I kind of disliked how the main character was presented, with his typical anime protagonist pervert demeanour and cowardly nature, the plot twist near the end turns all of that previously established character development on its head and actually makes Kintaro a really intriguing character. The fact that he's some mega genuis feels like the punchline of the whole first episode, making the hook of this series quite interesting. The art and music itself are representative of anime at the time, which is quite charming, so I don't have a problem with that. The animation in particular seems to be quite lively, more so than other anime that I have seen from the time frame really giving the characters some life. The plot at this point, with the main character that it has developed, could go anywhere makign this seem like a very promising show to continue watching and thus I'm looking forward to what this has to offer.

Actual Review:
This anime surprised me for sure, I thought it was going to be about some degenerate and his antics, but with every new episode of the six 30-minute OVAs I felt a combination of comedy and emotional merit exude from the lively and kind of immature surface of the anime. These six OVAs are all episodic, all except the last episode do not feature anything about the characters from previous episodes or the events that took place. This is because of how the structure of the anime and the motivations of the protagonist are set up; Kintaro, the job-hopping, perverted genius is probably the most versatile character I've ever seen in an anime, let alone a comedy anime. Just the fact that he's actually a genius under the comic veil of his pervertedness allows him to get into situations where it can have some stupid fanservice, but also even tricks the audience in the first episode regarding the impressions of the main character. Throughout each episode, although formulaic, Kintaro is faced with a new job and a new girl to gawk at, and even though the varying situations from episode to episode end in a similar fashion, it's interesting to see how Kintaro manages to not only get himself out of the stupid situations he finds himself in, but also manages to charm the girl in the process. And what's so charming about this is that, because of the episodic nature of the series, Kintaro always has to leave at the end of the episode before the girl comes to the realisation that Kintaro is the perfect man creating the perfect tease for the character that has been developed over the course of the episode and for the audience as we continue to be dragged along with Kintaro and his antics. Not only is his comical nature complementing for the series as a whole, but in combination with his genuine kindness, it makes for interesting motivations, sort of tricking people with his outlandish behaviour at first. Even though Kintaro and the stuff he does makes him seem unrealisic, just the fact that he wants to help people and can do so on such a widespread scale because he's a job-hopper makes him feel grounded in a way and as such makes it feel like an anime that could actually just go on for 100 episodes although the plots may become a bit elaborate after that. I know there's a manga, but I wish that the show kept going on like this.
Regardless, the show does give a very wholesome experience, starting off strong and powering through each episode (whilst also satisfying the audience enough so that they are hooked at the end of each episode) and ending on such a high note that I really, really wished that there was more. For the conclusion, I feel like his work at an animation studio was a fitting end (to the anime at least) because it not only has some kind of stakes in how would Kintaro manage to complete this anime that he's involved in, but also manages to cram all of the other characters into the last episode. I know that in itself is cheesy, but just the fact that we get to see everyone again kind of makes it come full circle. Not only that, but seeing the anime succeed and have Kintaro bail once again in the midst of all of the girls that he has charmed leaves it on such a high note for me. Furthermore, the last girl that he has helped and charmed in a way, doesn't go after him because of what he has taught her about life and her perspective, which in itself becomes really heartwarming, adding both a comedic flair and an emotional ending.
Kintaro as a character succeeds so well because he can fit into any situation, making him so strong and easy to write for. The animation of his various facial reactions and actions also do sell his versatility and make the anime even more charming. Although this anime does get pretty out there with its sexual references, it doesn't feel out of character for a story surrounding Kintaro as the protagonist and I don't think it extends too far from the whole nature of the show. Rather, I think that this show needs Kintaro to be a pervert to get into all of these stupid situations. The way that they are delivered as well are quite well done, just in the punchline delivery and some of the recurring gags help to just make it that much more funny. In comparison to other comedies which rely on one kind of gag or archetypal funny character to deliver the jokes, just the various situations that Kintaro is involved in kind of differentiates this comedy anime from others. In fact, this anime kind of reminded me of Cowboy Bebop in a way, though the connection is kind of weak. Let me explain. In my opinion, Cowboy Bebop succeeded because of the versatility of its characters and how you can just imagine them in any kind of situation. It's the same for Kintaro, with the exception that his backstory is not elaborated on, but I don't think that the comedic nature of the show even needs that to happen since it's just summarised in a couple of lines by the narrator at the end of most of the episodes.
Anyways, if I had the time I would read the manga and see how Kintaro went with his studying hobby but I might just savour the wholesomeness of this anime for a while. 10/10 would smash Kintaro again."
20541,"Mekakucity Actors was a bizarre show for me to sit through. Most of the time, I as wondering if I had accidentally gone to an alternate universe where Monogatari and Kiznaiver are mashed together into one show, but without some key characteristics. Kiznaiver without the melodrama that bogged it down and Monogatari without the witty dialogue and brilliant storytelling through said dialogue. This isn't to say that Mekakucity Actors lacked any of these things completely, but it certainly dialed it way back in those aspects for a more artistic and simple approach to story and conversation between characters. These distinctions feel extremely important because of how similarly the stories of Monogatari Second Season, specifically Nadeko Medusa, and Mekakucity Actors really play out. There's many of the same themes and some story beats even completely mirror each other, which isn't a bad thing in any way, but it just makes Mekakucity Actors feel tough to put on its own pedestal without unfair comparisons.

On an artistic level, I love how Shaft brings the world of Mekakucity Actors to life. The color theming of the characters, while it admittedly isn't a new concept by any means, is really satisfying and helps one keep each individual character straight and distinct in the beginning where many characters and ideas are getting thrown at you from all directions. Beyond just that, the show just oozes that classic Shaft style, with countless quick cuts, odd camera angles, and, of course, the Shaft head tilt. This is another reason why the Monogatari comparisons will never leave this show alone, because the even look the same.
img()
The character designs are another obvious positive for Mekakucity Actors. Along with the color coding of the characters, each one feels so distinct and the way they're drawn and dressed shows so much personality without them even opening their mouths.

On the music front, Mekakucity Actors has some fantastic insert songs, all arranged by Jin with various accompanying singers. My favorites were the ones made for episode 6, Headphone Actor, but that's for a more personal reason I think, which I'll get to more later on. Otherwise, there's not a whole lot more to say in the sound department. The voice acting is good, the soundtrack is passable, everything checks out as average to good.

Favorite Character: Takane Enomoto
img()
Specifically, before she was Ene, which is something that should be clarified before I go on with my reasons, other than that she is best girl with close competition from Kido. I adore Takane. Her and Haruka's episode, Headphone Actor, may be one of my favorite standalone episodes of all time. I couldn't tell you why it struck me as so amazing, other than that it was one of the most well written self-contained stories I've ever watched. From displaying Takane and Haruka's dynamic together and with their teacher, to their crushes on each other, to showing their personalities and ideals, to showing their connection with the other cast, to the realized love from Takane, to the tragedy at the end. It's such a great episode that I want to rewatch it again just thinking recalling it now. I will have to admit that I didn't like her nearly as much while she was in her Ene form, which was an entirely different personality and just didn't jive with me the same way.

If we're boiling down Mekakucity Actors to its greatest strength, it lies in its aforementioned ensemble cast. Every character is lovable in its own way and the way that they all interact with each other is so fun and makes them seem like actual friends. The real tragedy is that we don't have more episodes to spend with the gang just being friends and bantering with each other. While Mekakucity's dialogue isn't genius level like Monogatari, its more real and relatable, which may be strange for those who come from Monogatari expecting similar mind bending conversations to find them not really present. Another thing I really enjoyed about Mekakucity Actors was the story after the credits on most episodes. It was beautifully drawn and an absolute genius stroke of storytelling to tell the context of the story in a way that didn't break the flow of the overall plot.

On the less great side, the story was somewhat convoluted, especially towards the end, where it felt like the storytelling skipped a few major points just the get to the finale, where everything just kinda....happened. Then everything is fixed and everyone lives happily ever after. It just didn't feel like the setup and the climax got the time it deserved to really make an impact after you spent like ten episodes just learning about the cast, their backstories and how they ended up where they were. I've already mentioned it, but I wish that there had been a few more episodes to really make the cast feel as if they were bonded together and really fighting because they were friends and not just because.

Overall, I feel as if the overarching plot could have been told a lot more tightly and certain characters could have benefited from interacting with other characters, but otherwise, I thought that the story was told about as well as it possibly could have been with the way that it was laid out and put together in the first place. I loved the atmosphere that Mekakucity Actors exuded and really wished that there could have been more of it, that it had played to the creepiness of its setup more and taken more risks to separate itself from Monogatari's shadow, because the unfortunate fact of Mekakucity Actors is that it will forever be living in that shadow through no real fault of its own. Despite that, I give Mekakucity Actors a huge recommend, especially if you're a fan of Monogatari and the Shaft style."
572,"Writing a review of Nausicaä is like writing a review of Star Wars: A New Hope. Where do you even begin with a film this foundational and influential?

Should you watch it? Absolutely! Not only is it a tightly written, riveting action-adventure, you’ll recognize shades of its imaginative post-apocalyptic world in dozens of other anime titles and Japanese video games. It’s also a vivid portrait of its creator — Hayao Miyazaki circa 1984 — and his interests in flight, pacifism, Marxism and industry, presented with the emotional impact of a “kamikaze attack”, as his friend and peer [Mamoru Oshii once put it.](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/oshiionmt.html)

To limit the size and scope of this review, I will be focusing on the film’s relation to Miyazaki’s worldview. (This review will describe numerous plot events.)



Through unfortunate happenstance, the idyllic farmland of the Valley of Wind, a pocket of civilization in an otherwise uninhabitable world of poisonous fungal forests and giant killer insects, comes into possession of an ancient weapon of mass destruction. A formation of immense airships from a distant empire descends from above, deploying a small army of imperial soldiers who storm the castle and slay the local lord. Princess Nausicaä, the heir apparent, submits to the occupying forces to prevent further bloodshed. The Valley soon finds itself caught between two great, hostile powers, thus setting the Princess off on a quest to save her home.

Miyazaki, like several other notable names in his generation of anime creators, is a child of the war and the [leftist, anti-war and anti-occupation protest movement](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/japan-crossroads-anpo-treaty-nick-kapur-book-review/). As the war ended with an atomic bang, Japan became a pawn in the subsequent Cold War. The parallels in Nausicaä are apparent, but the film is more than an allegory for American occupation.



While resembling something of a religious epic with the messianic journey of Princess Nausicaä to discover the meaning of the toxic forest, the film also translates the creation myth of communism into genre. With their farming tools, the proud working class of the Valley of Wind rise up against the dopey imperials in a humorous action setpiece.

Miyazaki’s feelings on industry and pacifism are encoded into the film. The occupying empire’s chunky airships and armors are crude and dehumanizing, while the Valley’s modest assets, made from super-strong materials harvested from the toxic forest, exude personality and dependable craftsmanship. The Valley itself, as with many charismatic locales in [numerous Ghibli films](https://anilist.co/review/6695), exists in harmony with nature. However, the imperial warmongers seek to destroy the forest with the WMDs of old to dominate the natural world once again.



Princess Nausicaä, being something of an insect whisperer, continually defuses conflicts between the monstrous creatures of the wasteland and the panicked imperials. With her penchant for pacifism, she journeys deep into the toxic forest and prophetically returns to her people with the means to salvation. Likewise, when the WMDs of the great powers threaten to destroy the Valley, she [throws herself onto the gears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarioSavio#%22Bodiesuponthegears%22speech) of war in a desperate attempt to stop it. In Nausicaä, industry is a slippery slope to violence against nature and against one another. Harmony with nature and with mankind form a unified, pacifist ideal embodied in Miyazaki’s titular champion.

Over time, Miyazaki’s belief in Marxism would fade, and likewise the impact of anti-war messages in a significantly advanced, postwar consumer economy. His subsequent films would shift emphasis and tone away from the heroic bombast of Nausicaä. But anime is a medium for the senses, and Nausicaä remains his most sensational film for its passionately believed ideals and its madly designed fungal wilderness and fantasy airships. It remains my favorite Miyazaki flick because it is the most Miyazaki flick.

21390,"""Too little, too late"" is a painful phrase.

After 12 episodes of broken nonsense, this show somehow got a second season that attempted the impossible: being a competent sequel to The Asterisk War. By some miracle, it succeeded. Not to say that this show is even remotely good now, but this second season somehow turned being awful into an accomplishment. I'm not sure whether to be impressed or depressed.

Part of why this second season managed to improve upon the first one is that it actually makes an attempt to have dynamic characters, giving every character something to do, posing an actual threat for the main character, and attempt slightly more meaningful character arcs. It doesn't necessarily succeed in many of these areas, as the asspulls are still as frequent as the world-building is disastrous. However, for the first time, I felt slightly engaged in what was going on. The new characters such as Sylvia had genuinely cool designs and personalities, and some of the returning characters that barely got any screen time last season actually become genuine threats that bring actual life to this show during the end of the show's tournament arc. Hell, the final bosses of the arc --two literal robots-- have some actual chemistry and character development, both of which were missing in this franchise. The irony here is adorable.

Sadly, the tournament arc ends around episode 8, the show spends its final episodes trying at giving someone other than our main lead an emotional arc that was set up in the first season. The foundation of the first season had already collapsed in on itself, so seeing Julis' childhood friend that got teased in the early parts of season 1 was almost enough to keep me invested for an episode...before nearly falling asleep. None of the actually worthwhile side characters like Sylvia or the two robots Ayato would fight in the Phoenix Festa tournament make an appearance, and we're left with our dry harem, which only got marginally better than the first season. It's far too late to flesh any of them out now as we already spent an entire season enduring them as obnoxious caricatures with nothing going for them. There's no way for me to care about Julis's problems or Claudia's sneaky advances on Ayatofu. Even seeing some of the more neglected side characters Ayato hung out with in season 1 team up wasn't enough to get me to care about them, and that's because of season 1. If these characters were written as anything more than sleazy caricatures of archetypes beforehand, then maybe seeing the show try to do interesting things with them would have been more satisfying. It also would have helped if the show's idea of character development was natural growth instead of making Kirin radically more stern and mature than before out of nowhere. Sadly, all I can do is attempt to cherish what obligatory efforts the writers made to make us care about a couple of mediocre side characters.

While the awful artwork and art style mostly hasn't changed, they are a few moments of impressive visuals, such as the very first scene of the season. The sequence where Sylvia sings to Ayato is also pretty nice, as it's both a visual and narrative highlight for the show. Sadly, the fights are still terrible overall, as like last time, they're either incredibly clunky or immensely difficult to follow. There's no real middle ground here. The closest they come to that would be the final fights of the two major arcs of the season, which are admittedly entertaining, if not necessarily well-animated.

The music is still incredibly mediocre, with no memorable OSTs whatsoever. They do have the courtesy to throw in a new vocal track and a few new pieces of background music, but the only highlights are the songs that open and close each episode. The OP for this season --""The Asterisk War"" by Shiena Nishizawa-- is incredibly frantic, albeit a tad unwieldy with the frantic techno beats in the chorus. Once again, it's the ED that shines compared to everything else, as Haruka Chigusa's ""Ai no Uta -words of love-"" is a catchy and relatively heartwarming piece with pleasant vocals and visuals of characters actually having fun for once.

Sadly, this season is still not worth your time if you didn't already enjoy the first season. It tries to do what legitimately good sequels do, yet it fails thanks to its own incompetence and the borderline irredeemable failings of its predecessor. It's still a mess with largely terrible characters, nonsensical world-building, and asspulls galore. It still fails to animate good fight scenes. It still fails to be captivating for more than a few minutes at a time. At the very least, the attempt was there, which is more than I can say for the first season. That doesn't mean people like me are going to care since it's the sequel to The Asterisk War. No matter how good a sequel it may be, it would always be limited by the unsalvageable foundation that series built for this now dead franchise."
21665,"B: The Beginning postured to be [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/Production-IG)’s return to form. A gritty, near-future crime thriller with the added benefit of Netflix backing? This should have been right up their alley. Unfortunately, director [Kazuto Nakazawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101474/Kazuto-Nakazawa) struggled to reproduce the delectable amalgamation of high tension mystery, provocative subtext, and slick visual design to the standard of the studio’s [better](https://anilist.co/anime/467/Ghost-in-the-Shell-Stand-Alone-Complex/) [titles](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/PSYCHOPASS/). 

He tries though. Really hard. 



B: The Beginning follows dual protagonists: a jaded genius detective seeking redemption, and an angel-winged super assassin vigilante with a sword for an arm. Already, we’ve struck at the heart of the show’s fatal flaw. 

It’s indecisive. It doesn’t know what it wants to be. Is it a no-nonsense detective mystery-thriller? Or is it an epic fantasy action piece? The show attempts to be both, unsuccessfully for the most part. This is not to say that these genres are necessarily mutually exclusive. Only that B: The Beginning fails to find an appropriate balance between the two. Through its grounded visual style and heavy dialogue it builds itself up as dark and gritty. But it instead undulates messily between discordant poles, with jarring results.

In one scene, detectives apply their wit in an attempt to prevent chemical gas from spreading throughout a building. In the next, a member of the Insane Clown Posse skateboards down a skyscraper, flinging hand grenades in their wake. What the actual fuck is happening? This tonal dissonance is far too prevalent. What’s worse is that I don’t think it’s intentional. Matters aren’t helped by the fact that the the two protagonists occupy parallel story lines that don’t intertwine in any way they ideally should. And when these plot lines do overlap, it’s so utterly contrived it’s funny. Time is therefore split between the two main characters and neither receives the attention they need to make them truly interesting.

Bipolarism and underdeveloped characters aside, there are a still a number of nitpicks to be had. Despite the esoteric literary references and dramatic narration, there is no subtext to be found. Not that there has to be. But all these elements manage to contribute to is the gritty tone (edgy, if you will), which as we’ve outlined is prone to sudden upending. Furthermore, as opposed to any actual police work, the brilliance of our genius detective is established by way of his ability to sketch portraits using mathematical equations. Similarly, vital exposition is delivered via clunky info dumps. Any major female character exists in order to be damseled. Shortcuts like these are lazy and uninspired, making for a shaky first half of the series. 

Fortunately, the show picks itself up during its latter half. Here, the mystery element comes to the fore, burgeoning into a genuinely engaging game of cat and mouse. The central villain is a serious force to be reckoned with, and the ensuing battle of wits is good old fashioned high tension fun. It’s here where the detective is shown to be cunning in ways beyond mathematical finger painting through his actions and powers of deduction. It helps that the side cast is quite likeable. The fantasy plot kicks into gear too, but simply lacks any weight.

If there’s one thing Production I.G can rarely be faulted for, it’s there audiovisual design. Crisp, realistic, and dark, B: The Beginning looks like what a sci fi mystery thriller should look like. It's all really pretty. An interesting visual choice is the presentation of the detective’s thoughts via text and mind maps and such superimposed over the screen, Sherlock style. Take that how you will. The action sequences are by no means mind-blowing, but are mostly fun to watch nonetheless. 

Both the subbed and dubbed version are fine. Meanwhile, the end credits are fucking amazing. Marty Friedman of Megadeth fame teamed up with Jean-Ken Johnny from Man with a Mission and KenKen from Rize to create - without trying to overstate anything - one of the best ending songs in recent memory. Chances are you won’t be skipping the outro.    

webm(https://animethemes.moe/video/BTheBeginning-ED1-NCBD1080.webm)

B: The Beginning exists in a state of flux. It lacks focus, thematic or otherwise. It is comprised of two separate story lines that fail to complement each other as they should. Rather, they conflict tonally and in terms of substance matter. They detract from each other and from the show as a whole. I suspect that if the fantasy elements were removed altogether, the show would have improved significantly. Because when the pacing quickened, the mystery story became pretty exciting. With a second season in the works, perhaps the divergent story lines will somehow converge better than they did here. Or better yet, be done away with altogether."

At first, wandering into this anime, which starts out rather weird. It might have you question your sanity with - what the hell are am I watching? It could get you into asking questions such as - did that just happen, or was I not in the right of mind? Not surprising to ask those kinds of questions either. During the first few minutes, A Sister's All You Need kicks off with a quite pure WTF moment at its finest, and a depiction of over-the-top bizarre fanservice that makes no lick of sense. I am here to tell you, don't let that push you away since this is otherwise a wonderful anime. The first few minutes are just baiting. When the Imouto Sae finally starts moving the story, it becomes increasingly compelling as it goes on. It's not even remotely similar to those rinse-repeat imouto anime you can't escape and see everywhere nowadays. Imouto Sae is a pleasant quirky depiction of the slice of life's realistic themes, with a dash of sweet and tasteful romance in the mix. It goes into the vast otaku culture in a rather fun and charming way. Well, it's not all on-the-dot. Those fanservice-y moments you either love or hate are still there. They might turn some of you off.

It's not afraid to go all out and act totally obscure devoid of all logic and common sense. I personally found that aspect fun in of itself. It doesn't wholly shove it into your face and bounces of rather naturally. Tho, there is some rather erotic moment you would see in hentai, so keep that in mind as you watch this anime. But the core person behind these outrageous actions is just a cheeky - merely adorable and really likable silver-haired waifu. More on that very soon. The story follows a novelist Hashima who is obsessed with imoutos. Do I hear the siren ringing in the distance? No, but for real. This guy revolves him everyday life around little sisters. Even his work, which is writing light novels. His goal is to one day create the ""ultimate younger sister"" novel, bet no one saw that one coming. Jokes aside. Although it has a slightly weird background for the plot, the anime delves into realistic themes, as stated previously. Both in his work and everyday life. You'd be surprised to see how different Imouto Sae is than it's letting you know. When it comes to the art-style for the anime. It has that feel of a mature but moe vibe at the same time. I quite adore it a lot. There is not much that can be said. But it fits the anime and complements it quite well. 

The animation is not the strong point, but it's decent for an anime with such a setting. To put it into perspective, I didn't find anything annoying and have nothing to pick on either. It has a good production value that is more than enough to do the job. While the characters are all colorful, quirky - no one feels flat or dull. They all have something about them that will entertain you in some way.  Especially, Nayuta Kani. Without going too much into spoilers. Let's just say she is without a shadow of a doubt, the best girl in this story. She has such a lovely and spicy personality. It would shock me if a viewer didn't fall in love with her attractive and attentive character. Nayu is one of the core reasons this anime hit off well with me. You'd know what I am talking about if you gave it a shot. No one can possibly hate a bold and chipper daredevil? Our side cast is solid and feels apart of the group rather than a means to an end. Now when it comes to the negative aspect, there was nothing much I would like to add. Sure some arcs did feel slightly rushed, and that game they where playing was kind of weird and out of place. I would've like to see even more focus on characters. This is my only gripe if you take into mind, it was only a 13-episodes long. If it had more to offer. I would probably ignore it altogether, so it's just a nitpick more or less. 

My overall enjoyment for this anime was barely affected by the few bad I found, which was overshadowed by all the good and refreshing stuff. If anything, the biggest downside is the fact no sequel is insight. Of course, it doesn't really fit as negative. That's just me salty about the fact I won't see the story play out. It was an enjoyable watch and a pleasant touch of drama, which felt genuine and concise. It made our male lead Itsuki kind of complex. He has many insecurities about the past, his relationship with his family doesn't seem to be going well either. I just hope we will see more out of Imouto Sae in the future. But at some point, I might just go for the light novel. It was just that entertaining to me personally. I need more of Nayu in my life, so there is that. In a nutshell, this anime was quite a pleasant surprise. I am happy I didn't gloss over it and gave it a shot. It was kind of it to delve into some realistic theme, making it for an exciting and fresh watch if nothing else. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind their share of ecchi and want something slightly different than the others which fall in the same category as this one. Be especially sure to watch it if you want a quality waifu, Nayu is merely perfect in every single way you can imagine."
7711,"No matter how long you’ve considered somewhere your home, there are always going to be areas that you take for granted.  Spaces in the walls, between floorboards, behind the stove, maybe a forgotten crawl space or two...  But there’s a good chance these areas are not only seeing constant use, but by more than just rats and spiders.  They call themselves the Borrowers...  Tiny people, no bigger than your average action figure, living in hiding and building their lives out of the random knick-knacks that you thought you misplaced.  They mean you no harm, and have no actual ill intentions towards you, but if you wake up at the right moment, you just might catch a glimpse of them taking a tissue from your bedside.  This is what fourteen year old Arrietty was doing, on her first ever borrowing expedition with her father, when a lonely young boy spots her and tries to make contact.  Drawn together as two lonely souls often will be, Arrietty and Shon begin a tenuous exchange that gradually brings misfortune upon misfortune to their tiny doorstep.  Can Arrietty overcome the single minded curiosity of Shon’s aunt to protect her family, or will the three of them be forced to leave their home behind before it’s too late?

The very fact that this is a Studio Ghibli movie should tell you all you need to know about the quality of the animation.  The budget was obviously generous as always, and every second of animation is absolutely perfect, even if there isn’t as much to animate here as there would be in the studio’s more popular titles.  This is a fairly uneventful movie, with more stealth than action, a lot of dialogue, and barely any flying scenes(which is anathema to a Ghibli film) so it’s not the most visually stunning film in their catalogue, but it is still impressive to go through an anime film actively looking for cost cutting techniques and cut corners, and finding diddly squat for your efforts.  Rather, The Secret World of Arrietty is more known for its visual design than for its animation.  The character designs are among Ghibli’s more realistic, revolving around anatomically believable characters with only slightly cartoonish faces that are perfectly capable of expressing a wide range of emotions without ever slipping into the range of moe.

What’s more impressive by far, however, is the environmental design.  We follow the Borrowers through their trials and tribulations from a fairly unique perspective, travelling through the neglected nooks and crannies of the house, and while it is pretty convenient how so much of it is set up just right so the cast can traverse it...  Steps in just the right places, nails sticking out just the right distance apart, etc. none of it ever feels unbelievable, and I never once found myself questioning the dimensions of the house.  Their living space is full of repurposed small items, and while it’s absolutely unnecessary to do so, it’s still entirely rewarding to pause here and there and see just how much attention to detail went into this setting.  From framed pictures of stamps, to a leaky pipe giving them their water, to the fact that the liquid in Homily’s teapot has to bubble a bit before it pours, as liquid on such a small scale wouldn’t just flow like if it were in a life sized appliance.  There are a few unexplained contrivances, but you’d have to go out of your way to look for them, and even then I didn’t totally mind.  This is fantasy, after all, everything can’t be totally realistic.

What grabbed me even more than the visual design, however, was the sound design.  As you would imagine, everything is larger from the perspective of a lilliputian, and that includes what we would consider your average, everyday noises.  When we’re following the borrowers around, every single sound, no matter how mundane, is amplified tenfold.  Everything from the rustle of grass, to the squeaking of a window hinge, to the monstrous echo of water dripping in a sink, forms a very unique ambiance that serves as half of the soundtrack of the movie.  As for the other half, the musical score was composed by UK singer Cecile Corbel, a French artist by birth, whose body of work encompasses the entire western European region and has a strong Celtic vibe to it.  As a lifelong Studio Ghibli fan, she sent the studio her second album in 2009, and a producer was so enchanted by it that he hired her to compose the score.  You could make an argument for her hiring feeling a tad random, as she basically just got put to work on the movie they were making at the time, but whether by accident or design, her sound fits the film beautifully, playing into its folksy aesthetic in a way that only Celtic music can.

Speaking of Celtic, there are two English dubs for this movie, and the one we got isn’t even the more English of the two.  This isn’t the first Ghibli movie to have two dubs, but rather than being dubbed by two separate studios like a few of the other titles, Arrietty has one dub for America, and one dub for the UK, and because I was looking for an excuse to watch the movie twice, I saw both tracks all the way through.  Starting with the adaptive script, the American dub took a lot of liberties with the translation, but with very little exception, it didn’t change anything too radically, and it seemed to be moistly focused on giving the characters more personality and charm.  The UK dub sticks far closer to the script, changing only what was needed to match the lip flaps, although if I’m being honest, they didn’t do a GREAT job of it.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like we’re in Kids on the Slope territory or anything, but you do notice it a few times.  Anyway, the UK dub is a bit blunter with its wording, and a little harsher in some scenes, especially where it involves Arrietty’s father Pod and Shon, the human boy she encounters.

Arrietty herself is performed fantastically in both tracks.  She’s played in the American version by Bridgit Mendler, an up and coming Disney star at the time, but one that I’ had never heard of until now, and one who apparently hasn’t acted since 2018.  In the UK version, she’s played by the much more well known Irish-born actor Saoirse Ronan.  Between the two of them, I’d say Ronan has more raw strength in the emotional scenes, while Mendler is more likeable and charming in the light-hearted scenes, but you can’t go wrong with either of them.  For Shon, his performance by David Henrie is one of the biggest complaints people have, and while he does sound way too old...  He was in his early twenties, after all...  I do think his voice carried a lot of the pain and weariness of someone who’s had to face his own mortality far too early.  The UK version is played by Tom Holland, the future Spiderman, and he sounds way more true to the character’s age, but also a bit more believably childish...  A little more immature, and a little less self aware, which fits some of his actions in the film better.

Arrietty’s father Pod is played in the American dub by Will Arnett, and while he does sound a little like Bojack Horseman in a couple of scenes(or at least Bojack’s father Butterscotch, ironically) it’s not too distracting.  He actually has a lot more warmth and understanding in his delivery, showing Arrietty the dangers of exploring while still acknowledging that we learn by making mistakes, and even when she messes up, he’s more focused on fixing the problem than scolding her for it.  In the UK dub, Mark Strong is a lot colder, which is appropriate given the amount of shit he’s seen, and can come off as harsher on her for her actions at some points.  The only character who I have an objective favorite for is the mother, Homily, and while I’m not saying Amy Poehler’s performance is bad, it can be a little screechy and incomprehensible at times, and the script was rewritten in ways that make her come off as a bit daft and air-headed, and I don’t think that’s Poehler’s fault, but I had a far easier time enjoying Olivia Colman’s performance in the UK dub.  I will also say that while this movie does take place in an older section of Tokyo, the aesthetic still has a rustic and folksy quality that feels a little more organic with a mix of Irish and English accents.  Then again the American dub has Carol Burnett in it, so you know what?  Both dubs are amazing, you can’t go wrong with either one.

The Secret World of Arrietty is based on a long running children’s book franchise called The Borrowers, which I’m going to admit right now, I’m not very familiar with.  I never read the books, and I know I saw the 1997 American movie at some point, but I don’t remember almost anything from it, aside from some wacky hijinks and the basic concept of what a Borrower IS.  A Borrower is a tiny human that builds their lives off of small items they take that they know you won’t miss, which...  As I was aware even back then...  Is not borrowing.  They don’t return anything to you, which makes it more like self-justified theft, but that’s not the anime’s fault, so I’ll let it slide.  The only piece of Borrowers media I’m intimately familiar with is the film I’m reviewing today, and I have to say, it’s kind of surreal to see Studio Ghibli directly adapting such an immediately identifiable western property.  Yeah, Miyazaki was involved with some western adaptations, but not with Ghibli.  Yeah, he did make Ponyo with Ghibli, but that was an extremely loose adaptation, and it honestly had more in common story-wise with Lilo and Stitch than The Little Mermaid.  Arrietty is a very direct adaptation, to the point that it largely covers the first book in the Borrowers series, with some changes made to condense the story and fit a more Japanese style setting.

Yet, as surreal as this all may sound, Arrietty has an unfortunate reputation of being one of the lesser Studio Ghibli films, and I’ve seen a lot of people call it slow and boring, which I kind of get, but which I also kind of don’t get.  On the one hand, Miyazaki was not the director of this film, and it  kinda shows.  Arrietty was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, whose body of work I can’t really comment on because I haven’t seen either of his other directorial efforts.  I do know that Miyazaki wrote the screenplay, but despite the fact that he'd been fighting to get the film green-lit for decades, you can kind of tell that he wasn’t that interested in directing the project himself from the start because it’s devoid of the kind of excess and visual spectacle that he’d usually employ.  I think the reason Miyazaki handed this project to one of the studio’s less experienced directors is because he’s never been much of a story guy, and likes to write his movies as he goes, focusing more on emotion and visual magic than plot and a strong narrative.  That’s not to say you can’t go weird with an adaptation, I mean just look at the American Borrowers movie.  They basically threw out the source material, fabricated a more American friendly greedy corporate villain and let loose with weird ideas and hijinks, going balls-to-the-wall with the concept.  Miyazaki could have at least thrown in a scene where Arrietty has to fly a toy plane or something, right?

But the movie did wind up in Yonebayashi’s hands, and to his credit, he rose to the occasion, coming up with storyboards that impressed even Miyazaki himself.  The result, however, could easily be described as an anti-Miyazaki Ghibli film, as it’s the exact opposite of what Miyazaki would usually do.  Arrietty is a really subdued and grounded film, choosing to focus more on story and plot than action and thrills, and while I do get why some viewers might find the result really slow and boring, I have never felt that way while watching it.  I don’t know, maybe I’m just weird(I mean that is definitely true) but while some people say this ninety minute movie felt like over two hours, it feels more like one hour to me, and I had an absolute blast with it.  I can kind of tell which parts people find boring...  There are these long, wistful shots of Shon lying in a field of flowers, but for me, the beautiful music they play over these shots more than justifies them.  There are lots of scenes where the Clock family...  Yes, that is Arrietty’s last name, and I'm kinda surprised it wasn't translated as Kuroku for the film...  Are traversing the environment, but I love the atmosphere in these scenes, and with everything I said about the sound design earlier, I always feel too immersed to be bored.

Of course, that’ not to say this movie doesn’t have some flaws, and as much as I enjoy it, I can think of at least one pretty big one; I never found this movie to be boring or slow, but if I could put a label on it’s biggest issues, it’s that it feels unfinished, and I mean that in two ways.  First of all, there are several plot points that are set up early on and then never really pay off.  That’s not to say they don’t serve any narrative purpose, but it does feel to me like they might have done some rewrites in the middle of production to make the film feel less frightening to a younger audience.  For a couple of examples, Arrietty performs her first borrowing picking up a lost needle and treating it like a sword.  Problem is, she never actually uses it.  Another example, we’re warned of the danger of animals like rats and toads, but those never come back either, despite a crow getting the narrative treatment that they should have had.  They’re clearly shown to live near an ant colony, how is that not a concern?  There’s even one moment towards the end where, I’m not going to tell you what happens, but I found myself going “Yeah, no, my cat would fuck you up without hesitation, tear you apart and eat at least half of you.”  There is a substantial feeling of suspense and danger in some sequences, and I do thoroughly appreciate that, but they just leave so many potentially exciting ideas on the table.

There’s also the fact that this movie doesn’t really have an ending, and I don’t just mean the conclusion was unsatisfying, I mean it kind of ends, abruptly, with the end credits coming down right at the moment where you’d expect to see some kind of really powerful epilogue.  And then it just ends, and I do get that the way they took things is fairly faithful to the books, but it still feels kind of disappointing.  Still, what we do get, I do really like.  It’s a pretty small movie in the grand scheme of things, I found myself resonating with both Shon and Arrietty, both of whom are lonely and isolated youths for very different reasons, and each of whom have an entirely unique and interesting perspective on the world around them.  It’s a cute, charming story that doesn’t have a whole lot of meat on its bones, but it also doesn’t try to pretend to be more than it is, and it offers you an experience that you can lose yourself in if you choose to, alongside a cast of likeable characters...  Even the eventual antagonist, who’s surprisingly funny and has some pretty understandable motives...  who you’ll have no problem rooting for and getting attached to, even if it does lead to a kind of ‘read the novels’ type of ending.  It has its flaws, but I still recommend checking it out.

The Secret World of Arrietty is currently available in several different formats from Gkids.  The original novels by Mary Norton are still in print, and while copies of the 1997 Hollywood adaptation are easy to find online, I don’t know how you’d go about finding the various British adaptations, so good luck with that.  I should also mention that Bridgit Mendler put out a tie-in music video called Summertime, but it’s kinda terrible, especially compared to the songs Cecile Corbel wrote for the movie.

To this day, The Secret World of Arrietty is the highest grossing Studio Ghibli movie to receive an American theatrical release, even succeeding beyond Spirited Away and Ponyo in that regard, and while it’s possible that could be attributed to it’s roots as the adaptation of a beloved childrens book series, it’s still really weird to know that it’s become one of the more forgettable Ghibli films.  I would honestly consider it to be one of their most under-rated titles, and while I know I’ve said that before about Only Yesterday, at least that movie has managed to build up a decently sized cult following, while Arrietty hasn’t been able to do the same.  It’s not a particularly deep or exciting movie, and it doesn’t have the most dire stakes, but I think there’s more than enough to enjoy about it, and what it does have, it does really well.  It’s a really fun, emotionally satisfying movie that’s full of charm and likeable characters, creative set pieces and immersive atmosphere, and at least by my standards, just enough adventure and peril to keep it from getting boring.  I really like this movie, and I can’t guarantee you’ll feel the same way, but it’s worth seeing at least once.

I give The Secret World of Arrietty a 7/10."
21686,"i gave this a better shot than i did college

summary:

so kiss him not me is an anime with a few blatant things that immediately stand out as wrong, and caused me to drop it my first time i watched it. first, the entire premise is a fujoshi doesnt eat for a week, and then because she didnt eat she is no longer fat and is now hot! which is a yikes ass message on multiple levels. because of her being hot, 3 hot guys who were around her decide they care about her and one hot guy who isnt a piece of shit is still hanging out with her. but shock! shes a fujoshi so she doesnt care about that and kinda just wants to ship these real people she knows, which, whatever, thats a starting base for a story. theres a few paths that can be taken from that as a story and a few of them are good! i actively think that an anime that starts with someone fetishising the queer image and ends with them realising the harm that can do and getting past that phase in their life, and hell i'd even take an arguement for it being an entryway into queer acceptance, albeit not an ideal one. sadly, the path it goes down is continual use of queerbaiting and fat jokes for comedic purposes and for me, capstones at having an actually charming and cute episode that nearly redeemed the whole ass show be interrupted by sexual assault which gets pretty much brushed over.

Characters:

So For characters we have: 
1. Kae, a pretty bog standard in base personality of being a genuinely nice person, but they also added super into anime and bl which is a character trait! there are characters like that! but aside from her weight which Fluctuates For Comedic Purposes, thats all she has! i wish i could really write more about her character, but character depth is reserved for the lesbian

2. Mutsumi, the only not piece of shit boy. hes a genuinely nice person full stop who's soft spoken and consistently takes interest in his friends hobbies and cares about their comfort levels, including kaes during this whole reverse harem fiasco. he deserves a better anime

3. Shinomiya, who is pretty much just a little bitch. he actively was rude and a complete dick to kae while she was fat and changed her mind once her looks was to his liking, and he has no actual redeemable qualities. they may come after episode 8 but thats too late in my book!

4. Igarashi, aka the Nice Guy. Igarashi also didnt really care about kae at before she was hot, but he does have the decency to admit it was the case and has shown signs of not just, wanting to give up if she becomes fat again. 

5. Nanashima, i almost had something nice to say about him. shame he had to do a sexual assault and completely fuck up his character.

6. Nishima is good. shes one of two characters with a personality! she deserves a better anime, where she doesnt exist to queerbait! shes the lesbian with character depth.

Art/music/sound design:

honestly, i cannot talk negatively about any of the design of this anime too much, its not offensive, but nothing truly stands out. i have to give sever negative props to them adding a bunch of bouncy sound effects to kae when shes fat, definitely high tier comedy and NOT absolutely boringly unfunny.

TL;DR:
Too Lame, Dont Watch."

This review covers the English Dub versions of Black Lagoon Season 1 and Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage.

This review contains language that some readers may find upsetting or offensive, discretion is advised.




Call Black Lagoon the delinquent of the Class of ‘06. In theory, it’s the story of everyman Rokuro (Rock after the first episode or so, and from here on out) getting caught up in the hyperviolent crime world of the fictional Thai sin city of Roanapur. In practice, Black Lagoon is both broader and simpler. If you deign to imagine every crime thriller of the past 35 years tossed into a blender and animated in a mid-aughts style, you’ve already got the gist of the show. Lagoon is not, by any means, a complicated anime. To put it the way that one of the dub’s dramatic narrated moments might, it’s a show that follows only one real rule: if the narrative is getting sluggish, have someone bust in with a gun.

img880()
(Rock)

The series follows a core cast of four, who, collectively, make up the mercenary Lagoon Company. The aforementioned Rock, a Japanese salaryman who is kidnapped as an incidental detail in a job gone wrong. He’d be your straight man, the person with a moral compass that’s closest to normal, and a fondness for white button-up work shirts and ties. Then there’s Revy, a Chinese-American girl from New York and a loose cannon in almost every possible sense of the term. She’s the wild one, a firearm expert who favors a pair of pistols (hence her nickname; Two-Hands), swears like a lumberjack who just lost a leg, and just generally doesn’t give a fuck about anything. There’s Benny, a Jewish-American IT tech who is, pardon the term, “the chill one”. And rounding out the cast is Lagoon Company captain Dutch, an African-American (noticing a trend?) ex-soldier defined by a pair of sunglasses and a cool head. 

img880()
(Revy)

Calling the cast ‘colorful’ is underselling them. Revy is the most obviously characterful but all four members of the core cast perform strongly, even Benny. Rock in particular manages to usually nail the unenviable task of being the non-action character in an action show. Often he’s able to talk his way out of things that by all rights he really shouldn’t be, especially as the series nears its end.

Outside of the main four, there are a number of B-characters that help color the world of the series. Among these are Sister Eda, a promiscuous nun employed by the gun-toting Ripoff Church who essentially serves as a second Revy. The absolutely riveting Balalaika, head of the Mafiya-affiliated Hotel Moscow. The indestructible and outrageously-heavily-armed Colombian maid (and, we find out, ex-[FARC-EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RevolutionaryArmedForcesofColombia) guerrilla) Roberta. Mob bosses like the Triad head Mr. Chang and a number of more rarely-appearing characters help too. On the antagonistic side, you’ve got Neo-Nazis, terrorists, the Italian-American Mafia, and a smorgasbord of other Action Movie villains.

It’s here worth mentioning the strong dub performances. Almost everyone is voice acted bare minimum solidly, and many are actually very good. Of special note are those by Dutch, whose actor Dean Redman is probably better known as the voice of various animated Nick Fury incarnations nowadays, and that of Balalaika. Patricia Drake (best known as Trunks in Dragonball Z) brings an absolutely bone-chilling aura to her performance that makes the character simply magnetic to watch. It’s arguably the show’s strongest vocal performance overall and it’s a shame that it’s one of just a handful that she ever brought to the medium, being mostly a western animation VA. 

img880()
(Balalaika)

Finally there’s that of Roberta, whose cold performance is quite literally accented by a slight Colombian Spanish accent, her vocal tone really selling the character’s steely strength.

The script on the other hand is a bit of a bumpier ride. There are a lot of obviously-altered or adlibbed pieces of dialogue. References to American pop-culture like Sears and western films abound, and the cursing is colorful but believable. On the other hand, the script shows its age with liberal peppering of terms like “retarded” around. It’s the sort of thing where it’s hard to hold it against the show per se, since what’s considered acceptable language has changed over time, but if you’re a certain sort of person it’s liable to make you wince a bit. On the other hand, one can definitely hold the character of Shenhua, who is Taiwanese, against the show. Shenhua’s actual vocal performance is competent, but she’s dubbed in a highly stereotypical yellowface accent that is just not a good look for anyone involved. Not helping is the fact that her in-series nickname is “Chinglish”. Shenhua is the one point where the show’s script inarguably passes a line across ‘rude humor’ and fully sails out into ‘downright offensive’, and it’s a serious mark against an otherwise very strong dub.

Visually, the show is competent but not terribly innovative. It mostly works in muted color palettes and while some of the action sequences it executes are a bit atypical for anime, there’s really nothing groundbreaking here. Craft, not new ideas, carry Black Lagoon in this department. The CGI cars haven’t aged super-well, but it’s hard to blame the show itself for that, and other than occasional over-obvious tricks like frame-shaking to simulate vibrating movement, there’s really nothing to complain about in the visuals department.

So what of the actual plot? Well, Black Lagoon is divided into two 12-episode seasons (the second given the subtitle The Second Barrage), and further subdivided into several arcs each, each of which is usually 3-episodes long, though the one that closes out the show is longer.

The first season is on the whole, the stronger one by a good margin. There’s nothing quite like Dutch and Remy turning a boatful of blowhard Neo-Nazis into a shooting gallery, or Lagoon Company’s encounter with Roberta, who comes in with a briefcase and meido getup full of heavy weaponry to tear Loanapur apart looking for her missing young master.

When in the mode of pure fun, Black Lagoon is a blast. Unfortunately, the show from time to time tries to dip its toes into having a message, and it’s here where Black Lagoon makes its shortcomings known. Much of the discussion on the nature of power and what would drive people to lives of crime in the series is essentially empty philosophizing. At best, it’s a time and interest-killer. At its worst, it comes across as actively patronizing. This reaches its peak with the show’s overall low point, the absolutely miserable “Vampire Twins” arc that makes up the first three episodes of Second Barrage. 

img880()
(One of the twins. Note her rifle, it's the best thing about the arc.)

The Vampire Twins arc is a culmination of the series’ worst impulses. It mixes a plot device that strains credulity and absolutely annihilates good taste, even for this show. It stars two Romanian twins who have become expert assassins after a life of being forced to murder other children on camera for snuff films, both of whom sometimes “switch” to being the other by passing a wig back and forth. When one dies, the other pulls double duty, until she dies too. Both give the entirety of Roanapur a run for their money, up to and including Hotel Moscow, before they finally take the kids down. 

It’s a bizarre combination of cartoonish and relentlessly miserable. The former works for Black Lagoon (again, see the Roberta arc that closes out the first season), but the latter really doesn’t. It can be hard to pinpoint the exact line between gritty and violent media that’s still fun and gritty and violent media that’s just dull, but during this arc, which I must also mention, features Balalaika having to shake down minor character and sex club owner Rowen for literal child pornography so she can figure out who these kids are, that line has well been crossed. The arc’s sole redeeming feature is that it’s the first appearance of “The World of Midnight”, the haunting acapella track that has become Black Lagoon’s aural signature in the years since its premiere.

Sadly, the Vampire Twins arc may well have been something of a portent of what was to come for the seinen action genre, as that level of willful bad taste is now the norm for that sort of manga. It’s hard not to draw at least a small line from this arc to the sheer pointlessness of something like say, [Gleipnir](https://anilist.co/review/2374), or [Magical Girl Spec. Ops. Asuka](https://anilist.co/review/4305).

Elsewhere in Second Barrage, it’s a more mixed bag. An entertaining arc about a counterfeiter named Jane is a fun throwback to the first season, but it’s over a bit too quickly.

The aforementioned Yakuza arc that closes out the season is interesting in its intricacy, and while its own ruminations on the question of “why do people do bad things?” feel much more earned than those of the Vampire Twins arc, it still fails to make the connections necessary to turn those from merely food for thought into a genuine thematic thesis. It just can’t tie these ideas together well enough, and the overall ending again feels rather grim-for-the-sake-of-it rather than grim-for-a-reason, two categories separated by an admittedly fine line. It’s probably a bit too rude to call Black Lagoon on the whole philosophically empty, but it really comes up short in these areas.

img880()
(This is a still of arc character Yukio, but I also like to think of it as a visual metaphor for the weaker parts of the series.)

So is Black Lagoon a bad show? Certainly not, while it fails at really digging into the broader psychological issues it tries to, on a purely narrative level it’s endlessly entertaining. It feels a little backhanded to say that a show is “watchable”, since technically anything is watchable, but Black Lagoon has a “can’t put it down” quality that a lot of more thematically engaging anime admittedly don’t have, which prevents me from calling it bad. On the contrary, taken as pure entertainment, it’s actually pretty damn good. There are worse things for an anime to be than that.

If you’re looking to pass a few nights and pop some popcorn and are capable of putting up with its flaws, Black Lagoon is worth a spin. It may not be the classic that it occasionally gets bandied about as, but it’s good, solid, hot-barrelled fun."
530,"As the first major directorial job of the famed director Junichi Satou— of Ojamajo Doremi, Princess Tutu, and Aria fame—as well as being one of the most influential magical girl anime of all time, Sailor Moon has steep expectations to live up to. And while it might at some points stumble under the weight of its own production, I believe that it ultimately sticks the landing.

While the animation is nothing to write home about, its style is one of its hallmarks. The show is constantly aglow with color, bringing forward an innocent charm; a richly lit Tokyo Tower always features prominently in the beautifully drawn streets of the Juban District, where much of the show takes place. As the series goes on, the Juban District becomes a close and familiar place for viewers, with characters constantly interacting with their environment—whether at the arcade or discussing team plans at Hikawa Shrine—in a way that allows for the area to feel very lived in and serving to strongly increase the comfortability of the viewer.

Bro, vaporwave??????

The music of the show remains a highlight. While the soundtrack of Sailor Moon is not utilized very expansively—the average episode will typically utilize at least 3-5 of the same songs—it is nevertheless a joy to listen to. With a mix of orchestral instruments as well as those typically utilized in rock and jazz, the show constantly has an energy lent to it by its sound, an energy that constantly lends to both the fast-paced comedy and touching romance that the show loves to juxtapose itself by.

youtube(https://youtu.be/MWxJgokMkAQ)
I've heard this song at least 20 times, and it still hasn't gotten old

On a different note, I must admit that the mainline story of Sailor Moon is not my favorite. That is not to say that it is “bad” or “inadequate,” but I firmly believe that this is not a show where the greatest strengths lie in its main story. Of course, this is not a universally agreed upon opinion; Sailor Moon Crystal exists if only to appease the parts of the fanbase who complained about how the 1992 show strayed so far from the original visions of mangaka Naoko Takeuchi. I am not one such fan. While the overarching romance between Usagi and Mamoru could be compelling, I found myself diverting my attention towards episodes—such as the episode where the gang goes to an anime studio or the episode about the boy who has a crush on Ami—that according to [some ](https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/sailor-moon)are simply skippable filler. To put it in simpler terms, this is very much a show that I feel shines in its “filler” over the “essential” episodes. 

Arguably my biggest complaint about Sailor Moon is rather asinine. The transformation sequences for the Sailor Senshi are incredible, and rightly praised as such, with concise and dramatic posing framed by beautiful fabric animation that make them a joy to watch on an episode-to-episode basis. However, they are utilized inconsistently throughout the show. By Episode 33, all five Sailor Senshi are introduced into the show, meaning that, at most, there are going to be five transformations within a given episode, with some episodes not featuring all five transforming at once. One would think that the show would accommodate this and set a standard order and timing for every order of transformations, as a modern magical girl such as Precure would do. Sailor Moon does not do this, which means that in some episodes, transformations will be sped up, cut up, and otherwise fragmented. This obviously does not make the show unwatchable, but, especially within the context of binging, it makes watching segments of every episode somewhat jarring.

youtube(https://youtu.be/o6HAHogcHFI)
Seriously, that fabric animation is fantastic!

The Tokyo of the 1990s is a land of fads. While not strictly an intentional component of Sailor Moon’s ethos, it is nevertheless worthwhile to examine how the anime functions as a representation of the waning years of Japan’s economic bubble. Much of the “filler” of Sailor Moon takes place in new buildings or experiences that crop up across Tokyo every other day, whether that means an aerobics studio, a love cruise, or even a princess training camp, places that offer no practical value and that are, at times, relatively absurd. This anime is able to capture the end of an era for Japan, the closing of a time where people had more money than they knew what to do with, who put it in all in unrealistic ventures that would mostly collapse.

img420()

It is worth noting that the manner of action within Sailor Moon is fundamentally different from the modern magic girl anime (i.e., Precure). The Sailor Senshi do not spar off with their opponents in any sort of active way. For the most part, battles involve the girls running away from villains, getting attacked by villains, and then, after enough time has passed, utilizing their unique powers to take down the villain. This “reactive” manner of battle is very different from the modern, “proactive” angle of magical girl, which Precure animator Hisashi Kagawa described as “pretty young girls like in Sailor Moon [engaging] in ‘Dragon Ball’-like action,” wherein the girls will actively put their all into the fight and spar off against enemies on a level playing field. Obviously the two types of actions are of their respective eras, and are built on top of even older trends, but it is still fascinating to go back to an anime such as Sailor Moon and see how the genre looked before several drastic changes took place over time.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon is a lot of things. It is one of the most aesthetically pleasing shows I have ever watched. It is a show jampacked with charming characters and lovely music. It is a conceptual jumble that at times can be downright bewildering to view. But above all, it is an anime that delivers on a promise of showcasing the “Miracle of Romance,” and I truly do love it for that."
8861,"If you actually cut the ""incest part"" and think of it as a whole and how the story goes, maybe you might see something else. 

Instead of just being a moralistic freak that you are.
But I still doubt it anyway.



Before even watching the anime, I clearly thought that it was just gonna be a typical maybe ""School Days"" Anime. That doesn't really mean anything or has depth in it. Just a bunch of horny teenagers wanting to fuck. (very biased ik)

You never really want to trust comments or rumors especially when it comes to this. Not unless you've seen the series for yourself. But I doubt you're gonna be any different.



What I really liked and something to take note of, is that how the story goes especially the music that comes and goes in the right time. Which is also good pacing and fitting of the scenes with the music.
And rarely do I find something like this in a romance anime anymore.

It reminded me of WA2 (White Album 2) another anime that's actually under appreciated and also a VN (Visual Novel).



The arcs, especially was handled decently. Considering it is a VN and every girl has it's each and own respective arc/route. Which is fair.



The characters or girls has depth in the them. They aren't just simply fucking out of being horny. What makes this different and something to really appreciate. Is that, they're not just simply in love. There's a reason on why is why, and this is provided in every single arc.



On what I don't like or find a bit bothering is that, Haru is essentially a campus crush. Everyone and every girl if not, most are attracted to him. But to be fair he isn't that all high, he has his flaws to counter too. He gets weak or indecisive when pressured or confused.



His wingman Ryouhei is a typical pervert. Which isn't that surprising. And Sora is annoying but bearable, and I can understand that.




You'd have to think fair and carefully when rating something likes this. There's a lot of things I critically find, but given it's just 12 ep anime at the least it wasn't that bad. No, not that much.

Imagine this for a minute – you burst into the boardroom at an American television studio and tell them you have this idea that you want to see worked on. The board members ask what the idea is. You then say in an excited, giddy tone that it’s about a bygone-aged Chinese military strategist who, in modern-day Japan, uses his perceptive insights to help a young starlet gain fame as a popular singer. I can only imagine the looks that you might be given by the board members; probably a mixture of bewilderment and someone frantically pressing the big red button to call for security to kick you out. The question they ask is clear, though – “How is a series like that supposed to work? Who would watch this?”

Ya Boy Kongming! is a reminder that one of the beautiful things about anime and manga is that not only do properties dare to get those questions asked, but also that a Japanese studio would take the idea and run with it. When I was perusing the list of anime that were releasing in Spring 2022, this was among the ones that I added purely on a lark. The English-translated title got my attention, and reading the synopsis, I knew that this was something that I had to watch. There’s something to be said about insane ideas having a kind of crazed magnetism that makes you too curious to not see developed. At the very least, I hoped that some good songs would come out of it.

After dying and being reborn, Kongming finds himself wandering around what he thinks is Hell, but is actually the modern day (which, depending on who you ask, is not that far off) on Halloween. He finds his way into a club where he hears a young woman named Eiko singing to the crowd, and he’s captivated by her voice. After being brought back to her apartment and realizing he has the chance to live a peaceful life now away from warfare, Kongming takes it upon himself to become Eiko’s new manager and “tactician,” arranging for her to gain new superstardom, achieve her dreams, get more likes on social media, and make the world a better place.

It goes without saying that this premise is silly, and indeed, comedy is interwoven into the fabric of the show’s narrative and plot. Though virtually every single character in the show is funny in some fashion, Kongming stands centerstage as the show’s comedic ringleader. The show brilliantly uses the transplanted-from-one-place-to-another device in two ways: firstly, antiquity is brought to us rather than the present brought to antiquity, so the modern world is a given rather than being the odd duck out. Even though this is not an inherently unique idea, it helps breathe a little life into the cliché itself. Secondly, it’s also used to suffuse humor into everything surrounding Kongming. Absurdities come one after another either along with him or in his wake, giving nearly all of his scenes an unpredictable quality both in terms of material and timing. One minute he’s heavily debating how to move forward with his plan, and then maybe ten seconds later he buys garish glasses. 

Kongming’s antics are thankfully not purely used for silly comedy, either. His natural capabilities as a tactician allow him to navigate his new geographical and temporal landscape, especially given that his lack of knowledge regarding the present would leave most in his situation at a complete loss. He demonstrates an adaptive, perceptive quality that not only ingratiates him to those he meets, but also in scouring for information and evaluating any given scenario. These often lend themselves to even more comedic moments where some seemingly-innocuous thing he does actually has a purpose, which humorously comes to fruition in the later minutes of episodes or entire arcs. The result is that Ya Boy Kongming’s comedy works in both planting brick jokes that pay their dividends, and in brief one-off gags.

But even in the midst of its comedic goofiness and propensity for laughs, the series has an endearing heart at its center. None of Ya Boy Kongming!’s comedy reads as cold or mean-spirited since the crux of the series lies in the warmth of its characters and how they support one another. Kongming being transplanted into modern-day Tokyo is taken care of initially by Eiko, and through their interactions, he begins to take steps to make sure her natural talents bear fruit and blossom, nudging her in the right direction and fostering what is already there. 

And these moments are handled gracefully. Ya Boy Kongming! thankfully knows that within the midst of its oddball tone and setting, it needs to make the few times it pauses to catch its breath work effectively. The show demonstrates this quality not only in its earlier outings with Eiko soothing Kongming’s apprehensions, but also with the other characters as the ensemble size increases. While the actual relationships at times are more one-sided, with Eiko being the main beneficiary to Kongming’s guidance rather than the opposite, they believe in one another’s ability to help the other.

The show’s use of diegetic music greatly supports this notion. Since performance is intimately woven both into Eiko’s character and the overall universe of the story, both the performances in front of crowds and the more-private listenings carry dramatic significance. Eiko’s singing voice actress, 96Neko, especially captures both sensitivity and bravura as the occasion calls for it.  To contrast with that, Chiba Shouya as Kabetaijin walks the fine line between crisp pronunciation and smooth delivery. Nearly all the performances thus have a zest and charge which is always supported by the narrative, including comedically when it fits.  And I’d be remiss if I did not mention Zoltán Tarcsi for composing an immanently-memorable OP cover track, which forced itself into my brain with its Eurobeat techno goodness and still hasn’t let go ([click here for the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRjLbePQg1o)). 

And visually, the series works surprisingly-well. The Tokyo landscape affords numerous bright, neon-esque colors both in and outside the various clubs, and Eguchi Asumi’s first foray into color design makes a solid impression with its nighttime and sunset sceneries. The character designs are also a nice breath of fresh air – since we’re not dealing with high school aged characters, there is more liberty at work in what the characters wear. Converse-style shoes and a wide assortment of street clothes give freshness and personality to the people involved. 

If there is one particular aspect of the aesthetics that could be picked apart, it’s that there is a slight overreliance on one particular song. On some level, it makes sense for the show to do this – the song in question, “I’m Still Alive Today,” serves as one of the show’s thematic devices to help track Eiko’s growth. That said, there are a couple of times where it leans too heavily on it, regardless of its particular personal significance to her. Therefore, the song, while in and of itself not a poor composition, is still a slight annoyance. One of the episodes actually uses the song three separate times, which is rather much. This gets somewhat helped by the fact that its plot-relevant uses have some variety and utility in how the song is used, which makes this less of an issue overall.

I mentioned the song’s use of tracking Eiko’s growth, and growth is, in many ways, the underlying theme of the entire series. The little bits of information about Eiko’s life that we are privy to learning about indicate a young woman whose passion has been stepped on more times than she can remember. Though success for Eiko translates to performing at music festivals and letting her own singing be heard by more people beyond the scant followers she has, it also relates to her own downtrodden, reluctant outlook. It’s not enough to just be good at what you do – it’s acknowledging seizing the moments presented to you and making them your own, with a little help along the way if needed…which may or may not include repurposing military strategy and destroying your opponents. The Eiko that develops over the course of the series is not the same young woman we first meet, and as she begins to taste success, she also tastes an aspect of her own abilities and self that she never would have found otherwise.

Whether success relates to finding your own sense of self-signification, or in finding a reason why you love doing what you do, Ya Boy Kongming! tackles growth on numerous fronts. The show’s main characters both old and new all are embarking on that journey to some extent, tailor-made to the circumstances that got them where they were in the first place. It may take attention away from Eiko and Kongming at times, yet the refocused attention creates a fuller tapestry about growth that’s bigger than just those two characters. That doesn’t mean success comes easy, but it makes it at least a little closer and less of a farfetched aspiration. The show’s ability to cap off this feeling, all while sometimes having a cheap gag on standby, can make what follows hilariously unpredictable. The story will likely end exactly how you think it will, but the routes to get there are full of topsy-turvy craziness.

Ya Boy Kongming! understands that a crazy premise can only become a success if everything involved fires on all cylinders, and in this case, it does. With a colorful aesthetic, a strong sense of comedic timing and jokes, solid music, and characters that could be at times incredibly off-the-wall or endearing, it was the show that became my most-eager viewing during Spring 2022. There’s just a few too many times where it relies heavily on one of its signature songs to get a point across, and some of the dramatic beats and pacing work more seamlessly in some instances than others, but the infectious, musical wackiness the show provides is pure fun and never boring. So, I say this – turn up the music, turn on the neon lights, blow out the circuitry, and have a blast!

108268,"If you have aversion towards isekai genre. I would say Ascendance of Bookworm isn't your typical isekai. Well except the character being reborn the story is far from your typical isekai you have seen. Its one its kind.


What is Ascendance of A Bookworm ? Its about myne a little frail girl. In her previous life.In her previous life Motosu Urano was quite a bookworm. While dying she wishes to reborn surrounded by books. But instead she gets reborn as weak little girl myne, who lives with her  parents and elder sister in this medieval era town. Having all the memories of all past life all she wants is reading book. But unfortunately there's no book in her house infact books are rare and expensive in this world and only rich nobles can afford it.
But Myne won't give up so if there's no book she will make her own book. In the process she meets new friends and new people. She introduced minor technology to this world.  The anime isn't rushed at all its slow paced. 
Each episode is quite relaxing to watch. It feels more like a slice of life with a plot anime rather than isekai.


What i loved about this anime is each characters are so full of emotions and theres a element of surprises in every episodes. Each episode unfold something about a character. I love the part how Lutz and Myne relationship develops slowly. Its pure and cute. Besides main characters each other characters are written pretty well.


I like the art style of this anime. Well the art is pretty colorful. I like the medieval european setting. Each characters looks so cute. Animation wise i give it 10/10. 


The opening theme song of this anime series is pretty well animated. Its sounds good and well it gives a little bit of glimpse about how good the anime is. Ending theme is pretty good as well.
Voice actors have done pretty good job as well. Note that i have seen this anime in English subbed. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes it does not have fan service. The story is good and slow paced so its perfect anime to watch with family and friends. So grab some popcorn and get ready to watch with your family.

Lastly,this anime is for those people who don't want any fan service and over the top you know those moments.

This anime is for those who want a nice story, pure love and bonding between characters.

In a single sentence this is a perfect blend of nice story, cute characters, moral value(obviously about books and Family)."
20701,"If you are looking for a romance anime with a tsundere male character I highly recommend this. This anime is about a girl named Erika Shinohara who lies to her friends about having a hot boyfriend, forced into an ultimatum Erika takes a picture of a random boy she sees on the street. Turns out the boy is Kyōya Sata and he is well known as the ""Prince"" of the school. In desperation Erika ask Sata to be her pretend boyfriend and to her surprise Sata complies, under one condition, ""Spin around 3 times and bark"". This demand throws Erika into a relationship with Sata which she is referred to as his dog. Throughout the show we are given a glimpse into what Erika's life is like as Kyōya's slave. As she is forced to get drinks for him or even be his shield against rain puddles she finds herself in love. Though until around episode 7-8, Kyōya remains a jerk who likes to demean and order Erika around.  Some problems I found in the show was the fact that after they officially got together the Kyōya we knew for half the season had completely disappeared and here came this new loving Kyōya. However some might not find that a problem, I wasn't completely fond of the idea. Though a good things about the show is the solid plot which follows through but still shows a little bit of comedy and romance through Kyōya acting a jerk, and the animation, though some might not really care, the animation was really good and did a good job of showing off Kyōya's looks. However if you find yourself liking this anime just as much as I did, here's the bad news. After some extensive research I couldn't find the right anime just like Wolf Girl and Black Prince. Well I take that back, an anime that was kind of similar was Maid-Sama. 

This is my first review but I really hope that those of you reading this really enjoy it. I would recommend Wolf Girl and Black Prince if you are into the cold male character who takes a liking to a girl and harbors feeling but is still at the same time cold to her. This anime took me for a spin with the animation and plot and I look forward to rewatching it if I am really bored and can't find another anime. Anyway thanks for reading my review and I hope you guys really truly enjoyed it. Let me know if there are things I can work on or things you liked about this series. Also let me know if you want me to review a series in particular or want any recommendations.

Ah, yes, Panty & Stocking with Garter Belt
Hm, where do I start?

This show picks a seemingly simple topic, anti-hero angels who’ve been kicked out of heaven, adds its twist on magical girls, a sprinkle of plot, and a boatload of (...well how do I put this…?) “dirty” jokes and makes it into something entertaining.

Storyline and Plot
The show established a plot early on. These angels needed to kill ghosts to get heaven coins. However, after a few episodes, it drifted to a different place, shoving the ghosts in minor places to link it to the overall idea. I admit this is slightly sloppy on the creator's part, but I actually enjoyed it. I am a big fan of diverting from the plot for the sake of character development and didn’t notice this flaw until someone else pointed it out.

Characters
Panty and Stocking are simple characters, based around one or two of their interests. However, I don’t feel this takes too much away from the show as their interactions with each other and others are still entertaining despite this. Panty and Stocking don't conform to the stereotypes of an angel, they do whatever they want no matter the consequences. On the opposite side, there are Scanty and Kneesocks, demons who have a passion for following the rules and making the best of themselves. The irony of this drives the characters away from the stereotype that angels are good and demons are evil while still presenting two effective sides.

Art, Music, and Format
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KN0-HgWNo)
All the art style shifts throughout the show were some of my favorite parts, from the ghosts blowing to bits, the detailed transformation scene, and the cartoony style that dominated most of the show. Accompanying this was the soundtrack which, in my opinion, was great, especially my personal favorite song D City Rock (linked above.) At first, I found it strange each “episode” was really two combined, but I enjoyed it for the sake of my short attention span. It also made the show progress faster and not drag on due to the limited duration of episodes.

The Ending !!slight spoilers!!
Overall, the ending wrapped up the show in a neat little bow with a spot for a potential sequel. However, seeing as it's been 11 years, I don’t think we’ll be getting one soon. After the storyline diverted from the main plot, it finally got back on the rails and became fairly emotional for a comedy show if you don’t think about it too much. A bit of cliche was created towards the end, making things somewhat predictable but with a little art style swap and nonsensicalness, it was combatted nicely."
20483,"After finishing my 3th rewatch 4 days ago, I decided to write my first review about Mikakunin de Shinkoukei. As one of the first animes I watched in 2015, it had a special impact on me, especially with its nice comedy, adorable characters and moe factor. I hope you will enjoy my review. (≧▽≦)

Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is basically the story of a girl called Kobeni, who on her sixteenth birthday is suddenly told that she is engaged to the mysterious boy, Hakuya. Very creative, right? Well, for half of the show fits standard fare in terms of a Slice of Life and rom-com with a lot of moe. The latter half is where the show begins to peak when we learn the Mitsumines are not ordinary folk living on mountains and the connection with Kobeni is linked to a long forgotten accident, leading to the reason behind this engagement. Even if this doesn’t change the overall situations in episodes in my eyes, it is a factor which makes the story a little bit more interesting and different from other shows. The idea of including non-human characters in a slice of life anime might sound weird, even if it doesn’t’ change main process of the anime. I personally still think Mikakunin de Shinkoukei can be only defined as a slice of life, however however fantasyor something similar could’ve been an added genre.

One of the weakest points of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is some unconnected scenes one after another. In my opinion the main reason of it is manga, which consist of different and short chapters with simple designed panels. Besides the scenes with another, almost all scenes are well connected in their own plots. It wouldn’t be wrong to say Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is an episodic anime, however it doesn’t have a specific storyline either. The main idea of the whole show is making the characters as cute and funny as possible, which the anime succeeds in general. Only 12th episode has a different process than the others as a dramatic episode, which is not a problem for me. I even enjoyed watching such a nice episode.


img150() 
As the very main character we have Kobeni. I personally think she is like an average character who we can see in every slice of life + rom-com anime. Well, I can’t really say I love Kobeni that much, since she is unnecessarily emotional and overreacting at some scenes. However, she has some nice characteristics that cause some funny scenes in addition, so also I can’t say she is an unqualified main character. For me the expression “normal” matches her with every single feature of her. At the end I can just respect her housework skills and big boobs.

In a slice of life anime which could be defined specifically as a “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things” (CGDCT) anime, there must be a character who brings moe wherever she goes. For that role we have Mashiro, our little sister-in-law. With every action she does, she is always so adorable. It makes totally sense that she is the main target of Benio with her cute characteristic and sister-like behaviors. It is also cute that she tries to act mature, but every time she tries to be older than her age, she fails. Together with her interest on UMAs, Mashiro is a character that every moe fan would love for sure.

img150() 

Benio is my personal favorite character in Mikakunin de Shinkuokei. I heard from a lot of people that they find her annoying or repellent, but still nobody can ignore the fact that she is the main source of the whole comedy in this anime. In my opinion, without Benio, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei would be simple and boring. Even though her sister-complex might seem too much at some cases, I think that this just makes Benio a better character.

I actually don’t have much to say about Hakuya. He barely speaks during the episodes and he doesn’t heve a proper personality or character development. While rewatching the show, I realized again that his most important role is to be there and keep existing. However, at some points I think that he fits the main idea of anime which is made to be a slice of life.


Except that 4 main characters, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei includes 6 more supporting characters in total. Even though they are not totally awesome designed, all of them has an equal personality at a level worthy for their role.

In addition to single characteristics, the most important equality of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is the great combined relationships between characters. First of all, there is a romantic relationship between Kobeni and Hakuya, which takes the biggest attention on audience’s eyes. Because of Hakuya’s weak personality in general, their relationship can’t go far away from a single hug, however in the following volumes of manga, these two characters become a little bit closer than in the anime. In following, an another remarkable point is the relationship of Benio with all sister-like characters in anime. Not only in Kobeni, but her interest in Mashiro is enough to make me enjoy this show. Unlike Kobeni, Masiro finds that huge attention that benio gives her really annoying and tries to put her off. This annoyed expressions of Mashiro made me smile or laugh a lot of times. In addition we have two powerful friendship situations between Kobeni and Mayura , Benio and Nadeshiko. Both of the friends of this main characters can be defined as calm similarly, even though Nadeshiko’s personality is much serious than Mayura’s. I personally like Nadeshiko more, with especially the first OVA. Lastly there is the relationship between Mashiro and Setsuna, which I find kind of unnecessary. The reason that Mashiro annoys Benio, who Setsuna adores, makes her hate Mashiro, not in a malicious but in a funny way.

I want to start my paragraph with the opening and ending themes. Since I am not that into high pitched voices and energetic music, I would honestly say both songs don’t fit my music taste. The opening of anime, Tomadoi→Recipe (とまどい→レシピ), is actually kind of nice, especially the beginning part makes me addicted to the song a little bit. Unfortunately, I don’t have the same opinion about the ending theme, Masshiro World (まっしろわーるど). It was really not for me which is pretty understandable, since I skipped the song in literally every episode. We also surprisingly have a second ending that could be defined as an insert song, too. 16-sai tte iu no wa Tokubetsu na Kanji da (16歳っていうのは特別な感じだ) by Jun Ichikawa is probably my favorite musical piece including all the other soundtracks. I still wouldn’t listen it in my free time, however, it is not a song I would skip if it was an opening theme. Oh, and we shouldn’t forget great UMA song of course.

Lastly, there are totally 9 character songs, 3 songs for every main girl (Kobeni, Mashiro and Benio) which I think are the best part of the anime for music lovers. I won’t give my opinion about all of 9 songs here, however I would like to say Kobeni and especially Benio ones are pretty charming and nice.

With vivid colors and nice character design the show is nice and smoothly animated. In complacence with other popular shows like No Game No Life (MADHOUSE), Your Lie in April (A-1 Pictures) or Noragami (BONES), I would surely say that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei has a simple and easy style. The utilization of white for highlights just makes the colors seem more staring than normal. In addition to these, after looking at some panels of manga, it is easy to say that the animators improved the art style of mangaka in a really good way. Herewith I would say that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is wonderfully animated in its own way. Great job Doga Kobo!

The anime has 2 additional episodes, each lasting roughly 12 minutes.

First of them is Mikakunin de Shinkoukei: Mite. Are ga Watashitachi no Tomatteiru Ryokan yo., released at 19th of March 2014. I especially love the first part of this episode which deals with the childhood memories of Kobeni with her sister Benio and Benio’s best friend Nadeshiko. The other part of the episode represents another memory but memory of Mashiro and Hakuya this time. Both parts don’t take part in original manga, which means actually, first OVA of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is a filler-like episode

Second OVA, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei: Kamo Nikutte Midori-ppoi Aji ga suru no ne., includes the special edition of the 5th manga volume, and explains the experiences of 5 characters in an onsen trip in a thermal hotel. Mashiro’s interest in UMAs makes this episode totally funny and watchable.

Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is written and drawn by Cherry Arai if the source of the anime with the same name. I read the manga only until the end of the last episode of the anime and with everything I experienced while reading it I would honestly say that the manga is not much qualified like anime. Despite the fact that the art style is poor, all pages and panels seem so simple and plain that it makes the reader bored after a few chapters. In my opinion if you watched the anime, the manga is inadequate for an enjoyable reading.

To sum up, I want to start with writing all positive and negative aspects of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei:

- +Some great characters with well thought relationships
- +Impressive art style
- +Additional character songs
- +Nice OVAs
- +Better than manga for sure
- +Benio
- -Weak main lead
- -Unconnected storyline at some points
- -Average ending theme
- -Inadequate manga for people, who want to know what happens after anime

In conclusion Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is an enjoyable anime with cute characters in my eyes.

Thanks for reading my first review to the end! Have a great day!"
98503,"Gakuen Babysitters
AKA: I think I just felt a little tug on my heartstrings

This is one of those ‘healing’ anime that helps you see the goodness in the world. It’s pure, it’s uplifting, it’s adorable. It’s not what you would call a work of art – it’s similar to watching a baby giraffe try to walk for the first time. Its clumsiness is part of what makes it so endearing.

Even people who don’t tend to like little kids much – me, for instance – will find that this show appeals on a level you wouldn’t think possible. It’s hard to describe just how many times this series made me smile, go ‘awww’ or dance around in sheer unrestrained joy at their adorableness. (In my head of course, I didn’t actually go dancing round.)

But there’s more to the anime than just kiddy antics. It’s the reason Ryuji puts up with the kids, and the reason they love him.

He sees them as people. He doesn’t like cleaning up messes, changing diapers, or trying to stop a tantrum any more than the average person. He doesn’t enjoy not being able to spend as much time with his friends as he would otherwise, and he definitely doesn’t enjoy having his stuff ruined. But he loves the kids. He sees each tot as a human being with his/her own distinct personality, struggles, and likes and dislikes. They’re almost like family to him (Kotaro is actually family of course). Just being with them, seeing how they warm to him and come to trust and love him in return is one of the most purely satisfying parts of this show, and the reason I loved it so much. Ryuji is exactly the type of person that shines best when taking care of others, because of his gentle, patient and selfless nature. It’s also the reason he’s so good at it. His only fault is that he can be a bit too soft on the kids, but Kamitani and the others are there to balance that out.

Usaida, on the other hand, has got to be one of the most irresponsible babysitters out there. Seriously, leaving a kid that small outside by themselves, what was he thinking? Sure, he didn’t realise they were gone, but that only makes it worse. It’s not like it was a one-off either. I know it’s meant to be a gag primarily used to highlight Ryuji’s heroism, but he should have been made out as a bit more responsible all the same.

He’s not the only character who’s a bit unrealistic. There’s the crybaby father, the child-loving deviant (as he’s so called in the anime), the weary older brother and the tsundere who thinks the kids hate her. Whilst none of them were integral to the story (except maybe Inomata, who got some decent development), they were rather funny to watch at times. I suppose they did provide a bit of a distraction from the kids every now and again by injecting a bit of drama, which was refreshing. The love triangle scenario was unnecessary, but that didn’t mean it was bad in this case. I did think it was rather sweet, and the innocent way it was shown was consistent with the innocence of the anime on the whole.

The real gem, though, was watching Ryuji and Kotaro’s interactions. It’s incredibly rare to see the loss of parents in anime handled so maturely, normally it’s just a ‘let’s ignore the fact that the parents are dead until it’s time for a tragic backstory arc!’. Here it was realistically done. Ryuji loved his parents very much, and truly misses them. He treasures Kotaro in their absence, and Kotaro in return thinks Ryuji exemplifies everything good in the world. Parental death in this case brought Ryuji and Kotaro all the closer as the only surviving members of the family, and the way they cherish each other is heart-wrenching. Watching Ryu try and raise his brother in place of their parents, and watching Kotaro try and help Ryu as much as his tiny little body is able, was beautiful. It’s love in its purest form, and I’m glad I got to see it.
 
The other members of their new family, the Chairwoman and butler Saikawa, are also great characters. The Chairwoman is a good person, even though you wouldn’t guess it at first glance. She looks like a crotchety old lady, doesn’t mince words and makes Ryuji and Kotaro earn their keep, but watch her long enough and you’ll see a little smile creep over her face as she watches them bring life back into the too empty house. She has the ability of giving over lessons that seem harsh, until you reflect on what she said and realise how much care and wisdom was behind it. Saikawa, too, has a lot more to him than meets the eye. He appears enigmatic, but is hiding a wicked sense of humour and a heart of gold. He helps them a lot more than they even realise. Both play a big part in Ryuji and Kotaro’s respective developments.

What can I say about the rest of the aspects, like the sound and art? The sound is very tender and warms your heart. The voice actors, especially those that play the kids, are brilliant and really make you believe actual tiny humans are speaking. The art is mellow and has a lot of pastel tones and soft designs. The kids are ridiculously chibi, but that’s done on purpose to make them seem cuter. It works, too.

Altogether I’m unreasonably glad I watched this. I’ll probably go to bed with a fuller heart for the next week than I have done in a while. And I think I might even like little kids more on the whole after this. If you want a pure, adorable and heart-warming slice of life about a day-care, this is the one for you. XD
Adorableness Overload: The Anime"
16011,"And thus concludes the prologue of the Tokyo Ravens story. Although it has been four years since I previously watched Tokyo Ravens it's still fresh in my mind, wishing I could go back and watch it again for the first time as I was sad to see it finish with no season 2 on the horizon, however I can be happy that, unlike its counterparts in the genre it received a satisfying conclusion that left me happy for the characters, even if their stories are unfinished.

It definitely isn't the most incredibly animated anime you'll ever see, with the CGI through the first cour being off-putting at times (The famous CG omelette comes to mind) but it was forgivable seeing as it did not show up all too often and towards the second cour it vastly improved. On the positive side the magic battle were beautiful to watch from start to finish and they even managed one of the most visually appealing scenes of the two seasons Tokyo Ravens participated in towards the end of the show when Kyouko uses astrology which together with the music was a very moving and defining moment for the anime. Could another studio have done better? Certainly, but I really enjoyed what 8bit did and couldn't ask for anything else.

The peak of the show definitely lies with the abundance of well thought out and very visually appealing characters, with the show throwing many side characters in and out of the story to help along or fight against our main cast of characters, being Harutora, Natsume, Touji, Kyouko, Suzuka and Tenma. Each of these brought along new personalities and dynamics to the screen which bounce off each other and even the side characters (Most notable being Ohtomo, an incredible character that could headline his own Anime) with ease, which made the filler episodes much more bearable to watch and brought the conclusions to the various storylines towards the end of the show that much more enjoyable.

Speaking of the storyline, it did a good job of mixing a lot of slice-of-life episodes in the first half of the show, but when things get serious in the latter end of Tokyo Ravens, it gets very, very good. The final two arcs of the show, are an incredible demonstration of how to manage a final battle. Almost all the many characters introduced in the series to that point have some sort of role to play in the conflict, something that many shows cannot seem to do, but Tokyo Ravens excelled at, with each character slowly appearing one by one each in their own way to fight for a loved character in Natsume.

Finally, there's the ending. Four years later the kiss still leaves me wanting to see Harutora and Natsume happily ever after, but until then I'll be happy to just see the adventures of Harutora, Hishamaru, Kakugyouki  and how them with the others deal with their newfound standing within the world and how they use that to deal with the Agency. 

In the end, it's a 100% watch from me between the loveable characters in the slice of life elements to the uniquely insane combat that the world's magical system brings. Thanks for reading!

142074,"In this current deluge of cheap, trashy isekai garbage that we're experiencing in the anime community, it's easy to shrug off a show like MobSeka as nothing more than exactly that. It's not even totally wrong to call this show cheap isekai nonsense, because that's what it is, but that doesn't mean that it isn't GOOD cheap isekai nonsense. In this deep ocean of mediocrity that is isekai, MobSeka stands above its competition by being the best at what it sets out to do while also delivering on aspects one may not expect from a show such as this. 

The protagonist, Leon Bartfort, is probably the biggest draw of this show. He's funny, cocky, and a lot of fun to watch interact with the nonsensical video game world the series has been reincarnated into. This isn't the first time an isekai series has had a character like Leon, a confident outcast who shakes up the dynamics of the world, but Leon comes off as a different breed of isekai hero because he is written as a character first, self-insert power fantasy second, which is best case scenario for an anime like this. Leon is the heart and soul of MobSeka, and its his inclusion in the world that creates the most interesting aspect of this show: the friendship between Angelica and Olivia. 

MobSeka's main trio are subjects of circumstance, without Leon being reborn into this world, Angelica and Olivia would not be friends, as they were protagonist and antagonist in the original game. Whenever I watch anime I always like to think about what the characters would be like if they existed in a more peaceful world. Enemies could be friends, lovers could be enemies, and its that dynamic that MobSeka explores with its supporting cast. Watching Angie and Olivia's relationship grow with Leon as their anchor is a blast to watch, and seeing how it affects the world, namely with the Prince and his cronies, and the new protagonist insert, Marie, provides for an unusual, entertaining deviation on the 'reincarnated into a video game' story.

This show is well written, but unfortunately the production is quite lacking, but never to a degree that it affected my watching experience in any substantial way. MobSeka is animated as averagely as you can get. Some scenes suffer, mostly the action, but at least they bothered to do 2-D mechs. I don't care what anyone says, mecha will always be cool, so it's nice to see a popular isekai represent them positively. 

MobSeka shouldn't be this good. It had no right to be. I could have been here, writing this review, telling you that this is yet another generic isekai power fantasy bullshit-romp that is a waste of your time, but I'm not because the author of this story actually gave a crap and wrote a story worth telling, which is more than can be said for 90% of light novel adaptations we get today."

Only one Stone Ocean review? Yare yare dewa
[ img20() ](https://anilist.co/review/14207)


I haven’t been on the JoJo train as long as others — two years ago, I couldn’t tell a Jonathan from a Joseph. On April 28, 2021, Stone Ocean, the adaption of the series’ sixth “Part” was announced to much rejoicing from the fandom. And even though I hadn’t watched the series yet, I got swept up in the hype. I decided to binge JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure so that I’d be caught up in time for Stone Ocean’s premiere. I wanted to experience the show the same way others had, tuning in for the so-called “JoJo Fridays.”

Unfortunately, that wouldn’t be possible. Stone Ocean made its debut on Netflix vial “batch” format.

I don’t want to belabor Stone Ocean’s release too much as it already feels like a beaten horse at this point, but ignoring it feels a bit disingenuous, as it’s played a big part in this show’s reception. The overwhelming majority of anime is released weekly, which, in the case of JoJo, drives up discussion and hype. Netflix, like most streaming services, releases the episodes of most of its shows all at once. The hybrid of these two formats is known as “batch format” wherein a number of episodes will be released at once, but not all of them. Stone Ocean was released in this manner. I played Devil’s Advocate for a long time regarding this release and while I still stand by it not being the Awful Terrible No Good Worst Ever format most anime fans see it as, it obviously has its problems. Discussion of Stone Ocean is all but nonexistent compared to the previous parts as everyone watches the show at their own pace now. There’s little collective excitement to be had and that’s a real bummer. Making matters worse was the utter lack of communication. I want to say we had no idea how Netflix would release it until the episodes dropped on December 1, 2021. Many assumed the next batch would drop in March or so. Months passed and we got nothing. We eventually were told the next batch would drop September 1, 2022, and the fandom went into full doom mode because we assumed that meant the next batch wouldn’t release until well into 2023, making the entire part needlessly protracted, killing what little hype it still had. Luckily, the third and final batch released on December 1, 2022, but the handling of the release was still very disappointing. 

As if that wasn’t enough, instead of Stone Ocean being worked on by David Production’s A-team, the show was animated by the B-team, with the studio’s focus going toward this season’s Urusei Yatsura. This resulted in lower animation quality and it shows, with background characters being simple outlines ala volume one of [RWBY](/revision/latest?cb=20130827001927). This isn’t to say there aren’t genuinely well-animated sequences (the final stretch is particularly great), but it’s very clear that the A-game isn’t here. And while JoJo has never been known for its consistently great animation quality (unless your name is Golden Wind), it particularly stings here because we know that great animation was possible but given to Urusei Yatsura instead which didn’t need it as much as Stone Ocean. Even if the animation has been poor at times before, it always felt like David Production was trying its best with the hand it was dealt. Stone Ocean feels like it willingly tossed its cards away because it didn’t feel like playing the game.

Neither of these issues ended up hurting the show particularly badly, but they did dampen my excitement.

With the disappointing production addressed, I can answer the most important question: was the show itself any good? At the onset, Stone Ocean, had a pretty big task ahead of it. Like its predecessors, it had to be a good JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure installment in its own right. In addition to this, Stone Ocean does away with the largely self-contained nature of Diamond is Unbreakable and Golden Wind, opting to be a more direct continuation of the DIO plot last explored in Stardust Crusaders. If this wasn’t enough, Stone Ocean is the last part to take place in the timeline we’ve been following since Phantom Blood, meaning it not only had to satisfyingly put a bow on DIO’s shenanigans but the entire series as we knew it. 



Stone Ocean is a bit difficult to rank because it handles the tasks I outlined with varying degrees of success. As a part, I didn’t find it particularly strong. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot to enjoy here and unlike Golden Wind, I never found myself out and out disappointed by it. That said, the vast majority of Stone Ocean’s run was just “good;”nothing more, nothing less. But when I zoom out and look at this as a grand finale, it’s up there as one of, if not the best parts so far. Stone Ocean is definitely more about the destination than the journey and it’s a sight to behold once you get there. 



Stone Ocean follows Jolyne Cujoh. As you could probably guess, she’s the estranged daughter of Jotaro Kujo (so estranged, in fact, that she spells her name “Cujoh” instead of “Kujo” to distance herself from him). In her teenage years, she largely became as much of a delinquent as her father was in his youth, making it all easier for her to be framed for a crime she didn’t commit. While being transferred to the high-security prison, Green Dolphin State Prison, she’s given her belongings, including a pendant from her father. Upon pricking her finger on it, she’s given the power of a Stand, Stone Free. This turns out to be a great help, as the prison is absolutely crawling with hostile Stand users. As Jolyne tries to free herself from prison, she makes allies and stumbles upon a conspiracy involving her father and an evil he defeated in Egypt years ago. 

Since the beginning, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure has been enhanced by its colorful cast of characters and since Battle Tendency, the rich relationships between those characters have elevated the series further. The relationship between Jonathan and Caesar was the highlight of Battle Tendency and the latter’s presence was sorely missed after his death. The bond between the eponymous Stardust Crusaders is compelling enough to get viewers through the lull periods of the part they’re featured in. The same goes for Diamond is Unbreakable — even if the cast isn’t as close-knit as the Crusaders, they play off each other well. Even though I’m not the biggest fan of Golden Wind, I can admit that Bucciarati’s Gang is fun to follow.

img520()

With all that came before, it’s hard not to find the cast of Stone Ocean — or at least their implementation — a mixed bag.

The characters themselves are fine enough. Going in, I was ready to have Jolyne be my favorite JoJo and while she’s not quite there, I can definitely say she’s in the top three or four. She has a forceful and entertaining personality that’s more engaging than Jonathan and Giorno. She’s cool without being stoic, unlike her father during Stardust Crusaders. While subtle, she also has character development that I enjoy, gaining a sense of justice and purpose as the series goes on. Jotaro isn’t as prominent here as he is during Diamond is Unbreakable (it’s kind of hard to be when you’re comatose), but when he’s active, he still makes for a great mentor. Hermes is a fine Jobro, not boring, just not particularly notable, either. I absolutely love Foo Fighters and the zany energy she brings to the cast. Like Caesar before her, you can really feel it when she’s gone. While Weather Report makes for a compelling character and Emporio becomes Stone Ocean’s MVP, these occur either near or at the very end of the part. Throughout most of the part, Weather Report is kind of cool if not shallow while Emporio may as well be Smokey or Poco in how he’s used. The only person I out-and-out dislike in the group is Anasui, as he just comes across as a violent creep. I do enjoy his gender-bending design, though.



My biggest problems with the protagonists of Stone Ocean are their interactions with one another, or lack thereof. There isn’t a moment during the part where the entire group is together. This means that it doesn’t really feel like a group of friends. If they feel like allies, it’s mostly only through them having roughly the same goals and less because they’re actively helping each other achieve those goals. The only three that feel like friends are Jolyne, Hermes, and Foo Fighters because they spend the most time together. Once Foo Fighters dies, it feels like the connective tissue of the group dissolves. Weather Report, Anasui, and Emporio are largely doing their own thing throughout the part. The final battle is the only time everyone is together and it doesn’t feel particularly cathartic. By the time it happens, both Foo Fighters and Weather Report [have become golden clouds](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism) and the final battle doesn’t last long before everyone-not-named-Emporio is wiped out. It just feels odd that the previous part’s group of professionals feels closer than this group. And I guess you could make a point of prison not being a great place to foster friendships, but an explanation doesn’t make the situation any more satisfying.

Speaking of which, we have our first JoJo part that takes place primarily in America and it just so happens to mostly be set in a state penitentiary. There’s probably a joke here. Anyway, Araki gets points for uniqueness but I have to stop far short of giving our wacky mangaka a gold star because wholly hell is the setting drab. As bizarre as it is, a prison’s still a prison and doesn’t make for a visually compelling setting. And again, I’m sure that’s largely the point, as prison’s no pleasure cruise, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a bit boring. But beyond that, it’s a bit amorphous and undefined. It’s a bit of an unfair comparison as it’s literally the best setting in the series, but I can’t help but think of Morioh. The quirky town gave Diamond is Unbreakable a sense of place that no other part quite had. Even if not realistic thanks to its inhabitants, it felt realized and believable — I can still picture it as if it were real. Even if he didn’t paint it as a place I’d want to go to, Araki still could have put more work into making Green Dolphin State Prison feel real. He could have given it more notable locations, and gone more into the daily life of the prisoners. The locales of Stardust Crusaders and Golden Wind, even if not cozy, are at least beautiful. The setting of Stone Ocean is about as compelling as the setting of Phantom Blood.  Things feel more lively once the characters bust out of prison (because duh) but by that point, the part’s almost over.

As always, the Stand powers were a treat and made for some pretty creative fights. It’s hard not to appreciate the zaniness of Weather Report summoning frogs to rain from the sky. And even if it’s a bit hard to follow (though obtuse abilities are nothing new for “JoJo’s Bizarre [It-Just-Works]( Adventure”), you have to at least respect the interesting use of feng shui in the Dragon’s Dream fight.



Yugo Kanno’s score is still terrific, with standout tracks being Jolyne and Pucci’s theme. Both openings are great and it's nice to see the CGI models return even though I didn’t mind the traditionally-animated openings of Parts 4 and 5. The ending theme, “Distant Dreamer” by Duffy is beautiful and encapsulates the feelings of wishing for a better future perfectly. It’s gone on to be one of my favorite endings of the series. I wish the accompanying animation had a bit more effort put into it. And yes, ocean waves are a good contrast to prison, but again, even if it fits doesn’t mean it’s not disappointing.  

Prior to its final arc, Stone Ocean, is just good. And if it sounds like I’m damning it with faint praise, I am. It’s wild and unlike the vast majority of things you’ve seen before, but it’s nothing to write home about in the context of JoJo. It’s fun, yes, but even the worst of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is fun.

But then something magical happens.

It ends.

And it ends with a bang, one louder than any we’ve heard in the series thus far.

Stone Ocean can be seen as a pretty direct sequel to Stardust Crusaders, not just in terms plot, but in structure. Even as someone who likes Stardust Crusaders’ monster-of-the-week format more than most, I can admit that Part 3 was backloaded to the nth degree. I found it good throughout, but it really only hit it out of the park during its final arc, DIO’s World. Similarly, Stone Ocean is fairly middling until the gang breaks out of prison.

Besides the refreshing change of scenery, Stone Ocean improves thanks to having more energy injected into it as the heroes race against time to find the villain. Stone Ocean becomes even more compelling when we’re treated to the backstories of main villain Enrico Pucci and Weather Report, his twin brother. 



Pucci’s backstory is the most detailed of all the villains thus far barring possibly DIO and it’s much better for it. Unlike Diavolo, Pucci feels like an actual person and unlike Kira — as much as I love the bastard — it’s easy to empathize with him. His backstory draws us in and shows us that he has an understandable reason for doing what he does, though this isn’t to say his reason is necessary good. Pucci and Weather’s backstory is tragic in a way that nothing else we’ve seen before can top — in part because we experience it with them. Their flashback is much longer than, say, each of the flashbacks used to introduce the Golden Wind cast. This draws us into their struggles and makes the flashback feel more like an important part of the story instead of an aside. Pucci’s desire to split apart his siblings to stop their unknowingly incestuous relationship while keeping his vow of secrecy as a priest, only to have his plans unravel horribly once he realizes he’s made a deal with the Devil in the form of the Ku Klux Klan (it’s really crazy how Araki handles the horror and ridiculousness of racism as an aside better than Murao does while having his [entire manga](https://anilist.co/review/13505) center around it), helps us empathize with his plans. His plan to create a “Heaven” where people know their fates, as immoral as it may be, certainly makes sense when you’ve experienced just how much Pucci feels he’s been screwed by fate. And I appreciate Weather more due to how tragic his own life has been. 

I’ve said it before, but JoJo, up to this point, hasn’t been what I’d consider “deep.” The backstory might not be particularly deep either, but it’s certainly arresting in a way that nothing before has quite been and gives Pucci more layers than I thought possible for the series. 



Pucci/Weather’s backstory and the ensuring arc would be enough to elevate the part for me, but like an overexcited infomercial host, Araki says “but wait, there’s more!” While not quite measuring up to DIO’s World in terms of actual combat, the final battle of Stone Ocean made my jaw drop thanks to its spectacle. Made in Heaven’s speed makes it one of the most terrifying Stands we’ve seen. It’s hard to fight because of how hard it is to hit, exemplified by us hardly getting a good look at it once it’s in motion. It’s like a horror movie monster. Beyond that, its collateral damage is ludicrous — it makes DIO wrecking Cairo or Green Day and Oasis’ rampage through Rome look like minor mishaps in comparison. Made in Heaven is the most destructive Stand when it comes to affecting the world around it. We’re treated to scenes of time rapidly accelerating, causing dentures, clothing, and food to rot. We watch people freeze within seconds of entering a walk-in fridge. Glasses fly to the ground and shatter as soon as they’re out of people’s hands. The sun is rendered a streaking comet in a sky that rapidly changes from light to dark and back again. [Mangaka cannot make their deadlines](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking) — except for Rohan Kishibe, of course. All this would be enough to cement the ending for me, but no. In the bloodiest final battle since Stardust Crusaders, our heroes fail. One by one, they’re picked off by the monstrous power of Made in Heaven until Emporio is the only one left standing. He eventually defeats Pucci using Weather Report’s stand in what’s probably the most satisfying beatdown in JoJo so far. After, Emporio finds himself in a new universe, one where analogs of all his allies ([barring Foo Fighters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg)) survive. Despite this, the preceding deaths don’t feel cheap because the people he knew are gone — even if Irene is similar to Jolyne, she doesn’t have quite the same history or personality. Emporio, and Emporio alone, will be witness to what happened in the original universe. To drive this point home, images of the original cast are depicted in the sky as the show draws to a close.



The new universe is the perfect ending to the original run of JoJo, because it marks the end of the “Joestar” line. Or, at least, the need for the Joestars. In this new universe, Jotaro “JoJo” Kujo’s daughter isn’t Jolyne “JoJo” Cujoh, she’s Irene Last-Name-Not-Given. She may have the Joestar birthmark, but she doesn’t need to be “JoJo,” she doesn’t need to devote her life to fighting evil. With the last of DIO’s flunkies erased from existence, the Joestars can lead a bizarre, yet relatively peaceful existence. The anime drives this point home further than the manga did. During the final credits sequence, we see snippets of iconic scenes from previous parts followed by the final scene of Stone Ocean, meaning that the series as we know still happened, just with a happy ending. And speaking of the credits, the use of “Roundabout” is absolutely wonderful and ties everything together, reminding us of how far we’ve come. 

Curiously, while Stone Ocean mirrors Stardust Crusaders as a good part that was elevated to greatness in its final arc, Stone Ocean contrasts Golden Wind due to how different they are in consistency.  Golden Wind was consistently “good,” not “bad” nor “great.” The final arc didn’t elevate the show for me unlike DIO’s World or Bites the Dust before it. All in all, Golden Wind is enjoyable, but ultimately disappointing for me. I expected a lot from Golden Wind, what with the main character being DIO’s son and the main villain having a split personality. I felt that there was the potential to do more with Golden Wind but it just coasted by. Meanwhile, I expected very little from Stone Ocean by the time I approached the end. Yet it broke consistency to deliver something great, something that stretched the series in a way Golden Wind hadn’t. It felt like a proper sequel; introducing exciting new elements while honing in on what made the predecessor great.

But that’s the ending — the vast majority of the show is merely great. Taken as a whole, while enjoyable, Stone Ocean is nothing special in the context of JoJo. Your thoughts on Stone Ocean are ultimately determined by how important you find the destination compared to the journey. Endings make or break shows for me, so this breathtaking, exciting, and beautiful ending that honors all before is enough to make Stone Ocean one of my favorite parts. But if you find the journey more important, you’ll see Stone Ocean for its more middling traits, as they describe the vast majority of the show. Either way, Stone Ocean is a show I’d recommend, but with the caveat that it doesn’t get great to the end. It’s not a big deal but I always hate being the guy to say “wait, I know you didn’t like these twenty episodes but I promise you it gets so much better!” That said, the ending is so amazing that I’d be hard-pressed not to recommend it.

It’s been a bizarre ride, but I think this is where my journey ends. I won’t be waiting for anymore JoJo anime, so I’m glad I ended on a high note. 





Fortunately, Araki has made other manga and I’ve decided to read those. [The first one I’m reading is about horse-racing, I think?](https://anilist.co/review/19777)"
10110,"This is quite possibly the worst thing that I’ve ever watched. I’m serious. I don’t think I’ve ever had a more difficult time watching an anime. You might ask me “Why did you force yourself to watch this if you hate it so much?” The answer is “I don’t know.” Maybe to write this? Maybe so I could complete it again, originally watching it in 2013. Back then, I rated it a 4/10, which was VERY low, considering how low of a standard I had back then. Having an anime that you already watched stuck in ‘Currently Watching’ is annoying as well. Rewatching it, I can see why I gave it such a bad score back then.

Mayo Chiki is a 2011 anime about Sakamachi Kinjiro, nicknamed Jiro, a young man who has developed gynophobia (a ‘fear of women’) as a reaction to his mother, a pro wrestler, and his little sister practicing wrestling moves on him. He doesn’t ‘fear’ women in the way that I can only assume gynophobia normally works, but his body has a violent reaction every time a woman touches him - his nose starts to bleed. The amount his nose bleeds depends on the length and intensity of the touch from a woman. He crosses paths with Konoe Subaru, who is Suzutsuki Kanade’s butler, after opening a restroom stall she was in accidentally and discovering her actual sex. In the anime, Konoe has to pretend to be a man at school, so she can be Suzutsuki’s butler, due to a tradition of a male of the Subaru family serving Kanade’s family. If she’s able to make the entire three years at high school without her gender (sex) being revealed, then she can be Suzutsuki’s butler forever. As much as Konoe hiding her sex is part of the plot, there is very little to do with actual ‘gender politics’ or anything of the sort. I don’t really care about that, but the weird thing is that Konoe has been able to hide her sex for more than a year now, despite her being popular enough around school that she not only has one fan club devoted to her, but TWO of them. One is dedicated to ‘watching’ her with a warmful eye (stalking), and the other are her ultras, who want to physically assault Jiro for getting close to her. Both of these clubs have a good amount of members, but none of them have made the observation that Konoe is actually a girl. In fact, Konoe is oblivious to the fact of these clubs even existing until almost halfway through the anime. I know this is a silly anime, but this is just straight bizarre. After they have a physical confrontation over him finding out her real sex (her wanting to knock him out and give him CTE, him doing the harem protagonist thing of accidentally stripping her), Suzutsuki proposes a deal - Jiro keeps quiet about Konoe’s real sex in exchange for them helping to ‘cure’ Jiro’s gynophobia. There’s no real reason why this deal had to be made in the first place, since Jiro couldn’t give a shit less about Konoe’s sex - the only reason why he accepts is that he’s forced is due to Suzutsuki’s sadistic nature. Other characters include: Kureha Sakamachi, who’s Jiro’s sister that develops a crush on Konoe; Masamune Usami, who’s a member of ‘Shooting Star Subaru-sama’, one of the two clubs dedicated to Subaru; and Narumi Nakuru, who serves no other point than to be a comic relief character.

How is Mayo Chiki one of the worst anime that I’ve ever watched? There’re many examples that I can list off, but I’ll put two down just for simplicity’s sake. In the middle of episode 8, there’s a ‘Battle Royale’ at the summer festival the main characters are at, the winner getting the right to kiss ‘Takanashi Puniru’, who is actually Konoe who is ‘cross-dressing’, who won the ‘Yukata Beauty Pagent’. This sentence out-of-context doesn’t sound bad. A festival episode is bog-standard for an anime, and a main character being the center of a contest isn’t necessarily terrible either. Once you see the build-up to this, you’ll start to understand how awful in execution this anime is. Right before the ‘Battle Royale’ scene, Konoe runs away from the festival for reasons I won’t say due to spoilers. Jiro then walks what seems like two miles uphill to find her, and they have a heartfelt scene, which ends with Jiro passing out after his gynophobia flares up due to a hug. Jiro wakes up an undisclosed time later, in the infirmary of the festival, to his sister telling him that the Battle Royale is about to start. In the time he was KOed, Konoe walked back to the festival, presumingly sweating her ass off carrying Jiro back on a warm summer night, was coerced to join the Yukata Beauty Pageant by Suzutsuki (I assume), won somehow, and is now being shown off at the Battle Royale, which is a free-for-all paintball contest. The confusing part about this is how all of this could’ve happened in what I can only assume in a three to four-hour time span. Going past this - is this scene even necessary? After the heavy scene we just watched, do we REALLY have to have this scene? It’s literally just the main and side characters fighting over the right to kiss Konoe, since the pretense of anyone other than them being in the paintball contest is erased fifteen seconds in. It’s also unsaid how Jiro found a ‘paintball gun’ (the gun is actually a super soaker with paint inside of where water would go), but I’ll let this one slide since I’ll assume he grabbed one in between the time the contest officially started and when he points his super soaker at his sister. The real cherry on top is when Nakuru appears, now ‘drunk’ off of soda. Yes, this bitch gets drunk off of carbonation. Not sugar. Carbonation. And she gains a special power when drunk off of the fizz where she’s able to strip people of their clothes in a flash. This is all happening in the middle of the paintball field, where everyone else is already out of contention by some magical force. Suzutsuki ends up being the person winning. What makes it worse is that Mayo Chiki repeats the whole ‘drunk off of something that won’t get you drunk’, a plot gimmick that’s already used way too much, again. In episode eleven, Konoe, after having a single drop of white wine, undresses and licks Jiro’s neck for an uncomfortable twenty-two seconds. Having the ‘girl gets drunk off of a small amount of alcohol’ gimmick once usually means that your anime is uninspired, but having it TWICE, within four episodes of each other, is a brand-new type of horrible.

The obvious answer to avoiding seeing issues like this would be to do the ever classic saying when recommending anime - to ‘turn your brain off while watching this’ - as you can tell, I definitely did not follow that advice watching Mayo Chiki. The problem is that it’s so blatantly obvious that it’s just phoning it in, throwing out fanservice willy-nilly in order to satisfy the crowd that just wants to see an anime girl’s skin, which I’m guessing is most of the people who’re watching this. It’s the only reason I can reason to myself why the average rating for this show would be 70% on here. To be fair, in the reviewing world, a 7/10 pretty much means ‘average’, but that still means that the average viewer thinks that this is a mediocre anime at worst. Other than being a fanservice goon, the only other reasons why I would assume that anyone would give a good rating to Mayo Chiki is because either Konoe, Suzutsuki, or any of the other girls are ‘their type’. I really don’t get it. Perhaps I’m the weirdo here. Wouldn’t be the first time.

The only good thing I can say about Mayo Chiki is that it’s the first one in and the last one out when it comes to fanservice and ecchi. Even in the middle of what should be a dramatic scene, Jiro can’t help but squeeze one of the girl’s boobs a few times. The only reason you should watch this show is if you’re into fanservice.

I thought that one of the reasons why this anime was so bad was due to the amount of content from the source light novel that it had to cover, but it turns out that it ended at a part in volume five, which would tell me otherwise. This either means that the source light novel is just as bad as the anime, or that feel. (the studio that made the Mayo Chiki anime) were god awful at pacing this show. I felt like Mayo Chiki covered a lot of content since the climax of the show lasted around an episode and a half - which felt half-baked to watch due to how rushed it felt and how anti-climatic the ending was. Compare this to the episode before the climax, where it spends the whole episode showing Kureha enjoying her birthday, and the episode after the climax, which is about Nakuru overcoming her ‘complex’ about her breast size. These two episodes, while probably in the light novel, feel like filler and serve no purpose other than to take time away from the main plotline, which in turn looks barebones and feels pedestrian in execution. Maybe it was just this rushed in the light novel, but I’ll probably never know since it wasn’t ever translated into English. However, the manga was translated and has a slightly higher rating than the anime (at around a 75%). That being said, I’m assuming that those who read the manga came from the anime, which would possibly inflate the rating due to the grand majority of people reading it being those who first enjoyed the anime.

What stops this from being the ‘Worst Anime Ever’? For me, it’s due to Mayo Chiki’s sincereness. At no point does the anime ever try to pretend to be something that it’s not. It’s not ashamed of being a trashy ecchi anime. It embraces it. While I hated watching this show, I can enjoy the fact that there’s no hint of Mayo Chiki saying ‘actually, I’m just pretending to be a terrible anime’ - it does it with a smile. It doesn’t pretend to be smart or a ‘deconstruction of the ecchi anime industry’. This is what saves it from having that title, even though I’m giving it the lowest rating I’ve ever given an anime. It might be the worst anime I’ve ever completed, but it isn’t the anime that I hated the most.

Should you watch Mayo Chiki? If you’re into fan service, then this is your show - there’s no shortage of Jiro slipping and accidentally stripping a girl, shower scenes, girls getting drunk off of one sip of carbonation or white wine, squeezing a girl's breast when you’re trying to find a grip while in the passenger’s seat of a bike, and other examples that I’ve forgotten by now. Otherwise, I can’t recommend you to watch this anime, even in an ironic way. It took me a good month to muster myself through this show, due to the dread that starting up each episode gave me. There’s anime that’re ‘so bad it’s good’, but Mayo Chiki is so appalling that it can’t even be that."
101351,"Happy Sugar Life is a tragedy. I mean this in both literary and quality terms. Despite how interestingly and enticingly crafted this tragic tale is, and how effectively some of its presentation is, this show has one fatal flaw: overemphasis. One wouldn’t think that this is so catastrophic, but Happy Sugar Life proves why “show, don’t tell” is a thing.

There are two forms of this devastating lingering. The first one is the monologuing. This is what damages Satou as a character and drags this anime down and out beyond belief. Her personality is interesting, almost as if you put a mary sue and a yandere in a blender and watched them eat away at each other in the process of having an overprotective pedo lesbian try to keep her image and ideal life intact. It’s hard to care when the majority of her screen time is spent in her headspace, as she monologues about damn near everything. Regardless of what anyone thinks of this tragic hero on a moral level, it’s easy to see how this can feel grating and unnecessary. These scenes of her expositing her thoughts on any given situation can go on for minutes on end when almost every single time, her expressions alone are enough to tell us next to, if not everything she is thinking and feeling. 

Shrinking it all down to a sentence or two maximum to clarify something or truly encapsulate a scene for her, and letting the visuals do the rest would have been far more rewarding. It would have truly taken advantage of the imaginatively disturbing directing and presentation, both making Satou a far more interesting lead to follow, and making several scenes to be far more impactful and dramatic. It would have also kept a myriad of scenes from dragging out to more than double the length they needed to convey everything properly. Keep in mind that this applies to several scenes from several characters later on as well. You could cut down entire episodes worth of monologuing and probably improved the pacing dramatically, both in terms of an episode structure and scene-by-scene basis. The worst part of all is that the show understands this to an extent, with some of the most critical and stylistic scenes in the latter half of the show truly showcasing how powerful this approach can be.

The second devastating, drawn-out form of overemphasis is a more gratuitous, self-indulgent kind. It’s what destroys practically everyone else in this show. It’s no secret that the vast majority of the characters in this show are damaged, mostly reprehensible people. You can show that off while keeping the audience engaged and disturbed in a proper way. This show takes the worst approach possible with this. Whenever a character is established doing something fucked up, we linger on them licking something, drooling, and/or panting after sniffing something for extended periods of time or interacting with their target in some way. At that point, it’s more tiresome than creepy, and more aggravating than repulsive. It’s even worse when the show constantly reminds you of this with small moments and scenes that add nothing and could be cut out entirely. It’s bad enough that the progression of certain characters’ descent into pedophilic or stalker-like madness is utterly nonsensical, but when that becomes their defining trait, and when the show just lingers on about it, it becomes a nightmare to sit through for the worst reasons imaginable. 

To really paint a picture of how bad this can get, a male police officer is sexually assaulted for minutes on end, with several characters watching, and it takes his partner so long to intervene. On top of that, all they do is leave, rather than arrest the perpetrator or do anything for committing a crime of sexual assault on an on-duty police officer. It’s beyond wild how bad the gaps in logic are, and how much this show just wants to linger on the more disturbing elements for its own self-indulgent, narrative and character-damaging purposes. I’m not sure if any of this was the fault of the material, the director/screenwriter, or both.

It’s a pity, really. Outside of all of this, there’s an interesting, enticing tragedy at play, with some truly potent moments, both sweet and sour. The reveals are paced out well and tend to be brutal. The core narrative is theoretically engaging without too many glaring issues in terms of logic or consistency. On the audiovisual side, the visuals by newcomer studio Ezόla can be incredibly imaginative, even if their background and CGI endeavors are sometimes distracting and needless. The disconcerting feel the directing and imagery go for is a sight to behold. The music is generally good at bolstering emotional scenes with their own melancholic and beautiful tunes. The ED theme -""SWEET HURT"" by ReoNa- deserves special mention in that regard. If the show just showed more restraint and used its artistic flair to more consistently tell its story properly, I genuinely believe this would have been one of the better shows I’ve seen all year. Alas, the sweet that interested me was a tad too bitter."
109020,"Yesterday wo Utatte started as something average.
Here, ""average"", doesn't necessarily stand for something negative. It's ""average"" as in ""it's something that could happen to anyone, your average, dramatic daily life""; the show gave you this heavy feeling of empathy for its characters ー while you were fully immersed in the stunning animations, backgrounds and this backpack full of emotions. 
Then... where did it go wrong? When did it start to go from ""I can relate to the characters and the situations they're in"" to ""Things just happen in the most random way possible""? This review will try to cover that, my personal thoughts about one of the most promising drama of the season that transformed into what ""average"" should never mean.

webm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/fb6bc62c1d7de224ff30f173082a02aa.mp4)

Story: 5/10
Let's start with the plot: Boy A has been forever in love with Girl A, then he meets Girl B who's been having a crush on him since she first met him. Coincidentally Girl A and Girl B know each other.
Full of coincidences, but let's leave it at that ー those things happen in real life too, right? 
The first episodes were quite alright; and, by ""first episodes"", I mean until episode five. Then, something happened. Things were going... too fast. Personally I started enjoying Yesterday wo Utatte because it had a really slow pace. Things didn't go too fast, but not too slow either. The conversations were full of meaning and gave the characters great depth of what was their view of life (we will discuss more about them later on); so they didn't feel too cheesy or unreal. 
Sadly I barely started reading the manga but, personally, I think it's impossible to adapt 113 chapters in 12 episodes ー especially when the concept itself revolves around personal growth. Realistically speaking, growing up takes a lot; particularly for those people that kept living a certain way, without every looking back.
Yesterday wo Utatte makes you think that their character developments feel real by making them moving forward (hence, the finale) but totally ignores the real meaning of it.
Why did Haru leave school? It's mentioned many times, but it only got brushed off with ""she started working in Milk Hall"", but never got addressed properly. Shinako apparently never took Haru's part in the decision ー but what actually happened?
Shinako leaving her first crush behind. Now, Shinako. Her struggle felt... real, at first. You loved someone or, maybe, you pretended to love someone to still be able to stuck to what was your past; it's something that happens very frequently. 
What I really liked in the anime is that it showed how much Shinako was still a kid, despite being a full grown up; she was immature, she didn't know what she wanted, it really felt that she couldn't let go of the past. In fact, the very reason she still can't make decisions properly is because she never grew up for it.
I guess in the manga they might have been able to develop her more (considering they had the time for it) but in 12 episodes, it felt unreal. Shinako lets go of the past in a total random manner ー the show itself felt like it gave up on what it first was its expectation, to show in-depth characterization of the characters in it. 
We didn't have a chance to see Shinako actually let go, we didn't see anything. We just saw a random girl that decided to throw everything in a casual way and didn't face anything, because she had to make up with her new crush. 
Yesterday wo Utatte set an incredible high bar of what it wanted to show, only to let down and grab rushed episodes to get the ending they wanted.
The atmosphere felt scattered all over the place, the quality of the show itself started decreasing, the production set the bar high for something they didn't really think through; the ending was awful.
Mind you, if that ending would've been the 24th episodes, it would've been great. Super great. 
Why, you ask? Because there would've been build up for it. We could've seen Rikuo slowly falling in love with Haru and not falling head over heels for Shinako just a literal episode ago. The show has the audacity to brush it off as ""something that looked like love, but it actually wasn't"" to destroy something that would've come to realization only a lot of episodes after. Put it like that it just feels like a joke, an excuse, something that you'd say because of whatever reason. I mean you got to be fucking kidding me at this point.
This anime single-handedly took everything it had on its hands and threw it in the trash, like it was something they just wanted to brush off as soon as possible. This is what this awful ending made me feel like: trash. 
Trash for hoping it could be way better than your average drama, slice-of-life anime.

(Another thing I'd like to add is: the coincidences in this anime are hilarious. Like, it's incredible how anything happens so randomly, they always meet in such strange circumstances, is the town that small?)

Characters: 5/10

Why ""only"" 5? Because it's the score you would give to something average.
Half-assed, something you started building up perfectly then trashed. 
Let's talk about them a little bit more.
First, our MC: Rikuo. 
Who is Rikuo? Rikuo started off as someone who didn't give much thought in anything. As long as he had his ""average"" and easy-going life, he would've been fine with just that. He didn't have that big dream to achieve, nor a long-life passion that could be considered worth mentioning ー but he liked photography. 
An average-looking guy, with an average life, average friends and average backstory. 
How did something so half-assed turn so badly? Because you genuinely can't understand what the fuck Rikuo is doing most of the time. 
His first actions made sense, he was acting like a human being, something I was truly satisfied to look at. He was in love with Shinako, tried to get closer to her (god, I loved his speech about being friends and what-not at the end of episode 2!) and was finally able to do so. In the meanwhile, he never brushed off Haru. He gave her the chance of get close, never rejected her (the only time he did, he didn't even do it intentionally), so she really didn't have any reason to leave. When they finally got her date, I thought something started moving; since it genuinely showed that Rikuo did care deeply for Haru and he was thinking about her costantly, but apparently it was all for nothing.
Why? Because Haru turned Rikuo to ""someone"" into her head (despite always running away when that happened), Rikuo seemed fine with it (considering he wanted to... know her?) but actually never looked for her even once ー unless she was looking for him first or when she was in literal danger. 
Rikuo ""grows up"" (can I even call it that?) in the latest two episodes. He's always been the same for 8 episodes (not counting the first two because he did take that little first step ahead, something I loved to see), but then just stayed the way he was. Never changing, never moving. He understood that him and Shinako were playing lovers (I'm still angry at this, it was so fucking fast as a change that it didn't make any sense) and just gave up. Then he suddenly grew fond of Haru (who didn't bother looking for like... ever?) and was able to tell her she loved her, but not Shinako, despite simping her for over 11 episodes? If I had been Haru, I would have honestly went nuts over the audacity of this idiot.
I repeat: it doesn't feel real. ""But it's anime!"" It should still feel real, especially if it's about a show that's trying to be ""relatable"" and a slice of life.

Now: Shinako.
Oh my... there's a lot to say about her. 
Her character made sense, at first. Only at first, though. 
Being attached to your past is pretty common, especially when something traumatizing happens; but, as I mentioned before, if you show your character being the same for 9+ episodes, I expect to see something. Shinako never changed, Shinako never showed any sign of wanting to change ー the last episode shows it loud and clear, her relationship with Rou shows it loud and clear. 
webm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/ec79b40f299723fcc85e1087a747ce9a.mp4)
In Japan, you usually cut your hair when you're leaving something behind and moving forward.
Now I'm wonder if she just wanted a new look and nothing more. 
You're supposed to actually change your point of view when you're trying to move forward.
Spoiler: she didn't do anything of the sort. Shinako remained the usual ""not able to take decisions so I let everyone around me make them in my place"" + ""I can't let go of anything"", having no emotional growth whatsoever. You're always looking at the same character failing all over again. 

Haru.
Can I even say anything about her? She's literally simping Rikuo, never looking behind and, for some reason, the only mature one in the whole show despite being the youngest. ""The only one that's been fair"" I like to refer her as that. Since she actually gained the courage to declare war to Shinako, I thought that Shinako herself would've been fair too, but that didn't happen, sadly. Oh, just because I like Haru, it doesn't mean she's the one that saved this mess, she didn't survive either. She remained the same. Unlike Rikuo and Shinako, she actually showed signs of growing, when she faced the fact that she couldn't escape anymore from what was her love, from what was reality ー it looked like she was about to become better. It looked like it, for a few episodes. 
Personally I am a bit biased because she is 18 years old, so I can actually excuse her action, for the most of it; so, sadly, I can't give a mean outlook on her... I apologize for that. 

Chika, Rou and Youichi.
This isn't going to be as long, so I will just put them together. Chika and Youichi looked fine, but they felt like a ""filler"" episode. They left no impact whatsoever and it seemed like they were put in just to fill some blanks; pretty sad.
Rou... Rou. Rou... is a kid. Personally? Let's just go next, I don't even have words for Rou.

Animation: 9/10

Stunning, truly stunning. It's what brought me to this anime in the first place. You can say anything about this anime, but the animation team truly put their whole soul into it. It's full of details; little things, like an hand moving, wiggling ー every moment feels so... human, real. I could praise it all day! I'm sorry, I just love when an anime gets really detailed on every single movement, because they're trying their hardest to express how the character feels at that one moment. Love the effort.
Sadly it doesn't save the show.

Sounds: 8/10
Loved the ost! The endings were super great, especially the second and third one. Overall they were pretty chill and always fitting to the moment, I don't have much to complain on that.

Overall score: 5.5/10

I'm disappointed. 
Yesterday wo Utatte started as something that could've become my favorite anime ー something I could never forget.
But it ended up being a roundabout of unchanging people with unchanging feelings that refused to grow up.
With a rushed ending that would've worked only if they actually had anything close to personal growth.

If you start with zero expectations, it might actually be enjoyable ー if you're looking for a good, life-changing drama/SoL just try something else."
162694,"Background:

I think the Harem Genre has gotten a little bit stale and repetitive over the years, and i had ZERO expectations going into the trailer for 100kano 

When i asked my friends if the anime was good, everyone immediately went all hive-minded and said ""IT'S FUCKING PEAK YOU MUST WATCH IT NOW!""

And after finishing it, they were 100% right. 

Animation: img20()

While seemingly very safe in the surface, it does have a lot of soul and charm in all of the scenes.

Clearly Bibury has improved drastically in how they animate things, and that makes this anime REALLY enjoyable, all of the goofs, jokes are enhanced A LOT by the animation, and this is by far the best part in my opinion.

The world that encompasses Rentarou and [his ""Geass Power"" (as i would like to call it, unofficial name tho)](https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/C.C) is full of surprises and twists that make every single joke feel unique along with the places the cast goes to, and the many problems that the main character of this series has to face. 


Characters:img20()

Not the most fleshed out characters in the world, but they aren't personality-less (aside from, 1 technical one) 

Let's start with the Unluckiest, turned Luckiest, Rentarou Aijou.

HE'S QUITE LITERALLY the best part about the characterization in my opinion (at least, in this season), as explained in the Animation section, he has the ""Power of Infinite Lust"" from God himself, he does know his limits (literally in the title, only 100 girlfriends), but he didn't know how much the affected female would become in terms of irresistibility to him. 

He's like the human embodiment of Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" chorus (in a good way, not the trolling way, I'm serious).

He always tries his ultimate best to appease the ever-increasing amount of girls, not letting them down, saying goodbye, and never had thoughts of hurting them using lies.

![He also became the Spy from TF2 LOL!, LMAO EVEN!](https://100kanojo.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter20)!

The first 2 girls that he meets affected by his Domain Expansion of Infinite Lust is Hakari and Karane.

Hakari is just your standard love-interest-type character, that really likes to reveal her body (for some reason), and overall, way more lustful to him than EVERY SINGLE GIRL in the cast, and she does have a very great character arc later in the series (that I will talk about later)

Karane is an actual Tsundere that I genuinely like ([shocking, i know, despite my hatred towards them.](https://anilist.co/character/126372/Nino-Nakano)), and actually one of the more charming one I've seen, because she isn't overly toxic, and does have a great bond with Hakari (they kissed each other, twice btw) 
img1000(



Next is much more shy one, yet full of charm, using her phone to communicate, Shizuka (on second thought why is ""Shizuka"" such an uncommon name in fiction).

Shizuka has the greatest introduction to any of the girls in the cast in my opinion, episode 3 is where we see Shizuka in her full glory, with a very touching backstory as to why she didn't speak, rather used a book (initially), and after having eye contact with Rentarou, as time passes, he gets to know Shizuka better, eventually being Rentarou's lover.

The script shines in this department, as it depicts her feelings to Rentarou similar to a Fantasy Love Story, and that is a nice touch.
img1000(

Followed up the shyness is Nano. 

[If you have played any of the Project Moon games/read the lore for Library of Ruina, she is basically Angela. ](https://library-of-ruina.fandom.com/wiki/Angela)

If you HAVEN'T though, just make sure to know that Nano is quite robotic and nerdy compared to the other girls in the cast, as she initially speaks in quite a harsh manner to Rentarou at first, but after a little bit of dating, her mind changes, and over time, learns about him and his past and even future girls. 

img1000()


Further down there is a literal mad scientist who would fuck around in every turn and find out, Kusuri.

Her main appeal is her ability to create any drug in the world, along with cures for any drug (hope she makes one for cancer though, that would save a lot of lives).

On the subject of drugs (don't do them, kids), the ""Resident Evil""/Kiss Zombie Arc is a very intense one and serves to act as a sign of comedy, and development for her character, as she learns from her mistakes and then develop near flawless ones. 

img1000()

The final one is Hakari's mom, who's funnily enough, named after the Japanese of ""Mother"", Hahari. 

She was initially introduced as the Queen of the Hanazono family (with a somewhat concerning, and really dark backstory of child birth for some reason), who KNEW about what happened to Hakari and wanted to stop her relationship with Rentarou, so the cast has to find a way to somehow counteract Hahari's acts.

Her house was BUILT LIKE FUCKING AREA 51 IN TERMS OF SECURITY, so they have to plan ahead at every turn, it could be making fake noises to disrupt the police, bypassing the lasers, and many other means.

With the help of Rentarou's tears removing the laser detecting eyes, she IMMEDIATELY falls in love with him, and it got turned into something that is both very funny and turned into a darker one (especially for Hakari's side).

(The entire dynamic between Hakari and Rentarou is enhanced even more by this, and it really shows how much Hakari meant for Rentarou).

And thus wanting Rentarou to take care of Hakari along WITH her.



Story: img15()

there is a surprising amount of depth here, considering the fact it follows some of the main curses of an SOL (mostly storyless).

Aside from Hakari's arc, all of the characters have each of their seperate ways to grow and change as Rentarou falls in love with them.

the pacing is really fast, and that helps the comedy, and the slow moments are also well thought out and didn't disrupt the pacing due to the amazing soundtrack. 

the atmosphere is really alive too. Anything right or wrong could happen at any moment.

One minor nitpick: In my humble opinion, the opening is really grating and annoying to listen to.

I understand the show's premise is Infinite Lust, but you don't need to keep saying ""really love"" in every part of the chorus.

The references in this show are cool and are a nice throwback for me, especially the Tom Cruise one.

Overall thoughts
 
A must-watch, this is easily the best first-impressions-type harem for anyone to start with, and even if you watched harems in the past, you will still find a metric ton of enjoyment when watching this."
141249,"After watching the first three seasons and movie recently, along with this fourth season, I can tell why the Bungou Stray Dogs franchise is so big in Japan, albeit a bit less popular overseas due to it being more of a seinen series. The cast is quite unique, there is a solid balance between humour and serious moments, and the presentation is very well done. Without a doubt, Season 4 of Bungou Stray Dogs has been the best installment in the series thus far, as it was definitely the most thrilling and consistent of all the seasons.

Since Season 2, each season kicked off with a flashback that focused on certain characters of the show, and the flashbacks usually ended up being the best part of the season itself. However, this time around, I was thoroughly impressed by the fact that the events flashback sequence related to the events in the present quite a lot, and built upon them effectively, which was what was lacking in Season 3. I felt the present arcs were even better executed than the flashback, which was great.

The fundamental reason why this season worked better than the previous three in my opinion is that the stakes felt higher than they’ve ever been, and I genuinely felt worried for some of the characters, fearing they would meet their demise. Each episode was filled with twists and turns, which made it all the more thrilling, and the episodes just flew by every week. The sense of mystery felt stronger than it ever has been. You thought you knew what was coming, and then another twist happens. What’s more, the twists for the most part, didn’t feel forced at all, and were executed very nicely.

The cast of characters felt even more fleshed out this season, with Ranpo and Yosano really taking centre stage for a few of the episodes, and I’m glad they focused on characters other than Dazai and Atsushi, and gave more balanced development to each character of the Detective Agency. Some mature themes were present in their backstories, and I grew to appreciate their characters much more with the events that transpired in the past and future surrounding them. It felt like much needed information on their character was delivered, and it was delivered well.

The animation and designs continued to be consistent throughout, meaning that the production was probably healthy, and the staff finished the episodes ahead of schedule. Good job by Studio Bones here as usual. The soundtrack was good as always, capturing the mysterious and darker tones of the series. OP and ED were great as well.

Here's an example of some great direction from this season:
webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/9291f97c7e2a14980d935623b03bd98a.mp4)

I have virtually nothing but praise for this season of Bungou Stray Dogs, and aside from a few powers that felt a bit over the top, it wasn’t much of a problem for me personally. Overall, just a very solid, thrilling season that was a pleasure to watch every week, and the best season of the series to date. With Season 5 coming in summer of this year, you bet I’m excited for what’s to come."

There are fascinating ideas at play and a strong core storyline, but blink for a second and the whole piece falls on its face. It took me an unusually long time to firmly ground my takes on Deca-Dence (DD.) Even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, I was constantly flip-flapping between my thoughts on the series and whether or not it was meeting its objectives. Was this a muddled mess of a plot? Or the best-written show of Summer? After (much) deliberation I’d now answer with: “a little bit of both.” As promising as this premise is, there are key details that one could easily miss, ruining the entire experience. And even when interpreted as intended, DD fails to see through its fullest potential. I hope you’ll join me as I attempt to inspect the puzzling case that is DD: the strengths, the weak spots, the twist in Episode 2, and more. On that note, there’s no way I can hold a meaningful talk about DD without spoiling that major left-turn, so I advise you to have at least caught up with the first three eps before reading further.



 img100%() 



That’s coming from a guy who mostly watches his Japanese cartoons seasonally, so make of that what you will. The last time Mob Psycho director Yuzuru Tachikawa got involved with an original work, the small OVA got picked up by none other than Madhouse for a 12-ep series nowadays known as “Death Parade.” Learning that one of the brightest industry talents was attaching himself to another original script^ sent my expectations through the roof. I openly shared my hype in discussions and gave this series my backing. This had the potential of becoming the dark horse of Summer and I was thrilled.

DD’s pilot did little to keep me hopeful. The episode had your standard post-apocalyptic setting, a dystopian class system, a by-the-books arc about our MC proving herself, and a CGI battle with a horde of indistinguishable alien blobs. I was just about ready to lower my expectations significantly when they brought out a giant mecha transformation sequence while Konomi Suzuki belts the (admittedly banger) OP. None of this was bad by any stretch, but we’ve seen it all before. For a Tachikawa production there seemed to be a copious lack of ambition and intrigue. Something to really knock my socks off.

 img100%() 


The reveal that the Deca-Dence fortress was in fact an entertainment facility controlled by a space corporation won me over. Shifts in context challenged me to question everything taking place in the surface world and what that meant to the chibi cyborgs participating in the simulation. The newfound setting opened up room for worldbuilding, which the show does rather well at times. It occasionally drip-fed information about how the grand illusion was held together by staging scenes in control rooms, factories that manufacture the Gadoll aliens for the company, and the storage facility for our robots’ in-game avatars. A dichotomy presented between the remaining humans and their descendent cyborgs was fertile ground for social commentary to go along with some sick action scenes. Ideas behind the ranged aerial combat feel distinct and something out of a video game, and cool concepts pop up wherever you look.

Now you might think that I had a good time with DD. But I didn’t. For most of its run, anyway. See, my dumb ass didn’t quite pay attention to the second episode, as I was still reeling from its amazing twist. This was probably the worst possible mistake I could have made while watching the show, because for several weeks it was the only episode that defines who Rankers and Tankers are. To make matters worse my brain went on overdrive from that episode on, and my frustration grew as time went by. When a supposedly important character death occurred mid-season I had no idea what to feel, since I failed to catch the context behind that moment. Was that character a human or a cyborg? There are different implications for each interpretation, so which should I take? What the hell is a “bug” anyway? I kept running into those same issues with each plot point, running into brick walls as I regressed and reassessed the story. I never realized the answers to those questions until late in the season, and even then it took a series re-watch for me to comprehend what was happening. I’m all for sheepishly admitting that I ruined the experience for myself, and in retrospect I enjoyed a lot of the narrative presented. However, that isn’t the only reason I’m sharing this anecdote.

  img100%()  


In an interview conducted midway through DD’s airing (one I highly recommend you check out+,) Tachikawa admits that him and his team made the setting “somewhat complicated.” There’s certainly credence to his statement, but I don’t think that fully describes what’s happening here. A pattern crops up where select scenes pack exposition in dense chunks, separated with slower story segments. This stop-start pace runs about as well as a truck low on oxyone and robs DD of its momentum. Normally I wouldn’t find this approach problematic, but certain episodes don’t give me a lot of faith that the writers are using its single-cour length wisely. A notable example came hot off the heels of a big cliffhanger, where we follow characters in a factory processing… feces. These lulls in the narrative are all that harder to get through when those moments of plot progression leave holes unfilled. Earlier I mentioned my misunderstandings with the show’s terminology, but even the parts that I could make out yielded unanswered questions of their own. A bulk of those gaps lay with the relatively-unexplored secondary characters. Human survivors in Deca-Dence don’t come across as, well, humans (adding to the confusion with Rankers & Tankers.) These background roles aren’t given a ton of complexity, which is a huge shame. The aforementioned potential for social commentary and ideological reflection got relegated along with characters like Fei, Mikey and Kurenai. The apparent caste divide between “upper-class” Rankers and the “lower-class” Tankers goes unmentioned, which I found really strange. The episodes I enjoyed most were ones that were better able to tap into that potential, namely Episode 7 and its long-overdue return to the community Natsume was fighting to protect. Most of the writing behind its cast contrasts and betrays the intricacies presented by the premise, making me question if the series could be improved on given a higher episode count.

In the interview I brought up earlier, Tachikawa claims that while the setting was complicated, the plot was “more straightforward.” It’s an observation I agree with 100%. To better describe what we’re referring to, let’s briefly compare DD with the other script by this director. Death Parade was a story revolving around arbiters charged with deciding the fate of the dead. Episodes were mostly self-contained but came in a variety of tones and themes. Some nifty worldbuilding was done in the background, while not being necessarily integral to the plot. Instead, the show dedicated its focus to challenging the viewer’s understanding of morality and ethics. Death Parade chose to present a fully-fledged question and left the viewer to derive their own answers. On the other hand, DD’s conclusion was all but set-in-stone the moment it revealed its twist. You know what they never say: 

>""Nothing like a good ol’ battle against a ‘Big Brother’ AI to convey your anti- (space) corporation sentiments.”

Joke aside, this predictability was a series mainstay even amidst some incredible surprises, as opposed to the ambiguity of Death Parade. One show held all the cards, the other laid them all out on the table as early as Episode 6. This resulted in the story feeling needlessly demanding at times, setting up a hard-to-follow plot but paying it off with a less-ambitious message. With such a fascinating backdrop which arguably surpasses that of Tachikawa’s previous script, one can only wonder if this mostly-predictable journey and its half-explored ideas could have spent more time developing in the Pipeline. Now, none of this is to disparage what the show does well; “straightforward” doesn’t mean “bad.” So enough of me bemoaning what the show could have been, and let’s get into what makes DD work.

 img100%() 


Amidst my countless conflicted thoughts on the series, one constant remained clear: Natsume carries the show on her back. She may not clock in the most screentime but is always a joy to watch. A lot of these narratives about protecting important, “helpless” characters struggle to make an emotional connection with the viewer. Natsume could have easily fallen into that trap by being written as annoying, overly-childish or a cheap plot device for instigating conflict that feels illogical and unnatural. Thankfully, DD never runs into this issue; Natsume is charming and entertaining to watch. In a reversal of the Damsel-in-Distress, she is fully capable of fending for herself in dangerous situations. Giving her character resilience and strength in spite of her physical handicap made her an empowering figure. She shares plenty of chemistry with “Kumicho!” Kaburagi. While the stoic protagonist may not feel as endearing, he’s still a welcome presence on-screen. Instrumental to DD’s success is their bond when they’re together and their development whenever they’re apart. Utilizing their vastly different backgrounds and perspectives to good use, the series is able to convince us that this formidable duo have what it takes to conquer the system.


Hordes of Gadoll getting mowed down every week made for an entertaining spectacle. Sound and visuals are serviceable, no problems there. I appreciated the design contrast between the Space Colony and Earth. The chibi robot designs may have put some people off, and it admittedly takes some time getting used to. Use of CGI was inevitable but far from nauseating. Overall this presentation was a good effort from relative newbies Studio Nut, and I wouldn’t mind checking out their future projects.

My experience with Deca-Dence was one of misunderstandings. DD fell short of the lofty expectations I had for an original script penned by Director Yuzuru Tachikawa. Failure to keep up with the show’s fascinating setting and missed thematic opportunities hampered my time with the show further. Nevertheless the series still stands out amongst its peers with its strong central character dynamic and distinct action scenes. The world presented, while incomplete in some aspects, is a complex dystopia that occasionally makes for thought-provoking TV. There is a good story and kernels of good ideas hidden in this massive show, making it one of the more interesting highlights in this year’s anime lineup. Just pay attention, don’t make the same mistakes I did. 6/10

I also found another good one worth checking out: https://mipon.org/interview-yuzuru-tachikawa-deca-dence/
Really insightful, this director knows his stuff. Shoutout to @AnimeSavant for sharing the interview!

-- ^While he’s listed as series director, Tachikawa stated in an interview that he had worked on the foundations of the script. Credits for series composition go to Hiroshi Seko, who for the most part has a good resume and partnership with Tachikawa. Although this begs the question of who has greater influence between the director and the writer, one which I’m ill-equipped to tackle. In this instance it seems that a healthy balance was struck between the two, and that’s a relief to hear.

-- I’m having trouble wondering how bug elimination and chip retrieval makes sense. You can infer that this system control is meant to quell potential uprisings before they occur, but what are the bounds that make up an “Error Code?” Is it like a Minority Report situation where the A.I. detects the behaviour and stops it at the source? We never see this in the show; in both instances where Kaburagi takes a chip, the people they belonged to just dropped dead. Furthermore, how plausible is this concept anyway? If someone prominent in the small community like Kurenai dropped dead from these unnatural causes, surely people would pick up on that trend? It’s kinda unsettling how the populace never bring up such obvious topics, they really fell two-dimensional in that sense.

-- Kept thinking about Toy Story 2’s airport scene when watching Kaburagi find his avatar in Ep 8.

-- Random brain fart but how does currency work? All we know about the world of the cyborgs is their lives in relation to the Deca-Dence game. What happens outside of that? Perhaps they pay with oxyone? But the game is an arcade feature, and I assume most of the populace earn their money running errands. So the Rankers are sponsored and get living accommodations? In short, their economy promotes being an epic gamer and clocking in e-sports money. Now THAT is what I call forward thinking. Amazon, take notes.

-- If the game has a 90% satisfaction rate (whatever that means,) I assume there are more games? That could be interesting. I imagine there are some dudes chilling on the moon playing the future’s equivalent of Animal Crossing while all this madness is taking place.

-- Strange how the all-controlling system seems liberal when it comes to using drugs

  img100%() 

-- “Decadence” is defined as “self-indulgence.” This alludes to the leisurely activities of the cyborgs, as opposed to the poverty and near-death subsistence that humans undergo. Again, those parallels would hit so much harder if you actually USED them (keep calm Dweeb, you actually like this show…)

-- IN A NUTSHELL: Telltale’s The Walking Dead: Season One meets WALL-E.

-- BEST GIRL: Natsume. Her facial expressions in most episodes are peak meme-material, so that's a huge plus.

Apologies if I went off weirder tangents than what I normally tackle. I had a totally different review in mind until I gave the show a rewatch, so this piece morphed into a weird exercise in coming to terms with my personal experience. In any case I hope I at least provided adequate coverage for the show.

21220,"Definition of start:
noun

A beginning of movement, activity, or development.
This marks the start of [Boruto](https://anilist.co/anime/21220/Boruto-Naruto-the-Movie/), the best era of the [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/Naruto/) franchise.



Following the disaster of the ""Fourth Great Shinobi War"" arc, the Naruto franchise was at a low point even for Naruto standards. Thankfully, they redeemed themselves by moving away from Naruto and onto Boruto. This is the beginning of the ascent for the Naruto Boruto franchise.

The movie quickly introduces us to the concept of scientific ninja tools and their capabilities. This was a nice touch because the level of technology in the Naruto franchise has always been erratic. [Boruto](https://anilist.co/character/121439/Boruto-Uzumaki) wants to earn his dads praise, but [Naruto](https://anilist.co/character/17/Naruto-Uzumaki) is too busy working as the mayor Hokage. Boruto sees the upcoming Chunin Exams as an opportunity to gain his fathers attention. During the Chunin Exams, Boruto continuously contemplates using scientific ninja tools to aid him and eventually caves in to using them. All Boruto wants is to succeed so his father will acknowledge him, but instead Naruto punishes Boruto for using scientific ninja tools. Shortly after the Ootsutsuki invade Konoha and Naruto gets captured in order to save the village. The Kage plus [Sasuke](https://anilist.co/character/13/Sasuke-Uchiha) and Boruto rush to rescue Naruto and eventually do. Naruto and Sasuke have [Momoshiki](https://anilist.co/character/127027/Momoshiki-Ootsutsuki) nearly defeated, but [Katasuke](https://anilist.co/character/130419/Tono-Katsuke) unknowingly uses scientific ninja tools to revitalize him. This leads Boruto to delivering the final blow on Momoshiki and cementing himself as a Ootsutsuki leveled character in the Naruto-verse. Naruto finally decides to be a dad and acknowledges his son for his achievements. !I guess you have to save the world from an extra-terrestrial deity in order for your parents to acknowledge you.! All is well in Konoha and although the movie has reached its end, Boruto was only just beginning.




This movie introduces us to the next generation of the Naruto franchise. The new Team 7, Boruto, [Sarada](https://anilist.co/character/121440/Sarada-Uchiha), and [Mitsuki](https://anilist.co/character/121444/Mitsuki), and the new Ino-Shika-Cho, [Inojin](https://anilist.co/character/121441/Inojin-Yamanaka), [Shikadai](https://anilist.co/character/121442/Shikadai-Nara), and [Chouchou](https://anilist.co/character/121443/Chouchou-Akimichi), are the standouts of the next generation.

Boruto's character development throughout this movie is among the best of the best. He starts the movie as a child that only wants his fathers approval and becomes a true shinobi who understands what it takes to protect those that he cares about by the end. Most people only pass off Boruto as a spoiled kid, but do not actually look at how he has grown and become something much more.

The other new generation characters have much less screen time due to the constraints of the movie's runtime, but are still very interesting. All of them have a combination of their parents' arsenals which already makes them better than their parents were at this age. Although their skill sets are similar to their parents, their personalities are unique and make them very interesting characters. 

The next current generation of Boruto has a lot of potential to be explored and are looking to be the better version of the side cast from Naruto.

>""The new generation always surpasses the previous one"" 
 [Kakashi Hatake](https://anilist.co/character/85/Kakashi-Hatake)




The animation for this movie was handled by [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/Studio-Pierrot) just like previous entries into the Naruto franchise. Studio Pierrot really brings their A-game in this movie. The art and animation looks among the best of the best. There are even points in this movie where it is almost at the level of something like [Demon Slayer](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/), but not quite surpassing. On top of just the quality, the fight choreography in this movie is second to none. The fights in this movie are the best the Naruto franchise has seen up until this point. This very well may be Studio Pierrot's best work to this date.




The OST of this movie captures the feel that the Naruto OST delivered before and even gave a few new additions. The OST was never the problem for the Naruto franchise, but was actually one of its strong suits. One of the new additions, ""[Spin and Burst](https://open.spotify.com/track/1N39dPzIxDWzscoYwz8GWp?si=a4ad4fec2e2d4c2a),"" is probably one of if not the best tracks in the entirety of the Naruto franchise. With that said, the OST for this movie is top tier and does no part in dragging this movie down.




The opening for this movie was done by none other than [KANA-BOON](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3PWp9R5HvbQgxI5KBx5kVd?si=x6f1sxGQziOPKL1wJbRLQ). They have previously worked on ""[Silhouette](https://open.spotify.com/track/1di1C0QI6Y92yZPYn6XYAZ?si=1f17ee7023f9494f),"" the 16th opening of [Naruto: Shippuden](https://anilist.co/anime/1735/Naruto-Shippuden/). KANA-BOON has blown ""Silhouette"" out of the water with this new opening theme, ""[DIVER](https://open.spotify.com/track/7C1Lzlt1bOjNAxKboc9b98?si=b36e38337dcb4d03)."" Among movie opening themes, ""DIVER"" is among the best of the best.




This movie saved the Naruto franchise and now has elevated it to even greater heights. When it's all said and done we will look back at this movie that started it all and remember greatness. The reputation of the Naruto franchise has been saved and the start of the Boruto franchise is here.



To all the Peak Slayer and Boruto enjoyers, I love you :)

232,"Adorned with a glorious outfit, lovingly crafted by her best friend, the Cardcaptor takes her stance in wake of the challenge that lies before her. Illuminated by the pearlescent glow of the moon, the card spins frantically, before eventually grinding to a halt. Silent. Still. Untouched. Suddenly, bursting outwards in a sea of flames, consuming the once night sky and claiming it as its own, the card reveals its true form and surrounds the young girl in a prison of flames. Unaffected at the fiery blaze before her, the Cardcaptor stands her ground, readying her staff to tame the beast which threatens her. It’s time to add another card to the roster… 

Magical girls! I’m pretty sure it goes without saying, but the magical girl genre is a staple of the medium, and certainly has been ever since its inception in the 1960s, with Sally the Witch being widely considered to be the first magical girl anime (albeit the manga for Akko-chan’s secret predates Sally by a good five years!) Over the next thirty or so years, the magical girl genre would slowly mould and take shape into what we see today in many of the more children-oriented magical shows, with the Sailor Moon franchise often being considered as the show to establish the standard formula that many later shows of its genre would follow during the 90s, before seeing an influx of magical girl deconstructions in the early 2000s, with Princess Tutu being the most notorious example of such. When looking at the magical girl shows of today and excluding entries of the ever running Precure series and other similar anime marketed towards children, many try to adopt and replicate the success and popularity of Meduka Meguca (also known as Madoka Magica, the former name of which is a far superior title; screw you, fight me!) a show that placed their cute and adorable young girls and threw nothing but death and misery in their faces! Even if you’re not particularly that well-versed in the genre, as am I, you’re probably familiar with the general conventions and the iconography surrounding said genre, as it’s been parodied time and time again in many shows, and whenever an anime series creates a fictional anime within its world and gets all meta, many-a-time do they opt for a magical girl show, such as in the case of Puru Puru Pururin from Welcome to the NHK or Stardust Witch Meruru from Oreimo. However, for such an influential genre, what would be a good gateway show in getting more seriously invested in the various magical girl shows out there?

I believe that answer lies in Cardcaptor Sakura, which would not only make for a good starting point into the Mahou Shoujo genre but is also in of itself a delightful show; one that I have fallen in love with so much so that it has broken into my top ten favourite anime! Through its wonderfully charming cast of characters and shining creativity, Sakura is a series I wholeheartedly love and after allowing the series to sit with me for a while before starting up this review, I can honestly say that Sakura is perhaps one of the best experiences I’ve had with not only an anime, but with any piece of media! But, with that all said and done, let’s dive into the numerous reasons why I adore this show!

Sakura Kinomoto, our protagonist for this tale, is an average happy-go-lucky, fourth grader, who, when coming upon a mysterious book in her home, accidently breaks the seal of said book, causing the contents, that being 52 cards referred to as Clow Cards, to inexplicably scatter all over Japan. But the cards are not the only thing to be released mind you! Awakening from his slumber, Keroberos, an adorable little lion with wings who just so happens to be the guardian of the cards, informs Sakura that she must collect all 52 cards, or a catastrophe will occur as each card contains powerful magic. Realising what she has done, Sakura takes it upon herself to gather the cards, becoming Cardcaptor Sakura, and, along with her best friend, Tomoyo, a girl more concerned with filming Sakura in cute outfits and capturing every one of her moments on film than anything else in life, begin their journey of finding each and every card!

Cardcaptor Sakura’s narrative is one that is not all too complicated, and things progress in ways you can probably expect, with the first half of the series seeing Sakura collecting each and every card, while the second half of the series sees her transforming each one into Sakura Cards, thus claiming them as her own, while intermixing a heavier focus on romance. What sells Sakura’s narrative is in its simplicity and charisma, all the while emitting a wonderful childlike innocence about itself. Sakura is the type of show I can well imagine me enjoying as a child, and, like Little Witch Academia last year, is also a show that is able to evoke these feelings of childlike nostalgia and wonder in me. It’s a raw, personal kind of feeling I get, and is one that I find hard to properly articulate into words. There’s something wonderfully uplifting about Sakura’s narrative, that with each episode that passed I couldn’t help but inadvertently smile. It’s that complete sense of optimism and incorruptibility about the show that made Sakura such an enjoyable and relaxing time for me, presenting a world filled wonder and excitement in the same way a child growing up looks at the world, which, for as someone who has become cynical of things in my early years of adulthood, helped me remember those feelings I once had about life, especially as Sakura is filled with boat loads of heart. Perhaps I’m being overly dramatic and melancholic here, but that’s how I honestly feel, and Sakura makes me feel this way in ways I can’t quite describe or understand, which is why I feel such admiration about the show.

Anyway, enough with that sentimental crap (for I am the manliest man you’ll ever meet and I don’t need no cute and innocent show to make me feel better about my life, hmpth!), Cardcaptor Sakura, for the most part, is largely episodic, following a basic formula of introducing a card, Sakura encountering said card, figuring out a way to capture it, and then using the newly captured card in a later episode to catch another one. However, saying that, I don’t mean to insinuate that just because Sakura follows an episodic, “Card-of-the-week” formula, that is it by any means repetitive nor is this a negative. To go on a brief tangent, I’ve never agreed with the sentiment that just because a show employs an episodic narrative structure that it is inherently bad, or of any less value than that of a show that has a continuous on-going story between episodes. While, yes, an episodic narrative structure can mean that the anime can easily get trapped into a formula and become stale, I don’t believe that all shows that utilise this form of story-telling fall into the same trap or should be thought of as having less value because they chose to opt for that kind of narrative. Let’s take Cowboy Bebop for example. While beloved within the anime community still, and often revered as a cult classic, one piece of criticism I see quite often hurled its way from those who are not as fond of the show as others is that Bebop’s episodic narrative structure holds it back and prevents the show from developing its story or cast, and to that I completely disagree. All of the episodes in Bebop centre around establishing and building the world presented to us, adding layers of complexity and characterisation to the cast, and a lot of episodes spend large amounts of time developing each character, going through their mental hang-ups and exploring their past, with enough energy and charisma per episode to keep things interesting. Cardcaptor Sakura works in the same way.

Like Bebop, Sakura uses each episode to slowly build up its cast of characters. We’re always learning something new about them, and the characters themselves are learning more and more about each other as the show goes on in turn, allowing each member of the cast to form relationships between one another in impactful and well-constructed ways. Every episode builds upon the last, adding new layers of characterisation each time, and the sheer amount of creativity each card brings allows for that much freedom for the writers to experiment and play around with, resulting in a lot of variety and originality each and every episode. It really feels like the people behind this show were having an absolute blast with the production, and it truly does show as each episode is oozing with so much love and personality. This is what makes Sakura such an addicting and memorable watch. One episode Sakura will shrink down to the size of a peanut in pursuit of a card as she manoeuvres around her home running from all of the inherent dangers of being that small; another she’ll grow as big as a building and fight off with an immense dragon reminiscent of a giant monster movie! It’s this constant stream of creativity, intermixed with great character interactions and chemistry that really brought the series to life for me, and it only grows in personality as the series moves along.

And that’s not to say that Sakura is void of any emotionally affective drama either. Cardcaptor Sakura can be surprisingly emotive at times and it handles its melodrama with care and maturity, and even sometimes in rather beautiful and profound ways. Take, for example, episode 16, “Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories”. In this episode, Sakura and her family spend a small vacation in a cottage located in the countryside of Japan, whereupon, after adventuring out, is invited to tea by an old man in the area, whom she frequents everyday with for the reminder of her stay. The two naturally grow closer, and Sakura finds out that this old man has lost his grand-daughter, after he offers Sakura her clothing to wear. After a teary goodbye, Sakura uses her magic to create a rainbow for the man as a thank you to him and to recreate the painting the man’s grandchild had made for him whilst she was still alive. The episode ends informing us that indeed this old man was in fact Sakura’s great-grandfather, ending the episode with some wonderful cathartic pay-off and making the first seemingly unimportant episode in the grand scheme of the narrative have more emotional weight and meaning. And that’s just one of the many examples of this!

Sakura is even faced with several moralistic dilemmas regarding the capturing of the cards. The most prolific example of such is in her pursuit of The Dash; an extremely fast card that transforms itself into a small rabbit-like creature. Dash ends up befriending a girl from Sakura’s class, and the two bond together, with Dash helping said girl exceed in her track running, which brightens up her life. Sakura is left with a dilemma however: should she capture Dash as she has been quested to do, but risk the girl losing the race at the national competition as well as losing her newly gained friend? Or should she just leave Dash as is allowing her to win the race, but not from a result of her own abilities but that of the card? This is just one of many examples in the show, and many of the cards are intrinsically linked with several characters in the show who relate their own problems and mental hang-ups, giving each episode a greater sense of emotional pay-off. And it’s not like Sakura is just a series of episodic events either. There are several overarching stories happening simultaneously that slowly build-up in the background that result in their own pay-offs, as is evident in the climax to the first half of the series, which actually had a great plot-twist that I am sure will be a nice surprise (just don’t watch the third opening like I did before then otherwise you’ll ruin it like what happened to me because I am dumb! Learn from papa LIQ’s mistakes!)

However, as expected of a show with seventy episodes, not every one is as strong as each other, and there are some episodes here and there that I didn’t quite care for, as was the case with episode 55, Sakura in Wonderland; a parody of Alice in Wonderland where Sakura gets dragged into the book. While I did get a few smiles here and there seeing the cast portrayed as the characters from the original novel, I mainly zoned out for much of the duration as I’ve seen this kind of thing done a million times before in countless other shows. However, the episodes in which I found to be lacking were definitely the minority and for a show to have perhaps three or four episodes, that, I didn’t feel were bad, just “meh” is quite an achievement.

Dependent on your levels of tolerance, you may find yourself somewhat irritated at Sakura’s level of denseness in regards to the premonitions she has nearing the climax of the first half and how long it takes her to put two and two together regarding the identity of the person from her dream, even when it is pretty obvious from the get-go. However, I can generally excuse it on accounts that she is still a child, and because of her good girl personality. Finally, one may have an issue regarding the level of suspension of disbelief you have to endure during your watch, as Sakura flies throughout the city with nobody seeing her at all which would be pretty difficult, and in the episode in which she grows to the size of a building to fight a dragon, not a single person sees her at all, despite the noise and damage to the area. While these are indeed critism somebody could make against the show, I would ultimately argue that they are pretty pedantic and do not take anything away from the show even when you factor them in.

If I were pinned down to the floor by a group of thugs in the middle of the night in a dark alleyway and under extremely specific circumstances was told to describe Cardcaptor Sakura in a single word otherwise risk getting shot in the face, I would say “charming”.

Charming. I believe that best sums up Sakura in a single word and is certainly the best way for me to describe the characters presented within it. When I am consuming any piece of fiction, the most important element to me are indeed the characters, as they hold the key, if you will, into whether I am invested in the piece that I am watching. Characters are what I personally value most in any given circumstance, and while I am a guy who likes a good o’ story to go along with my characters, I can generally be more forgiving of a show if the characters have wonderful chemistry. And indeed, the characters of Cardcaptor Sakura have wonderful chemistry. This is what I believe Sakura excels at the most, and that is crafting emotionally rich and charismatic characters the audience can grow easily attached to, and some of my favourite moments in the show, and truly the most delightful, are when the characters are just goofing around together. My jaw has physically hurt after some episodes due to the sheer number of times the characters and their interactions have made me smile, especially Keroberos, nicknamed Kero-chan.

My love for this tiny guy truly knows no bounds and is easily not only my favourite character in the entire show, but also one of my favourites in the medium. He’s massive ego, insane love of food and strange accent all perfectly worked together to create a character whom made me grin every single time he was on screen, but Kero isn’t just a mascot character however. Aside from dishing out exposition about the cards and the such, there’s genuine level of love for Sakura, his new master, and their relationship actually builds and develops as the series goes on, culminating in a beautiful friendship. The relationship that builds between both characters is one that is completely believable and feels sincere; as if the two had known each other their entire lives. Kero isn’t simply a selfish asshole who sees Sakura as an inconvenience but someone who openly cares for her as a person and her well-being. The two even get into arguments as well, such as in the case of episode 15, “Sakura and Kero’s big fight” where the two argue about petty things for the entire episode but learn to look past them and to appreciate each other for who they truly are, adding emotional weight as well as a real sense of maturity to their relationship.

While Sakura herself is your typical cheery and optimistic girl you would probably expect from a series such as this, she does go through a substantial amount of development, both in terms of her actual magical power and in her coming of age and growing to realise whom she truly loves in the latter half of the series, eventually concluding that aspect of her character arc in the second movie. However, that’s not to say that Sakura is solely just a cheery innocent girl with no other characteristics or emotions. Sakura frequently has moments of depression and self-doubt whereupon she reflects on herself as both a person and as a magical girl, adding more complexity and introspection into her character, all the while receiving mass amounts of characterisation, moulding her into more of an honest human being rather than an expressionless plank of wood, with her interactions between her and her brother being the best example of such. Sakura is a strong protagonist for this kind of show, so much so that every time she succeeded in whatever task that came her way, did I feel a sincere sense of accomplishment as well, resulting in my once cynical and cold heart being warmed once again. What sells Sakura is in her simplicity and how this simplicity is delivered with boats loads of heart. 

Perhaps the thing I was most impressed by with Sakura’s cast is how subtlety characters grew together. Perhaps this is a pedantic thing to praise Sakura for, but the sheer amount of anime I’ve watched that simply have characters deliver internal monologues about the status of their relationships with other characters, or what they’re feeling about said relationships is astounding, and Sakura does away with such a feature, making the relations that do grow and develop feel all the more grounded in a sense of believability. Much like how I became to grow fonder of the characters as the series developed, the cast themselves warmed up to each other as well. Take Sharon for example, a kid from Hong Kong who locates to Japan in search of the Clow Cards, becoming a rival to Sakura in the process. While starting out cold and distant, adamant about working together with Sakura and generally putting up a barrier between himself and the people around him through his apprehensive attitude, Shaoran eventually begins to warm up to the rest of the cast. He starts to admire Sakura and her abilities, and grows to fully understand her as a person, and opens up the rest of his classmates in the process, to the point that he begins to care for Sakura as a person and her well-being, all the while doing so in a subtle way. With each passing episode, Shaoran’s demeanour slowly changes, and characteristics established in the earlier parts of the series begin to fade away and be replaced, all the while never having to resort to exposition or internal monologues to convey his change in attitude regarding Sakura and everyone else, treating the viewer with respect. The same thing can also be said of Sharon’s cousin, Meiling, who, like Sharon, begins her relationship with Sakura and the rest of the cast rather apprehensively, before eventually seeing Meiling grow to care for Sakura, resulting in a heartfelt letter in which Meiling writes, “to my dear friend”, a clear juxtaposition from the start of the series.

While there are many other characters in the show, speaking about each one individually would be rather redundant, and would take away from their magic (pun intended) in the show. However, there are some personality quirks and reoccurring gags that you may find to be somewhat lacking. While it is somewhat entertaining, and especially cute when Sakura and Shaoran keep falling for them, Yamazaki’s lies and the gag surrounding that can become somewhat tiering and unfunny for me the more it goes along, and the same thing can be said regarding Tomoyo’s obsessive recording of Sakura (albeit, nowhere near as bad as the former piece of comedy I just mentioned). I can easily see Meiling’s character being rather annoying and hard to put up with for some people, especially with how clingy and whiney she can be at times around Shaoran, even if I didn’t personally find her that grating personally. While I did have maybe one or two slight problems here and there with elements of some character quirks, that’s all they are when you break it down: slight; and don’t really do much to take away from the overall experience and are small things that can be overlooked.

Cardcaptor’s animation as well has aged pretty well for being twenty-years-old, and there are genuinely some great animation cuts here, with one of my favourites being a moment in which Meling is punching a bunch of penguin statues (I swear, it looks a lot better than how I am describing it here!). The animation and art are damn amiable at times too, with a lot of cartoony pull and stretch as well as a multitude of various reaction shots, adding to the charm of already charming characters and locals, although the art can get somewhat “CLAMP-Y” at times, with Toya and Yukito in some shots appearing as massive NBA players with the thickness of a pencil! Every time Sakura used the cards, it was an absolute treat for the eyes with swooping special effect work and animation, combined with rather attractive and unique designs for the physical forms of each card, with Firey and Watey perhaps being my favourite out of the bunch. Likewise, the soundtrack is handled with just as much care and love as every other element, with every piece being more or less burned into my mind, with the music used to accompany Sakura using a card being my favourite of the series. It’s magical, yet exciting arrangements always managed to make me fervent whenever she would bust out a card. Similarly, the openings and the endings are also a treat, with each one being incredibly memorable and wonderful pieces of music in their own right, with the first ending, one featuring Kero running endlessly across a hill, being one I could watch on repeat forever.

Moreover, Cardcaptor Sakura also has two movies, both of which I believe are worth checking out. The first of which, taking place at roughly episode 35 of the TV series, sees Sakura win a trip to Hong Kong before running into both Meiling and Shaoron. The film is essentially like watching an extended version of a regular TV episode and contains just the same amount of charm and likeability about itself, so much so that I was smiling the entire time whilst watching it. While this film can be skipped as it doesn’t add anything to the overall canon, I’d ultimately recommend it, not because it’s a good time in of itself, but just because we get to see Shaoran’s family, and can fully understand why he is so adamant about collecting all of the cards and impressing his strict mother. 

The second film however is definitely the one you should prioritise and watch as it is a direct continuation of the TV series, picking up exactly were the last one left off. To put it bluntly, I adore this film! It’s a perfect summarisation of everything I loved about the show, compacted into ninety minutes, and my jaw actually hurt by the time I had finished watching the film as I was doing nothing but smiling during the entire runtime. It wraps up nicely a certain releationship and character arc that I don’t want to specify as I wish to avoid spoilers as much as possible for those who have not watched the show yet, ending the concurrent story on an incredibly satisfying note! 

There exists some other supplementary Sakura material out there, that can be ignored if you so wish, but if you decide to watch them, shouldn’t really take up no more than twenty minutes of your time. There’s a short directed by the same dude who directed Monster, called “Leave it to Kero-chan” which is a fun little ten minute special, as well as a mini three part series in which Tomoyo films various things in Sakura’s life, which I’d recommend checking out the first episode of which at least as it goes all meta as Tomoyo films Sakura recreating the first opening, and even ends with her voice actress, Sakura Tange, performing “Catch You Catch Me”.

To finally conclude, as if it was not already evident enough, I adore Cardcaptor Sakura. It’s a show that appeals to me on a very raw personal level and is the perfect balance of everything I look for and admire in a show, exceling in the area that matters the most to me: the characters. Sakura is not only a shining example of what the magical girl genre is capable of, but also a shining example of what anime at large is capable of as well. Sakura is just another example of why I stick around in this medium because, every so often, a gem comes along like this one, and profoundly connects with me. Before I die from sucking this show’s dick for over 4,300 words, I think I best resign here! Thanks for taking the time to read what is effectively a fanboy harping on about how much he loves a show about an innocent magical girl that warms his once cold heart!

Bravo👏👏👏 This anime to me is the definition of the phrase “go above and beyond their expectations” because god damn for a show that I was initially really dragging my heels to start because of how cliche the first episode started, by the end of this series I actually found myself being impressed with how neatly this story was able to tie up all of its loose strings by the end, and was actually able to tell a complete story within just 12 episode (which nowadays is actually kind of rare).

Everything about this series just really impressed me more and more the longer it went on, from how much development each of the main cast gets throughout the series, to the deep and actually complex story this show portrays, to the moments where characters actions actually have long-lasting consequences, just everything about this show just really impressed me by the end. Sure you could say they cheated a bit by making the first and last episode almost an hour each, but at the end of the day this story was able to be told within just 12 episodes (a single anime season) without it feeling at all rushed or needlessly drawn out throughout the entire season, so for that alone this show receives a lot of praise from me. 

In fact, now that I think about it this might be the best single-season anime from this entire year so far, because everything else that was good this year was either a continuation of an existing property or took at least two anime seasons to tell its story, The only thing that even comes close in my mind is “Dumbbell Nan-Kilo Moteru?” but even that show really didn’t carry the same level of weight to story like this series, maybe that will change during the fall season, but right now to me this is honestly the best 12/13 episode series from this entire year.

Now without really getting into spoilers because I want as many people as possible to read this post to hopefully convince them to watch this amazing series, while I did in the past joke about how this series might as well be called “Plot Twist: The Animation” because of how many GIANT revelations happen during this series, overall if you were to watch this series altogether after it aired I don’t think you would actually notice how many times new information comes to light, because of how well the story just unfolds at the most opportune time. 

I know I already said this but the balancing act alone of needing to balance between unfolding the story at the right place to make it feel not to fast or to slow, while also giving each of your characters enough time to develop, while also needing to make sure the story still feels interesting enough to keep your viewer captivated, is a really hard task for many series to tackle (let alone in just 12 episodes) so the fact that this series was able to accomplish all of that, is why I am going to give this series a 90/100, because other than the real cliche opening at the beginning of the series (and the small cliche moments that are sprinkled throughout) I cannot think of any other reason to deduct points from this series. 

Everything from the story, the characters, the animation, the music, and the way it all just comes together, in the end, is why I feel this series deserves a 90/100, if you have any other flaws you can point out in the comments to give me a reason to lower the score go for it, but for now, this is where this anime is going to stay in my library😅 If you have or haven’t watched their series yet I hope you enjoyed it just as much as me😊

125038,"Every Season there are various anime that instantly become popular, but then there are also anime like ""Shadow's House"" which are unfortunately not so popular, despite being AMAZING gems!



Before starting this review, I would like to point out that my review might contain minor spoilers of the first episode of shadow's house.

In my option Shadow's House is a major masterpiece, it finds the perfect balance between mystery, horror and light hearted scenes. Each scene for me was memorable, and from the start of the anime, there were always hints of a much darker plot being slowly approached with every passing episode. I am happy to say it did not disappoint, furthermore, with the absolutely stunning visuals, amazing animation and some of my favorite music scores this Season, there wasn't a single moment where I felt bored watching this anime, especially as the story progressed.

Below I will delve into the main categories of this show, without spoiling anything major;

The Story revolves over a large number of unique characters, with each character having their own Shadow Master to serve, some characters are similar to the Shadows, some are quite different. I will not get into detail, but this made an absolutely amazing narrative. Furthermore, I have never ever seen an anime that is remotely similar to this anime, and as such I must praise the author of this story for coming up with something very unique and very interesting!

As previously mentioned, the art was absolutely outstanding! When I look at art, I mainly look into 2 categories, the Aesthetics (i.e. how the characters, and world look like.) as well as animation. And this show delivers both perfectly! All scenes are made in high detail, and every single time I would happen to pause the anime for some reason or another I couldn't help but be shocked by the pure level of background detail. Furthermore, all animations that I have noticed within the anime are all very smoothly animated, and there was never any scene that felt out of place.

youtube(https://youtu.be/wrVUrvYIDKg)

There are a good number of really well made OSTs in the show, I have left a link to the anime's outro above, just so you can get an idea of how great the music is. (Along with the artwork.)

The Story took a lot of time introducing each character properly, topping this off with amazing narrative, the anime was able to change how I felt about characters (From hating to loving, and vice versa) with pure ease. Furthermore, each character feels unique and special. To a point where I genuinely have fun seeing the characters interacting with each other.

I overall enjoyed watching this anime, and I would gladly re-watch a second, perhaps a third time. The only thing going on through my mind after watching this, is ""When are we getting another season?""

The author of this anime's story made a magnificent job writing a completely unique, yet wonderful story. Furthermore, the Studio responsible for this masterpiece did a wonderful job visualizing the author's creation.

5341,"well First thing If you are a person that enjoy reading books specially romance novels you going to love this anime. spice and wolf is a book more than an anime. story is the characters , their relationship , their every small reaction to every event and etc. If you are a person who loves books, really enjoy reading novels, love cute girls ( :D ) Spice and wolf going to please you well.

story is Exactly as is should be, one soothing romance story that slowly hunt your soul.Story of a wolf goddess named Holo The wise wolf and simple merchant named craft lawrence traveling together through a fantasy world which looks like old Europe in 13th century where churches have lot of power and control most cities. though it looks like one ""SIMPLE"" story but it isn't actually. there are lot of point in story when you feel extremely excited. but after all we can summary the story of anime in two words "" Holo and lawrence"" The ""Spice and Wolf"".

The main character of anime ""Holo"" is the far the best character of all animes, games and etc. she has the best personality, best habits , best detail and everything else she needs to be THE BEST. There is no way that you watch this anime entirely and don't fall in love with holo. other than that the chemistry and romance between holo and lawrence is the best one in all animes. they are indeed the best anime couple. they have a unique relationship. I can spend all day to tell you how lovely holo is or how good are they two together but you will find out your self soon enough after first episodes.

anime music is unbelievably match and good for it. it can change your emotions with ease during the important parts of story on top of that holo's and lawrence voice acters did a wonderful job. I can't imagine a better and sweeter voice for Holo.

long Story Short , Spice and Wolf is a one of a kind anime, no anime before and no anime after it was even close to it and unfortunately I don't think there would be one in the future neither. it will make your soul travel to an unkonwn magical world where you find your self in a place just like heaven. I would like to call it an illustrated book instead of an anime. if you are kind of person who enjoys old novels and beautiful love stories you will find nothing better than SAW to suits your needs."
131520,"Contains a few major spoilers, but most people have read the manga, and anything important was already spoiled 3 years ago.

My review for this show was supposed to be in the manga section, but since the movie was released, I think it should be better here.


Since the creation of the harem theme in a romantic comedy, the shipping war was born. Many animes led to a good ending, but for the worst part, you don't know why the heck that happened. The recent harem romance film was Saekano Fine which I watched from a Japanese theatre. It was great actually since I knew the reason why the MC ended up with her.

And now this...

It's like I'm living in a deja-vu, another great manga/anime with a polarized or controversial ending. It's like eating a meal, but for some reason, you ended up tasting bitterness after that last bite. I remember that time when I read the manga a few months back and honestly, I hope this film would surpass that manga. But all hopes seemed lost. Don't get me wrong, the first season was good, the second season was great, but the film/conclusion was meh or so-called, disappointing. Before you read this review, let me give you a warning that I didn't simp anything in particular, and had a neutral side.

All I can is, WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK!


So the film started after the events of the second season. Well, I'll not state the contents of the film but damn... I don't know how the heck they condensed the remaining chapters of the manga into a 2-hour long movie. Many important scenes were cut from the manga, and the pacing of the movie was like a solid recap of 3 episodes from a certain anime. I know that in the second season, they cut also many scenes but this film adaptation was different. It was a rapid-fire recap format. From a romcom harem story, you would've expected all of the girls to be happy in the end, but in reality, that was a total disaster. The beginning of the story was great. The hints, the dynamics and developments of the characters, and the chemistry between the girls and Futarou, but suddenly, Negi buried the work of the final remaining chapters. He didn't conclude it is a good way and of course, the hate was reasonable because it felt rushed, pointless, and incomplete. All characters were developed well and had a great build-up for that ending. But suddenly, this girl stole the center stage of the story. She kept and chained herself to her memories and ""sacrificed"" herself for the greater good of her sisters. And she made herself to be the supporting role in the series. She eclipsed the whole story without any proper explanation and ended up being that girl who had a happy ending. That's the problem, Negi didn't put any solid stand on why that girl had to be that girl, who didn't have any development. And Futarou, who didn't show any emotion throughout the series, kneeled in front of that girl and said, ""Will you marry me?"". Well, that sucked. I didn't have any problems with why that girl won, but Negi should add some closure to their relationship. The ending was like, ""you didn't see that coming, didn't you?!"" when in reality, it was unexplainable. It seemed Negi was forced to end his story and just wrapped up all the loose ends, but it doesn't feel satisfying. This show/movie unfortunately has never managed to do that, a lot of harem series actually manage to break free from their shackles and start developing the relationship between the main character and the true heroine more at some point in the story. It keeps teasing into all directions until the very end and then throws in a spontaneous conclusion of who the true heroine is. The relationship development is basically just skimmed over and then we are also skipping straight to marriage.

At the very end of the series when Fuutarou is describing why each of the sisters is significant to him and relevant, he jokingly just brushes over the bride at the end and says “Welp, just be yourself and that’s that” and proceeded. Jokes are half-meant and it pretty hurts for other girls to hear that. It feels like he chose the winner based on who fans would predict the least and then didn’t have an agenda to go from there. I would have been happy with her winning if it was actually developed more, but it just feels more like a mercy win than what would’ve resulted.

I didn't expect to have an anime original ending for this film but at least, they should execute it well.

I like the characters, especially the other quints who had great development and resolve that led to nothing. But while the others like Itsuki, who didn't get any development until it got shoved right at the end, where it felt nonsense. That biological dad of theirs, who had no impact on the story, became a plot tool. Welp, it ended with melodrama soap opera garbage. It was nowhere to be seen in the first place.

The other bruh moment was the appearance of Futarou's grade school friend, where incredibly fast to the point that they felt completely disconnected from the overall arching plot. She came, and it was like 2 minutes where nothing happened, she left and never to be seen again. She also stated that she the girl who Futarou met from Kyoto. How the heck did she know that she's referring to Yotsuba, while she didn't meet her in the first place? This is some bullshit writing. What the hell.

The art was nice. It's the same in the second season and they maintained the quality at some point.
The sound was great. It's a little bit better than the second season but I like the music from the second season. They captured the moments from the manga. The credits scene was a big thumbs up, and the music they used there was a memorable one.

Overall, I still enjoyed the series, but I had major problems with the film. It could be better if they produce a third season instead of a movie. There's a saying that it's not about the destination, but it's the journey. If you agree with that, you could say the whole story is great. Sadly, it didn't maintain that consistent and promising quality. The production quality maintained well, but the last stretch felt like Negi wanted to troll us. The romance at the end was cheesy and troupes were handled pretty well. I guess if this story is relatively well done, it is still a harem story at the end. I enjoyed Negi's ride. It's like riding into a van but the tire got flat and accidentally crashed into a crowd. It's not that bad, but the ending was a disappointment. As a matter of fact, it could be one of the potential best harem romcom animes, that it could overtake my favs. As a rom-com fan, my disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.

For some reason, I want my money back.

116673,"I have been waiting for this to drop since it was announced, i have watched most of the bleach episodes from the anime and i read the entire manga not so long ago actually. So i have a pretty fair understanding of this mans narrative and artistic style and im pretty familiar with what kind of treatment his work has received in the past. This adaptation for Burn the Witch is stylish, colorful, fluid, fun, well animated and with a soundtrack that does a great job at conveying that Kubo style and in adding depth to what we are being shown. Its supposedly a movie but as it is divided in three parts im kinda confused as to what i should call it, so if im to reffer to it once again ill just call it a series. 

In an era where there seems to be a serious case of repetition in animes artistic styles, im glad to say that this series feels pretty unique and fresh. Not just for the setting (which is pretty exceptional on its own right as it is a magical interpretation of London but not entirely fantastical, its still is the london that we know in real life) and captivating character designs that Kubo is known for, but also for the style of animation. The lines on these characters are so damn clean looking, and each movement is so clear, natural and agile that its just a visual delight. Theres also plenty of scenes that i can recall with striking color palettes, which is always a plus and something that i personally appreciate.

From a soundtrack perspective, i loved how well it accompanied all of the episodes and it really helped to build the excitement in the most intense scenes. 

This is a pretty exciting and fast paced series, there is some quiet time and time to breathe in between scenes. But just as a scene can start to feel even a bit boring or still BOOM, something happens and the characters jump to the action. Which is something that i deeply appreciate being that its only 3 episodes, it would be awful to see that they wasted the little time they had to tell a story in boring dialogues, but they didnt! quite the opposite! And that allows for an entertaining anime that will keep you going until the very end...

...An end that isnt exactly satisfactory or with much of a sense of closure, but its there and it works. Its not that its bad, its just that more could have been done. As i have stated before, this is the Kubo style. And everyone who has experienced Bleach from beginning to end knows how he ended that manga in a pretty unfulfilling way, so this is just him showing that he has yet to become better at giving closure to his stories. But, you should take this criticism with a pinch of salt. As this is an adaptation of a one shot and im not exactly sure about how fair it is to say this about a one shot. Now, the criticism that i can make is that while i enjoyed both female protagonists, liked their chemistry and saw a bit of development in their relationship... i feel like more could have been done when it comes to character development, cuz there were some nice things that were setted up in episode 2 but didnt really pay off in any interesting way for the ending. Which is kind of a shame, since there was even a character with a kind of imposter syndrom case which i found super interesting and that could end up leading to something interesting but in the end it amounted to nothing. Again, this also happened in bleach and it makes me worried that Kubo might still be the same kind of writer that he was when he worked on that series. 

There is supposedly going to be a sequel of burn the witch after the release of this series, i seriously hope we see an evolved Kubo with an improved writing style that shows us more of what he did back in the Souls Society arc and less of what he did in, for example, the Fullbringer arc."

“I don’t think anyone is born knowing the reason why they’re here it’s just something you have to find as you go along”- Honda Tohru (Fruits Basket)

At first glance, Fruits Basket may appear to be an anime catered specifically to girls, but when looked closely, it is obvious that it can be enjoyed by a much wider audience. Since Fruits Basket is a reverse-harem series with elements of fantasy thrown in, it is only natural to bracket it in the realm of Shoujo anime. However, that is not the case because Fruits Basket adds depth and originality to the generic world of reverse-harems.

Story 9/10
The Story is about an orphan girl named Tohru Honda whose life changes after encountering two members of the Sohma family: Shigure and Yuki. Ooh and guess what else? Similar to other fantasy shows, there is a curse upon the Sohma family, which turns them into their designated horoscope animals when hugged by the opposite sex. Fruits Basket is a loveable anime that essentially centralizes around Tohru Honda as she gets deeply involved with the Sohma family.
One of the good parts of the story is the fact, that they introduced a character in each episode, many times for comedic value while also efficiently advancing the story. The fact that the story had like no plot at points really made this worth watching and when it did have plot or story telling was spot on.
The subtle Romance that is seen here and there can be hard to notice if you have not seen an romance anime before if you have then it will be easy to notice, The romance parts of the show are not “lovey dovey” like in most romance anime it’s just enough there to make you go, “awwwwwww that’s cute”.
There is a love triangle between Yuki, Kyo, and Tohru, and then there are side characters who just loves “Prince Yuki” as he is so lovingly named.
The one flaw I had for the story was that at times the emotions were lacking in terms of the situation. For example, instances where there should have been seriousness, there wasn’t, and vice-versa. Some things were just simplified or brushed over.
Pros: Unlike most anime of the Shoujo genre tend to do with the over dramatic scenes (that can often make you hate the characters because you often cannot relate to them in these situations) these were very few and far between.

Art/Animation 10/10
The animation compliments the story beautifully. It complements the mood of the Anime very well. It is pretty light-hearted water color art (I think). Personally, I love anime done with water colors but it’s not for everyone and I realize it can be a turn off to some folks. Yet, when it needed to be dark, the dark art style/animation was done beautifuly and captured the mood accordingly.

Something to point out is that the people doing the background added a lot detail which was wonderful to see. The characters moved in the background scenes furthering the story even more, such as continued fight scene’s occurring as if you were really there.

Sound/Music 9/10
The accompanying music/dialog of the show is great. The soundtracks played in this anime fit with ongoing situation while also enhancing the viewer’s the mood accordingly. There is no soundtrack in this anime that is misplaced or out-of-place and the opening is very fitting for it tells the story abstractly for what is happening throughout the entirety of the shows. As the show wraps up it does tend to feels a little out-of-place towards the end of the show but at a very minimal level.

The voice cast they have for doing the show is marvelous. Everyone played their roles successfully and they were enjoyable to listen to. Two of the primary characters, Yuki and Kyo were a perfect fit for the characters they played, whereas Yuki’s brother was over the top in such a successful way that only anime can do. It was obvious that the voice cast team was carefully considered.

Characters 9/10
Characters are always one of three things likeable or unlikable or worse--indifferent. Personally, Fruits Basket had mostly all likable characters to some extent. Each character has a different personality and if feels like they gave each character individuality.

One character that was thoroughly enjoyable and even a role-model to some point is, Tohru Honda. The Shoujo genre is filled with the “simpleton” archetype. However, Tohru (although not the brightest) is an incredibly kind-hearted soul who holds this show up. She is the epitome of a kindred soul who actively helps out everyone that enters her life and impacts them in a positive way. Even though her life has been filled with hardships after she became an orphan, she always has a smile on her face. That is rarely seen in Characters who have not had a good life.

Kyo Sohma is the typical Guy who gets teased and picked on a lot by the other cast members. Kyo is the a person who has a hard time expressing emotions and is more kept to himself. He also has an outrageous rivalry with the other primary male character, Yuki. Eventually he opens up as the story progresses and he becomes more of a normal Human (although that is not quite right). He becomes the fan favorite as the show progresses and later on we learn that his life was not all rainbows and butterfly It is darker than we thought.

Yuki Sohma is a stereo typical dude in many ways. He is smart and hot and everyone wants to be his girlfriend, and he is the kind of person the males inspire to be. Unlike many shows he is extremely protective of Tohru throughout the whole show (surprisingly so is Kyo). To the credit of the show all the characters are flawed by their curse but with the help of Tohru they find all begin to find their way.

Shigure is the typical pervert comedy relief character done right almost to a “T”. The one flaw I had with his character is that his perverseness is played at some really strange times in the show, but he can be very serious and very manipulative.

The anime does a good job in creating a realistic and appealing characters, they are not two dimensional.

This show introduces characters like Kyo, Momji, and Hatori early on, and they too are very good characters that Tohru of course helps. Most of the characters are blessed with good development. Few shows have the ability to juggle this many characters this effectively. There are even character that have episodes entitled to them that help to flush that character out and give you a greater look into the Sohma family. I have to admit that some of the characters, after they were introduced, soon had me in tears. I felt sorry for them. The writers made one care about each character and in a different way.
Admittedly, some characters like Yuki Sohma’s character development were very subtle and discreet. The changes crept up on you, much like real life. Most of his changes were psychological. Out of the main cast he is the one that is done subtle and not at all normal for the Shoujo genre.

As for the extra “kawaii stuff”, you will have to decide for yourself.
The Yuki Fan-Club Girls, love ‘em or hate ‘em, this is something that only you can decide. Personally I liked them at the end for they also helped with character development. They made you stop and actually look at all the changes that had occurred in Yuki.

Enjoyment 9/10
Over all, the enjoyment level for me was a 9/10. I had an amazing time watching this show during both its good and bad times. I gave this show a “9” because of its witty comedy, awesome characters, and a story that was overall intertwined. It is must see show. The whole time I watched it, I was entranced, with that being said, I hope all of you will take the take time and watch this surprisingly brilliant anime and enjoy it as much as"
3457,"Before seeing this anime I had high expectations as it was a well known anime and it seemed quite serious, but when I saw it the only question I asked myself was why do people like this?
It's super slow and boring that it doesn't even look like it has a plot. The truth is that none of the episodes were exciting and a couple of times I got lost in my thoughts because of how boring it was.
I'm not going to criticize its animation because that doesn't matter in my ratings, but I have to admit that I didn't like it at all, I know it's an old series but it's a vampire series!!! More character moves or fights would have been great and that would keep me from falling asleep.
The music is great and I feel like it's a lot for this anime, it doesn't fit. If I had to watch the opening and ending without watching the series, I would think it is a gothic, gore and serious anime but this is more like a romantic comedy that plays sexy vampires.
The love triangle doesn't work either. Yuki could leave at any time with Kaname (who is also a super flat character) as Zero always treats her aloof. I understand the situation and that it is something of the character and for a couple of chapters it is fine, but in each chapter during a season behaving like that is overwhelming and boring, and the plot does not advance.
Yuki as a character was fine, she was different from the rest of the protagonists in this type of anime, but then she begins to behave like one more and her character falls low.
What bothers me the most is that what they counted in 13 chapters could have been counted in 6. I saw myself repeating on the screen all the time: is something going to happen?, This is boring, how much longer? ...
In the end, the plot is based on Zero, but we couldn't even feel empathy for him because he was always distant, and that's a big problem, if we don't care about the ""main"" character (because sometimes Zero seems to be the protagonist), How are we supposed to be interested in the series?

Personally, I think this anime draws attention for its sensuality more than for its history, vampires are treated as sexy beings and consequently there are sensual scenes, in addition to that vampires are an interesting topic for the public and that is why it became popular. Unfortunately it doesn't work, I see a lot of potential wasted in powers, in vampire fights, bloodier scenes, in character development ...

If you want to see this show, I recommend it if you are a fan of vampires and love triangles. If not, I do not recommend it, better watch the Twilight movies, they are more interesting.

112667,"This show with a Light Novel title is an Action Romance about a Soldier from a country called ""The Empire"" and a girl from ""The Sovereignty"" having many encounters with each other that made them slowly falling in love, despite the 2 countries been at war with each other for 100 years. Romeo and Juliet basically

The story is simple, a young man named Iska is one of the best soldiers from ""The Empire"" and is sent to missions after missions to somehow win this war. He has a goal, however, that is to make peace with the enemy country and ending the 100 years of conflict. Meanwhile, in ""The Soveirngty"" a girl named Aliceliese who is a princess of her country, also wants peace with the enemy. With this common ground, the 2 characters understand each other more and started getting along.


The story is simple, yet the world supporting it is very lacking in any lore or information. All we know about the world of this series is that there are 2 nations fighting. 1 nation is more technologically advanced while the other relies on magic. That's it. Where are they? What are the people like? What other difference do they have? Nothing. Heck, we don't even know their fucking names. The whole magic and technology thing doesn't even matter when you look at their cities. The architectures are the same. The culture seems the same. The people seem the same. It takes out the immersion and the feeling of being a real world.

 I'm not saying every Fantasy anime needs this much information. But when it's about 2 giant countries fighting over each other, then give us something to easily differentiate the 2 at a glance and to make it feel like 2 real countries that are believable. The only difference we can spot is in combat. And not when we spend half of the season out of combat

And the way it presents its world just feels cheezy. New information is added when it's convenient. It doesn't feel natural. There are no previous indicators what so ever


Most of the characters are poorly written. They barely have any screen time to developt and doesn't have any motive to fight in this war, other than they just so happen to be involved in it

They only have 1 trait about them, and then that's stuck to them for the entire series. An example of this is Iska's crew. It consists of a loli with big breast, a red-haired girl who is just there, and a guy that's trying to be the older brother type quiet type. That's the only trait they have. They feel 1 dimensional and they don't feel like real people.

 And not to mention the boring dialogues they have with each other. The interaction between them just feels like they're new colleagues, mere acquaintances, despite the show telling the viewers that they're close. It doesn't feel satisfying nor entertaining. 

I said most because personally, I enjoyed the fuck out of the 2 main love interests. Idk why, but when they're talking to each other they feel like an awkward couple being a tsundere and slowly understanding each other and more open towards each other. The slow progression is relaxing and feels just right for this kind of thing.

This is the only thing I like about the show. Everything else is eh

It's an action series but I honestly can't say a lot about it. It's fine. Magic vs Technology sounds cool on paper, but 80% of the technological side of things use swords. The animation, choreography... I can't say much about it, to be honest. It's fine

But yeah that's it, goodnight. I don't know what else to put as a closer"
20968,"When I first heard that A-1 Pictures would be releasing an original film project in 2015 my interest was piqued. When I heard that this project was going to be an original story from the creators and crew of one of my all-time favorite shows, the 2012 teen drama [Anohana](https://anilist.co/anime/9989/AnoHiMitaHananoNamaewoBokutachiwaMadaShiranai), I was overjoyed. Now almost 2 years down the line from its original release in Japan, I have finally had a chance to watch the film and I can now give my verdict.

Did Anthem of the Heart manage to meet/surpass the standards set by its predecessor? 
No
Is Anthem of the Heart a good film?
Kind of
Was Anthem of the Heart inferior in terms of story or characters then? 
No not really

The Good

Before I get into where I think this film failed I first want to make it clear that I would definitely recommend watching Anthem of the Heart, especially for those in their teens or if you're partial to coming of age stories. The film presents a well told, heartfelt story about overcoming trauma and anxieties alongside the usual themes of romance, misunderstandings and heartache found in these films. It's headed up by a diverse and likable main cast , which while fitting firmly within the tropes of both its own genre and anime in general, do more than enough to elevate themselves beyond cookie cutter stereotypes to characters we can recognise and empathise with. The relationships these characters share with one another feel organic and natural, avoiding the contrivances of many of their contemporaries, with a special mention going to the relationship between the semi-mute lead Jun and her mother. Beyond the story elements, the sound track is a good fit, while it won’t have you coming back again and again it does a solid job of complementing the story it’s trying to tell. In a similar the vein the quality of animation is as you would expect from a feature piece, with brief moments of visual flair working in the films favour, if never being all that breath taking.

img1000()

So what exactly is it that’s holding this film back from greatness?
 Well In my opinion it’s the very fact that it’s a film to begin with.

Let me explain, when looking at the two driving creative forces behind this project you have director [Tatsuyuki Nagai](https://anilist.co/staff/103539/TatsuyukiNagai) and prolific writer [Mari Okada](https://anilist.co/staff/100978/MariOkada), both have been involved in a number a successful projects over recent years and had previously teamed up to not only to work together on creating Anohana, but also when adapting another much-loved work, [Toradora](https://anilist.co/anime/4224/Toradora), the dream team it would seem then. But on closer examination of both their credits, you quickly notice that neither has any experience with stand alone feature films. While it is true both had worked together on the 2013 theatrical release of Anohana and Okada wrote the screenplay for [Hanasaku Iroha: HOME SWEET HOME](https://anilist.co/anime/14175/HanasakuIrohaHOMESWEETHOME) the previous was in essence a compilation film of the existing story and animation while the latter was the continuation of a story and cast the viewer was already expected to be invested in, neither of these films existed within the same vacuum that Anthem of the Heart does.

img1000()

So why does this matter? 

The issue here being  is that ultimately the end product is a film that feels like it should have been a short 12-episode TV show or a maybe a series of OVA’s, the kind of material these two usually put out. Without going into spoiler territory, many areas feel under developed. The entire character of [DaikiTasaki](https://anilist.co/character/88945/DaikiTasaki), the school’s baseball ace, felt rushed and as a result, his relationships with the rest of the main cast under-explored. This is not to say he didn’t have a good proportion of screen time or even that he was poorly written, in fact the contrary is true, the character is a well realised and nuanced individual but the audience, as with many other elements of the film, are not given quite enough time to create a truly meaningful connection. This seems to be as a result of Okada trying to cram all the different elements and emotions she wants to express into the one story, something that's more possible over the course of a longer running format,  instead of focusing on a select few. This desire to put so much in ultimately, in Daiki’s case, makes the conclusion of his arc feel like it comes from left field and left me strangely unsatisfied despite it being the outcome I was hoping to see. This underwhelming sensation is prominent several times towards the end of the film as key emotional threads get swamped and/or lost entirely by so many vying for the viewers’ attention. 

It wasn’t just a case of too much to take in too little time that has me questioning if Anthem of the Heart might have made a better episodic series. When watching the works of directors such as [Makoto Shinkai](https://anilist.co/staff/96117/MakotoShinkai) or [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/SatoshiKon), or anyone who’s work is almost exclusively comprised of theatrical works, the films different acts and arcs flow fairly seamlessly into one another creating a narrative that sucks the viewer in and along for the ride. Yet however simple this might seem, when watching Anthem, there were several times I could almost hear the end credits of the episode beginning to play in my head, this was most noticeable after the fairly info-dump/exposition heavy opening twenty minutes or so after which the film finally decides it wants to get the plot moving, it goes without saying that this disjointed feeling serves to take the viewer out of the experience and as such lessens the emotional impact of the film.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, as stated earlier, Anthem of the Heart is defiantly worth the watch but is far from perfect. The film has a number of other flaws as well as positives, the number of the later far out weighing the prior, that I won’t go into here to avoid this becoming a 3000 word essay. Ultimately I came away from the film not disappointed, it was highly enjoyable and I look forward to picking up the DVD/Blu-ray for a re-watch, but with a feeling of slight dissatisfaction, wondering that if the story had only been approached differently could it have been so much more. 
However it did manage to at least impart one great piece of wisdom on me. !img1000()!"
7088,"img770()
There's so much I want to say about this anime... I don't even know where to start.

You know, in my personal blog back in the day, I had a post, from 2010, when this anime was just airing. In it, I said the following:

""I think, that this is a new masterpiece for my collection. I can't see anything wrong with this anime. OP is fantastic, I'm listening to it for the 3rd day straight. Seiyu are perfect, beyond praise. Girl who voiced Korone is absolutely priceless.
Art is, once again, great. The authors definitely had their own style.
Music is not particularly original, but is always fitting.
The story is simple, but never boring. And the characters - oh my god - they are the absolute best! And, imagine this, are not over the top crazy. Especially the protagonist. He's not a mumbler, not a pushover, not a loud showoff or a superhero, he's just a normal, decent guy. It's so refreshing, that it alone is enough to call this a masterpiece!""

And so, now that I have re-watched this anime, I want to take this ""review"" apart to see what changed in almost 10 years, now that I have more experience and, hopefully, better taste in anime. So bear with me.

img770()
First things first, ""OP is fantastic, I'm listening to it for the 3rd day straight.""
Absolute truth. Now I can say that I'm listening to it for the 10th year straight. ""[REALOVE:REALIFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtJSzlcOk8c)"" is easily one of the catchiest anime songs I've heard in my life and is still in my playlist to this day.
When I was a kid, I always watched ""Darkwing Duck"" before school, and to my neighbors' and parents' dismay, pushed the volume of that opening to a 100%. I'm not doing this often now that I'm an adult, but when Daimaou's opening started during my rewatch, I just couldn't help it and caught myself doing exactly that. It's just that good.
The rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorable, but always creates the atmosphere needed. I also liked that it included the variations of the opening song for some action scenes.

Next one. ""Seiyu are perfect, beyond praise. Girl who voiced Korone is absolutely priceless.""
You can't even imagine, how hard I laughed when I saw this in a 10 years old post. The thing is, I never really cared about seiyu. I knew the most popular names at the time, like Miyano Mamoru, Romi Park, Rie Kugimiya... you know, the big names. But I rarely, if ever, checked the other ones. It was enough for me that it sounds good, I didn't need to know who voiced who. So, noting a seiyu was a big deal for me back then.
So, with that said, now I know that Korone was voiced by, hands down, my absolute favorite seiyu these days, Aoi Yuuki. This is just destiny. I need to make a statue of this girl and pray at it every morning. So, there's really nothing more to add, seiyu in this anime are indeed perfect.

img770()
I thought that I may have oversold it when I said that art is great. And maybe I did, it definitely has its flaws and it's not, say, Violet Evergarden or Kimetsu no Yaiba by any means. But if you give it some leeway for it being a harem anime, then compared to its ""colleagues"" at the time, like Rosario+Vampire or Princess Resurrection, it looks like a masterpiece. Especially the animation. It doesn't look too static (for example, much as I like it, I could only re-watch Princess Resurrection at x1.5 speed, because of how badly it was animated), not too twitchy, it's just solid. The backgrounds are sometimes a little meh, but that was never a big deal for me.
Other than that, the picture is bright, the lines are pleasingly thick, it is pretty detailed. Easily passes the test of time and looks better than many modern anime.
And there's almost no censorship. Yay, nipples! (Except for Lily. For whatever reason, she was the only girl censored. What gives?)

As for the story and characters. Usually, harem anime follows a simple path of one waifu per episode until they show them all. Daimaou was different in that it showed every single character in the very first episode, and then started to develop them only when the story needed them, and not just because a new waifu must happen.
The episodes are full of content, there's barely any downtime at all. There is no time wasted, the episodes are literally just opening, ending and new content. No flashbacks, no ""previously, on Daimaou..."", nothing unnecessary. However, because of how packed the episodes are, everything moves a little faster than I would've liked and some moments feel rushed and undeserved. Including the character relationships (especially between Akuto and Junko) and the series finale. This is unfortunate and is probably the main reason this show has such low scores. If only it paced itself a little better...

img770()
Akuto, the protagonist, is amazing. He doesn't constantly whine, his nose doesn't bleed every time he sees a woman. He's charismatic, looks badass, acts rationally. Always nice and respectful to his girls, he never goes out of his way to end up in perverted situations and even prevents them if he feels like they are too forced. He is, for a change, a man, not a child. Even though this is still a school setting. All of this makes him stand out inside the genre filled with the absolute worst protagonists anime has to offer, ranging from creeps to simps to blank slates with barely any personality at all. Sai Akuto is a hero that shows how the harem anime can be a respectable show that stands on its own two feet. One of the best harem protagonists to date.
Korone is the best girl. If anything, just because of her ""turn off"" button. Dream come true. Plus her hairstyle, voice, striped panties... everything that I love, she's still my favorite character in this anime.
And while we're on the topic of panties. This anime has some of the best variety that I've ever seen. Eto has lace, Junko has fundoshi, Soga has a bear print and they are signed so that she doesn't lose them etc. Brilliant!
And speaking of Soga... she's just precious. Every dialogue with her is worth quoting. It's interesting how she manages to be adorable, but in a non anime cliche way. I really miss characters like her in modern series. She is fascinating.
Junko is an unfortunate victim of that content overload. If their conflict with Akuto was more developed, it would be just perfect. Their arc had a lot of potential. But instead it felt rushed and therefore phony. Still, love her.
Lily is even worse in this regard. Compared to manga, they may have as well just cut her out altogether. Which is unfortunate, because she is easily one of my favorite characters visually. And not just in this anime, but literally one of the favorite ever. I still use her face on avatars in some places. Simply gorgeous.

+ Characters. Both personalities and design.
+ Tightly packed episodes, with not even a second of downtime.
+ Good animation and art.
+ No censorship (almost).
+ Opening and the overall soundtrack.
+ Seiyu. Aoi Yuuki, obviously, but also Yoko Hisaka and Aki Toyosaki among others.
+ Varied panties :P

- Because of how packed episodes are, some moments seem forced.
- The last special ends on the most interesting part! -- 

So finally, for the last point of my original ""review"".
""I think, that this is a new masterpiece for my collection. I can't see anything wrong with this anime.""
And you know what? 10 years later... I think I still stand by it.

The biggest problem this anime has is that it was only 12 episodes. But it's 12 episodes with 24 worth of content. On one hand it's great, because there's never a dull moment, the story keeps moving, the relationships fluctuate... but at the same time, it doesn't let you stop, enjoy said relationships, develop characters, world etc. They do it, but very hastily. Which only makes me think ""what if they had at least 24 episodes...""
Still, I got immense enjoyment out of this anime now, just as I did the first time.
Yes, it's a harem anime. A harem anime, in which the hero respects the girls around him, doesn't spray fountains of blood of his nose, doesn't constantly try to look under the girls' skirts, doesn't focus on one single ""main"" girl shoved in your face by the story. And they, in turn, have reasonable motivation to be with him, other than ""he's the protagonist"".
This is a good story, covered in beautiful art with colorful panties flying around from time to time. ""Harem"" is not the purpose here. It's just some fan service that a good author can add tastefully. Which is exactly what happened in Daimaou.

Is it the best anime ever? No, of course not. But one of the best in the genre? Very likely. And if I were to make some sort of a top-50 anime list, there's a good chance Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou would end up in it.

img770()
P.S. I also recommend the specials. While nothing outstanding, they are still a fun addition if you enjoyed the main series. The animation took a bit of a hit in quality, but not to the point where it's ugly and unwatchable. Very much worth it if you want some extra fan service and comedy in your life."
101316,"The first time when I started watching anime, I was noting more than a 13 year old kid. The happiness and the excitement for the unknown was something that made so many of us so attached to this medium. As years went by and we all got older, we started to forget what was it about anime that made us skip a beat in anticipation for the next episode. While everybody is different and common opinions are not always the case, there is that one show that comes once in a long time that hits way too close to home. Some may like a show, some may completely dislike it, some may see it as mediocre while others will see it as the best thing ever. For me IRODUKU: The World in Colors was one of those shows in which I went in completely blind and came out with a bittersweet smile.


If I were to describe this show in the simplest terms, it would go with something along the lines of ''teenage life, coming of age and magic mixed in for full effect''. This is not a show for everybody and the blandness of its initial episodes may drive off many people. But that's exactly it! This show doesn't try to go over the top and doesn't try to add in unnecessary drama to move the plot ahead. If you take away the magic and time traveling aspect of it, you're left with the lives of our group of friends as they try to deal with their teenage ordeals. Tough, the plot mostly orbits around our protagonist [ Hitomi](https://anilist.co/character/128075/Hitomi-Tsukishiro), the show takes short breaks to give some screen time to the other characters in the group. Unfortunately, none of them get enough development. They don't feel like blank states, they are somewhat relatable but at the end of the day they all feel like missed opportunities. For what is worth, P.A. Works tried hard enough to cram as much as possible into a small screen time of only 13 episodes. The only one that really got a fairer treatment was our protagonist's grandmother, [Kohaku](https://anilist.co/character/128077/Kohaku-Tsukishiro), which felt the most human from the whole show.
img620()
As much as I wanted to like and emphasize with Hitomi, for me at least, she often felt bland and uninteresting. The main love interest, [Yuito](https://anilist.co/character/128080/Yuito-Aoi), was just a few centimeters more interesting than those dense ecchi protagonists. In this department, their relationship felt like a frustrating lost cause. 
Spoiler about the ending:
!The ending was undoubtedly a tearjerker. Though it felt rushed. Also all this buildup for a relationship that never came to be was also a big disappointment. I expected to at least have Yuito travel to the future with Hitomi and start a new life with her there, but no... screw you, viewer.!
I didn't bother to research this series in detail, but I'm amazed they managed to pull off this show without any source material. The audio was meh-ok, but nothing to remember. You usually have at least the OP or ED songs that you listen to each episode, but in IRODUKO both are skippable. The visuals are surprisingly good, though not something I would call amazing.
img620()

I don't even know if I should recommend this show or not because it highly depends on the personality of the viewer. It can either turn you off quickly or make you go to the flow, hoping to see what will happen next. For what is worth, it is an enjoyable and pretty chill watch for the weekend. I didn't expect anything when I started watching it and finished it decently satisfied."
103302,"There's a popular saying that floats around the anime community, ""Don't judge an anime by its first episode!"". Kono Oto Tomare! definitely necessitates this philosophy with its pilot's admittedly clumsy pacing. This is evidently a result of the large amount of backstory revealed in the shows first 24 minutes (which, in my opinion, hurts the series's storytelling a bit) topped with minor character friction that feels somewhat contrived. However, upon completing Kono Oto Tomare! I realize how vital this ""stick with it!"" mantra really is in the grand scheme of things. This anime is certainly standard slice of life fare but, if you choose to invest the time in it, it also proves itself to be a heart-gripping coming-of-age drama focusing on the troubled students of a high school koto club.

Once you conquer the hill of the first episode the story begins to blossom into something that is ultimately much better than what is initially set up. With each episode the viewer is introduced to new characters, each of them injecting their own personal issues into the narrative which effectively builds the story's foundation. This first season is essentially about synthesizing each of the main character's positive change arcs. To be honest, I think the strongest part of this series is the character writing. I particularly enjoyed how each character was confronted by a suitable opposing character, ultimately leading to eventual development and actualized moral change. I think the show summed this concept up best in its own words, at its heart the Koto Club is ""...a group of people with seemingly no common ground supporting each other by compensating for what the others lacked.""

With this in mind, Kono Oto Tomare!'s best character is undoubtedly Kudo Chika who, despite his delinquent facade, proves himself to be the Koto Club's heart time and time again. As a viewer I found my fondness growing for him as he became more emotionally intelligent and observant of the people surrounding him. The real draw here is that Kudo personally seeks out his own reformation and often in spite of all of the other character's initial doubts of him. This applies heavily to Houzuki Satowa who proves to be an effective rival and potential love interest to Kudo, though she is definitely more than just that.

One thing to keep in mind though is that the show's animation is definitely on the rudimentary side. In some of the key sequences there is an emphasis on special effects and stills rather than on actual animation. You can tell this anime has its roots in manga, a medium that's invested in still images, despite it focusing heavily on the playing of instruments and how skilled the characters are with their hands. At the same time, this anime is also a really good comedy with its visual gags relying on a simplified, chibi art style. This not only works well as an offset to the main drama but it also serves as a cushion for the overall animation in the long run.

Overall I honestly really enjoyed seeing this season through to its end. Though I will stress that these 13 episodes serve mostly as a prelude. The final episode promises further growth on behalf of the characters more than capping off the entire season. I think this show deserves recognition with regard to character intrigue more than anything else. Needless to say, I'm excited for what's next and will be seeing the story through into its second season. It deserves that much."
12531,"This is a spoiler-free review.

( I am writing this at 3 A.M., having just finished the series not half an hour ago. There's schoolwork banging on my door, the allure of my bed at the edge of my room, and the constant distractions that the internet seems to bombard me with. Yet, I cannot seem to bring myself to think of anything else. The worst part about finishing a masterpiece of a series at such a late hour is there's nobody to share it with. So instead, I'm writing down my thoughts here - no drafts, no polish, no pictures - just my thoughts plain and simple. )

This show is, without any exaggeration, one of the greatest stories I have ever had the honor of witnessing. The fully-realized characters, each with their own hardships and desires; the harsh and authentic depictions of friendship, of love, of growing up; the beautiful setting, with each location becoming as familiar as any of the leads; and the music - the utterly stunning, wonderfully crafted, and absolutely breathtaking music.

Kids on the Slope is an absolute joy to watch.

What I feel really binds this story together, more than anything, is just how messy it is. Characters fight for no reason, they get scared and hide things from each other, and they purposefully do stupid things that clearly won't end well. Sometimes things just happen - this show has tragedy, it has regret, it has dangerous decisions and even more dangerous consequences. Some plotlines are just dropped, or resolve without closure. Characters enter from seemingly nowhere and disappear nearly as quickly. It honestly feels like there was no plan at all.

But... that's life, isn't it? Let's be honest: life's a mess. It's full of bad things, bad things we do, and bad things other people do to us. Life hits fast and hits hard, and it can be unexpected and completely out of our control. Sometimes others seem to do things that make no sense to us. We've heard it thousands of times before, but nobody's perfect. No story is perfect. No relationship, neither one of friends nor one of love, is perfect. And that's the point. 

It's jazz. It's the imperfections that make it beautiful.

So what if not everything went according to plan? So what if things didn't go where you wanted them to? Sometimes it's the things we do that hurt the ones we love, but sometimes it's the things we don't, and oftentimes there's no way to tell the two apart. Just follow the rhythm, add your own flair, your own vision, and see where the music takes you. No matter the consequences, no matter the regrets, no matter the pain and heartbreak, no matter the mistakes and screw-ups and flaws, no matter how long it takes and how much despair seems to creep below you, the melody will lead you to happiness. So just play along."
132473,"the faraway paladin is another isekai series with a minor twist, that our protagonist essentially has to restart life from being a child in another world. the main character here - named will - is under the care of three strange and mysterious undead beings at the very start of the story and in that phase the core of the show is the bond that develops between this new family as well as the mysteries behind each of them and how will ended up in their care. i wasn't very big on how the anime went about all this though, for one thing we were rushed through 15 years of life in just about the first three episodes and that left precious little time to develop or meaningfully explore the relationship will had with his undead family of gus, blood and mary. as a consequence the moments that seemed like they were meant to be most significant just felt completely flat. it was clear that will cared a lot for them, but the audience wasn't given much reason to care and there hadn't been enough time devoted to them to make what happened feel like an especially big deal, especially considering how thoroughly any stakes or tension got killed off when spoiler-kun (stagnate) made his appearance in the 4th episode. unfortunately, like many african countries the story continues to be plagued by underdevelopment throughout and moment after moment passes by without feeling especially impactful from the more emotional moments where will is at his lowest to the moments meant to feel like great triumphs and even the resolution to the ""mysteries"" i mentioned before.

for a while i actually thought that watching this through to the end would turn out to be a complete waste of time, but things did pick up and mostly stay up around the halfway point with the introduction of best boy menel and the real start of will's adventures. menel and a number of the other supporting characters really did breathe life into this anime and helped balance out will's own relatively bland persona in a way that genuinely felt fun to watch at points. there were entire episodes that were carried by how will and menel bounced off each other whenever they shared a scene and that includes the final episode of this first season which was otherwise not anything spectacular, though we did get the show's only passable fight scene to my recollection in that episode. even the bishop was a surprisingly enjoyable character and i did appreciate how they decided to make him a little more complex instead of just someone stubborn for the sake of being stubborn, he's a person with his own convictions and reasons for being the way he is even if he's only a minor character. of course, there were problems with the character writing here, and will in particular came across a bit too shallow, with a sharp turn in character towards the end and a backstory that got glossed over at the beginning - though in at least one respect that could be a good thing for the show overall, seeing how well more blank protagonists lend themselves to the wish fulfilment aspect that's kinda inherent to at least the post-sao isekai genre.

now, when i call it wish fulfilment or even power fantasy, i don't at all mean that to be a negative comment since the popularity of the isekai genre always felt to me like a result of escapism, and mistaken or not that's how i've approached a few of these stories in the past and it's not something i'm immune to. will has the air of a character ideal for that, with his vague sense of regret for failings in his past, his desire for a better life and to be a better person, and eventual sense of loss over something he can't regain. it's an outline easy enough for the audience to trace their own experiences and thoughts onto and that would probably make each of will's successes all the more enjoyable and fulfilling to watch. it's a lot more fun to watch when you go into every fight expecting but also genuinely wanting the protagonist to come out on top, even though on a technical level the fight scenes themselves usually felt really stilted, and didn't carry a whole lot of weight. i've seen people say the original author of the faraway paladin created it for writing practice, and truthfully speaking it felt a little like the anime adaptation too was put together as practice for an inexperienced team a lot of the time. the art was good, the music and sound design didn't stand out as bad or great, but the animation and timing for various scenes as well as the dialogue and pacing really left a lot to be desired on a weekly basis. the industry being what it is though, it's probably just that they didn't get enough time or resources and since it's far from the worst anime that came out even just in 2021 [[ex-arm](https://anilist.co/anime/106503/EXARM/) noises] i don't wanna complain too much about this stuff.

it's a fairly standard isekai just without any of the ecchi harem stuff, which i guess is a godsend for some people. i mean you have your op protag and his still growing party, demonic forces at play, a medieval european setting, it doesn't really do anything to stand out from the crowd and honestly that's okay. if you're into crazier or more subversive stories within that genre then this isn't gonna be the story for you, but if you've ever enjoyed an isekai then you'll probably find Something about it to appreciate and that was very much my experience as it aired. 60/100 is by no means a negative score, if i hated it or didn't like it at all it'd be 50 or below, the fact it's just barely above that mark is just reflective of the fact it's almost like the new poster child for 6/10 anime in my mind because it had a few downsides and most of its positives were just ""okay"" like the art and supporting characters. not worth going out of your way to watch, but it won't be an altogether bad experience if you do, that's what this anime is and what the score i gave it means

Story - 8

If you like How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom, You will no doubt like The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt. Man, why are anime names getting longer? The two anime are operating within the same kind of concept and theme and I will be making comparisons to Realist Hero in this review too.

The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is not an Isekai anime. The story starts with Crown Prince Wein who was put in charge of a small kingdom called Natra which is in debt when the previous King went out of commission. The problem is Wein is lazy even though he is cunning and a genius. At his side is his trusted sidekick Ninym who is from an oppressed minority race called Flahm.



The anime touch on topics such as making money, negotiating with other kingdoms, forging alliances, war and a lot of geopolitics. While Realist Hero also touches on similar kinds of topics, the huge difference is Realist Hero skim the surface without going deep into it while Genius Price goes into all the in and out of what is happening in a more micro-managed style.

Another huge difference between The Genius Prince and Realist Hero is that Realist Hero has a more laid back tone while in The Genius Price, Wein is literally navigating a minefield of politics with his kingdom's neighbours. It is also a much more cunning world where the leaders have to outwit each other. E.g. A prince from another country die cause of an accident in Wein’s kingdom and he has to avoid war from breaking out between the two kingdom or political backstabbing and that verbal promise shouldn't be taken to heart or attempted assassination.



There are a lot more backhanded deals compared to Realist Hero be it politics such as other kingdoms making one face in front but already got thing scheming with another kingdom. This also goes into the business side such as Wein’s making money out of products coming from kingdom A that is at odds with Kingdom B by lying the origin to kingdom B and shipping it to them. 

The Genius Price does have some comedy elements to it. It is especially done with Wein being lazy and wanting to get rid of his own kingdom but accidentally improving it instead since he is a genius. There are also times when he is calm and composed but panicking inside. It is an amusing kind of comedy than the type that will make you laugh out loud.



Worldbuilding is decent, it feels a bit fast in some parts but the anime does do a fine job at making sure the viewer knows the different Kingdoms, their rivalry and so on using an overview map. The usage of Wein’s little sister Falanya studying with her tutors for the explanation and narrative of what is happening within the kingdom or what Wein’s doing is a pretty cool idea. 

Character - 7.5

The characters also shine in The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt even though there are not a lot of developments. The characters are well designed and come with their own set of interesting personalities and characteristics which make for a fun experience throughout. The dynamic between the characters and outwitting each other is also a big highlight of the anime.

There are also quite a lot of characters but the major focus is on Ninym, Wein, LowellMina and Falanya.



Wein, the lazy but genius prince of the small kingdom of Natra. As much as he is lazy and often complains about selling his kingdom and running away, he got a lot of jobs done in a most spectacular manner. Sometimes also by accident.

Wein may sound like a goofball behind closed doors, the side he only shows to Ninym. However, he is very cunning, creative and very good at outsmarting other kingdom’s politicians or generals. He also takes a lot of calculated risks. All these factors alone make him a really entertaining character to watch. It's like watching Shiroe from Log Horizon plan things out. As cunning as he may be, he also cares for his loved ones and if someone hurt them, he will go out for their blood.



Ninym is an adviser and an excellent aide for Wein. Cool-headed, intelligent, mature and sometimes can be a slave driver when it comes to getting things done. She is also capable of accompanying Wein anywhere from a diplomatic mission to a battlefield. Ninym is also caring for people who she cherishes and much like Wein will show no mercy to people who hurt her close friends. Ninym's relationship with Wein is an interesting one too since they are more than a friend but not lovers too. Definitely waifu material though.



LowellMina, princess of Earthwold Empire and a close friend of Wein. She is somewhat similar to Wein. Intelligent, kind, not arrogant for a noble and have the best interest of the people at her heart. The anime takes some time to establish the back story and relationship between Wein, LowellMina and Ninym too.

LowellMina, being a girl, her advice and idea are often dismissed in favour of her brothers (the princes of the Earthwold Empire) and all of them are gunning for the throne of the Earthwold Empire. The outwitting battle and mind game between LowellMina and Wein is also an intriguing one to watch.



Falanya is Wein’s little sister and someone who looks up to Wein. She can be seen in many scenes where she is studying everything from politics to battlefield strategy with her tutor. She later got a good screen time and development where she proves she is capable as a princess.

Art & Animation - 7

While The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt is not groundbreaking in terms of production quality it is way better than Realist Hero. The overall tone and the details of the arts are pretty good while the animations, in general, are on the weaker side.



The character arts and design are nice. Not only they are unique looking, but also very suitable for the fantasy medieval theme. The details on the character are also fairly nicely done with all the ribbons, accessories, stripes and texture on their outfits. Facial expressions are also spot on from the character putting up a poker face but panicking inside to smirk faces when Wein is winning. The animation of Wein twitching like a kid out of annoyance is also amusing and well animated.

The background also looks nice with good art quality and a fair amount of detail to them. Indoor scenes are well detailed and populated with objects that give an actual vibe of the era. Some of the floorings also look really nice with detailed patterns on them. The outdoor scene also looks equally nice with well-detailed castles, houses and some pretty looking natural environments. Scenes that need background characters have no them and for an anime that is not focused on food, the foods look fairly delicious too.



I also like how the camera transit in the early part of the anime where there is a battle and the camera goes from a carved soldier looking piece on a strategic map to the real general of the enemy army. However, the combat animations are extremely weak. They are mostly still shots with effects, close up camera shots with a few awkward motions and animation.

Sound - 6.5

The opening and ending songs of The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt are decent, they are good for listening to a couple of times but didn’t have retaining power to be in a playlist.

Background music sound nice with appropriate instruments and nice-sounding music which super compliments the scene. They are not so memorable but they do sound good. The background music quality is also well above the music that is used in some budget fantasy anime. 

I also don’t notice any sound effects missing from the anime. The anime has the standard level of detail and quantity that I expect from an anime when it comes to sound effects. Things such as the sound of a wooden block when Wein lifted a block from the strategic map or the sound of the carriage’s wheel when inside a carriage are all accounted for.



Voice acting is superb for all characters. The voice acting brings out the wit of each character nicely and things such as Wein panicking or twitching out of annoyance and complaining are also nicely voiced. As a fan of Rie Takahashi’s voice, it instantly makes Ninym a likeable character for me. Takahashi nailed the role of the character even if the character reminded me of Emilia from Re: Zero sometime.

TLDR:

An intriguing anime that goes deep into the geopolitics of the fantasy world. The outwitting battle and mind games between each character or kingdom are also fascinating to watch."

Today I will be talking about a show that hit me different and was quite an unique and interesting watch to me. I initially saw this show because the title ""The ""Hentai"" Prince and the Stony Cat"" is very fucking funny to me . What I initially watched as a joke has now became a show that I have seen 3 times and look back on fondly ( it is still kinda a joke though lol lol ). Come child, let me tell you why. 
img() 


I want you to look and think about all the female leads in popular romance anime in this day and age. 
img22%() img22%() img22%( img22%()


The Female leads in romance anime/manga are usually very perfect. Yes, I know I am being hypocritical here because well they are not fully perfect and most of them do have some flaws which makes them human, but I could argue that these flaws are usually very trivial or can actually make them more cute. 

There is nothing wrong with that, after all it is a romance . They are gonna be characters who are attractive or perfect. I know there are some romances where the characters are flawed ( for eg. Tsunderes if that counts). But I am going to say that the number of these shows are relatively less compared to the perfect/attractive types.  

So, What Makes This Show So Special?

If you ask me that question, I would say the reason I find this show to be interesting and unique is because it has characters who have major flaws in personality and not one or two of them. no no no. All Of Them. 
It doesn't shy away from showing their bad sides and it has quite good and interesting writing that I liked a lot. Lastly, despite being a romance ecchi anime ( if ecchi or lolis put you off then I won't recommend this to you lol ) it manages to portray themes like Self-Acceptance and Family quite well.

`Façade :- a deceptive outward appearance.`

I am sure all of us have lived / are living under some kind of facades. Maybe we regretted it or still continue to do so. The first arc of the anime has two characters who are living in facades themselves i.e. These two.  

 img45%() img45%() 

Yokodera ( Our Male Lead ) gives his facades to Azusa Azuki ( the girl ) who actually wants a façade. Now call me an overanalyzing anime reviewer man but I think there is a nice lesson on façade and self acceptance here. 

Yokodera learns that the lack of his façade of pretending to be not be a pervert was actually helping him. He learns that during the lack of it everyone in his class started to hate him for his actions and he himself couldn't do as much perverted stuff as he used to ( lol ) . What he thought was a part of himself that he needed to get rid of was actually was he needed the most.  

While Yokodera learns that his façade was actually necessary for him, Azusa learns that her façade was actually hurting her instead of helping her. After being teased and bullied in her past, she thought she must became this incredible and powerful person so that it would not occur again.  ( I can relate because I too have been bullied and teased  for a short period of 10 years of my life ) . When in reality, she just had to accept herself and be willing to open up to others and be more honest about her own feelings. 

img() 
` On a side-note, I personally can relate. I had spent my school life with people who constantly teased and ridiculed me for anything I did. I had shut myself and didn't share anything or open up to anyone. It was only after a long time of talking to people in college and understanding myself that I realized that people are not judging everything I did / said and I can actually talk about myself with other people in my life `
img() 


I would say the main theme running across the show is Family, it's effects and it's importance which leads us to the discussion of Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi ( Our Female Lead ) and her family. Let us dive in. 
 img() 

Her Family is constant struggle in Tsutsukakushi's life and three whole arcs of the shows are in regard to her family. I would like to talk briefly about each arc.
 
Sacrificing emotions for her sister has always been a thinker for me and I don't think I can understand it properly to this day. Sometimes, I think it is a dumb and stupid mistake on her part and sometimes, I think it was act of great sacrifice and loyalty. I have pondered on the question and thought for a long time and have finally thought of a decent theory ( if I say so myself ) . 

 img25%() img25%()  img25%() 
 `Me Thinking ( Yes, I changed my race three times while thinking )` 

Tsutsukakushi had been fighting with her sister for quite some time which was what lead her to make that wish to the cat god. Having lost her mother in a young age and living separated from her father, she places a really high value on family which was the reason that when she lost her sister's ""respect"" ( not really ), she was willing to go to such lengths to get her back.
( Also the reason why she didn't care about getting her emotions back as she had already got what she wanted i.e. her sister ).  

There was also another arc which highlights this aspect of her character really well. That is arc of the storm. What was once a silly wish made on a whim ended up almost destroying her home. The arc also thought her the difference between Yokodera and family. That is despite her feelings of wanting to convert Yokodera into her family, that is simply not possible because in the end of the day he is not and he has his own home.  Yokodera explained her to that he wishes that instead of spending every minute of the day together, he prefers some distance because that way things can be more exciting when they meet up and also that they should spend more time together in each other's homes too. Now, I know his speech is very unconventional but It comes from a place of honesty and sincerity which is why I love the way he handled this situation i.e. not by being a epic anime protagonist giving a life changing speech but rather just expressing his feelings. I do love this couple a lot.   
img()

Lastly, the final arc of the anime is just very heart-warming and sweet. 10/10. Peak Fiction. Loved it. Small Tsutsukakushi is very Kawaii.

This is section is just random shit that came to my mind ( just like all my reviews tbh ).
I would like to explain the ""characters who have major flaws in personality"" point from before. 
 img10%()  img10%()  img10%()  img10%()  img10%()  img10%()  img10%()  img10%()  img10%() 

Look at Our Male Lead, Man is degenerate and pervert but he is also a guy who is very kind hearted and helps both Azusa Azuki and Tsutsukakushi with their problems with all he has got. 

img() 

Tsutsukakushi is a girl who has no emotion . Something which is so integral to making a girl ""cute"" despite that she wished to continue to march forward with her dream of becoming a pre-school teacher and shows a lot of love and respect for her loved ones. ( A similar trend can be seen for the rest of the characters, though they don't get as much time as the main two )

I love this approach because people in real life are not ""Black"" or ""White"", all of them have good  and bad sides to them. I am glad this show treated it's characters with this approach and it is one of the reasons I look at it fondly. 

I didn't like the ed during my first watch but on subsequent re-watches I have grown to appreciate it. Very cute, princess-type vibe from this song showing our cute Tsutsukakushi dancing with her emotion-filled form showing the contrast of character between the two of them despite feeling and doing the same thing. It is very kawaii and epic.

 And that's it folks, The review is over. 
So is this show the greatest anime ever made? 

No, it is not. The show is filled with some questionable ecchi moments and some tropes and clichés you might see in a typical romance harem anime ( though personally I don't mind ) which take the show's ratings down.  
I wrote that title to bait people into reading this review because unfortunately despite it's good characters and interesting drama, not many people have seen it and this being the anime I have re-watched the most, that makes me sad :(. I will end this review by saying, I wish upon the cat god that if you do decide to watch or re-watch this show, you have a excellent time and have a wonderful day my friend :)"
105018,"Note: There is a spoiler in this review regarding a plot element that is actually also spoiled in most of the film's marketing materials and pitches. I think viewers are best off going into this film blind.

Masaaki Yuasa does it again (at least in my humble opinion). Him and the rest of the creative team were really able to bring the core cast of Hinako, Minato, Wasabi, and Youko to life. Strongly defined and identifiable characters in anime films are so hard to come by because efficient film economy isn't something seen too often in anime storytelling and screenwriting. So, the plot is nothing to write to your undergrad philosophy professor about and not something sophisticated to analyze, but the creative team took care of the film's character writing and progression, which is the most important thing in mainstream storytelling. 

Yuasa's really gotten more consistent as his career has progressed. I remember ""Kemonozume"" and ""Kaiba"" losing me towards their respective ends. ""The Tatami Galaxy"" really dragged in the last third for me, before finishing on a really great closing episode. But ever since ""Devilman Crybaby,"" I've noticed that I am more consistently engaged by his works. ""Devilman Crybaby,"" ""Lu Over The Wall,"" ""The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl,"" and now, ""Ride Your Wave"" never really dragged for me through any sizable stretch.

Now, for ""Ride Your Wave"" itself, I found this is one of the better depictions of a romantic relationship in anime form. I knew a montage was coming to summarize Hinako and Minato's short physical relationship to set the audience up for Minato's death and I was ready to find the montage cliche and hackneyed, but the soundtrack was just so damn effective that my heart melted and I was sold on their relationship. Having Hinako and Minato do the sing-along with Hinako breaking into laughter was just a gorgeous, gorgeous thing. The PDA and physical couple play between Hinako and Minato was depicted in such a relatable and fuzzy manner as well.

Not to the extent of the ""high-concept"" of ""Snakes on a Plane,"" but the title of this film essentially captures its premise. A girl whose identity is anchored in surfing and ""riding waves"" experiences a major tragedy and then learns to overcome it. This is not a thematically or narratively complicated film that will challenge your pre-existing conventions and notions through deliciously meaty plot lines (which is hard to do and perhaps best avoided in a 90 minute film format, anyways), and that is okay because of the aforementioned character writing. The plot serviceably moves the characters along in their development, but to offer some criticism, there are some clunky contrived aspects of the plot that the enjoyable character actions effectively distract from. The rhythm of the plot sputters in the last third of the film as Hinako tries to move on from Minato, and as the narrative flags from the lack of dynamic conflict and new introduced, the climax is introduced as this big, simple, and perhaps too convenient way for Hinako to move forward. The final conflict of the climax is corny and cheesy (mmm, cheese-dipped corn-dog) and repetitiously re-summons the illegal fireworks bros that helped to bring Hinako and Minato together in the first place. The execution is a little dumb, as it demands some convenient idiocy from Youko, but I forgave the cheesiness because it results in a column of water ridiculously moving up a skyscraper and a glorious and cathartic collaborative surf session with Hinako and Youko down the side of that skyscraper.

Ultimately, I found ""Ride Your Wave"" to be a well-executed and straightforwardly earnest film that is filled with warmth and humor. ""Ride Your Wave"" had the best humor I've seen in some time for an anime, and that really helped the characters feel more dynamic and personable within the short run-time of the film. I highly recommend this film as a way to book-end a date night on a loving and affirming note.

Oh yeah, Michiru Oshima does another kick-ass soundtrack. No anime-associated composer does better at evoking feelings of nostalgia and poignancy. The combo of Yuasa and Oshima or Yuasa and Kensuke Ushio more often than not results in sonic glory."

Illuminating against a dark secret, the electricity flowing through a coiled wire induces a powerful electromagnet. This is the attractive force that gives rise to a significant and amazing sequel titled Railgun S. A sequel that has darkened the story for the better.

The revamped expansion of the Sisters Arc from Index now reveals a greater impact while implementing its own semi-theoretical science. This is a poignant story about the pain, suffering, care, and kindness triggered by one of the most controversial subject science has made possible. That is, the cloning of humans. Through a branched exploration of human values, this season gets you to feel personalized and deeply embedded by its ideas. With the Sisters, it questions whether they're mere guinea pigs to be disposed of or something more than just that, something containing human qualities. Burdened by the guilt to let all this happen is Misaka, a girl who suffers and throbs with so much pain, yet she develops the most and develops with a touching message. Then we have Touma, an idealistic drive who rises with heroic kindness. He's a solid character in Index but here, he's even better as a crucial supporting pillar. They're among the characters who possess the desire to stop the experiment's inhumane desire for absolute power. And who amplified all this agony even further? That goes to Accelerator, an appearance of a ruthless predator who plays around with his defenseless preys, instilling a strong fear factor. A perfect role for an antagonist who aims tormenting anguish right into the direction of a weakened heart. Undoubtedly, this season has shifted its tone towards a darker stance for the better but the more positive tones are still present to contrast with it. Misaka's friends lighten up against the gloom with their lighthearted attitudes. While happiness may seem like a faraway thing in upsetting times, the presence of friends is a joy that brings in laughter and smiles. Sisters Arc is such an exceptional arc that the last two thirds feels quite dull. Nonetheless, the conclusion is still a solid story about four girls who live in a city full of electrifying moments.

Corridors and alleys as far as the eyes can see, the maze-like structure of Academy City is a setting where fights between powerful espers occur at. Saturating themselves with engrossing choreography, smooth animation activates heightened energy as they unleash vibrant abilities with one another. Accompanied by camera shakes and build ups of slow-mo attacks, they're the kind of battles that pack a lot of emotive excitement. And when gore makes its appearance, it adds a layer of cruelty which underlines a savage presence found throughout this season. Like an endless torture sucking you deeper towards the dark despair. To add even more moods and emotions, the differing brightness in colors syncs with the adjusting tone, transforming from sunny optimism to cloudy pessimism. Pained expressions that visually show the impacts of getting betrayed over and over again hits one's heart right in the feels. It's this kind of heartbreaking moments that reminds us why storytelling can become a touching art, an art to sway our feelings. Furthermore, voice acting also expresses the emotions lingering inside them, sending a cute note until seriousness gains control. But if there's one character who is so influential, it definitely goes to the man named Accelerator. His voice actor nailed his role flawlessly. A gripping delivery of a barbaric antagonist, with his harsh and frenzied vocal projecting spine-tingling chills. In contrast, soft soundtracks of piano and other calming notes play with feelings of positivity against a season full of pain. Again, this contrasts to when all hell breaks loose as tense background tracks intensify the drama with powerful importance. Maintaining the mastery of amazing openings for this spin-off, fripSide delivered two awesome opening songs yet again. With upbeat thrills, like a generator producing accumulating powers, hearing the songs sends a flow of electric current inside me and kick-started my excitement for what's to come.

And what comes out is a sequel that goes all the way through the roof, leaving a trail of energetic eminence behind. Railgun S is the flowing of non-stop greatness and has managed to power all of its sciency exploration into one functioning season. Truly a certain electrifying force."
139587,"Isekais are a dime a dozen these days, and it’s not every day you find a really special one. I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend this one, but what I will say is, it’s above average by isekai standards for sure, with good animation and lovable characters that make this show very chill and easy to watch. It has some good concepts, but the overarching video game aspects do hold it back a little. There are also some very unnecessary aspects of the show other than the game mechanics, such as the telepathy, which I’ll highlight below.

STORY:

It’s pretty basic, but it doesn’t really do anything very wrong, or step out of their lane. The one thing that stands out is that the person who gets isekai’ed isn’t really the main protagonist, but the helper to her. I really wish that the way people get isekai’ed get a bit more creative, but perhaps no one really cares about those few minutes of the plot. The levelling up mechanic is one thing that I can never really get behind in most shows, because it’s just a plot device to skip any sort of training, or more meaningful character development. The characters just get stronger by gaining materials and slaying enemies, not by genuine training.

ART:

Genuinely way better than I expected, but seeing that studio C2C adapted this was already a good sign, given some of their previous work, for example, Majo no Tabitabi, which looked very solid. Some very sharp sakuga in some episodes that could even rival shounen fight scenes, but also some parts weren’t that well animated, especially near the end. Overall, the animation was still a big highlight to this show.

MUSIC:

The OP and ED were very good, although the OP would hint that the show would potentially be pretty dark, which didn’t necessarily hold true. The soundtrack itself was pretty basic, which very video-gamey sound effects and music that didn’t really stand out.

CHARACTERS:

Fran carries this show on her back, and anyone who has watched this knows it. She’s adorable, and just a little cinnamon roll. She has her moments to shine, though I wish things got a little darker than they did. The relationship between her and Shishou was very wholesome as well, though I don’t really get why they talked in telepathy mode, especially since a lot of the time, Fran is talking out loud. I do understand using telepathy to speak during battles, but when they’re just talking normally, the telepathy was quite unnecessary, and because of that, Shishou’s voice actor, Shinichiro Miki (voice of Kaiki from Monogatari and Kisuke from Bleach) had that filter over his voice which made it a little strange hearing it for the whole episode every time.

The side characters are alright, but other than Amanda, none really stood out, as they just kind of existed. As for the villains, once again, they fall into the category of “evil just for the sake of being evil”. They’re just simple bad guys, with no real motives, which is a bit underwhelming but expected, for the nature of this show.

Overall, other than Fran and Shishou, quite a forgettable cast of characters, but it was still enjoyable to watch their shenanigans.

ENJOYMENT:

For the most part, I did enjoy this series, other than a few segments near the end of the series. Very cute and wholesome.

THEMATIC EXECUTION:

I really wish the show emphasized more on the darker themes. We saw shades of them, with the whole slavery aspect in the beginning, and when Fran was killing the villains, but I think the show would have benefitted more from extending those scenes and really fleshing out the world a bit more, because from what I saw in this show, there were definitely a lot of dark elements present in the world.

OVERALL:

Not the most unique show by any means, but a good effort here for sure. Pretty great animation, and seeing Fran and Shishou’s wholesome relationship develop was a nice treat to see. I would definitely be happy if a Season 2 ever was announced, because Fran eating curry is life!"

-Trigger warning for sexual assault talk!!!



Back when Given  first aired, it was praised for its healthy representation of a gay couple. In a genre that is saturated (at least in anime) by shows like Junjou Romantica, Super Lovers, Love Stage, and similar stuff, it is no surprise that Given was a success and that it had a good reception by the community. It was a show in the Boy's Love genre where there was not only a central plot, but where the characters had motivations of their own, and also personalities. While the production of the anime was average at best, it was still an enjoyable and emotional ride. After the TV anime ended, and the movie was announced, I am sure many people expected the quality to stay and for the main message of the show to deliver once again. It is a shame that it did neither. I knew going into this that I was not going to be a fan.  As someone who used to be an avid reader of the manga at one point, I knew the arc the movie was going to focus on was not what I liked. Most of my issues were how the relationship between Akihiko and Haruki was treated, and also about how a show that was praised for a good representation of a relationship between two people ended up becoming yet another bad trope in Shounen ai anime. Whatever the first season of the anime tried to build, the movie just spat on.

The pacing of the whole movie feels fast, yet slow. Many transitions feel out of place and overall it is just very hard to follow up with what's happening. The production takes many shortcuts. Many. Plenty of shots are way too close and don't help establish the position of the characters in the scene, which makes the direction of the movie seem stilted and it lacks the personality that the first season had. This is very easy to spot in the first five minutes of the movie. We begin with Ugetsu's (Akihiko's on and off boyfriend) concerto and while I did expect the anime to add in CGI, it was still a huge disappointment. I don't mind the CGI model, whatever, but the main point of that scene was to let us in on the music world of Ugetsu. Let us see just what music he plays and what effect it has on people. The anime makes this a completely boring scene by failing to add to the atmosphere. It felt like a watered-down version of what happened in the manga, and this says a lot since the manga is not only in black and white but has no music or sound effects. It is also easy to notice that the violin playing sounds no different than if you looked up a violin piece on Youtube. In the first season, the sound when the band was playing at the concert venue, clearly sounded as if you were there hearing a band. Attention to detail is important and the movie doesn't seem to have it. Since the concerto scene has no impact, it is very hard to take Mafuyu seriously when he says that Ugetsu's music made feelings resonate within him.  To make things even worse, many of the scenes where characters are playing music, are drawn from the chest up, meaning you won't see them actually play the guitar or whatever instrument they have. This probably meant to save time and/or money, but it is worth mentioning that it decreases the quality of the movie, since the first season had a jam session where every character was seen playing their instrument of choice.

It is time to address my biggest problem with the show and it is Akihiko and Haruki's relationship and the way it was handled. While the anime watered down some parts and/or removed some content (which I'm grateful for cuz the scene on the couch was heartbreaking and just pissed me off), it is important to know that the couple the movie focuses on is not, and will probably never be, on the same level as Mafuyu and Ritsuka's relationship back in season 1. Akihiko is honest to god a jerk in the beginning, and despite what the show tries to say, I can't ever see this man in a good light nor care about whatever good deed he does in the future. He has many problems, and while this does make him seem human, I just find him completely dislikable. Taking advantage of someone who you know has a soft spot for you and/or is in love with you, is an asshole move. Excuse my profanity but that is just the best way to describe it. Akihiko has no issue taking out his frustrations on Haruki. He hides a lot of things about himself but also expects others to tell him everything about them and what they are thinking. This is hypocritical behavior. He clearly has known for some time that Haruki had a crush on him, yet he didn't stop to think about his feelings and just used him when he needed to. It is funny how he tells Haruki that he is running away when it is clearly Akihiko who is running away and he even says so himself at some point. It is not Haruki's fault that Akihiko has problems with Ugetsu, yet he still ends up being dragged into their mess. Akihiko knows Haruki is in love with him, yet that didn't stop him from sexually assaulting him even though he asked him to stop and was crying. While the anime made this scene seem less horrendous than it was in the manga, it is still terrible. Even when Haruki says it was ""consensual"", I beg to differ since he only let him do what he wanted after he saw Akihiko was crying. After this, Akihiko apologizes and Haruki says he hopes he leaves by morning. To nobody's surprise, Akihiko seems to lack self-awareness and doesn't leave the apartment. Riveting. Even after what he did, he still has the nerve to ask Haruki to please help him since he has nowhere to stay. Haruki ended up cutting his hair after what happened, and it seemed as if there was an indication that he may give up on Akihiko and look for something else, but that is false hope since, spoiler, they will end up together just like you knew they would. I love how Akihiko literally assaulting Haruki, in Haruki's own apartment, is just glossed over as some dumb plot device. 

At one point in the movie, Haruki is feeling bad since both Ritsuka and Mafuyu seem to be playing music fine, and Akihiko offers him some words of encouragement and this helps him feel better. I am sorry but this man assaulted you a day ago, and you're not only taking advice from him but feeling happy about it? this is not how things work. Haruki has self-esteem issues, and to me it is heartbreaking to see someone who clearly deserves better, end up with someone who I would rate lower than garbage. Like the book, The Perks of Being a Wallflower says, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" . The rest of the movie continues showing Haruki and Akihiko growing ""closer"" and I say this in quotes because it just doesn't work for me. I need more than still shots gliding across the screen while some dialogue plays. Nearing the end of the movie, it is heavily implied that Akihiko fell in love with Haruki. Even in season 1, there wasn't much context to believe this. It only seemed like Akihiko liked teasing him and to me, it never felt like he was falling in love with him but whatever. The only thing I am going to mention about Ugetsu is that the movie tried painting him like a villain, and at the same time it made him lose whatever personality he had in the manga. I didn't enjoy the way his character was handled, and it seemed like he was the bad guy of the story, even though both he and Akihiko were to blame for how their relationship became and ended. 

To end this review, which is kind of my hate letter to what Given became, the part where Akihiko and Ugetsu break up is not done properly, causing it to once again lose whatever emotion was supposed to be there. The show feels hollow and I find it incredibly sad since the first season did a great job in that department. Plenty of scenes between Mafuyu and Ritsuka were removed and this again makes the song they sing in the movie suffer. It is not a bad song by any means, but at least for me it had no emotional value and it is not better nor on the same level as the song they sang in the first concert. The theme song that plays in the end, however, has way more emotion and seemed to fit better the relationship between Akihiko and Ugetsu, as well as the one Mafuyu had with Yuki. It is disappointing to see a show that was something special go this bad. Not only did it feel like the studio didn't put the same love into it, but most of the issues in the movie were going to be the same since the story is following the manga. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a good movie either. It is merely an hour long so it doesn't feel like wasted time, but it left me feeling empty and besides the ending theme, I didn't enjoy the majority of its run. If you do like the couple of Akihiko and Haruki maybe you will enjoy this or were even looking forward to the movie but at least in what refers to me, I once again remembered why I dislike Akihiko Kaji."

Fire it up!

The wonders of a light novel adaptation falling into J.C. Staff’s hands are ones that don’t begin and end with Shakugan no Shana. Up until 2005, none of the studio’s other LN adaptations latched on with viewers, with Maburaho, an ecchi comedy, being their most successful result. Not to be confused with Shaft’s similarly named ecchi comedy from the early 2000s, Mahoromantic! Either way, J.C. Staff finally struck gold with a tried and true light novel selling formula that launched Shana into the stratosphere. It has action, it has romance, and more importantly, it has an eye-catching female character as the story’s focus! 

Shana’s appearance is one that draws in curious onlookers. She looks like a typical anime school girl, and yet her hair and eyes are both fiery red and she’s holding a SWORD. And she’s surrounded by FIRE. Additionally, Shana’s design and personality both represent a popular anime character archetype at its most straightforward. Small, but also hot-headed. Her hair color can flip back and forth just like her temper. With the added ingredient of a male lead character who doubles as her romantic interest, Shana exemplifies the ‘tsundere’ trope to the point where her existence helped to become the future blueprint of the idea.

img2000(
Baka.

That’s not to say that Shana was the first or most important of her kind. This character archetype can be found in much older media (even in media I’ve reviewed already, like Akiha Tohno from Tsukihime), though I can’t help but link later light novel adaptations with similar character dynamics back to this one. Haruhi Suzumiya, Zero no Tsukaima, Kaze no Stigma, Toradora, Oreimo, all playing with the idea of a central, untouchable female character, usually with some type of soft spot. Regardless, J.C. Staff can only do so much in their adaptations.

The main problems with the Shana anime are the same problems that crop up in other light novel adaptations. Being a medium of words, you will need to stay attentive so you can piece together every little explanation that drops on your head with each new episode. Many systems are introduced, many characters pass by, and you only have a limited amount of chances to get acquainted with them. Denizens destroy humans. Humans can become Flame Hazes. Flame Hazes destroy Denizens. Some humans become torches, and some torches are Mystes. Juggle this logic with an expanding roster of characters featuring unique combat abilities, and you got that classic brain frying light novel charm.

Although the selection of characters is vast, most of our mainstays are worth keeping up with. Shana’s predictable fiery personality hides no surprises, though she makes the action sequences a lot more enjoyable, as she doesn’t waste time moping about. It’s clear that her and our main protagonist, Yuji, make for a fitting pairing. Neither of them are clever, though both are reckless enough to get the job done when they need to. Despite this, the story tries to stick some drama into Yuji’s relationships by tossing in an average schoolgirl named Kazumi, who also has a crush on Yuji. Yet, despite the obvious matching of Yuji to Shana, Kazumi gets multiple episodes of attention! On the flipside, our other resident booze-drinking Flame Haze, Margery, makes for a fun time whenever she’s involved.

img2000(
Woooooo alcohol!!

The next ‘light novel’ problem would be the story’s structure. The contents of this first season reaches through the first nine volumes of the light novel series, as well as its own original anime material. While episodes from the first cour take their sweet time with the first two introductory light novel volumes, the rest of the season blasts through well over 1500 pages of content all at once. Suddenly, the comfortable pace from the early episodes turns into a mad rush of information and action that is difficult to take in. Each arc takes on a different set of villains, so if you need a summary of what Shakugan no Shana’s actual plot is, it’s about constantly trying to save the city from being destroyed by Denizens.

My favorite parts of the story are towards the beginning, where Yuji and Shana are getting to know each other, with Shana needing to re-learn human conventions. This makes up the underlying concept of this anime, where each conflict serves the purpose of further strengthening Shana’s personality and relationships. Yuji is also trying to get a grip on his whole ‘torch’ situation, while trying to find a place for himself in Shana’s action-packed adventures. The two slowly learn how to work with each other while also trying to understand their compatibility.

As for the other parts… I’d much rather have ‘too much story’ in an action adventure than too little, though the amount of characters feels like overkill at times. The whole Tiriel/Sorath conflict feels like an afterthought, secondary to Shana learning about affection. Even side characters like the previously mentioned Kazumi seem like an unnecessary source of drama, secondary to a greater conflict that is also happening at the time. Even with so many different problems arising, I’m left wondering what all this commotion is building up to in the long run. I’m looking for some kind of hook, but I’m not finding any.

img2000(
Shana left wondering why Yuji HATES her so much

Despite the information overload and colorful action scenes, it’s not as if Shakugan no Shana is fighting for your attention. This story is confident in its mechanisms, and you’re either along for the ride, or you’re getting lost in the details. The real question is whether or not this ride is worth getting on in the first place. And as much as I hate to shoot down a popular 00s staple, I confess that I couldn’t get into this.

Truthfully, I stopped wanting to follow it by the time I got halfway through. It’s not as if I couldn’t keep up with it; I did manage to follow the flurry of characters and the ever changing scenarios by revisiting episodes. But regardless, so many special beings were being poured into the cast that the impact had been entirely diluted by the time I got to the last arc. Any time it was hinted that Yuji or Shana were going to die, I had gotten used to it. They don’t make for good victims, even when they’re out saving each other, because there isn’t a chance that either of them are going to get killed off. Not in the first season, at least!

As for the romantic drama of the show, I felt that the ‘love triangle’ situations were unnecessary. Shana and Yuji clearly have enough problems to deal with as it is. I can understand wanting to shape Shana’s human emotions over the course of the season, but the way this story goes about doing it is always bordering on hacky. Every conflict is overcomplicated, and every arc is constructed with far more characters than it needs. It’s an anime that has its moments, and has its own good characters, too. It’s unfortunate that its best qualities are buried under its worst ones. If you can stomach it, you won't hate it.

D'oh!"
66,"Review by me lol

Slice of life has always been a genre I've thought to have massive potential. By removing the tightly knit plot and fantastical setting of other anime, it leaves the perfect opportunity to focus on characters. Some of my personal favorite anime like New Game and Imouto Sae Ireba Ii. use the slice of life format to craft some of the most interesting and believable characters set to screen. All of this is to say that slice of life in its conception allows for the perfect canvas to write intricate characters. Which is why whenever I see an anime do the complete opposite, I'm instantly interested in it.

Lucky Star will always be one of the most interesting slice of lifes to me for the simple reason that it ditches complex characters in favor of ones that are paper thin and utterly simple. Of course, pulling off simple characters in a genre where characters are near the only appeal is incredibly difficult, but when it's done well it will never cease to amaze me. Which is where we get to Azumanga Daioh.

Azumanga Daioh is the concept of simple character writing taken to its logical extreme. Running gags persist throughout the entire series and you'll be able to extrapolate most of a character's personality within the first few minutes of seeing them on screen. And that's precisely the point. Azumanga Daioh uses simple characters to show complex character relations. Within the massive group of friends the show follows, characters interact with each other differently depending on their relations with one another. A few examples: Osaka, Tomo, and Kagura form a group they call ""The Knuckleheads"", and this bond formed in idiocy persists in small ways throughout the show. Kagura has a rivalry with Sakaki, and will often compete with her. Chiyo and Osaka form a close bond with each other. These relations turn what might have become relatively stale into something incredibly interesting.

Not to mention, the characters in Azumanga Daioh are just FUN. I especially love Ayumu ""Osaka"" Kasuga. She really does steal the show in so many ways. Aside from her there's the hyperactive but lovable Tomo, adorable and intelligent Chiyo, cool with a penchant for cuteness Sakaki, responsible voice of reason who can also be occasionally immature Yomi, and competitive Kagura. There's also three teachers in the main cast: irresponsible Yukari, responsible Minamo, and perverted Kitamura. That's a simple explanation of the entire cast but I don't think my description emphasizes just how real each character feels. Despite being simple and very out-there, the cast almost feels like they were made for each other. There's not a single cast member I didn't like, and most of them I absolutely loved.

One of the more interesting parts of Azumanga Daioh is the emphasis on school events, traveling, and generally breaking away from the monotony of school life. Three times the characters go to Chiyo's summer home, three times they have the sports festival, and on top of other miscellaneous events and the school festival, Azumanga Daioh manages to constantly break up the pace of the show to keep things consistently fresh.

Another standout part of this anime is the comedy. While it's mostly what you'd expect from a slice of life, it occasionally gets super out-there and surreal, especially when Osaka's involved. This surreal side of the comedy really helps Azumanga Daioh differentiate itself from other anime, not to mention it's just super funny. I've rarely seen a show that can make me laugh as consistently as this one, and on top of all the other things I loved, the comedy really helped complete this show.

Azumanga Daioh is just another slice of life comedy. It also perfects everything it sets out to do. I'll always remember episode 19 as one of my favorite moments in anime. It's not the climax of a giant arc, it's not explosive or big or even really anything out of the ordinary. It's a scene of Minamo and Yukari simply talking about the future and what they want to do with their lives, and it managed to get more emotion out of me than the climaxes of most anime. I never really noticed or cared that Azumanga Daioh is mostly fluff, because it's fluff that makes you feel something, with characters that are simple but also utterly enthralling. Azumanga Daioh truly is a masterpiece in its simplicity."

Blue Box was always a highly anticipated romcom- way before the Fall 2024 season. Youtubers and analysts were seen publishing videos commonly titled ""The most underrated romance manga"" at every turn. Naturally, this piqued my interest, so when the release date for the adaptation was announced, as a romance fan, I couldn't be happier. Until, I was dissapointed. (Don't leave. I promise it ain't what you think)

img600()


So, the first episode actually felt good. The animation -both CGI and hand-drawn- for the songs (how tf you get both Eve and Hige Dandism), and the sports sequence actually surprised many of us due to the amount of love put into it. Multiple people performing moves in the background, gorgeous close-up shots of the main characters, and comedy chibi bits were more than enough to convince everyone that this show was gonna go on a roll. However, this assumption was only based on a single episode.
img600(v)
img600()

After a couple more episodes aired, I began to feel let down. Although the production was there, the rest just felt subpar. The jokes were too dry to be able to make anybody with decent humour chuckle. The characters included a simp protagonist, the nice girl, the lively childhood friend who is also the losing heroine, and the incredibly observant male friend. Chinatsu came across as a hollow character, simply existing to appeal to the viewers and Taiki. Speaking of Taiki, holy fk he was annoying. Like, we get it little bro. She's pretty.


img600(

There we go. Episode 6 giving us the best episode yet for the best character. Whoever you pick as your favourite from the main girls is your choice, as it is your personal preference, but when discussing who was (and probably still is) objectively the best character at this point of the story, it's exceedingly obvious Hina clears. Not only did she have personality, barely managing to pull the viewers back from dropping the show with it, she also came with another package. A tragic package.
img600()

Hina was Taiki's long-term best female friend. Their interactions had chemistry because of Hina's personality and because they knew each other for a while. What made it all suddenly so gut-wrenching to watch was how Hina understood her own feelings for Taiki too late. She was in the worst position possible. Taiki was actively in the midst of pursuing a romantic relationship with another girl, who coincidentally lived in the same house as him, making any chances for a comeback steal nearly impossible. I'll get back to this later.

I'm not gonna lie to you, the episodes after 6 were exponentially decreasing in value, so I'm very glad they took a break to present to us:


Yeah. Cour 2 was a banger. We immediately started the fresh serialization off with a stand-alone episode dedicated to Haryuu and Karen, which was unexpectedly emotional. I'll tell you what, Karen and Haryuu's relationship felt so healthy and more on the mature side, to the point where some people might've started favouring them more than Taiki x Whoever, but this is when I understood something. This anime's strength did not merely lie in the enthralling blue box of romance (horrible title drop ik), but in the sports aspects as well.

img600()

As something of an athlete myself, whenever they shoved a serious/emotional match in my face, I simply couldn't help but relate to the characters and the emotions they were feeling. The thought of losing, the thought of improving, the thought of not getting over your limitations, the thought of dissapointing others etc. It was real. To me, these moments of Chinatsu, Taiki or Haryuu giving it their all felt more meaningful than the love triangle; at least, before the love triangle got better.


With the addition of episodes 14 and 15, Blue Box was able to peak. Don't get me wrong. There was build-up before them, so I'm not saying only these two episodes were praise-worthy. It's just that 14 and 15 provided so much. 

img600()
Episode 14 is Blue Box's single best attempt at stellar story-telling. Displaying Chinatsu's intense Inter High Finals match simultaneously alongside Hina's confession, blossoming a rollercoaster of emotions within us. Not many damn anime girls have the balls to confess the way Hina did on that swing. Watching the confession in awe is one thing, but seeing Chinatsu fail to make the clutch shot attempt just when Hina succeeded in verbally confessing her feelings generated a surge of goosebumps that I wouldn't be able to explain now. The pacing of the episode and the conversation taking place during the match felt too right and too refreshing; it's difficult to elaborate. The pinnacle of Blue Box's romance element and its sports element side-by-side. What a day to be alive, huh?

img600(

Episode 15 wasn't nothing to scoff at either cuz guess what? Chinatsu is an actual character now! We celebrated Chinatsu's birthday and perceived some quality time between her and Taiki. As a Hina lover, I thought I'd be distraught, but that wasn't the case at all. Why? Simply due to Chinatsu gaining the ability to be vulnerable around Taiki. She felt human. She felt real. Her and Taiki's interactions got a huge boost in chemistry and enjoyability. I couldn't dislike her now. I couldn't hate them being together now, so it started to complicate my feelings on the matter. 

img600()

Ah yes, very clever; because after all that (insert Karl Anthony-Towns edit), Blue Box finally had the perfect formula for a love triangle that actually works. Two likable heroines with their own stories, own personalities, a non-incel protagonist (not anymore, at least) that actively tries to sort out their romantic feelings by thinking and observing their own actions:

1. Chinatsu who wants Taiki all to herself, but is unable to express her feelings very well
2. Hina who is waiting for a positive response to her confession, waiting for the correct opportunities to interact with and make Taiki fall for her, even though she knows it may be futile (truly sad)
3. Taiki who is racking his brain, sorting out his feelings towards the two girls while also trying to distinguish badminton and his love life. 


Episode 18, aka the representation of Blue Box's beautiful sports aspect. Taiki's match with Yusa did not dissapoint. Taiki's inner conflicts, Taiki's improvement as a badminton player, Hina and Chinatsu's support. Wouldn't this be considered yet another god-tier episode in Blue Box standards? Yes.

img600(


img2200()

Episode 24. My downfall. Hina squad knew it was coming. Hina squad knew there couldn't be any other way. Hina squad sad. Hina squad cry. The atmosphere felt just right for a serious conversation. Just right for a rejection. Taiki handled it in the best way possible and I respect him for it. There was no point in leading her on or trying to drag things out. He loved Chinatsu and Hina was precious to him....

11013,"What was I expecting when I started watching Inu x Boku SS? I really don't know, something entertaining at the very least? Unfortunately, Inu x Boku  is nothing of the sort, just an episodic hodgepodge of random scenarios with little-to-no overarching plot. I'm actually not sure what this was supposed to be. A romance? If so, it certainly lacked progression until the very end. A comedy? Well, it didn't really make me laugh very much, which I admit, is somewhat subjective, but the humor didn't work for me, outside of a few characters or episodes. Supernatural? I guess it had supernatural elements. Honestly, those were the highlight of the show, but the supernatural powers got so little focus that they may as well have been just a plot device.

Artistically, Inu x Boku is going to blow absolutely nobody away. It's rather basic in every way and is starting to look a little dated as the years pass. That's not to say it's not acceptable, but it may look really old in a few years. The big win for Inu x Boku was the songs. I really liked the opening and the changing endings, it added an air of personality to each episode, which was refreshing. Outside of those things, nothing about Inu x Boku is a technical marvel, it's only acceptable at best.

Favorite Character: Kagerou Shoukiin

I was a hair away from saying that Karuta was my favorite, but I had to give it to my S&M dude. Honestly, his introductory episode was the funniest in the entire series, I was legit laughing out loud because of his antics. I aspire to go around labeling things as sadistic or masochistic now because of him.

To be clear, I did like some of the cast, even if it's not as many of them as I would have liked. Sorinozuka, or the scroll dude, was really funny as well, especially with his interactions with Nobara, his perverted, lesbian secret service agent. Nobara in general was a hilarious character. However, I cannot say that I loved the main two characters very much. They kind of felt as if someone was like, ""Hey, we have these two pieces of cardboard for main characters, so let's give them a personality."" and then they decided to make one piece of cardboard a self-pitying loli tsundere and the other an overly attached stalker. I felt zero connection to either of them throughout the entire series. Not once did I feel anything other than boredom when they came onto the screen. If you've followed my reviewing at all, you know I'm a huge shipper and this show didn't even make me bother with shipping characters, because they were so mediocre outside of a select few.

I don't even know if I'm disappointed by Inu x Boku or just relieved to be done with it. To make a confession, I was kind of half asleep for the last 3-4 episodes, if not even longer, so I may have missed out on the best the show had to offer. However, I feel as if that proves my point though. Inu x Boku couldn't even command enough of my attention for a single cour, that's how bland it is."
108617,"Are you tired of reading wall after wall of pretentious text?
Do you just want to know if you should watch the darn show?
Me too.

A heartwarming and emotionally powerful story about a father and daughter that doesn’t turn incestuous. The premise of “bring a child from point A to point B” is nothing new, but literally everything else is so damn good it doesn’t matter. I am convinced that this is a plot by the Japanese government to fix their declining birthrate. Watch this show.

The story is about a robotic golem trying to return an abandoned human girl he names Somali to her home. However, in this world, humans have been hunted almost to extinction. This presents two problems. One, it is hard to find a human settlement. Two, Somali is thought of as a delicacy by most of the creatures they meet. 

This is a mini-arc based/episodic show where the two main characters travel to different places that are loosely connected by the objective of “return the child”. Along the way, we also learn more about humans and why they almost went extinct. But the plot isn’t really relevant. Their journey is mainly used as an excuse to explore the father-daughter relationship between Somali and the golem, the relationships they make with those they meet along the way, and the different perspectives the different races/creatures have. 

This is gonna be a big section because the characters are a huge part of the show.

Usually, young children in anime are either really annoying or used as an overly cute plot device with no actual personality traits. Somali is neither of these things. She is one of the best depictions of a child I have seen. Somali is a perfect mix of curious, energetic, affectionate, innocent, cheeky, and wholesome. You can tell that she is sincere in everything she does and that she loves her oto-san (the golem) with her whole heart. Any time this adorable little goober does anything, it leaves me with the feeling of “damn, I kinda want to be a parent someday” and a stupid grin on my face. That feeling is only magnified by how endearing she manages to be in spite of the fact that she probably dies if a gust of wind blows her hood off and exposes that she's human.

Her dangerous situation also reveals a sadder, more realistic side to Somali. She has her own doubts and fears that I’m not going to get into because it would ruin some of the more emotional moments. Just know that she’s not on screen to be cheerful and adorable all the time. Below is a screenshot from the OP. I don’t know exactly how to explain it, but that one slightly sad yet geuninely happy smile manages to convey more about her than my paragraphs of text ever could.


The golem, being a golem, is pretty emotionless. But throughout the show we see him slowly develop the ability to feel. He gets attached to and protective of Somali, who he starts to see not as a mission objective, but as his daughter. In the later episodes, whenever Somali gets distracted and runs off somewhere, he calls her name with just the slightest hint of anxiety, and that slight hint has the same emotional weight as someone crying and screaming at the top of their lungs. The golem is actually a really good dad too. He lets Somali have her fun but makes her eat her vegetables. He regularly puts himself at risk protecting her from bad guys despite not being her actual dad, and stresses out when she gets sick. You know what the best part of him is though? He’s a huge tsundere. Whenever someone accuses him of growing attached to Somali, he responds with “golems do not feel emotion”. He doesn’t say “baka” though. 

The side characters are amazing. It has been a long time since I cared so much about side characters. They’re all unique. They’re all relevant to the story. They serve a thematic purpose. I actually care about what happens to them. I can’t say much without going into spoilers, but just know that the overwhelming majority of them are great. 


Are you tired of seeing this exact generic medieval fantasy town? (no spoilers)
!img300()!

I am, and so is Somali and the Forest Spirit. Locations are stunning and all of them are different. There’s desert towns in volcanoes, forests that look like something out of James Cameron’s Avatar, vast underground caverns, and more, each with their own flair. The world is filled to the brim with varied landscapes, tons of different creatures, and vibrant colours. It really feels like these characters are on a journey across an entire planet and that there’s way more to be explored than what is shown in the show. This town was the most generic and bland one I could find, and it’s probably better than 80% of fantasy towns.

I like the designs of Somali and the golem, but the creatures just look alright. The vast majority of them fall into the category of humans with animal heads and I would have preferred more creative designs. But there’s enough variety in the animal heads that I didn’t really mind too much. (also note the vibrant colours and unique looking town by the way) 


The animation is average at best, but there’s barely any action in this show so it’s not a huge deal. Sometimes, they do that thing where instead of animating a fight they just slightly vibrate a still image. All in all, animation and action scenes are not this show’s strong suit, and are bad for a show from 2020. 

Something else that disappointed me was the music. The OP, ED, and OST got the job done and weren’t bad by any means, but we all have that weeb music playlist and I just can’t see myself putting any of the songs on there. I’m usually a sucker for stuff sung by the voice actors and actresses but even that wasn’t enough to make the ED shine. 

Thankfully, the voice acting makes it so that I don’t have to give this section a rating of average. Whoever they cast to play Somali did a great job at portraying her energetic and charming personality while also nailing the super emotional moments. The actor for the golem was somehow able to convey emotion using a robotic voice, and I swear he slowly becomes more human sounding over the course of the show. 

Give this a shot if you're looking for a heartwarming and emotional story, or for something that might make you cry. 

If you’re into shows that are heavily character based and don’t mind not having an epic storyline, then check this out too. 

[Usagi Drop](https://anilist.co/anime/10162/Bunny-Drop/) is (probably) the most well known anime about a father-daughter relationship, and for good reason. It takes place in the real world and leans more towards iyashikei/slice of life than adventure/drama, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less emotionally impactful. Avoid the manga.

[Made In Abyss](https://anilist.co/anime/97986/Made-in-Abyss/) is about a deeply emotional journey in a super unique and hostile setting. It includes an unbreakable bond forming between a girl and a robot, but doesn’t deal with father-daughter relationships. It dips its toes into Lovecraftian horror and is darker in tone than Somali and the Forest Spirit.

Filled with endearing protagonists, great bonds, side characters worth caring about, a vibrant world, and a soundtrack that mostly just exists, Somali and the Forest Spirit has the ability to make me grin like a fool and cry in the fetal position in the same episode. As of the time of writing, it is the 439th most popular TV anime on Anilist. It is beaten in popularity by the smartphone isekai and I am angry about that. I have no clue why more people aren’t checking this out. I don’t want this anime to be a hidden gem. I want the whole world to know about this show. I want it to get the recognition it deserves."

I always give second chances to everything because I know that everything or everyone deserve a chance for redemption, there are those who fail and those who succeed and I especially love to see how someone or something can learn from the past mistakes and improve into something greater and better but without losing the original nature.
I don't watch many movies because I essentially hate watching 1hour and 30 minutes or 2 hours of a quickly made story that hardly can leave space for a bigger world characterization and better character, but this can only be me because I'm more used to series of many episodes, and hardly I find something that ends up liked by me; a little different story is for the movie episodes of a series because, despite what I said before, they are going eventually to get filled with the remaining episodes, in fact an example is the masterclass of the ""The Garden of Sinners"" movie series that started confused and I ended up loving it or even the Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel trilogy of movies that made me crazy even after playing the VN.
But what about Sword Art Online? SAO is massively full of flaws and we all know this and it can't be denied : boring arcs, fillers, some weak and random characters and many useless decisions in terms of story progress. But there was always that diamond piece in that garbage that was the absolutely insane and fantastic concept and starting point of the VRMMORPG, the literal game of Sword Art Online in Aincrad, and Progressive could be the good starting point of a remake of the story into something greater than the anime. I liked how Progressive actually had a different story from the anime and how it even improved from the original.
But was Progressive able to do so? To me, yes it did and I will bring you in this movie with me.

My first thought with this movie, my first impression, was a positive one because it started already with telling Asuna's background, because it was left quite empty in the anime, and showed us her family, her friends and the reason why she entered SAO; but what I think is the best part is the real reason why she started SAO : she wanted to play with her only friend at school, who also has some demons of the past, and I even more loved how it was displayed that Asuna was a true noob, unlike in the anime where she was a true god, and learned with time and hard work, and sometimes desperation.
The movie is in fact extremely human because it shows very specific situations and gives a human feedback that can be anger of being abandoned, fear of dying and not coming back, desperation to find a way to survive of the true happiness of eating something good after a long time; and all of this links the movie to becoming darker in terms of ambient because the dominant feeling for a big piece of the movie is the true desperation when you face the possibility to die, something that was present in the SAO anime but disappeared with time to leave gags and funny episodes, and all of this led to a really great character development for Asuna from being a scared puppy to reaching the alpha female, the restless solo player, and for once feeling free from what she was forced and expected to do, the absolute best of the class at school with the best grades of all because her family was expecting so. Related to this I found significant the dream of Asuna of being appreciated by her family but I will leave the full context to you.
I was surprised by how much Asuna was able to develop in the movie, like as I said from being a scared puppy to being the Asuna we know, and I liked even more how she approached every situation : in the anime I always saw Asuna as a fearless leader who was the dominant player since the first day and so I thought she faced every problem with ease, instead it was quite the opposite and she was always led by her emotions and never thought of her real needs like eating and sleeping, a desperate warrior trying to calm the anger, and being able to see a completely different character from what you were expecting is really sweet. And being able to forgive, I wasn't expecting that.

Talking about Mito, I liked her. Mito is a good addition to the story as a reason for Asuna to join the game and progress over time thanks to her help and Mito is what made me say ""this is a human SAO"" because essentially she is the incarnation of your average player : a bastard going after the loot, who likes to help the noob friends but scared of losing every progress and so will think about the own good to then regret it completely and look for being forgiven. Mito is really cool and gave to Asuna a reason to keep going and improving, and I love her character design.

But what about Kirito? I loved how he had a really small amount of time because this is not his anime, this is all about Asuna but at the same time I liked how he behaved when he had to be put in : never lost his temper, always cool and loyal to his original character, by any means the beater who wants to help the weak but doesn't really know how to do so. It was sweet to see scenes from the anime being reworked again and made even better when it came to Asuna and Kirito being in the same party and having to interact with each other.

One of the strongest points of Progressive can be even the comedy because here it's not too much or too little but it's the right amount at the right time unlike the original anime where a lot of filler episodes were made only for the comedy and completely forgot about the original story and themes. Progressive had few but really good comedy moments and I enjoyed every single bit of them. In fact I love how this movie stays loyal to what it wants to be and doesn't exaggerate with the stuff or simply doesn't go too much over the lines and keeps a good distance from the original work. Overall the story is really good paced and I didn't feel many forced decisions but instead a good storytelling for a movie.

But if I have to talk about some of the downs then I have to mention that some parts felt a little bit forced and I am not your biggest fan of time skips, but there are only 1 hour and 30 minutes of time to tell a story so I can easily let it slide, but overall I feel like every character had the fair amount of time in the movie.

I wasn't too surprised but the animations are amazing once again and they are smooth, clear, polished and essentially fun to watch and the fight scenes were, once again, absolutely fun to watch with few resting times and a lot of thrill. The details of the city environment are great once again and the general visual effects are again fun.
The music is again absolutely amazing thanks to that legend of Yuki Kajiura and I really want to give her immortality because her music is absolutely top of the class.



Because I see it as a massive improvement compared to the original Sword Art Online and Progressive has the chance to rewrite its story, more or less because you can't cancel what the original work is unfortunately, but if I had to rewatch something I would probably rewatch this because it was absolutely fun to watch.

1604,"Note:  It has been a year since I've last seen Reborn but I'll do my best bare with me. It's also my first review so I'll try my best. I will also try to make this review to be without spoilers or little to none.

I'll start off with this I'm a big Reborn fan I truly love this anime with all my heart. It's one of the first anime to start off with and yet I still love it. You can say this review is a bit more biased because of that but to me Reborn is an anime that will be on my top and will always be. I am currently writing this review in 2020, almost a whole decade since Reborn has ended, I truly hope you find this review helpful.

Now let's talk about the soundtrack I believe Reborn has some of the best openings and osts. I'm also writing this review as I'm listening to the op's on a loop. Even after rewatching it last year, I still think Reborn has some of the greatest ost's out there, I thought it brought so much more emphasis into the fights. Also another thing to include is the visuals for the op, we cannot forget about that, my all time favorite is Op 1 Version 2 but I do have to say Op 4 is quite a close contender. The endings are great too although I used to skip ed's I now listen to them and I do have to say that the ed's aren't as good as the op's. However, some are still great in my opinion and not to mention that I can listen to the soundtrack's for hours and hours without getting bored of it. 

Reborn has such unique characters to the show and how they develop is great. Tsuna before meeting Reborn, was called No Good Tsuna, for being bad at almost everything, but as we go on to the series Tsuna still has his lighthearted personality. However, we see in the anime he has a sort of seriousness to him, he know's when the situation is dire and will focus on protecting the people he cares about. Gokudera at first, he was a character that hated Tsuna, I believe it was because of him being the future boss of the Vongola and how spineless he was. Gokudera at first tries to kill him, but he sees his wrongdoing and instead decides to follow Tsuna. Calling himself his Right Hand Man. I introduce Yamamoto, in the anime he is introduced as a light hearted person with a fun personality that follows along Tsuna to have fun. Later we get to see Yamamoto more serious in later arcs, he tries his best to train his capabilities perfecting his style of fighting. Ryohei Sasegawa, the older brother of Tsuna's love interest Kyoko Sasegawa. His signature line TO THE EXTRME! is a favorite of mine in this series. He's introduced as a guy that tries to recruit Tsuna to the Boxing Club after he goes Dying Will Mode. but Tsuna rejects him. We later see that Ryohei is a caring person that loves his sister and wishes to protect her from danger. We also see in him that he is much more serious and more cautious in another arc. Hibari, The Strongest Vongola Guardian, we're introduced to him in the Daily Life arc where he has a disciplinary committee that he runs. Hibari's character is someone that cares about the people around him but he doesn't show it as much. We see that he really enjoys fighting strong opponents and likes to use his signature line to threaten people I'lll bite you to death. Lambo as a character is just there for comedic relief most of the time, his resolve changes over time, but at first most see Lambo has an annoying character. 

The story is also very unique considering a professional hitman comes to suddenly tutor a useless middle schooler that goes by the name Tsunayoshi Sawada. We get to see Reborn, tutor Tsuna whether it be over school or in fighting. We get to see the dynamic between Tsuna and Reborn over the series even the ending of the manga shows how they've grown. Tsuna's dynamic with his family (aka friends) shows a light mood, but as we go on to the series it's changed into a serious mood where they fight with their life on the line or something important to them. All the arcs from Reborn bring enjoyment to you whether it be the Daily Life arc, Kokuyo arc, Varia arc, and the Future arc they're all unique in their own ways. It brings such that Reborn doesn't get tiring with how unique the story is and bringing in a fresh concept for each arc instead of reusing things.

The art for Reborn isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad. However, once you bring animation to the story, Reborn for it's time has some great animation for it's fights. To me the animation doesn't feel stale or jagged it just improves or stay the same. How they animate the X-burner and the Dying Will Zero Point Breakthrough is quite amazing. 

The enjoyment I felt from Reborn was just a 10/10 some scenes are breathtaking. To me it was a show that was perfect with little to no flaws. From how characters develop to the conflict of the story is just amazing in my opinion. Writing this review in August of 2020 I may rewatch Reborn for my second time when I have summer vacation, but just go watch it. It's such a great show."

""Do you regret giving up potentially your only chance to be freed of your burdens?""
 Demon Queen Echidna

On the journey to figure out the answer to one of life's longest-asked questions, I found myself on a different journey all together. A journey following the hero Leo, not on a quest to find out how long it takes for a hero to become a villain, but instead, the villain becoming the hero.

img()

Obviously, this isn't completely true. I'm Quitting Heroing, translated from the Japanese title ""Yuusha, Yamemasu"", is, in fact, a story about learning how long it takes for a hero to become the villain, there's no way around that. However, the reason I say what I say is because that's not the only story being told. The hero, Leo, isn't our only protagonist after all, and it's here we find a different story - the story of the villain becoming the hero. 

Before I get too far in to this review, I'm going to warn you all now, I'm going to ask a lot of rhetorical questions and say things that are meant to make you think about themes, rather than speaking clearly about the series, so I hope you get where I'm coming from. I'm writing this review like this, because as I watched this series, that's simply how I was thinking. I would ask myself questions like the ones I'm about to ask you, trying to decipher what the answer may be to a riddle with no solution. This review also might not be reminiscent of my others, as unlike those shows that made me emotionally-driven to write about them, this series simply made me think. Now, about those questions, allow me to hand out the forms.

img()

In a story like this, there's so many questions that float around where the answers are so paper thin and loose that it's as if they don't exist in the first place. Morals, religion, etc. It's questions that can be influenced by things like this that never seem to find an objective answer. For example, if I asked ""Is a hero good?"", do you believe there to be an answer? How about this - ""If a human hero fights back a demon army, are they a savior?"" The easy answer is just to say yes. If they saved the world, then they must be a savior after all... but, what if the hero invaded the demon realm to do it? A demon realm full of creatures that had their own lives, just like us, suddenly taken away by a ""hero"" who wanted to protect humanity. If these demons step up to try to stop the hero, are they the heroes now, or are they still monsters?

This question seems as easily answered as saying “well, that depends if you’re a human or a demon”, but why is that? Can’t a human feel remorse for the demons who are getting killed by this hero? Can’t a demon feel guilt for whatever reason it may be that a hero is trying to kill them? It’s never a matter of which side you’re on, nor what specie you are, but simply what you think. Humanity and demon kind don’t matter in the slightest, since this answer comes down to you, as a single person, deciding what you think is the morally correct truth. ""If demons invade the human world and kill them, they’re monsters, but if a human invaded the demon world and kills them, are they a hero?"" Questions like these can only be answered by one person. You. 

I'm Quitting Heroing doesn't constantly explore these themes, of course. Earlier on in the series, it's a more episodic tale of the hero choosing against humanity and going to help the demon army. He helps the remaining subjects of the demon kingdom with their menial tasks and works to gain favor towards the demon queen. It's a simple, but charming premise, at the very least, so I never disliked watching this series even if it was nothing special. However, the show really took a turn atop a peak.

img()

If you were born for just one purpose, one purpose that defined your whole existence, and suddenly, after living your life for that one reason, you're told that you don't have to do it anymore, what would you do? Could you live a new life without being relied on for that one reason, or would you make sure you always have a purpose?  Well, late on in the series, Leo decides to become the villain. That's his answer to this question. If the humans don't need him anymore, he will make them need him. He will save the world, even if it means destroying it first - and the only ones able to stop this ""hero"" who has protected humanity for thousands of years is... the demon queen and her generals. Suddenly, the demon army is fighting to save the humans while the human hero is fighting to destroy them all. Suddenly, that question I came in to this series searching for an answer to was right in front of me... and suddenly I realized... Heroes don't become villains. They don't become villains because they've always been the villain. It's the only choice they ever had. 

It's... depressing. The last few episodes of this series show a hero who defended humans for thousands of years suddenly try to destroy them, while these ""monsters"" to the human race break down, cry, and fall apart while trying to stop him. It's like everything you've ever known got turned upside down and suddenly you have no idea what to think or who you're supposed to side with. 

img()

The series does end on a lighter note atleast. Leo is defeated, but isn't killed, because in the end, he only did any of this to prove to himself that the world truly didn't need him anymore... and it doesn't. Not his world anyway. Spared by the demon lord and her generals, he joins them in trying to not only protect the human world now but also the demon world - to create a world where they can both live in harmony so another hero is never needed.

While I'm happy with this ending, I haven't stopped thinking about the questions I asked myself through the series though. I could've focused this review more on the characters like Lily, the cute wolf girl who adores Leo and is the first one to really break down when Leo decides on dying, Melnes, the assassin who truly wanted to destroy humanity for what they did to him, or even Echidna, the demon queen who only wanted to make a better world for the demons without ever harming the human world. I could talk more about Leo and his journey, how he's lived and grown for 3,000 years, only knowing one thing the entire time he's ever existed - protecting humanity. I'm sure I could talk about more and give a well and honest review about this series. However, I chose not to.


I believe this to be the real review I wanted to write after all. A review where I simply put these thoughts down on a page and asked them to others who will take the time to think on them. If you want to know about the characters or the story, the show is available to you, but I wanted to get these questions out there even to those who choose not to watch it. Why? I guess I just think they're fun to think about. Important? Maybe not. But definitely fun. Just like this series.

It’s never good to start this sort of thing off with a negative, so I will say, before I begin in earnest, that Blood-C is far from the worst anime I’ve ever seen (that title probably still goes to  the sole episode I’ve watched of Modern Magic Made Simple), nor the worst I’ve ever completed (Occult Academy’s final act is far more insulting and the film Expelled From Paradise is much more boring). With that out of the way, I should note though, that Blood-C takes an earnest swing at being among the most pointless.

The core concept of Blood-C isn’t hard to grasp. Our protagonist is Saya, a high schooler who is also a miko who, at night, defends her town from vicious demons called Elder Bairns with the help of a sacred katana and her own ability to heal quickly. 

img880()

This simple premise is an iteration of among the oldest stories in fiction--protagonist with special abilities slays wicked monsters--and it’s really, genuinely quite hard to screw this up. A better series, even if it were not exactly transcendent, would milk this setup for all the pulpy action that it’s worth. Indeed, the first few episodes are promising on that front. After sitting through about 15 minutes of the world’s dullest high school life anime, the first few episodes conclude with Saya fighting a Bairn. These scenes are, from the series’ start to its end, the major highlights. The fights are (with one exception), universally well-choreographed and animated, the earlier ones especially might remind watchers of the video game Bloodborne and if the show had stuck to this formula throughout, it might not’ve ever become great exactly, but it probably would’ve at least remained fun.

Blood-C’s idea of raising the stakes is where the real problems start to arise. About halfway through the series, the first named character (Nene, one of Saya’s classmates along with her twin Nono) bites the bullet by having her head quite messily chomped off by a Bairn. This starts an escalation of sorts, where the series seems to confuse intensity with bodycount. What starts as initially shocking and frightening quickly becomes merely gross, then dull, then outright boring. By the time a squadron of dividing bunny demons show up in the series’ final episode, you’re more likely to sigh than be revolted when one of them grabs a gaggle of townspeople, puts them in a giant sack, and blends them with an eggbeater. It’s nauseating sure, but given enough exposure the human brain will get sick of just about anything, and that’s as true of the countless gory (and in one of the series’ more unpleasant fixations, vory) deaths here as anything else.

If the problem was merely that the series didn’t know when the chain of messy gruesomeness became too much, it might be a glaring flaw in an otherwise good show. Unfortunately, it marries that problem to an equally large one, which is that aside from Saya herself, who is a cool protagonist if not an especially layered or thoughtfully-written one, it is difficult to impossible to care about pretty much any of the other characters. So, while it’s shocking when Nene gets her head chomped off, it’s not uspetting because it’s Nene specifically, it’s just a swerve. Similarly, in a later episode when a giant frog-crab-spider Bairn murders the vast majority of Saya’s other classmates, it’s really quite hard to care. It becomes obvious before too long that this is a show that equates bodycount with meaningful narrative development, which is a mistake that can pretty much cripple any attempt at serious storytelling.

img880()

And goodness, does it make a genuine attempt at squeezing something resembling an interesting twist into its final two episodes. So it turns out that the entire town that Saya lives in--including her own father--are a manufactured “game” controlled by a vaguely-motivated villain to test her, Or Something, explanations are offered but they’re hazy, and even if they weren’t, this twist (which I am sure is intended to be super shocking) comes in as mentioned, at the tenth episode out of twelve. Even if this was an attempt to take the series in some other direction, it is by that point too late for it to matter much. Sadly though, it’s not even that, as the whole “it was all an experiment!” shtick mostly serves as an excuse to cheat all the named characters that had previously died on-screen back to life with very little attempt at justifying said happening, and then to kill all of them again. Exactly three named characters make it out of this series alive; Saya herself, the man who runs the cafe` she eats at every day before school (who turns out to be the mastermind behind it all. Of course), and one of her classmates who turns out to be a woman in her 30s playing at being a high schooler, and has possibly the least personality out of anyone in the core cast.

To be sure there is detail that could be gone into other than what I’ve covered here but, there’s really no point. Blood-C is a thoughtlessly-written series that tries desperately to impress you with its bodycount and willingness to show blood, guts, brain matter, and in one deeply unpleasant instance, maggots, splattered all over the settings and the protagonist. Unfortunately; it’s a pointless enough exercise that the main thoughts I came away from the show with were that Saya deserves a better anime to cut up demons in, and that at least the fight sequences were pretty good. It’s ultimately a pretty iffy way to burn six hours, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to much of anyone, unless they’re a truly diehard fan of the larger Blood metaseries of which this is a part. Even then, sister series Blood+ seems to be more well-regarded. At the end of it all, the prevailing feeling one gets with Blood-C is that nothing that happened in it actually mattered at all, which is really not what you want to leave your audience walking away thinking.

PLEASE NOTE THAT MY REVIEW CONTAIN MINOR (Okay, MAJOR) SPOILER



Indeed, the title has given you a big hint on what the anime is going to be about but it's not all about running. There is more than to just running. 

The anime centers around Hakone Ekiden, a university relay marathon race that exists in real which is held annually between January 2 and January 3. 

The animation is awesome and the pace of the story is steady, plus it flows nicely. The story may be a little slow in the beginning but I honestly feel that none of those moments are wasted and in fact, are needed in order to understand the ending better. 

From having to persuading the members to run the marathon to learning about the members' strengths and weaknesses to daily practices to attending qualifiers and lastly the marathon itself, the anime has shown us their determination, teamwork and friendship which leads them to completing the marathon. It was only a person's goal to run in the Hakone Ekiden in the beginning of the series but it became 10 people's goal to complete the Hakone Ekiden at the end.

However, I feel that we are only scratching the surface when it comes to character developments. Well, it might be hard to throw in the story and full character developments when there are only 23 episodes with 10 important characters. Despite that, I like all the 10 unique characters in the team and I am glad that we managed to see them grow mentally and physically. On a side note, I’m really glad that we get to see their inner thoughts when they were running on their allocated section during the marathon that helps to build up towards the ending. That part sticks with me the most for some reason.

Oh, and did I mention that I really love the ending?! <3  I really like how the ending is concluded but one, just one questions that has not been answered. Musa, can you tell us is it Jota or Joji? 

I have to say this because Haiji Kiyose is definitely one of the best leader I have seen in anime! He cares a lot about his teammates, encourage them, giving advice and even cook for them despite having his own problems to deal with. I'm glad that none of the members gave up and Haiji gets to have his dream fulfilled :) 

Of course, Kakeru Kurahara is one of the person who is gifted in running but that doesn't mean that the rest cannot compete in the marathon. Every one of them is important and there is no way Kakeru can win the race without his team, which I'm glad that this is also emphasized in the story.

Thank you Haiji, for giving Nico-senpai, King, Yuki, Shindo, Musa, Prince, Jota, Joji and Kakeru a chance to participate in this marathon and for teaching us that there is more to than just running :)

Not so related to the story/characters but I really love the two ending songs 'Reset' & 'Michi' by Taichi Mukai. It fits well with the series and I see myself listening to these songs quite often for a period of time.

And to end this lengthy review,

I did not expect to see an instalment of the Goblin Slayer franchise that is even lazier and more devoid of life than the TV series, yet here we are; witnessing a movie that begins with an approximately 25-minute recap combined with a voice-over narration from one of the characters. Of course, the scenes this movie decided to show us once again are only the most crucial moments, like the infamous rape scene from the first episode, [the Elf character](https://anilist.co/character/126457/Yousei-Yunde) almost being raped, and [Priestess](https://anilist.co/character/126483/Onna-Shinkan) lying naked beside [Goblin Slayer](https://anilist.co/character/126458/Goblin-Slayer). I am sincerely thankful for bestowing on me the opportunity to see these scenes for a second time. Without the said summary, I would unquestionably forget what every female character in this series boils down to; tits and rape. The movie reminds me of that yet again, merely 5 minutes after the recap, by implementing a tedious bath scene. Yeah.

As this instalment labels itself as a movie, I was eager to see improvements in the production values, yet, to my immediate realisation, there is no positive change to be found here. [In my write-up of the original](https://anilist.co/review/4517), I was a tad lenient on the art style in comparison to others though showed my immense disdain regarding the CGI, to sort of balance things out. Goblin's Crown suffers from the same issues as far as the visuals go, and that is all I can say about that. There was and still is no personality or uniqueness when it comes to the art style, and the CGI is as wretched as ever. We can quickly spot it whenever an action scene takes place, and be delighted by the sight of appalling animation, horrendous camera movements and uninspired colour pallet. Naturally, Goblin Slayer still looks like a walking-talking trash bin whenever he is on the screen. He and various goblins effectively ruin anything resembling tension or excitement with their horrendous CGI bodies, armour pieces and blood. Lovely.

The same absence of development applies to the cast. Over the course of 60 minutes, we learn nothing extra about the main characters, and we meet new folks who are either killed on the spot for the sweet shock value or given the most basic personality and purposes. Ah yes, there is nothing more satisfying than seeing an individual whose entire character amounts to having flashbacks and mental breakdowns so unconvincing, that it is unbearable to watch. For instance, at one moment [the main new girl](https://anilist.co/character/188204/Reijou-Kenshi) remembers all the nasty and deplorable stuff that happened to her, and a second later she is all good because Goblin Slayer muttered something about killing every single goblin. So motivational! In the bargain, we can sum up the plot of Goblin's Crown in one, compact sentence. Find the girl, dump irrelevant exposition about a God of some sort on the viewer's head, show raped women, kill goblins and jerk off to the Goblin Slayer's amazingness. It is that simple, yet has as much entertainment value as a funeral.

And you know what? It ultimately does not matter. As much as I loathe the TV series, at the very least it knew how to hold my attention and maintain my interest in it. This movie, on the other hand, feels like something so insignificant and meaningless, I was bored to tears through and through. It made me bloody exhausted, and that is all there is to it.

〈 ...is somehow even more boring. 〉"
130586,"The greatest ""demon lord"" was reborn as the greatest human. This anime looked interesting at first glance but became boring after the time skipped into high school.
When I rate an anime, I take five categories into consideration: sound/music, visuals, characters, story, and ending. The sound, visuals, opening, and ending are all good.
Ard is the main character of the anime. Ard doesn't change when he reincarnates, and he keeps all of his powers. !His status as a typical nobody is quickly dissipated. His main conflict is his regret that he couldn't save Lydia.! Ard is an interesting character, but the people around him determine whether the anime as a whole is interesting.
Ireena is a character that quickly grew annoying. !She has two semi-conflicts over the anime. The first conflict she has is with her lineage as it causes her to be bullied. We don't really see this, but it is apparently solved simply by Ard following her around and persisting in his attempts to become her friend. The second conflict is how she carries the blood of the evil gods, but Ard doesn't care about that so it's solved within a minute. These conflicts don't make Ireena interesting because they don't create any tension between the characters and are solved half-hazardly.!
Ginny is worse than Ireena. !Her only conflict was her lack of confidence which was built up over many years and was immediately solved within one or more days. Over the course of the anime, Ginny becomes extremely bold, which is unbelievable considering her extreme lack of confidence earlier. On an additional note, the way Ard, Ireena, and Ginny speak is extremely annoying, but that's just a subjective opinion. There is another problem with Ireena and Ginny that I will talk about in the story category.!
!Olivia isn't very interesting herself, but the way she comes close to realizing that Ard is the demon lord is an interesting dynamic. Sylphy has her obsession with Lydia, but that's about it. Lydia's personality surprised me, but she doesn't really have any conflicts. Despite all of this, they are more interesting around Ard than Ireena and Ginny.!
!This is because of power dynamics. The story in this anime varies from terrible to good, and that all depends on who's around Ard. The first main arc in the story is the frenzied dragon king's attack, and it could've been solved so easily if Ard had just taken out all of the small fry demons instantly. The second main arc occurs because of a lack of communication, but it wasn't that bad. The duel between Olivia and Ard was disappointing because it could've been cool to watch. The last arc revolves around the past, and it's the best arc of the series. This is because, for once, the enemy is formidable. The problem with Ireena and Ginny is the fact that they are so weak. Ireena and Ginny talk about this briefly in the last episode, and their answer is to not give up. This doesn't fix the problem. Because of this gap in power, the enemies are weakened or we have to rehash the save your friends trope. We don't have to do this with Ard's old colleagues, and it makes them more interesting to interact with.! 
The ending was pretty good. !It did a good job settling the matter between the two ""Demon Lords."" I wish the fight between Ard and himself included more magic considering that's what they specialize in, but that's only a minor complaint.! I don't need a season two, but if one comes along, I'll watch it."
132474,"I’m catching up to Overlord as I write this review, and yup, this show is indeed a Walmart Overlord. Arc is basically Ainz but nicer, and Arc is overpowered as well. The cast isn’t too big, as it’s only Arc, Ariane, Chiyome, and Ponta basically, the other characters are so insignificant they might as well be specks in the wind. I enjoyed this series at first, but then it got rather repetitive as it’s mostly just saving various groups of people, usually elves, and that got dry rather quickly.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 11/25

Another typical isekai where the protagonist is overpowered and there is little to no reference to the person in the real world. Just your typical protagonist that goes around saving various people, and of course there are some companions like Ariane and Chiyome that also don’t have much of a distinct personality. The story is quite repetitive in that Arc gets hired by people to rescue their tribes, or to help them with a “quest”.

The politics… I did not care one bit about the politics because it was all dialogue and little to no action. In fact, I barely remember what the politics are since the world building was so minimal.

ART: 6.5/10

The fight scenes are cool sometimes, and the animation is ok, but there are too many still frames in fights, and that’s too bad. Guess the budget wasn’t that big.

MUSIC: 8.3/10

The music is solid, and what I really liked was the ending theme but DIALOGUE+, one of my favourite endings of the season.

CHARACTERS: 10/20

The characters are fun to watch, as the interactions are enjoyable, but they don’t have enough personality to keep me completely invested. Arc is kind of like Ainz from Overlord as he has his “knight voice”, and his inner voice that is more like a normal person. Ariane is fun to watch but also has little to no personality. The other characters have the same issues, as they’re just not memorable, and because they aren’t memorable, I barely have anything to say. They’re just fine, there’s nothing wrong with them, they’re just boring at times to watch.

The villains are your typical clueless villains that aren’t that smart, and aren’t very engaging to watch. Arc, Ariane, and Chiyome usually finish them off in a matter of minutes.

ENJOYMENT: 9.7/15

It was exciting enough at the beginning, but fell off as it got repetitive.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 11/20

The world building wasn’t too good, so all the political themes weren’t executed very well. The comedic themes are solid, and they make the series somewhat fun, the fight sequences are a bit unfocused as it just seems like the characters are having fun, rather than committing to fighting the enemy, it just seems quite casual.

OVERALL: 56.5/100

A rather repetitive plot with a lot of rescuing, mixed with comedy, and a more “nice” Ainz. The start of the show was promising, but the repetitive and uninspiring plot lines, it became somewhat dull near the end. Yet another average isekai, with its ups and downs."
21676,"Remember DanMachi? That show that everyone loved because of the boob strings? Well it's back, this time without (much) Hestia and Bell, slotting them out for over-popular kuudere Ais and a new character, Lefiya. The story follows the same timeline as the original show, just from Ais' point of view rather than Bell's, hence the show's status as a ""spin-off"" of the core series. The question that everyone is looking for the answer to: is a lack of Hestia and yuri undertones enough to save such a intellectually bankrupt and boring concept? Well, it's definitely not, but it's thankfully somehow more palatable than its parent.

For all intents and purposes, Lefiya is equally the main character of the series with Ais herself. Most of the plot of the show centers on Lefiya's (seemingly sexual) interest in Ais and becoming stronger in order to support both her and her familia, which take the place of all of the original DanMachi's cringe-inducing Hestia fanservice moments. This the largest (and I'd really argue ONLY) reason why this spin-off is better than the original, as our slotted-out cast is simply more compelling. The Loki familia in general is more interesting than Hestia's, as it actually has members and relationships, even if those relationships are incredibly canned and trite. Lefiya, despite having the same drive as Bell (""I love Ais""), is more interesting simply because of the fact that she doesn't wholly break the rules like he does, and is a ""support-based class"" rather than a dagger-touting everyman. The actual plot is the same sort of ""the monsters were smart and had a plan all along"" bullshit, but has more actual information than the original telling of the story, so it's far more interesting to follow and I could totally see someone who is really bought in to this world really enjoying it. To the rest of us, it's a pretty stereotypical anime plot.

Aesthetically this series is pretty much identical to the original. Good, but not great, and carried by character design like every other harem fantasy series. We do get some good animation when Ais is fighting, but also a lot of straight re-used animation from the original when Bell's and Ais' points-of-view cross. Music is incredibly forgettable to downright bad, as is most of the VA. Fans of DanMachi are really only here for one thing though, so if you were worried about the girls not looking cute, fret not. With that in mind, I guess Sword Oratoria fulfills it's aesthetic expectations.

For the life of me, I just can't get why they didn't just move forward with the original story. It's not like Hestia and Bell weren't a popular duo, because they were despite Hestia being one of the worst harem characters in recent memory. Going back to do a spin-off an entire year after your successful series seems to be either an admission of money-grabbing, requiring minimal actual writing, or just a lack of confidence in the actual material that comes later, which is also very likely given the objective quality of DanMachi as an IP. Fans of DanMachi are going to have plenty to like here, but it's really only a minor patch to an otherwise forgettable soft-isekai crank-out."
136934,"My Stepmom's Daughter is My Ex is a absolute shockingly mid anime about 2 ""step siblings"" if you even call them that that were the year before boyfriend and girlfriend and their relationship kinda hit at home with me which is saying that their relationship was pretty embarrassing and pathetic, and these 2 still try and cling on to their previous relationship they had while they are siblings which turn some scenes turning pretty weird and uncomfortable to watch myself but i can see how some people like this anime but its personally not for me.

img()

honestly this anime doesn't have a lot going for itself it like most of the episodes feel kind of repetitive with their flashbacks with ""back in junior high i had a thing that most people call a boyfriend/girlfriend"" type bs and with those flash backs being pretty pathetic and not a lot being shown in those 
flashbacks.

img(

the setting and the plot of the show is just all over the place and not in a good way like just watching this anime was great sleeping material tbh i couldn't sit through an episode with exiting out and watching youtube for half and hour before continuing then realizing clicking back on it was a bad idea. but this anime's story just gets a bit off track sometimes and some scenes seem a bit unnecessary and repetitive like the flash backs and scenes of Ayai crying and obsessing over Mizuto which feels like they had nothing else to write about and wanted to drag this story to 12 episodes.

img()

The Characters are even worse like the only good character in the show was Ayai because she got some character development and grew up during the show and the rest of them kind of were there lurking around being annoying and painful to listen to like Kawanami was such a useless character in the story and had no purpose of solely known for being that guy who was Mizuto's ""friend"" kind of and being a weirdo.

honestly if your trying to get into anime i recommending not to watch this because story is a little weird if your not the type of person to watch anime and the plot gets a bit confusing and shaky in some areas but if you are the type of person who likes a good romance anime and can get into this type of thing then go ahead and watch this. but this anime is personally not for me because of its crappy features"
3002,"This anime is relentless, not even letting you breathe for a second while still throwing everything it has against you. Not only do the side characters progress well, focussing on how gambling can cause the darkest human traits to surface when under enough pressure, but the main character's progression from an impressionable yet hopeless lowlife to a man driven to the edge, only determined to push on because he has nothing else to lose helps to constantly drive the series forward amongst all the chaos. 

The show has a slow start, but quickly picks up the pace and never stops. The gambles and the stakes escalate very quickly and you are left gripping your chair as you wait for the next episode to load. The only breaks you get are at the start and after the first arc. The reason this anime does such a good job at building tension is because it constantly reminds the audience of the stakes and whether it's constant cuts of the time limit or a sweeping shot of the danger that threatens the character's lives, the audience really gets a taste of what kind of peril the characters are in. Even though money is the main prize that most of the characters are aiming for and are motivated by, they are constantly questioned to weigh the life of one another against said money. Kaiji's morals constantly flip as the series goes on because of the gambles that he finds himself in, whether he should dive into his inner demon or try to keep sane by upholding his humanity. Also, seeing the constant changes in the side characters really help to illustrate the strain and pressure they are in, though sometimes the characters aren't really justified in how they change like this. Sometimes it's hard to believe Kaiji is such a genius and is so determined to win considering that he started the show as a lowlife with nothing really to lose. But, it works well enough that I can shelf my disbelief for most of the show. 

The gambles themselves and the games that the characters have to participate in are really pushed to their limits, with the anime exploring every possible facet of the game including cheating. The fact that cheating is used alone helps to push the boundary of the games that are played and they are done quite cleverly, apart from the simplicity of the final game that Kaiji plays against Hyoudou, the mastermind behind all the sick games. This entire underground gambling world and hierarchy are explored very lightly, but I think it hits pretty well when the characters turn out to be the things that people are gambling on. 

Admittedly, the artstyle will drive many people away from the series despite it suiting the dark tone of the series because of how the unique face shapes allow the anime to express the very twisted expressions needed to sell the dire situations of the characters. The way the faces contort and bend to the will of the animators help in emphasising the desperation, which is important considering the stakes that the characters are pit up against. In terms of imagery, I thought that this series would be kind of boring because even though the games are ridiculous, it would be pretty hard to entertain an audience with that alone. The imagery is simple, but because of the crazy artstyle the series manages to use the imagery to enhance the tense moments for the most part, though most of the actual imagery and what they mean is a bit too simple. 

The narrator in my opinion is the most distracting element of the show, and so are some of the inner monologues of some of the side characters. Though the narrator is necessary to explain the rules and establish some of the inner workings of the games to the audience, he repeats himself way too much and as an audience member I feel a bit insulted. Sometimes the show really does respect your intelligence, and then the narrator just adds a layer of unnecessary fat on top, essentially negating how the show actually respected your intelligence. However, the show does show moments of brilliance in terms of perspective and inner monologues especially in the most climactic moments. The show usually shifts the perspective from Kaiji to the other character that he is dueling, making it a lot more tense since the audience is forced in a position to second-guess what Kaiji is thinking and what he concludes to be the correct decision. These moments to me are the best parts of the show because it causes the audience to actually think about what actions will have what repercussions by disecting the mind of the character that we spend the most time with."
118419,"I probably should have noticed from a mile away. Its interesting premise of a mysterious girl followed by slice of life episodic episodes until its big twist and pandering for a few episodes until the story gets wrapped up quickly to its “emotional end.” But instead of an enjoyable experience, all you get is a bad taste in your mouth because you realize, what was the point of this show?

Oh, is this another Charlotte?

This was probably the one show that I REALLY wanted to like this season, and at the same time, the largest disappointment this season. Everyone already knows the creator behind this anime, Jun Maeda, his other works such as Clannad, Angel Beats!, and Charlotte, and even the formula he uses to create his material: the first half of a show is to introduce the characters, the premise, and exploring the premise in interesting ways. Then in the second half pull off its twist and end with its climax scene to get the audience emotionally invested into the show. 

Even though this worked for shows like Clannad and Angel Beats! because of the setting and slowly builds up the setting over time with a natural progression into its twist, for shows like Charlotte and his newest work, Kamisama ni Natta Hi, or, The Day I Became A God, doesn’t have this clear “natural progression” and forcibly takes us from the first half of the show into the second half of the show while interesting characters lose their initial traits and ends with a poorly executed twist because of how poorly the buildup to that climax was written.

As said before, the first half of the show is dedicated to introducing all its characters, explaining the premise, and exploring the premise in new and interesting ways. 

To start off with Kamisama, the premise is nothing we haven’t seen before. We get introduced to our generic protagonist boy who acts as our stand-in character and our mysterious girl, in this case, Hina Sato, a self-proclaimed God “Odin.” And this mysterious girl, just like other mysterious girls we’ve seen in other anime, has the supernatural power of predicting pretty much anything correctly. We follow their two adventures with other introduced characters such as the boy’s childhood friend, his crush, his little sister, some horny TV host, but more interestingly, Hacker.

But unlike Maeda’s other works where even the episodic nature of the first half of the show was interesting and brought up interesting points about its premise (even if one of the shows, Charlotte, pulls off its awkward twist that disregards the first half of the show), Kamisama had almost none of that, and at times, the episodic plot doesn’t align correctly with its premise.

Even if some of the episodics were somewhat entertaining and stupidly hilarious at the same time, such as the beginning episode with the horseracing and the shogi episode, the one episode, and probably the most “popular” episodic, that didn’t make sense was the sixth episode where we get the protagonist’s crush and she manages to make contact with her mother through some makeshift telephone that has access to the afterlife and ends with a discount Violet Evergarden episode where the father and the daughter get together and watch a series of video tapes at certain times as a “farewell” message before she passes away.

At this point of the show, we should already be convinced that Hina definitely has some supernatural powers and can even be considered to be a “god” because this is utterly impossible because it surpasses the realm of possibility. However, we learn later on with the show’s “twist” that she was just sick and her grandfather implemented a supercomputer that allows her to make insane calculations in her head. Although the horseracing episode and the shogi episode make sense because they have bases in statistical probability and calculations, this doesn’t make sense. No supercomputer, no matter how powerful, can contact the dead.  And if the writers expect me to believe that this was a “super-duper” powerful supercomputer that can do anything, oh please, there’s better plot consistency in The God of High School because at least I’m expecting everyone to have supernatural powers even though it’s not explained at all.

Even though the first half of the show was very hit or miss because of its plot consistency and its general entertainment value, in Maeda fashion, everything falls apart in the second half of the show. Our “big twist” is that Hina was suffering from a deadly terminal illness and her grandfather implemented a supercomputer inside her to keep her alive. A large corporation soon learned of this technology in Hina’s brain and decided to capture her and surgically remove the computer into her brain. The protagonist tries to open up to her and finally does in its “emotional end” bada-bing bada boom the end. 

Although I’ll appreciate the transition was a little smoother than Charlotte’s transition (but is that even an achievement?) because we get a few episodes revealing Hina’s secret, the worst part was that all the characters, in true Maeda fashion, lose all their character traits and plot relevancy in the second half of the show minus the protagonist and Hina. The supporting cast are all irrelevant to the point of calling the protagonist at the end to supporting cheers of “never give up!” and “please bring back Hina!” 

But probably the worst of them all is the most promising character of the bunch, Hacker. He was introduced as almost a “rival” to Hina and his small bits at the end of each episode we learn that he is a genius and a supercomputer himself, just not as powerful as Hina. He spends time trying to discover the grandfather’s secret and his work and discovers Hina and her powers. But at the end, all we get is a sob-story of how he was mistreated and abused as a kid and ended up simply being a stepping stone for the protagonist to go meet Hina in the hospital. After that, he loses all plot relevancy and we never see him again.

Even the protagonist himself ends up becoming really annoying during his hospital stay as he tries to “open up” to Hina. He never learns or accepts that Hina is in a terrible mental state because he keeps physically harassing her and yelling at her to do something that ends up with Hina screaming for help. Like please, someone told you that she distrusts men now because of her mental state, so why are you attacking her and trying to force yourself onto her while she clearly doesn’t remember who you are?
In the end, Kamisama ended up being another tragically painful work from Jin Maeda and P.A Works. Although it had spectacular visual art and animation that rivals any other P.A Works anime to date, along with its great audio design to try to make the emotional scenes impactful, overall, this show was a mess from start to finish with its contradictory plot holes, painful characters, and a painfully obvious climax given Maeda’s other works. 

I’m honestly a fan of this kind of formulaic writing because it can bring some truly impactful moments with its climax, but Maeda missed yet again with Kamisama. Hopefully he will bring his A-game in his next work and give us something that will truly be an unforgettable experience."
126659,"The third film for the ever growing MHA franchise, following on from Two Heroes (exceedingly mediocre imo) and Heroes Rising (much more fun, great action) comes World Heroes' Mission, a globetrotting adventure that pitches our budding heroes against a terrorist organisation based across the world.

[Spoilers from the start]

 It must be said the first thing that struck me about this film, is that for something called 'World Heroes' Mission' there's an almost total lack of heroes from across the world, instead all the work being done by the same Japanese heroes we already know, with a few generic superhero type presumably local people visible in the background at times. I get that people want to see the characters they know and like, but it feels like a missed opportunity to design some fun new heroes (we do get one local hero, an Egyptian who's literally a hyroglyph pharaoh...). Oh and also presumably to avoid offending anyone at all the main story is set on a large island just off the coast of Spain that's magically popped up, with its odd mix of Italian/Australian scenery.

 Now onto the plot, the main event being about a terrorist organisation (Humarize) who want to keep humanity 'pure' (aka quirkless) and seek to eliminate those with quirks. I actually like this idea, given how the series loves to tell us at the begining of most episodes that 80% of the world has quirks, what of the 20% that don't? Deku after all was one of them, so he knows how it feels to be an unpowered minority in a world where those without are looked down upon. Unfortunately the film makes no effort to ask any of these questions, they're just terrorists who want to kill people, and the leader's own justifcation is incredibly stupid (basically people didn't like him as a kid). Furthermore to make the story even more hollow half the the bad guys actually have powers anyway, and in fact so does the leader! They make some offhand comment about them joining in return for being allowed to live, but it just doesn't make sense and totally cheapens the whole potentially interesting concept. There are some actual unpowered guys with guns, but they're worse shots than stormtroopers and not a single one of them has a face or name.

 The other side of the story is Rody, typical no parents anime protag who lives with his younger siblings and does small time crime running to make ends meet. Honestly he's fine, unlikely to be anyones favourite character but he's got some personality and brings some humour. Anyway he meets Deku on a job, accidentally gets involved with Humarize and they're put on the (corrupt) police watch list and have to run away. They bond on their roadtrip, get chased down by some villains (one of whom, a kinda cool archer girl, escapes and is just forgotten about, not even showing up for the finale) and meet up with Bakugo and Shoto where they assault the Humarize headquarters and save the day (with 0.3seconds on the clock left). 

One thing this film has going for it is it looks great, good work by Bones with nice sceneries and backgrounds, and the action is fast and frantic. The final third of the film is basically one long punchup, with Deku vs the Humarize leader, Bakugo vs a couple of creepy kids with extending swords and Shoto fighting a beefy lava manipulator. It doesn't quite match the sheer destructive scale of the previous film but it puts in a good attempt. Bakugo's fight was certainly the most spectacular with the three of them leaping all around the place with dust, debris and explosions everywhere, Deku's fight is a touch more mundane, don't get me wrong again it looks great - the Humarize leader's (I've already forgotten his name he was that forgettable) power looks great, projecting back people's attack power at them - sadly being Deku the whole fight is just him repeatedly throwing himself over and over without any thought and just getting more beaten up, and then after having lost more blood than the average human body holds he sees Rody get hurt and just casually goes super saiyan and seemingly masters One for All instantly to win (but then ya know doesn't mention it). Then at the end the bad guys, despite having been blown up, crushed, etc are all unharmed and get arrested and it's a happy ending.
 The budget clearly didn't stretch far enough for anyone else to get epic moments, the heroes at other sites do get some brief moments, but nothing of any note and with little combat shown (and still not enough Blazin' screetime!) - it would have been rather cool to have a battle up the Eiffel Tower or something.

Now I do get that I sound very harsh on the film, but don't get me wrong I did enjoy it, I was just disappointed that the plot didn't try harder, it doesn't add any new or significant characters, gives no real character development and because it's a film despite the huge scale of the events shown will never be mentioned in the main series."
116338,"tl;dr: Watch the damn show. It is fantastic. 
I knew this would happen. I purposely waited for this to finish airing completely because I just knew it would be that good. Boy could I not put it down. Mairimashita! Iruma-kun 2 compeltely met my expectations, and then blew them out of the water. One of the best ways I've seen Mairimashita descirbed is as a comfy saturday morning cartoon. And I completely get that and agree with it. The show has quite a simple and silly plot, super silly character, and silly interactions that almost make you feel like you could have watched this show when you were seven years old. Do not be fooled though. Under that guise of a cutesy anime we have extremely well written story and characters. Season one was pretty exceptional in my opinion, yet season two still blew it out of the park. There was not a single dull moment in this season. I literally found myself watching episode after episode dying to figure out what happens next. One of the most surprising things to me was just how well Iruma developed as a character. Through meeting several demons, a nice romance subplot, the father figure that sullivan is, we see Iruma seriously blossoming in this season. Arguably the best thing about this season is the extra side of Iruma that is shown. Without spoiling it, I think it was my favorite moment of the season. I really hope we can see more of Iruma like this in the future as it created so many interesting moments.There is pay off after pay off and I love it so much. The fun and goofy moments perfectly satisyfy my sweet tooth, while the more serious moments scattered across the show provide a perfect break from that sweetness. One of the greatest things about this show for me personally is the romance subplot. As a big fan of romance in general, I can appreicate when the romance isn't overdone, poorly written, and too cheesy. The final thing I seriously appreciate about this one is how well written the side characters are. Each side character truley has a purpose and is their own person. At no point does it feel that a side character is there purely for fluff or to make Iruma look better in any way. They all have their own ambitions and their own way of growing throughout this season as well. Stuff that like really is what pushes an anime up to greatness. Mairimashita Iruma-kun 2 is genuinely an example of a perfect anime and gets a perfect score from me. I know I'm not the only one who enjoyed this anime to this extent. I would very much so be interested in hearing what other peoples favorite moment was. Overall I'm very much looking forward to season three and I sincerely hope more people watch this show."
13659,"Yo. Did I get your attention? Well I think I did if you're reading this. You're probably a little confused and a bit weirded out at just the title of this review, but hear me out, will ya?

Incest, dating your own sister in OreImo's case, in real life is looked down upon heavily in society and some would even consider it morally wrong. Some believe that it's gross, disgusting and creepy. Others think that it's ok. Obviously I'm not here to tell you my bias or position on this topic, this theme is just presented in this medium. So as this may forever be on the internet, I wanted to clear some things up before I start: I'm just some figure on the internet who wants to write a review for a show they enjoyed and tell others why they enjoyed it. That's it. OreImo's second season ONA is a completely different story though cough cough. 

There will be major spoilers present in this review, so I advise you to watch the series entirely before reading this review. Of course that is unless you'd like to hear an individual on the internet ramble on why they liked this show, then by all means, continue reading.

OreImo needs little to no introduction. Its infamous in this community for very obvious reasons, but that's what makes it memorable. OreImo's second season takes place right after the events of the first season's ONA. Through a fitting first episode, it shows us the still-awkward relationship Kirino and Kyousuke have even after Kyousuke brings her back from America. It shows us that we have even more life counseling to come in this season!

Just from the look of OreImo's title, ""My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute,"" I'm sure many would be turned off just by the sight of it. I'm that one individual who ended up diving head first into this series regardless. What is the first thing that comes to mind when reading this title, I ask. Yes, a siscon, incest, whatever you can think of relating to this. I won't argue with you that there are some really generic harem/rom-com elements in this show, but I don't think this title serves the show enough justice. This is what I believe the story is about: It's an accurate depiction of otaku culture, the daily life of people surrounded by this medium and a relatable developing brother-sister relationship. Kirino, an otaku schoolgirl struggling keep this side hidden from everyone else, but at the same time wants to become friends with others who share a common interest with her. Kyousuke, an average guy, but a brother who is giving it his all to try to protect and amend his broken relationship with his sister. That's not all though, it's a real depiction and a story of friends who grow and develop as people through the help of each other. They laugh, cry and even argue with each other and that's what really defines OreImo.

I'm a bit biased and I totally understand why you wouldn't like this season or this series in general. I won't deny it and point out some of the obvious flaws this season had. Some of the episodes and scenes in this season felt a bit rushed, out of nowhere, sometimes even plain stupid. Who do you think I'm looking at, stupid and pointless Kanako confession? Though I won't deny it, a part of me actually enjoyed that scene . . . teehee. Some of the scenes are a bit exaggerated, but of course that has to do with almost all anime. The absolute manslaughter of best-girl is present in this season and it hurt to watch. The added in harem element of the show may be considered a flaw through some people's eyes, so I'll add that on here too. But again, I'm a very biased individual and I won't say no to a harem that is done decently well, especially after getting invested to a series that I watched 16 episodes of. Again though, it was a bit random seeing every girl confess to Kyousuke left and right.

One of the things I think all people who watched this show can appreciate, is its animation. Done by A-1 Pictures, they do a splendid job animating this squeal and there's really nothing else about it to say. There are no flaws or complaints I have with the animation in this season whatsoever.

The same can be said about the sound. The soundtrack produced and used for this series in general is iconic and I would be able to name it straight away if you were to play it for me right at this second. The wide variety and amazing VAs used in this series is a real treat. All the VAs fit their role amazingly well and I wouldn't replace any of them for another. The opening, made again by ClairS, is the perfect choice. Their new OP is catchy and a real pleasant tune to the ear that will get you up and dancing in no time. Having a different ED every episode again, like the first season, was something new that I haven't experience in a while and was a real treat as well. All of the EDs were done by one of the episodes focused character's VA(s) and were all real catchy with an added in LN drawings for the visuals.

All the characters and their interactions with each other are done well. Some of the complaints I have against this section would be a select few characters being under developed or being developed out of nowhere without any prior warning. Saori's backstory was indeed random and out of nowhere, but it had a purpose to play during her arc to explain what was going on and why she formed this group of friends in the first place. Ayase's confession was a treat, don't get me wrong, but it was rushed. I wish they could've expanded more on her month stay with Kyousuke, giving me more of a reason to root for her. But again, fitting a whole volume worth of content into one episode is one hard task to pull off. As I mentioned before, Kanako's whole confession was out of nowhere too. Her only attribute was that she was a hot-headed loli, who suddenly started bring Kyousuke bento's. I wish they could've expanded on her character a little more, but again speed running a whole volume worth of content is hard to pull off.

The harem tag might even turn you off completely. You might think that this show is too simple only touching on the themes of friendship or what not. So why did I enjoy it? Simple. 1. Seeing Kirino and Kyousuke's sibling relationship slowly develop and blossom into a relationship was relatable was a real treat. And seeing the effects of this relationship during this season and the friends they made through it was really heartwarming. 2. It speaks to the audience. Watching and hearing Kirino fangirl over Meruru or some eroges just spoke to me and probably many others who love this medium. I couldn't help, but laugh, giggle and relate to hearing Kirino giggle over seeing one of the heroines in her ergoe say, ""Oniichan daisuki!"" I could say the same thing during Kuroneko's mini arc. Seeing Kyousuke and Kuroneko hug their pillows and squirm around thinking about each other was really relatable and I couldn't help but get a jittery feeling for them too. OreImo does a great job at speaking and relating to its audience. 3. It built a newfound imouto fetish I never new I would have. OreImo sets a clear distinction between real life and games, and they really like to make that apparent especially with the incest theme in this show. I too, also know my boundaries between real life and the 2D world. I'm sure we all have our own kinks, right? Some fans in this community may like tsunderes, other's may like kuuderes. Being more specific some may like catgirls, darkskin or even futanari, but I diverse as I think you see where I am going with this. After finishing OreImo years ago, I had just realized that lit a fire in me, which has lead me to have the divine imouto taste, OBVIOUSLY NOT IN REAL LIFE (I just want to make that clear). And after realizing this, I came to grow an appreciation for this series lighting this weirdness in me years ago, and I'd like to thank OreImo for that. 

Wrapping this up before this review takes any weirder turns, for those who have grown tired of the overused harem/rom-com aspect found within this season, may find this season disappointing. But for those who enjoyed the first season and don't mind this change, will still find that the new OreImo is just as enjoyable as the old."
107625,"When words surpass the limits of our existence, that is the moment in which mankind can express themselves without any boundaries. During history, this statement has been some of the greatest boosting for the improvement of societies. Hence, what a better manner could be implementing this concept in a new-generation production. Definitely, words have been sparkling like a fizzy drink during the course of this production.

Cherry finally noticed it, spontaneously, like the serendipity that it was meeting Smile. An easily-blushed boy and a well-known influencer got to know each other due to the spur of the moment. Both of their paths got entangled, both of their fears were connected, and finally, both of their feelings blossomed into a relationship that will make you burst into tears of blissfulness.
Two artistic disciplines play (never said better) a key role in the development of the plot. On one hand, there are haikus. Haikus are brief nuances of how we perceive life, expressed with a minimalistic yet touching vocabulary. In the progress of the film, you will notice how powerful can be those magic words in both of the main characters. On the other hand, music is the catalyst; with a rhizomatic nature, every single character will be implied to recover a missing object, specifically, an utterly dear vinyl.

Regarding the graphics, the 80´s lovers will enjoy it. The powerfulness of colours suggest with flying colours the youthful events illustrated throughout the film. The animation is also pretty well developed, having its summit when the emotions are on edge. As a matter of fact, they seemingly combine with all the haikus that appear in combination with the dialogues. On the other hand, regarding the OST, it expresses successfully what the director tried, from my point of view, to express: vividness. I have done a little research and I am glad to say that I found the OST on Spotify, link will be laying at the bottom of this review.[link ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5pgrx7pgID7wc8bgNxF3OW?si=255ca3c07fe0423b)

I highly recommend this film not only to people who usually enjoy cute stories about their nostalgic teenager years or teenagers that want to feel identified in the big screen, but also to the ones that are scared of living the true version of themselves. It is hazardous to notice whether you are doing something because of your own will or, on the other hand, due to personal restrains. Maybe this film will help you open your wings and fly to the sky, to places you have never dreamt about (yep, pretty metaphorical this phrase). If you do not feel identified with this sort of attitude though, nevermind, you should give it a try either."
132052,"Sigh… Alright, where do we even begin with this one? First of all, if you actually finished all 24 episodes of this dumpster fire, like I did, I applaud your dedication, but sometimes I really do question the decisions I make, such as continuing to watch this week after week. Studious male harem protagonists have been somewhat of a repeating character archetype, like Futaro Uesugi from The Quintessential Quintuplets, or Nariyuki Yuiga, from We Never Learn. I am convinced however, that Umino Nagi is one of the worst harem protagonists that I have seen. He’s literally Kazuya, but gets good grades in school. He’s indecisive, and rather dumb for a studious kid. I felt like the author of the manga just gave up on keeping the source material at least at a decent quality, because the anime just stopped trying to be good as it went along. Just like the anime, you’ll also probably find that this review you’re reading will also drop in quality as it goes along, who knows?

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 5.5/25

I’m not even going to question the whole swapped at birth thing, it’s animanga, and animanga does these stupid things, and we know this. Perhaps it’s just easier to turn your brain off and just appreciate the harem anime as it is, but it’s quite an infuriating show to watch. So, we can as usual, assume that every girl likes Nagi, even his little sister, and that’s to be expected. What angers me is why the girls try to play wingwoman for another girl when they clearly like Nagi in the first place? Guess romance is weird like that. The pacing is honestly slower than I imagined, especially in the second cour, where there were cliffhangers galore. Sure, there were some well done moments, but for the most part, it just wasn’t very well written or entertaining.

ART: 7.7/10

The animation is fine. It’s colourful, quite a good job honestly. The character designs are quite decent.

MUSIC: 8.3/10

I will say I enjoyed both OPs and both EDs, they’re honestly one of the highlights of this entire show.

CHARACTERS: 5.5/20

I’ve already mentioned my disdain for Umino, so let’s talk about the girls in the story. First, there’s Erika, an “Instagram Influencer”, who lived in a rich household, and once she moved out to live with Nagi, she didn’t know how to do many things, and found a lot of mundane activities very new. She’s pretty inoffensive for the most part to watch, but her feelings for Umino were rather muddled. Then there’s Hiro, who was probably my favourite character, since it seemed like she might have a little bit of a good backstory, but her character writing was rather inconsistent. Sometimes she’s extremely kind, but sometimes she can come across as a bit overbearing and overly annoying as a character. Lastly, ooh boy, there’s Sachi. Why is she even in this harem? There was no need honestly, and she didn’t even have much of a role to play. Guess she made this whole show a bit more trashy.

ENJOYMENT: 3.5/15

I admit, there was a bit of cheap enjoyment to be had, and there were a couple very solid episodes, but most of it was a snoozefest.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 4.5/20

The themes were rather muddled, honestly. What were we trying to do here? Figure out why Nagi and Erika were separated at birth? Just have a slice of life harem? This show is so lost, and the directions they took in the second cour really lost me as well, as any sign of writing quality went completely awol.

OVERALL: 35/100

This show was a mess, and it’s probably not going to end anytime soon, at least in the manga. I’d compare this show to a lost, misguided child. Someone, please steer this back onto a road of at least passable writing quality, please? Well, to be fair, I wouldn’t really care either way anyway…"

With the Summer 2024 season approaching, every romcom lover, including me, was excited for the enormous hype revolving around Roshidere. During that period, I accidentally came upon the poster for a new addition, highlighting 3 girls with either short or blue hair and a random dude chilling in the back. This was, in fact, the formula for the show. The story of  romcom's losing heroines and their perspectives. The story without a core protagonist. Welcome to the dark horse of the season. Welcome to Makeine.

Since, you've finished listening to the OP above, I'm sure you're well aware of how [A-1 Pictures ](https://anilist.co/studio/561/A1-Pictures) performed. This is, perhaps, one of the most well-produced romcoms in a minute. Let me elaborate. 
img2200()

In short, the animation is breathtaking. From stellar shots to just simple movement being so fluid and satisfying to see that it urges the audience to go check out the studio adapting it. The characters look amazing and move so fluidly that it often prevents the viewers from noticing the incredibly aesthetic and detailed background (there were actual manga volumes in one episode), as well as the 'camera angles'. They masterfully collaborate hand-drawn shots and CGI, to the point where nobody questions anything about the visuals. Be for real. If you complainin about Makeine's looks, then you're exceedingly picky and I'm coming for you.

As if having those wasn't enough, there's actually an even more important aspect when it comes to the execution of Makeine. The voice acting. Holy crap, it is good. It has no business being that good. The seiyuus picked embody their characters perfectly and make it so that each one is enjoyable. Not only that, by the time the series moved on to heavier topics and drama, the enjoyable voices turned into emotional performances that forced one to empathise. Already well-known VAs like [Shion Wakayama ](https://anilist.co/staff/148220/Shion-Wakayama) (Takina from Lycoris Recoil, Nanahoshi from Mushoku Tensei) and [Atsumi Tanezaki ](https://anilist.co/staff/112215/Atsumi-Tanezaki) (Frieren from Sousou no Frieren and Futaba from Rascal does not dream), as well as promising VAs such as Hikaru Toono and Momoka Terasawa brought the series to life and added the touch it needed.

The soundtrack fit perfectly in touching moments and the creators were kind enough to provide us with gorgeous EDs for each and every arc. All good enough to be listed as bangers. 

All of this doesn't mean you should sleep on the characters and their writing either. Let's move on to the main cast and why literally picking any of the losing heroine as your favourite wouldn't bother me.

img2200()
webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/Makeine-ED1.webm)

Yanami Anna is undoubtedly the icon. That's easy to understand because I keep getting bombarded with her edits whenever I open social media. She has the most recognizable design out of the losers, and on top of that, her personality is a mood. With her bubbly nature and carefree attitude, she captures the attention of the audience, single-handedly delivering most of the comedy and trendy dialogues. She is an absolute unit of a personality. 

We first get to see the reality of losing heroines' situation from her whole thing with her childhood best friend, Sosuke, whom she had unrequited feelings for. I must say, it felt really nice to explore the losing side in depth and comprehend just how tragic it is for them. Yanami's arc was definitely weaker compared to the other two's, but what can I say? If you got blue hair in a romcom, you're getting robbed. As a gluttunous woman once said 'You're either the childhood friend or the homewrecker'. UWAGIDAYO! Don't worry, though. It's quite obvious she's gonna end up as Nukumizu's partner.

img2200()
webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/Makeine-ED2.webm)

Yakishio Lemon probably has the best and saddest arc in the show. She's a sporty girl who loves running. She's deeply in love with her childhood friend Mitsuki and has been locking those feelings up. It's sort of like her coping mechanism to run. Mitsuki has a girlfriend and Lemon does not have a place to fit in inside his heart. 

Everything starts hitting in the feels when she accidentally tells Mitsuki that she had fallen in love with him. The viewers learn of her perspective, how she felt horrible for having this intrusive glimmer of hope that Mitsuki might actually come to love her and not his current gf Chihaya. Even more tragic when Mitsuki explains that he did have feelings for her in the past. Naturally, Lemon being the mature teenager that she is, after running away, organizes her thoughts and talks it out with Mitsuki and Chihaya. 

img2200()
webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/Makeine-ED3.webm)


Then enters best girl, Komari Chika, a shy girl from the literature club who has social anxieties and feelings for her club prez. No wonder she got two arcs. Her voice acting, specifically the stuttering and the high pitch reactions always impressed me. She's the most interesting and the most considerate one in the group. Remember the time when she immediately called Yanami when she thought Nukumizu was about to get bullied or the time when she voluntarily went running with Lemon (something she's bad at) in order to give Nukumizu and Yanami some alone time? I remember. Her chemistry with Nukumizu, with other characters in general, was always the finest. 

Her first arc was, of course, about her losing. In this case, she's the homewrecker. The club prez and his childhood friend Tsukinoki are senpais who truly cherish Komari. However, during the process, Komari falls in love with the prez, which leads to quite a drama. Contrary to what everyone believed, she suddenly confessed to him out of the blue. Atfer the display of courage there, she was rejected, but still managed to maintain her loving relationship with her seniors.

Her second arc gave off the best atmosphere so far in the show. Tsukinoki and the prez were getting ready to graduate, so they left the responsibility of the club to Komari. A sentimental and nostalgic feeling overwhelmed me personally, as I thought about my own graduation. The literature club was the only place (aside from her home) where Komari felt at home, so she felt the strong need to preserve it. The pressure driven from the responsibility was huge and Komari didn't want to rely on anybody else. She wanted to do this for herself and for her senpais, but this only created more pressure. Who knew she could shout like that? Nukumizu saved the day.

img300()

Nukumizu Kazuhiko is the main character of the show. Supposedly. The reason I'm saying that is because he doesn't act like one. He views himself as a supporting character in others' romance stories and forces the viewers to feel that way too. He doesn't even have to be the protagonist because he's already the best supporting character you could have. Every arc I mentioned, every tragedy I talked about in this review wouldn't have been solved peacefully without Nukumizu. He doesn't like standing out, but when somebody needs him, he's always there to talk. Always there to think of them first. 


I guess I haven't talked about the comedy. Such random ass visuals and random bold jokes were used to make it a more enjoyable experience for both the watchers and staff themselves. What do you do when writing and production are both superb? Trust me. It may sound simple and small from my explanation alone, but if you give it a chance, it'll hit hard. Some might relate, some might simply empathise. Makeine shits on generic romance tropes and excels at the tropes they do implement. Thus, creating peak a romcom, devoid of corniness. A certified classic, in years to come.

[Click here for more goated reviews ](https://anilist.co/user/HomuraDesu/reviews)"
98385,"Adapted from the seinen manga by Jun Mayuzuki, After the Rain (Koi wa Ameagari no You ni) is a tender-hearted romance about a bold high school sophomore, Akira Tachibana, who develops strong feelings for the charming middle-aged manager, Masami Kondou, at the restaurant where she works.

A story that should've induced endless cringe was somehow realized into an uplifting slice of life. It certainly helps that Kondou, colorfully performed by the resonant Hiroaki Hirata, isn't the one doing the pursuing. When Tachibana's feelings for him become evident, he reacts responsibly. He's fully aware of the ramifications of dating a teenager at his age, and is understandably resistant to the idea.



Tachibana, voiced with a quiet sharpness by Sayumi Watabe, is surprisingly insistent when it comes to what she wants, though guarded enough to not share everything about herself. Her apparent coldness frustrates Haruka Kyan, an old track partner who longs to rekindle the close camaraderie that they once had. Tachibana, who was—and still is—an exceptional runner, opts out of competition due to an injury, and seems quite content with spending the bulk of her social time pursuing Kondou. She distances herself from Kyan, perhaps because they've grown apart, or because Kyan brings back memories that she wants to forget.

Initially, I didn't quite understand why Tachibana would be attracted to someone as old as Kondou. It wasn't until around the fifth episode, when we get a glimpse of Kondou's personal life, that it started to make sense to me. Outside of work, Kondou lives a modest life as a bibliophile and single father. He's a caring parent to his young son, Yuuto, and maintains a comfortable home when the two of them are together. Tachibana likely sensed this kindness from her time with him, and thus sought him as a refuge after losing motivation for most everything else. 

Director Ayumu Watanabe, who also helmed the anime classic Space Brothers, brings an understated sophistication to the performances and atmosphere. After the Rain doesn't fear placidity. Scenes often break from the commotion to dwell with the surroundings, which are typically dressed with a relaxing ambience and rain covered petals.



The biggest negative for me was Ryousuke Kase, a character who appears in the fourth episode. In total contrast with Kondou, Kase has a lustful and self-serving interest in teenage girls. With near supernatural ability, he finds a way to interject himself into Tachibana's life, and even gain leverage over her. Thankfully, the adapters realized that this character was about to break everything with contrived drama, and they quickly pushed him to the side; we don't see much of him thereafter.

There was a moderate amount of what some academics have snidely deemed as ""male gaze"", where the imagery is seemingly framed from a straight-male perspective. In the case of this anime, the camera occasionally gives the viewer an alluring close-up of Tachibana's modelesque demeanor. Seeing as this is a seinen targeted to teen and adult males—or anyone who appreciates a nice story—some light fanservice should be expected. Personally, I felt that these visuals aptly supplemented the sexual undertones of the material.



Animated with dazzling finesse by Wit Studio, After the Rain is a portrait of two people, initially separated by a generation, who are drawn together by intersecting circumstances. The overall emphasis, for better or worse, is more on the everyday character situations than on the romance. Ultimately, the story is an exploration of the efforts that we take to reconcile the loss of the things that we cherish—whether it's an old friend, or the dreams that we strive for. If you're looking for something sweet and innocuous with a dash of poetry, you may find satisfaction with After the Rain."
107871,"- This review is being written under a subjective lens and mainly enjoyment. 

- The amount of spoilers will be as minimal as possible to none.  I don’t talk more about the plot points except in spoiler text.  There are some image spoilers but it's all out of context and I took too many screencaps lol.

- If you come to expect opinions from a very critical sense, sorry, but I’m not your guy as we may have different tastes.  

- I’ll try my best to explain what are the things that worked for me and what doesn’t in this review.  Then you’ll hopefully be able to understand my point of view and maybe come to your own conclusion about what this will be like for you.

I preface because a lot of people online come to expect reviews to fit a mold of what they want which isn’t always realistic.  For me, I just like to talk about anime I enjoy. And so this review is about such things. Sorry if this ain't what you're looking for.

Princess Connect / PriConne has been labelled as ‘diet KonoSuba’ and there’s a good reason for that.

According to AnimeNewsNetwork, KonoSuba’s Director (Takaomi Kanasaki) was this show’s 
a) Director, 
b) Series Composition, 
c) Script (eps 1-7, 9-13), 
d) Storyboard (OP, ED; eps 1-7, 10-13), 
e) Unit Director (OP. ED), 
f) Sound Director

Source: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=99659

This guy literally did an ironman and you can see how much of his flair resonates throughout the whole show to the point where that comparison is made.

Aside from talking about the director, Princess Connect! Re:Dive is a 13 episode TV anime series released in Spring 2020.  It was animated by CygamesPictures and is based on the mobile gacha game of similar name produced by Cygames.

If you aren’t aware, a lot of anime are adapted and produced to serve as advertisements for their respective source materials.  This anime is no different as it serves to push the viewers to play the mobile game.  Understanding this fact, this might explain why certain decisions have been made.

Regardless, PriConne is a hit or miss show.  
- If it hits, I think you’ll be having quite a good time.  
- If it misses, it’s generic of an anime you can find anywhere, however I think it’s a much more well-polished show overall and this makes it above-average over the generic anime you could find.

I will recommend this show based on you the viewer/reader liking one or multiple of the following factors:
- Slice of Life / CGDCT
- Cute & Fun Characters
- KonoSuba’s Comedy / Style
- Isekai / Adventure / Fantasy
- Great Storyboards / Shots
- Episodic Anime
- Typical Anime Tropes (tsundere, isekai, etc.)

Don’t let these factors deter you from trying the show.  Maybe the show will hit with you.  It definitely did for me in its 1st episode and I wasn’t expecting much out of it.

I think the first 3 episodes should be enough of an indicator to show what you’re getting yourself into and help you make your own conclusion about whether or not you find this show entertaining in future episodes.

For me, I have found myself enjoying this show a lot more than I expected to.  It was a very enjoyable treat which explains my rating of a 9/10.  I believe for many others, it won’t be as high but this was a really strong entertaining show overall personally.

img1000()

If you would like to understand more about the rating and reasonings, read the sections below.




I think the common mistake with ratings is that we all tend to judge and associate each review rating on our own personal scale.  When people see an average anime - they see that as a 5, some see that as a 6 and others as a 7.  As you all know, we all have different tastes hence different rating scales.  Hence why I’ll post my scale below.

My Personal Ratings Scale (Anime):

4 and below = I would've dropped this show already but made myself suffer through it for some reason. Regardless, this is the drop zone generally.
5 = This was really meh and I wouldn't take the time to rewatch.
6 = This was meh and I wouldn't watch it again unless I was forced to.
7 = It was okay and acceptable, it was good entertainment and you enjoyed the ride.
8 = This was a great story and you enjoyed the show/movie but it wasn't considered one of the best experiences. Just a great time overall!
9 = If you watched this show/movie for the first time, you'll love this a lot. It ain't life-changing but god damn you'll have one of the best experiences.
10 = This show resonated with me so hard - chills and intense emotional catharsis. 

img1000()




I got roped into this show by a preacher - Neppington.  

Then another friend mentioned it was Diet KonoSuba and it was a 9.  I’ve loved KonoSuba and this just seems like high praise, so this caught my interest and I was bored at the time.  

Since it was ‘diet’, I thought it was just a more inferior version and had very low expectations.  Really, by diet, it’s more of a less crude - more derivative version of KonoSuba.  Still, I’ve loved watching KonoSuba 1, 2, and the movie; so this made me curious on what I was going to witness from the same director as I kept on watching this show.  These low expectations and preconceived bias with KonoSuba affects my score, to be honest.  It surprised me and I enjoyed the ride.

Aside from those factors, I find myself enjoying most anime but it seems like my preferences lay in comedy, action, and slice of life.  This show managed to hit all of the right preferences/notes with me.

Before making this review, I saw the TV version and I’ve only watched the TV in Japanese Audio, English subtitles.

img1000()




Now the review.  I’ll be talking about the anime in the following categories:

1) Story / Plot / Characters

If I remembered correctly, according to Neppington, the story being adapted in this anime is a lot of original material except for the characters, lore, world, and hints of the main storyline.  This can explain why a lot of the real plot is in the background or barely explored that much as they want you to play the mobile game lol.  As a result, we’ve got mainly a slice of life anime exploring the world and people that the cast encounters.  If you’re expecting a grand adventure, go play the mobile game as I imagine that’s where the meat is.

The thing is that with this story - it mixes in CGDCT, Slice of Life, Wholesome Moments, Comedy, Drama, and Action.  You can infer from the previous paragraph that CGDCT, Slice of Life, Wholesome Moments, and Comedy are the main focal points throughout the series.  They do have some action scenes that helps complement the story but not like super epic fight scenes you may come to expect from general action shows.

Drama is few and far in-between.  I think they’re really done well though!  Considering what they were given, I would love to see this show attempt to do real drama and more action.  They try to do drama for comedic purposes but you can see the show pull off real drama when they want to which makes me curious on what this would be like if given another season and a legitimate drama-focus.

For the plot, it’s an episodic anime.  If you binge this show and pay attention, you’ll eventually start to notice a pattern with the progression of each episode as it goes from the morning to the evening.  Consume this anime however you wish, I think it’s best to watch it daily to let the episode simmer but binging is fine too.

Now, let’s get to the characters:

The MC.  He’s a hit or miss.  And honestly?  It’s valid to hate him.  His personality is so bland and stupid but… for me, they incorporate it so well with the jokes and stories that I couldn’t help but find him endearing at times.  He’s literally braindead, a baby, just a really stupid kid.  The show eventually becomes wiser over time about his personality and that sense of awareness is great.

img1000()

As for the other characters, it’s a mix of tropes but I really enjoy their personalities and character designs.  They all felt quite unique and while I could attribute to them as archetypes, I enjoy their chemistry overall.  I stan Karyl.

While Konosuba has Kazuma and the 3 idiots.  Princess Connect has an overpowered baby and the 3 competent parents.  That’s how I would describe it.  It’s not a complete Konosuba spin-off.  This is its own thing and I really enjoyed seeing Konosuba's director take on these things, even if it’s a little bit shallow.

And the depth of these characters… it’s shallow, let’s admit that.  The chance to look further into their personalities and growth comes from the storyline in the end which the show opts to hint instead of fully explore in order to sell the mobile game.  

In the end, most of the show is fun hijinks that aims to have a good time versus a character exploration drama.  Is that bad?  No.  Just set your expectations to watch a fun entertaining comedy/slice of life with minor plot around here and there.  This will make the experience a lot more enjoyable, in my opinion.


2) Visuals / Animation

Holy shit, I don’t know who they hired or if they got a lot of that gacha money but the visuals look great!  

img1000()

Comparing this to Konosuba by Studio Deen, the production value in the visual department is a lot better!  CygamesPictures clearly want this to be the best looking thing they could with the director's funny visual gags/flair.  You can immediately tell how pretty many of the scenes look as they do a lot of great environmental shots and character shots.  The amount of attention to detail in the lighting department reflecting the different times of day as well as the settings is honestly phenomenal, in my opinion.  So many scenes that looked so pretty because the visuals were A+.

Of course, there will be some shots/scenes that don’t look as pretty but they’re few and don’t last for too long during the show.  And sometimes those scenes are drawn like that on purpose to draw out a comedic effect/background or its part of the directors flair.

As for the animation, it was honestly really well-done.  The sakuga and movements for action scenes flowed really well.  As for typical animation while walking, it was all serviceable, nothing too note-worthy but it was all well-done.  Nothing looked out of place animation-wise and so well-done.

3) Audio / Soundtrack / Voice Acting

img1000()

The audio design overall is well-done.  Well-timed audio gags and the like.  It helps that the director also did the sound directing.  Comedy complements the sound directing a lot.

Soundtrack wasn’t too super memorable but it helped fit the setting and achieved its purpose of being background music.  There was a lot of variety though and it all served their scenes quite well for what it needed.  Considering it sometimes elevates the jokes, I’ll say it’s serviceable and not a detriment.

Opening is not too memorable but it’s always fun to watch.  Note - you don’t see all of the characters explored in the show from the opening.  Most likely a literal advert for the game.  As for the Ending, it’s comfy and very chill to end the show on.  Notice how the tone mimics KonoSuba where the opening is super energetic and the ending is super comfy.  I can’t help comparing it because the guy is literally ripping off his style haha.

As for the voice acting, I think they all knocked it out of the park.  I really enjoyed all of the performances and nothing seemed out of place.  Its typical standard anime voice acting you can come to expect but still enjoyable.  

Minor spoilers near the end - neutral comment: !I think the MC voice actor deserves props because he actually starts to change his voice near the end showing he’s getting smarter and recovering.  Finally some real work besides saying some of the most monotone one-liners and agreement grunts lmao; easy as fuck job though.!

4) Overall

img1000()

What was something that I expected to not like ended up being a favourite.  Quite an experience.

Now the ultimate question: was I convinced to play the mobile game?  

Not really but I can see why they would push me to it or why others would.  As an advertisement, it definitely did its job.  Entertaining af advertisement though.  I hope this KonoSuba director gets more work and flexibility like this because this was a real nice treat, personally.

As for most people, I think they’ll find an entertaining show and the worst is seeing it as really generic on face-value.  Though, I think this show is a hidden gem and should be given a proper fair shot for the first few episodes at least, who knows you might enjoy this show.



In conclusion, hopefully you learned something useful from the review.  Thanks for reading. :)

There are quite a few big names in this production. VnC adapts the manga of the same name by Jun Mochizuki, mangaka of the highly rated manga Pandora Hearts (RIP the anime). VnC is animated by Bones, which has a history with action (My Hero Academia, Bungo Stray Dogs, Mob Psycho 100), and directed by Tomoyuki Itamura, known for his flamboyant style in the Monogatari Series. The queen of anime music Yuki Kajiura (Magical Girl Madoka Magica, Demon Slayer, the Fate franchise, Sword Art Online, and of course Pandora Hearts) composes the OST. The two leads of the story–Vanitas and Noe– are narrated by Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro in Demon Slayer) and Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi in The Rising of the Shield Hero).

Now, how well did these big names come together?

Adventures of human Sherlock, vampire Watson, and friends in steampunk Paris.

Vampires are going berserk. A self-proclaimed vampire doctor, who is himself human and goes by the name Vanitas, journeys to save those vampires using the Book of Vanitas. After vampire Noe meets Vanitas, he joins Vanitas’s adventures and the two become embroiled in the developing conflict between humans and vampires. 

Now, I wish I could elaborate more on the last sentence. But the story is incomplete with the manga ongoing for the long haul. Mochizuki has said that she wants to write about !death that is not rewarded; no major character has (yet?) died.! Vanitas himself is one of the mysteries that drives the show and more remains to be revealed. Some bombs !(such as Ruthven’s hold over Noe)! are planted but not yet triggered. The rollercoaster has not yet reached the top of the ramp so while I have high expectations, I’m withholding judgment on this front.

.

This is a double protagonist story. Noe and Vanitas are opposites of each other from their personalities to their world views. Noe is cheerful, naive, wears his heart on his sleeve and is openly caring. Vanitas is brooding, shrewd, purposefully ostentatious and guarded. !Noe was raised by adoptive human grandparents, then befriended vampires. Having received kindness from both, he loves both humans and vampires. Vanitas, having experienced cruelty from both races, says that both humans and vampires are ""monstrous and endlessly selfish creatures” (ep 9).! They are attracted to each other’s differences, and as they work together to save vampires, Noe and Vanitas learn from each other and teach each other something new. 
This dynamic makes their interactions ever interesting and their growth heartwarming. Throughout the two cours, Noe learns from Vanitas to be more tactical and assertive in the face of a foe !(against Roland in the Catacombs, Astolfo in Gevaudan)!, and Vanitas learns from Noe to open up to and rely on others !(Roland in the Catacombs, and of course, Noe!)!, however little. 

In addition to the protagonists, most other characters also have deep and meaningful relationships. Mochizuki has expertly balanced Dominique’s vulnerability and her strength. While she appears strong at first, viewers eventually learn that she has been putting on a tough front to hide her trauma and self-doubt to protect Noe’s feelings. Her caring nature and love (romantic and platonic) are the real sources of her strength. The fact that she and Noe have always been secretly watching over and caring for each other is both sweet and precious. It’s clear that Domi is very protective of Noe because she blames herself and never wants to see Noe hurt again. !She has scared off anybody who may cause Noe harm, which is perhaps why 19 year old Noe remains so innocent and precious, as Vanitas conjectures (ep 4).
!
However, their relationship and Domi’s character have been undermined in the anime because some clarifying details never made it into the anime, leaving Domi in a misunderstanding light for anime-onlys.! The collar Domi put on Noe to prevent him from getting lost (ep 3) is a gift from Veronica. The torture room in ep 4 belongs to Veronica, not Domi. 
!
Other character details that the anime left out have also left the characters and their relationships more shallow and less believable. Domi’s popularity with women and her potential bisexuality (tho she loves Noe), cuts of Noe that suggests that he has a small crush are Jeanne, Riche’s (do people even remember her?) nerdiness, and Marquis Mechina’s appearances, are all small details that add life to the characters which I wish made it into the anime. The large side cast, to no one’s surprise, suffers the most from all the cuts and was left bland.

Back to the pros. Many shounen anime suffer from female characters who are only defined by their relationship to the male protagonist. That is not the case in the Case Study of Vanitas (ok fine that was a bad poun). Female characters live their own lives as much as the male characters !(and agender character)! do. Domi’s obsession with Noe is not superficial; it is deeply rooted in their shared traumatic experience. She is popular with the ladies and befriends Jeanne, who has her own life and struggles.

Jeanne is also multi-faceted, even though she is the least well-written character of the main cast in my opinion. Jeanne is another character with a tragic past that chains (pun intended for Pandora Hearts fans) her, but as she breaks free she also proves to be strong and assertive. She is a bit of a push-over (as Domi comments) but bold when she knows what she wants. As for her relationship with other characters, although some moments are hilarious, I absolutely hate that her relationship with Vanitas started with his sexual harrassment (so go make him regret it by wrapping him around your little finger, girl!). 

img820(
But until the tides turn, the joke’s on you Jeanne

In contrast to the main cast, the side cast has little time to be fleshed out, as previously mentioned. Nevertheless, they are given enough attention and contribute to the setting.

If they aren’t trying to promote tourism, idk what else they’re trying to do here

19th century France in an alternative steampunk timeline where vampires are created makes for a wild setting. There are many terminologies and details that can be overwhelming but are tied together neatly to contribute to the rich world building, lore, and conflicts. In addition to completely fictional details, there are some real world references that help you to keep track of them. 

- The Beast of Gevaudan is a real myth that VnC has its own explanation on.
- Dominique de Sade quotes a real life Marquis de Sade (ep 7). 
- Doctor Moreau is based on a fictional character from a real book called the Island of Doctor Moreau. 
- Roland Fortis comes from the Song of Roland, which includes an Olivier and a character who doesn’t make it into the anime. 
- Vanitas? A still life artwork which includes various symbolic objects designed to remind the viewer of their mortality and of the worthlessness of worldly goods and pleasures. 
- Noe? Noah’s Ark.
- Jeanne? Joan of Arc. 
- The d'Apchiers? The d'Apchiers.
- Astolfo? Astolfo.

Vanitas’s birth flower is the blue forget-me-not; Noe’s is the purple aster. Noe Archiviste’s name hints to his memory reading ability and his role in the story. He is an archiver to remember the forget-me-not and a witness to other people’s experiences.

TLDR: Mochizuki crafted an incredible amount of details into the setting. Some of them refer to a character’s role in the story, some of them just exist for the world building. There’s a lot to interpret (but don’t look up the Song of Roland if you don’t want to see flags). For viewers who enjoy digging and analyzing, VnC can be a very rewarding experience. For those who just want to relax, VnC can be overwhelming and very confusing.

.

Luckily, Mochizuki introduces the numerous terminologies by drip feeding. She slowly unravels the world, which works well for a mystery story. Many details are well-thought out. And although VnC is not yet complete, the small arcs so far have been cohesive, revealing, and building up to something greater. The storytelling balances serious plot with light-hearted moments often by alternating between them. While the shifts are abrupt, they give viewers a break from the heavy content and make the happy moments all the brighter while making the sad moments all the more gut-wrenching. Still, even the darkest moments have happy parts to them, making VnC heartwarming on its rainiest days.

.

While the larger narrative has been smooth, the moments that tie it together have been bumpy. A lot of the slapstick humor did not work for me and unfortunately, the anime added some and exaggerated some. Although the characters are young, VnC is a fairly mature piece of work and much of the screaming feels out of place. Thankfully, the screaming and overflowing chibi cuts tone down and abate over the two cours. 

The anime also did not have time for some of the larger conflicts building up behind the scenes. The pacing is sometimes rushed, especially near the ending. Still, considering that the manga is both very dense and often amounts to more than 40 pages a chapter, it’s a very difficult job to pace the content into bite-sized 20 min episodes in 24 episodes. 

.

There are other stylistic choices that didn’t fit the aesthetic, in my opinion. A lot of the art, animation, and voice acting are over the top. 

Mochizuki has gifted VnC with eye candy character designs, and she plays with the style and goes off-model to convey the mood ranging from wonder to horror. Bones, though, perhaps in trying to capture her dynamic style, chooses some odd moments for going off-model.

img820(

VnC, especially in the beginning, also makes some disorienting color and filter choices. This is a scene where !Vanitas invites Noe to work together (ep 10)!, yet the color choices force the viewer’s focus onto the art instead of the significance of the duo's relationship.

img820(
Imagine a scene with all the saturated colors and they appear every episode. My eyes…

Moving on to the animation that jump cuts for too much dramatic effect…It’s a style that Itamura brought from the Monogatari Series and now overpopulates the first cour of VnC.

maybe that’s how much Noe doesn’t like Vanitas /j
Natsuki Hanae’s voice acting of Vanitas feels at times goes over the board with Vanitas’s emoness. Granted, Vanitas is an emo character and he is young, as Mochizuki remarks of Hanae’s performance. Still, I personally wish Hanae toned down a little (pun intended) so that Vanitas’s more nuanced moments can shine. 

img520() img130()
“I will save you vampires, muahaha, ahaha”... ... .. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ↑ so who this :/ ?

The reason that I wish that these elements are less ostentatious than they are is because VnC is great at its relationships, storytelling, and characters. It doesn’t need such blinding colors to cover the joy shared by its characters, dramatic jump cuts to garner attention, or overblown voice acting to inflate its characters. In fact, the loud flamboyant style drowns out and distracts from the quiet moments where VnC is at its best. It’s exactly what critics have said of The Great Gatsby movie.

>While certainly ambitious—and every bit as visually dazzling as one might expect—Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby emphasizes visual splendor at the expense of its source material's vibrant heart.
                                                                                               —Critics Consensus, Rotten Tomatoes

Luckily, the style improves during the second cour, perhaps because they ran out of time or budget. Eventually, the stylistic choices do add to the emotions of the scenes rather than overwrite them. 

That said, there are also many aspects of the production I appreciate. Although some details have to be lost when they are adapted, the designs and backgrounds are still stunning.

No I don’t enjoy Louis dying I’m celebrating the art!

Many aspects of the show dropped in cour two. In cour one, Bones also used CGI in VnC in a way that contributes to the story’s narrative. CGI on the Book of Vanitas (which, given its already ethereal design it must be really difficult to animate) gave it an otherworldly aura. Bones probably liked the outcome and used CGI again in cour two for the landscape of Gevaudan. As a result, Gevaudan certainly doesn’t look as breathtaking as Paris in cour 1 does.

Magical girl book transformation music playing
For those who love fight scenes, the fight sequences are also well animated in both cour one and cour two. While VnC isn’t a battle shounen, so the fight scenes were rarely the focus, Bones gave them the budget to look gorgeous and exciting. There are some minor errors and poor transitions (ep 1, where Amelia almost pulls off Noe's bowtie  but it magically went back), but one would really have to rewatch and look to notice. And did I mention the fights are synced with Kajiura’s music? It really accents the historical tone and polishes the fantasy setting of the show.



Considering the vampiric setting, the fan service scenes shouldn’t have surprised me as much as they did. This is because readers get to pace themselves when reading the manga, but when viewers watch the anime they just sit when the production decides to dial up the sensuality and listen to 30 seconds of moaning. But hey, Bones has got to make sure the DVDs sell. And shared sexual activity (although the coercive nature of Jeanne and Vanitas’s relationship ought to be critisized) is arguably better than boob cuts. I am happy that the production didn’t frame the female characters as just parts of their body which would irreparably damage their characters. Rather, when they are portrayed in sexual light, it is done in a realist manner that impacts the male characters.

Looking at VnC gifs has become my new hobby
Personally, VnC’s strengths spoke to me and its weaknesses pale in significance. I’ve always placed more significance on the story elements such as character growth and plot than production elements such as animation anyway. The adaptation didn’t exactly handle the differences in media well, but I’m still happy to watch the story told in anime format.

VnC is a story on the more mature side, with complex worldbuilding, well-thought out characters, and dynamic relationships. The amount of details it packs and leaves out can make the show difficult to process, but analyzing it is its most rewarding part for those who enjoy analysis. The show is ambitious but not without its flaws. There are poor stylistic elements that gradually improve, production values that decline somewhat, but neither of these problems are significant enough to make the show unenjoyable thanks to the strength of the source material. It has moments where it shines, moments where it shines too much, moments of hilarity, moments where the humor falls flat on its face, moments of beauty, and moments of pain. 

Pacing issues aside, the overall story structure builds up wonderfully to, uh, a climax that is not yet reached, because the journey is ongoing. But you can still enjoy VnC, because it’s not the destination that matters the most, it’s the journey! That’s the point VnC makes by telling you how the entire story ends in the very first episode. 

VnC is not for everyone. But if you enjoy depth, emotional rollercoasters, rich characters, good storytelling, and cute cats, don’t sleep on this one."

Back when Tower of God was airing I [expressed my excitement](https://anilist.co/review/6956) for what could have been a landmark turning point for both the WebToon and anime markets. I stand by everything I said, and there are undoubtedly good results achieved with this venture. A quick search on Google Trends would reveal that interest in WebToons and Manhwa skyrocketed with the release of ToG. If the goal was to create commercially successful products that brought WebToons mainstream prevalence, the production committees at Crunchyroll certainly succeeded. But despite the corporate success, it's difficult to view this partnership without some degree of cynicism; the flagship adaptations themselves have left a weak first impression. At best, they were middling half-measures that somewhat managed to hint at greater things to come; at worst, they did disgraceful disservice to the source material being promoted. And that brings us to where we are today. ToG was a flawed, but promising, adaptation that oozed with potential. But God of High School was all style with no substance, and today's case study, Noblesse, possesses neither. At the very least the sheer lunacy of GoHS was capable at provoking a vitriolic response from me. But soulless unambition confines this husk of a show to an arguably worse fate - indifference. Here's how. This review contains mild spoilers, but skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you'd like to go in blind.




 img100%() 

After an 820-year slumber, the mysterious Raizel awakens, à la Rip Van Winkle. He is a member of the Nobles, a secluded race charged with protecting mankind from afar. Finding himself far from home, Raizel decides to live a peaceful life in modern-day South Korea. The show is split into two arcs, both of which are concerned with factions alerted to his ""Awakening."" His incredible abilities are rarely put on display, instead serving as the impetus for power struggles and internal politics. These conflicts and Raizel's new way of life are what the show utilises to explore certain ideas. But before we take that deep dive, there is something that needs to be addressed. For those of you who don't know, Noblesse the Anime does not share the same chronological beginning as the original webcomic. A 2016 prequel, Noblesse: Awakening, is the canonical start of our story, and the anime decided to continue where that OVA left off. Personally I didn't see a need to catch that prequel, given that the anime was never advertised as a follow-up. Way I see it, the existence of the source material or other adaptations doesn't absolve this individual instalment of meeting fundamental story objectives. My beliefs aside, I'm not one to tell you whether the OVA is necessary viewing or not, but I believe there is merit in making observations off the anime alone. And the show does attempt to make the best out of its 13 episodes, isolating a specific time period in order to deliver a narrative and thematic context one could understand as an entry point into the franchise. It's all just not very good.


 img100%() 

Noblesse emphasizes the importance of setting aside our differences. All of us may come from various backgrounds, or possess unique traits. But no single member of mankind holds greater value than any other individual, nor is anyone entitled to unjustly take that value from someone else for personal gain. You and I are different, but you and I are the same, and should be treated as such. Throughout the series, there's this healthy lifestyle being promoted, showing how wonderful it is to live in peace and harmony with those around us. This is contrasted with the true enemy of Noblesse: systemically-corrupt organizations which represent dehumanization at its ugliest extreme. Be it greedy, soulless monsters or authority figures driven to irrationality, the antagonists of Noblesse abuse their powers at the expense of others. It's up to our boy Raizel and his crew to stand up for the little guy and maintain the balance. It's a solid message, and one that is certainly welcome in our politically-charged landscape. Let's not draw lines in the sand or discriminate, but go the distance to understand and love others instead. Let's join forces against systemic oppression, let's band together against the evils threatening to break us. The Noblesse OP sums up this idea through an emotionally-stirring refrain: ""So why does everybody hurt each other?"" These sweet sentiments sound an awful lot like propaganda, but there's no need to worry about things getting too preachy. Because while being thematically framed as propaganda, 


 img100%() 

Now, I'm going to be demonstrating how this series is lacking in the execution of its intended message. The following three points covered here aren't necessary to every story of this nature. Rather, they're here to highlight how the thematic storytelling fails to be convincing. Firstly, let's address Raizel and others of his kind. Noblesse implies countless differences between Nobles and humans, but doesn't give much for the audience to work with. For a show featuring Nobles for a significant chunk of the runtime, we sure know next-to-nothing about them, aside from their incredible powers and boomer mannerisms. Why is their society so secluded from the outside world? Why are they supposedly incompatible with the humans they once protected? How does their society, ideologies and way of life differ from ours? Are there negative repercussions should our worlds collide? I'd like to think there are answers to these fascinating questions, but I just can't find them within this adaptation. The difference matters to the message, showing that anybody can see eye-to-eye and seek common ground. But there is no context, and as a result there's no real conflict between either party, rendering any commentary on this subject meaningless. Granted, it may not be fair to look from this perspective; even though the script seems like it would tackle this topic, neither of the show's two arcs really attempt to address this issue. So let's go ahead and talk about those instead; specifically, how they fail to portray moral ambiguity. Good and Evil are two ends of a spectrum, with the show's cast clumped together on either end. Bad people are capable of doing good things, and they can't simply abandon their flawed nature at the drop of a hat. But very rarely does the show burden itself with positioning our characters in the middle; there is no moral grey area. Noblesse chooses to play these concepts as straight as possible, watering-down the conversation to its most basic principles. For example, take the villains from the Union, some of whom are cold-blooded murderers who ingest pills that turn them into literal monsters, horrifyingly disfigured and dehumanized. There's no doubt in everyone's mind that Raizel would obliterate such cruel killers without a second thought. But the very moment one of the antagonists reveals some sign of humanity, their lives are immediately spared, and they suddenly become capable of doing no wrong. These moral questions are made to be as simple as possible, offering no substance in stating the obvious. What happens if you're on the bad end of the spectrum, and are finding it hard to work towards that harmonious middle ground? Well, Noblesse just throws up its hands in the air and adds nothing else to the subject. Those reformed characters from the Union are magically OK with their new social standings and doing good deeds, because that's how rehabilitation and life works, apparently. The third example I'd like to point out is the show's assessment of what unity means. Raizel and his growing group of besties enjoy a quaint suburban life, but rarely do we see them make connections with normal human folk. Within Raizel's household, peeps from various backgrounds do interact with each other. But there's no real attempt at understanding each other, nor is there an apparent need to. There's no difficulty faced, nor adjustments made, nor compromises agreed upon. Similar to my first point, there is no conflict, and it's hard to care. Everyone's just happy chilling at home and at their workplace, instantly bonding without putting in any effort. Two teenage students who had grown acquainted with Raizel's crew almost served as the human core of the group, only to unceremoniously disappear entirely from the narrative, because Noblesse decided that it was a good time to throw in exposition about random in-world politics. Closest we get to mutual understanding between different groups of people is one line of exposition, which I believe embodies a lot of the issues I have with Noblesse's thematic half-measures. Raizel's butler, Frankenstein, clues one of the main characters in on a brief history of Nobles and humans, back in Episode 2. In describing the relationship between both races, Frankie claimed that humans were weak and solely dependent on the Nobles to survive. Now that Raizel has opened his horizons to see human life up-close, he clearly knows that hypothesis isn't true and realises how his native society's misconceptions are false. But that's just it, there was never any intention to convince the audience otherwise. Of course humans are not helpless, how could they be anything but? Noblesse prides itself in making digestible, weak arguments, expecting a pat on the back and thunderous applause. It hints at a greater conversation, but drains all nuance from it, to the point where most potential meaning is lost. I must apologize if you felt that you didn't really gain anything from this long-ass paragraph, because I know that feeling too. It's the experience I had with this show; 


 img100%() 

Critiquing Noblesse for what it attempts to do is marginally more interesting than what it actually is. A vast majority of Noblesse comes across as… a school-based SOL. That's right, this story is played straight to be a slice-of-life. This cast of powerful idiots are either commuting to school or playing House at Raizel's. Bursts of serious exposition regarding investigations or politics are often quickly interrupted by long stretches of repetitive comedy sketches. Cutting out all the times Raizel and his bros get called ""hot"" by every minor girl in the high school cohort would end up halving the season's episode count. Episode 7, the all-time low for the series, sees one of Raizel's fellow Nobles getting crushed on by a student, followed by Raizel's chummy friends playing a basketball match. What makes these unfunny skits all the more annoying are the copy/pasted cast of characters. People might find Noblesse's non-personalities entertaining, and I'd be inclined to agree if everyone wasn't a carbon copy of one another. Noblesse's crew of genetically-superior expository devices are the literary equivalent of ""Hey Man, Can I Copy Your Homework?"" Eccentricity is fun in small doses, but cramming in this cast of stock characters sucks any life or chemistry to be had in the group dynamic. This means that scenes play out exactly the same, because all of the characters in them are exactly the same. The VAs soft-spoken, stoic delivery makes this issue worse, as half the damn characters sound painfully indistinguishable from one another. Every good guy's vocal inflection is equally polite and devoid of all personality. It has been annoying to hear a huge chunk of the cast members talking like they're all auditioning for roles in a fujoshi-bait butler anime. Of course, I mean no offence to those who find pleasure in those sorts of things; if those BL shows are to your fancy, you could do far better than this bland bunch of refugees in a PTSD halfway house. You could also settle for more in the visuals department; Production I.G. phoned in their work with all the brilliant aesthetic of a 2010s Man of Action cartoon. Lighting is fine, but backgrounds and character designs leave much to be desired. The show goes as far as to reskin their characters' supernatural abilities as much as possible, and the same goes for the repetitive backdrops of drab city skylines and stiff forests. Action sequences themselves are serviceable, but feel clumsy and unsmooth due to poor cuts or underexposed settings. The soundtrack is unmemorable, but I quite liked the opening and ending songs. The fact that the ED's K-Pop manages to be the best part of half of these anime episodes is pretty damning of the show's quality.


>""The most destructive criticism is indifference."" E.W. Howe. 

I'd like to think I've done my best to find something worth caring about in this show, but it appears that Noblesse seems less interested in its own story than I am. The series' subtext is watered-down to merely stating the obvious, with holes distracting from any positive takeaways. It's a pandering script that fails to pander effectively, and an action show that feels like it barely has any to deliver. Noblesse is at times not a show with supernatural combat, but a stiff, unfunny SOL that's one sexual awakening away from turning into BL. Visuals are unappealing, music is unmemorable. Noblesse makes mistakes in almost every regard, but it's no trainwreck. And that's a damn shame, because at least it's fun to see things go off-the-rails with trashy shows. Instead, all I'm left with after Noblesse, is sheer indifference. 3/10




- Out of the 12 eps we got (let's be honest, Ep 7 was a fkin OVA,) I only had a good time with one, Ep 8. Up till that point we barely had any info about who the Nobles are or where they were from, so the visit to Lukedonia was a refreshing change of scenery. We also had Young Frankenstein, who was the only fun character in the show…
- …Until he wasn't. The episode immediately following saw the novelty of the flashback wear off, and the show's only strong character along with it. YF all but disappeared between episodes, and all we were left with was boring ol' Frankie. I was disconnected from the rest of the episode, because the arc made zero sense! How does the Big Bad Bully of Lukedonia go from declaring his lifelong hatred for Nobles in one episode, to subservient servitude with zero complaints under a member of said Nobles? And what's more confusing is that the Blood Pact thing only happened at the end of Ep 9, which still leaves the question of what happened to YF during this time unanswered. This scene could have been a massive moment for the series, as Raizel and YF set aside their differences with their union. But again, the show just expects us to shut up and accept what's offered.
- So remember how the Union hacker and the schoolboy hacker had this ""Aneki"" relationship, only for it to disappear with the memory wipe and never addressed again? God, this show was such a waste of time.
- Rael really got his ass confined for 10 years over getting rejected. Fs in chat maybe, Idc.
- Crunchyroll, Sony, Whomever I Need to Talk to: Please give your WebToon adaptations more episodes. Each of them needed more time to tell compelling stories, and all three fell short of that. Well, maybe more eps wouldn't have saved this script, but still.
- BEST GIRL: No one really deserves this award, but I'll offer it to Young Frankenstein for being such a badass chad. Genuinely fun on-screen presence. Plus he's practically shipped with Raizel for life, and he definitely wears the pants in that relationship. YF, FTW.

And we're through with this show, good riddance. Really wasn't looking forward to covering this mess. I guess you can call me a WebToon completionist from now on, here's hoping I finally find more nice things to say about the state of these subpar adaptations.

107961,"(Spoilers)
After watching the first 2 episodes of Girlfriend, Girlfriend I realized that to fill the empty void in my being I need to expose myself to as much trashy harem/romcom anime as I can to rejuvenate my soul. Hensuki: Are you willing to fall in love with a pervert, as long as she’s a cutie? is something I couldn’t unironically recommend to anyone as it is a gauntlet of every degenerate porn category the author felt needed to throw at you. This anime emphasizes it is a harem but most importantly is clear from the beginning how trashy it’s willing to go. I started episode 1 at 4 a.m. and when Sayuki took her shit off revealing a dog collar and quite possibly the fattest anime tits I’ve ever seen, I was compelled to continue to the next episode from pure spectacle alone. What followed was immeasurable dissatisfaction as the next two girls focused on are not only nearly as hot but either want to dominate the MC physically and mentally or only wants to draw yaoi of him. 
     Hensuki also has a mystery that is integral to the plot, a mysterious love letter addressed to the MC paired with white panties, to which most viewers who have watched an anime before will know who the culprit is immediately. Knowing who wrote the letter does not make the situation any less vile by any means and therefore I can confidently compare watching this anime to watching a tragedy happen in slow motion for the span of several hours preparing for what you truly know is inevitable. 
     While only a fool would watch an anime like this for the plot, I’m not too sure I felt Hensuki had any soul to it. Despite this, I somewhat enjoyed this anime. The fun, albeit very static and dense cast of characters including the amoral MC, masochist, dominatrix, fujoshi, and the “sister” all make this tragedy less of a car crash and more of someone getting hit in the head with an ACME anvil or piano. Surprisingly, the only moment that left me with pure surprise had nothing to do with any of the fetishes but rather the wild jump cut from the cute date with the blonde girl in episode 2 to her sitting in the library reading a book with the MC revealing that he “later learned she was racially mixed”. It was so jarring and out of nowhere I had to rewind to make sure I was reading it right. What's even more interesting is that it had no relevancy to the plot whatsoever and was never discussed again.
     With all of that said, the best girl is tied between Sayuki and the nurse from episode 3 who is on screen for only a couple of seconds but I fell for immediately. An honorable mention for best girl is the student council girl whose ""I like the way you smell"" fetish is not as crazy as some other character's fetishes like being a slave owner or a pedophile. In comparison, I find her very mild and decently cute.

97880,"This review contains spoilers for Lelouch of the Resurrection

img520()
Part of being a reviewer is knowing yourself and knowing your preferences as a viewer/gamer/reader/whatever. This will help inform you of your possible opinion of a work going in. I once said to a friend, “I think I’m just going to have to accept the fact that I pretty much like everything.” My experience with Lelouch of the Resurrection (Oh, my apologies Lelouch of the Re;surrection) is proof of this. There were parts of this movie that were confusing, there were parts that were kind of dumb, and I’m still a bit iffy on the entire premise. Yet I still enjoyed this movie.

Before I go into the review itself, I’d just like to point out that I find it very, very odd that no one has talked about this movie. I watched a video about someone talking about this movie prior to its release but nothing after it. It’s weird because I’d expect people to have strong opinions on the continuation of such a popular franchise, but there hasn’t been an errant Youtube video nor a Reddit post, nothing. It’s possible that I’ve heard nothing because I was off the grid for a couple of months after the movie was released, but that doesn’t explain all the succeeding months. I assumed it was because it didn’t leave an impact. But no, the movie certainly has things to say and was engaging, love it or hate it. So I remain confused.

img520()

I eagerly awaited the release of this movie, for Code Geass means a lot to me as an anime fan. This show codified my love of anime way back in middle school. At our anime club, watched the first episode of it in our school’s anime club and I was taken aback by its action and brutal violence. It doesn’t help that it ended on a cliffhanger (thus probably explaining my love of shows with cliffhangers), thus making me desire to watch more. We watched the first episode the day before a week long break. I binged the rest of the show in two days. I was completely enthralled by the mecha, the political intrigue, the supernatural Geass, and of course, the infamous ending. It was stark, it felt real. I got its message crystal clear; one of sacrifice and the brutality and ethics of armed conflict: one who kills must be prepared to be killed. Still, part of me held on to the hope that the Prince made it out.

Still, I respected the ambiguity and integrity of the ending. I was iffy on a sequel, especially one with the title as blunt as “Lelouch of the Rebellion.” It threatened to undo what made Code Geass ending so compelling to me all those years ago. Some series benefit from a sequel, others practically beg for it. Code Geass didn’t seem to me one of those works. [Gigguk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMc8icI6mmg), with more grace and humor that I can ever hope to have, makes it clear that, to many, Code Geass has a perfect ending. Lelouch of the Resurrection has its work cut out for it. Still, I was cautiously optimistic.

I gave it a watch and I’m happy to say that Lelouch of the Resurrection handles the show and its ending with care.

It is a year after the climactic Zero Requiem plan, the “tyrannical emperor,” Lelouch Vi Britannia, is dead. Or so it seems. A terrorist group from the Kingdom of Zilkhistan has attacked and abducted Zero (Suzaku) and Nunnally vi Britannia. It’s up to the Black Knights and their allies to retrieve their leaders before Zilkhistan’s nefarious plans can come to fruition. On their way, they bump into C.C., who seems to be harboring a secret.

img520()

And that secret is a surprise to no one for long. Five minutes in, we are treated Lelouch Lampherouge, reduced to an infantile state. With a title like that, I’m not sure why I was surprised that the movie was so brazen. It knows why we’re here and it won’t tease us. At first, I was worried the movie would treat us to a fake out that Lelouch wouldn’t end up being resurrected after all. I never expected my fears would be assuaged so soon.

As a Sunrise movie, the animation and art is topnotch. It’s almost memetic how bad Code Geass can look at times, so I was pleased to see what it looks like with a movie budget thrown at it. No off-model characters here and the proportions don’t look too weird either. Some may raise objections at the CGI used for some of the mechs, but they seemed to blend in well enough and they were animated well. It helps that, as high-tech machines, it would make sense for them to look quite different from other aspects of the setting. It also helps that they were an absolute treat to see in action. These things are super powerful and seeing them both trash a bunch of mooks and butt heads with one other is really a treat. 

img520()

As a movie, there’s not much room for expansion and/or explanation. So it’s good that we’re following characters we’ve seen in the show, though it’s bad that the antagonists are completely new. They’re serviceable enough, though, obviously, we don’t get much time with them. I do appreciate the fact that their villainousness is shown in part because in some ways, they’re a villainous mirror of Lelouch’s relationship and Nunnally.

I was worried that, not having seen the show in years, I wouldn’t be able to follow the plot. The movie doesn’t hold viewers’ hands in acclimating them back into the world of Code Geass, but luckily, it didn’t prove that hard to me, since the movie doesn’t often refer back to events except for major ones, which I do recall.

The ending felt a bit rushed. I wasn’t sure exactly how C.C. and Lelouch managed to figure out how the Queen’s geass worked (seeing as her Geass makes it so they wouldn’t remember her using her Geass (though it was shown that Lelouch knew she had a geass and, thus, subsequent uses made him more aware of how it worked...somehow)). I thought people got over Lelouch returning a bit quickly. I wished we got a bit more character interaction. I’m a bit confused on how Lelouch returned. The intricacies of “C’s World” and whatever the fuck was up with Charles went over my head years ago, and having been so long since I watched the show, I just threw my hands up and turned my brain off, though I can acknowledge my annoyance when doing so. It’s nitpicking, but the insert song montage at the beginning felt kind of narmy.

img520()

Still...when Lelouch finally returned to the way he was, I won’t pretend it didn’t make me happy to feel like I was transported seven years back into the past. I loved seeing him use his geass again. I loved the violence, once stark to me, now over-the-top. I loved the mecha action, especially now that I can compare it to other mecha shows. I loved the absolute insanity that is the Queen’s pseudo-time-travel geass and seeing the characters have to deal with it. If nothing else, this was fun, and fun goes a long way. It reminded me of getting into anime all those years ago.

img520(

And at the same time, it respected the show, it didn’t just try to entice me with fun while disrespecting what made the fun possible. Lelouch once again cited his philosophy that “those who kill must be prepared to be killed.” Given that the guy just popped back from the dead and is immortal now, that can sound hypocritical. However, the movie makes it clear that he’s only back in the fray because the situation is so dire (namely, he really loves his sister) and he doesn’t announce to the world that he’s back, for his belief is important enough that he feels the populace should believe in it. Once his job is done, he doesn’t take up the mantle of Zero again. To further drive the point home, he discards both the name Lelouch Lampherouge and Lelouch Vi Britania at the end of the film. They are still dead. He is L.L. and he shall travel the world with C.C. (so cute!) So I appreciate that the movie took strides in making sure it didn’t seem just like a cash grab. The creators clearly care about the world and story of Code Geass, and as a fan, I’m grateful for it.

There might be a bit of confusion since this takes place in the continuity of the movie trilogy and not the television series. The only thing that I found confusing was the survival of Shirley. Some might state that the series made it explicit that Lelouch was dead, but as I hinted at earlier, there was always the possibility that he was alive due to the scene of C.C. talking to someone on the wagon. Of course, if this wasn’t an alternate continuity, this would make the ending less ambiguous. If you don’t like the ending tampered with, rest assured that this is, technically, not canon. If you like this ending and enjoy the television series, you can rest assured that these continuities fit pretty nicely together.

img520()
This movie would work well as a grand finale, not doing much but to show that Lelouch is back. But apparently Sunrise plans to continue the series, and this movie leaves me confident for the future. I certainly wasn’t blown away, but the movie was a lot of fun while still staying faithful to the show that preceded. If you’re a fan of Code Geass, then I recommend giving Lelouch of the Resurrection a watch.

100526,"Real girl is like a real life story for most hitting reality with what life was like for most otaku's during the early years of there life. This show is a bit fast when it comes to the story but I don't feel it was rushed or anything that leads to poor product nor confusion to the viewer making this one of my top anime's for spring 2018.

The animation is very solid and smooth making it enjoyable to watch, its not to out there and is nice as just a weekly episode. you don't feel like your left with a cliff hanger and waiting a whole week before you can see it again its a easy to leave and pick back up again anime which a nice change, the story is solid and probably my most enjoyed part of this anime the characters are a little hollow to be honest but then again im only on the 4th episode.

this anime hits in a real soft spot for most i think, playing on the real life story of a otaku in high school being shunned and disregarded as a human being simply for the person he is and for the things he likes. its real, its accurate and its the blatant truth that makes this such a unique and good anime. i love how this anime shows the true side of most otaku as well. weird, shy and not all out going but they are also good people loving, caring, determined and very kind there just a little awkward to show it.

this anime reminds me of my high school days of being bullied, shunned, mistreated and pushed away from others spent alone but it wasn't all necessary bad making this so realistic i just wish i had a Igarrashi in my high school years aswell.

Animation: 7/10
Story: 8/10
Characters: 7/10
Atmosphere: 8/10

Final Verdict"
146210,"Now I Usually Make Reviews on Animes that are Different from the rest and boy this one is good to talk about. 

A Quick run down of the story: a kid summons a horny demon that becomes his companion and they do horny things together, they fight bad guys, meet an op mage and get whooped and mid fight they learn about horny demons past. confess their love for each other and do more stuff together. thats pretty much it and its awesome.

img() 

The Characters in this story are pretty much useless besides the main 2. Alto and Vermeil and they are really good characters. Alto's character is really well done, he's a passionate guy who wants to protect Vermeil and be with her forever even though she's a demon and i also like he isn't that cocky guy, he knows his boundaries but tries his hardest to do more and he cares about peoples wellbeing's which automatically makes him a good character.

Vermeil at first was just some horny demon who seduces Alto for his mana but when the story goes on you can really see who she is for real and i love how the writers made her character development a more down to earth person who wants to keep Alto alive and healthy because she truly loved Alto throughout the entire series which some of those scenes where they talk about their love for one another is a real highlight in the series for me. 

img()

The Plot of the story is kind of typical in my opinion like. they meet each other, do some battles, some drama happens, some intimate scenes together, super op guy comes along, flashback and then they confess their love together and happy ending. which was exactly what happened in the series and what reverses that out for me is the characters honestly i don't mind that type of plot but the characters really set the entire series for me. if the characters are bad i'm not going to watch the show because i like a really strong main characters in a romance anime and i love the intimate scenes together when they confess their love for each other because it gives it a happy ending and it shows that they really love each other and they would do anything for each other, which is the greatest part in my opinion.

would i recommend this to you? 
my answer would be yes in my professional romance anime opinion lol
i really liked the story and the characters in this anime and i watched this in 1 day because i loved it so much and i would highly give this one a watch if you haven't already because you won't regret it
and thats it for me :)"
6956,"For reasons that I've never quite figured out, the slice of life genre in anime has become rather popular over the years.  These animated situation comedies tend to be rather formulaic and unfortunately tend to suffer from trope ridden characters that never really undergo any development or exist only in relation to a protagonist with very little personality and development outside of their relationship to that person. 

Over the years, I've watched quite a few shows that fall under this genre, mostly looking for something relatively laid back and easy to digest after a tough day of whatever I'm dealing with at the time.  I generally know what I'm getting into when I pick something in this genre.  I honestly don't expect much at all.  Occasionally a show in this genre comes along and surprises me in a positive way like Working.  I have to confess that I never quite got a lot of the ""must watch"" slice of life shows.  I generally don't hate what I've watched or anything, but I took them for what they were and didn't get all the hype as honestly, they really didn't seem worth all the praise.  I picked up Wagnaria or Working!! as a recommendation not expecting much.  I ended up pleasantly surprised by it and think that it is one of the better shows in the genre.

Working is a well drawn anime and the voice acting is good.  There are quite a few popular voice actors for this one as well surprisingly enough.  The opening and closing themes are catchy and upbeat and set the tone for a show that is generally comedy oriented, kinetic and fun.  Technically, the show is above average I would say.  The fact that it got three full seasons says quite a bit, as these types of shows, with rare exception, tend to be light novel or manga advertisements at the best of times, cranked out quickly and cheaply to drum up some interest in the source material.  While not a masterpiece, it looks and sounds good enough and has a pleasing style that doesn't jar you. 

Why do I write a review on what is just a slice of life comedy anime about goofballs working in a restaurant?  Well, this slice of life does what few of these shows ever end up doing.  Having actual character development and resolutions to various problems throughout the seasons.  As mentioned in the previous paragraph, many shows that fall into slice of life comedy have a bad habit of very trope heavy characters that never really go through any real conflict or development and are there to fill a role.  At worst, many of these shows devolve directly to harem romance shows too.  While there's nothing necessarily wrong with that if that's what you're looking for, it tends to make the show very shallow and predictable in its pacing and resolutions.  

Working spares us from that and has most of its characters that undergo growth and change as the show progresses.  There are enough men and women in the show so that it doesn't devolve into a harem romp that seems to doom many of these set ups.  The characters themselves, for the most part, are interesting and funny enough to overcome the ""show about nothing"" problem that situation comedies always have to fight against.  While this show doesn't really have any deep philosophical message to it, it is compelling and fun to watch because the characters and their issues become fun to watch.  With slice of life, that's all that is really demanded of it, and Working will deliver.

That's not to say that this is a problem free show.  There are some issues that bothered me while watching it.  Without too much in the way of spoilers, one of the original main characters ends up getting shunted off to the side and is one of the few in the show that doesn't really undergo development, quickly becoming somewhat of a punchline character.  This is somewhat strange considering how important they seemed at first, that they would devolve into the same joke every time they had any screen time.  Some characters could also use more screen time away from the restaurant than they get as well to add some context.  I generally feel that some of this was just laziness given the care that some of the characters got in their back story bits.  Characters do progress and grow quite a bit, but the story is very episodic at times.  There isn't any grand goal or story arc here, the work day ends, people go home, etc.  Things can feel a little directionless at times outside of the character development.  Those looking for major tension and plot progression outside of the character relationships will likely be more frustrated with the show than I was.  

At the end of the day, despite the issues, this is a series in the slice of life genre that deserves your time if you like these types of shows.  One of the great barometers for a good anime is whether or not it genuinely entertains you, regardless of the subject matter.  Working is genuinely entertaining and a pleasure to watch.   It's one of the best that I've seen in the purely situation comedy oriented shows.  I did generally turn my brain off and just enjoy the ride for this one, but it definitely exceeded what I was expecting.  

This has my full recommendation if one is looking for a light slice of life comedy to enjoy."
21851,"I'm personally not a huge fan of absurd comedy. My tastes align more along the situational side of humor, where the laughs are strategically placed at seemingly normal and unassuming points in the plot, rather than having the entire setting take on an abstract and irrational form in order to accommodate its comedic elements. Nevertheless, both forms of comedy have their respective merits, and when the shackles of rationality are off, the possibilities become endless.

When I first looked at the summary for the anime series Armed Girl's Machiavellism, I thought I knew what to expect. The main character, a problem student from another school, transfers to an academy where all boys are forced to crossdress in order to safeguard the girls from the ostensible toxic masculinity that emanates from the opposite sex, whilst the girls themselves are armed to the hilt so they can defend themselves from the already much-oppressed boys. At the onset of the anime, our main character is given a choice: crossdress and conform, or leave.

The summary made no mention of whether he accepted those terms, so I assumed that he did, and that the series would turn out to be something akin to Himegoto, where the effeminate crossdressing main character is constantly mistaken for a girl. I couldn't have been more wrong, and in hindsight I was actually glad that my initial assumptions proved to be incorrect, for the anime, in all its cringey and surreal glory, gave me a lesson in the joys of absurdity that greatly raised my appreciation for the wackier incarnations of comedy.

(Each major aspect of the anime is given a rating in brackets, followed by an explanation of that rating.)

Premise (3/5): On the very surface level, a brief glance at the synopsis will not tell you much about what makes the anime good (or bad). A mysterious main character arrives at a school run by powerful girls with abilities bordering on the superhuman (and in some cases fully embracing the realm of the unbelievable). The main character systematically defeats each of them and coerces them into joining his burgeoning harem, all the while making his way towards the ultimate evil: the Strongest™ fighter at the school, an equally enigmatic character who has dark ties with the main character's past. You might be forgiven for thinking that this sounds like the progression of pretty much every other magical high school harem anime, and in some ways that might exactly be the intention of the series: the most fascinating kinds of parodies are those that betray viewers' expectations where they least anticipate it, and Armed Girl's Machiavellism certainly achieves that to a degree. Depending on viewers' tastes, some may enjoy this style of satire, and some may think this particular attempt tries too hard to replicate the structure of something that it is not.

I'll admit that it was the crossdressing part of the summary that intrigued me the most, though it somehow turned out to be one of the more irrelevant parts of the story. Past the initial uproar over the main character's refusal to crossdress, the rest of the series actually progressed relatively smoothly - or at least as smoothly as you might expect an absurd comedy anime series to.

Characters (4/5): Fudou Nomura is a straight-talking, no-nonsense main character, the sort that I appreciate the most, especially in a harem anime (pseudo or otherwise). He makes it his life's goal to collect a stamp from each of the Supreme Five Swords, the five girls who maintain law and order within the campus, whereupon obtaining all five stamps he would be able to leave the school grounds on his own terms (as opposed to getting kicked out for the heinous crime of not wearing a skirt). Despite his rebellious delinquent past, he has a strong sense of honor and an admirable determination to right the wrongs of the restrictions imposed upon the male students, making it quite easy to sympathize with him and his quest.

The Supreme Five Swords themselves are a collection of easily-recognizable cliches: Rin is the uptight and self-righteous tsundere who falls in love after a single kiss; Mary is the blonde, busty foreign beauty whose dignified exterior is easily breached; Satori is cunning, psychopathic, and sometimes downright evil; Warabi is the petite little girl whose closest companion is an anthropomorphic bear several times her size; and Tsukuyo is the quiet, serene figure whose unassuming features belie a breathtaking aptitude for swordsmanship. As with most comedies, the power of the stereotype lies not in the characters' interactions with each other, but the fact of the stereotype's presence in itself: the cliche is there to be laughed at, rather than to help the viewer feel familiarity with the subject. The series succeeds in this respect whilst also developing the characters enough to allow viewers to still feel some sort of emotional connection with the girls, however weak or nascent.

But perhaps the most nonsensical and simultaneously interesting female character of the lot is the self-styled Empress, Kirukiru Amou, whose role in the anime is constantly teased until the final showdown. She is a mixed bag of conflicting emotions: love and hate course through her veins in equal measure. Ultimately, it is love that wins out, and yet it is also love that drives her away from that which she most desires, a fitting end for a destructive and contradictory entity such as herself.

Audiovisuals (4/5): A series where the story is carried by its ubiquitous fighting scenes ought to serve up a visual spectacle for the masses to enjoy. The animation in Armed Girl's Machiavellism isn't at all bad, but a more cynical eye might think that it doesn't serve its purpose too well, as the action can appear stodgy in parts. Nevertheless, the character designs are cute, the fanservice is tasteful, the art is drawn at a relatively good level overall, and the frequent insertion of move names as a comedic device works as intended. The soundtrack is brash and violent, much like the characters in the series, and the opening + ending themes are catchy rock numbers that set the mood for the anime well. All in all, the audiovisuals are decently good, with some stand-out moments here and there. And that's all one really need ask for.

Execution (3/5): Given that I often have a hard time appreciating the full comedic breadth of absurd humor, it proves somewhat difficult to give the execution of the satirical elements of the story an objective evaluation. Nevertheless, there are many other aspects that I can readily acknowledge, from the adorable romance sub-plots running through the plot to the moral lessons in struggling against a tyrannical hierarchy that the series seeks to convey. The series moves at a satisfyingly rapid pace befitting the nature of its story, flitting from arc to arc with no room for fillers, and even if you might find the humor difficult to swallow, at least you'll never be bored.

The humor seems to pride itself on its cringe-worthiness, throwing up inexplicably absurd plot points to move the story forwards, such as the ""Warabilympics"" saga where Fudou engages Warabi's pet bear in a sumo wrestling match, or Mary's attempts at forcing Fudou into committing an act of sexual harassment against her, the failures of which somehow deepen her latent feelings for him. Whether you might think that the series is trying too hard to be absurd is, as always, purely a matter of taste - I personally enjoyed some parts of the humor, whilst feeling exasperated and uncomfortable towards other segments. There's a somewhat rushed feel to the way in which flashbacks are used to try and establish the link between Fudou and the Empress, though the flashbacks explain their secret relationship well enough that any lingering confusions regarding their interactions can quickly be worked out.

Overall (3/5): The value of a comedy series is ultimately rightfully judged on the level of entertainment it brings to viewers. Some comedies try and impart a message of some sort on its viewers, taking on more than just their burdens of distraction, whilst other series dispense with the formalities and go straight for the kill at every possible instance. Armed Girl's Machiavellism hangs somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, and ends up being neither. Its indecisiveness means that whilst its overall absurdity and subsequent comedic value suffers somewhat, it offers a greater emotional bite in terms of being more than just a series that people have to switch their brains off completely to watch. When it's at its best, it can both generate a few healthy snorts and warm the heart. Otherwise, however, it falls into the tedium of a story that isn't always sure whether to take itself seriously or revert to its comedic roots.

Although this might seem like a fairly harsh view of an anime that I honestly enjoyed quite a lot, I felt that the inherent flaws of the series were significant enough to warrant a mention. Regardless, my imaginal recollections of the anime are wholly positive, the fondest of those mental screenshots perhaps being the blushing face of Rin Onigawara as she navigates her newfound attachment to Fudou. Love, it seems, is the answer to the ""Machiavellism"" (or rather, Machiavellianism) of the school's authoritarian hierarchy of discrimination and dominance.

Armed Girl's Machiavellism is a silly, funny, and occasionally touching sight for sore eyes. And I wouldn't have it any other way."
101547,"Intro
Isekai cheat magician. If you've gotten far enough to read this review after seeing that title, I'm going to assume you probably are willing to put up with isekai cliches to at least some degree. As a person of that type myself, having read and watched absolutely metric tons of isekai content, I have extremely high tolerances. Thus, I was able to make it through this anime. However, if you get fed up with tropes and cliches, or get easily annoyed by isekais not being original just close this review now and never watch this anime.

The Concept 
This anime is a perfect recreation of the default setting and plot structure for an isekai anime. The key difference between this anime and other isekai anime out there is that they is no difference. With the saturation of the isekai genre being what it is, pretty much all other popular isekai anime in recent years have all  had some unique twist to the normal formula to make themselves unique. This anime doesn't do that. Shield hero give the protagonist, well, just a shield and makes it a revenge story with the royalty being evil, slime has the main character be, well, a slime, and goes in more interesting directions with a focus on the developing city and such. Even the extremely awful ""high school prodigies..."" anime had the twist of each character being overpowered in a variety of different and theoretically interesting ways. This anime feels like a writer made a template story for them to experiment with changing things of to try to make an interesting isekai, but then they just published the default version instead.

The Plot
To say that the plot of this anime is anything other than generic would be a lie, as would describing basically anything about this show as anything other than generic would be. The two main characters get summoned to another world of fantasy and magic, they join the adventurers' guild, they are found to be exceedingly strong, and they train their strength to fight monsters. They uncover some nefarious people trying to do evil things and they battle them, saving the day in the end, but never actually killing the enemies because that clearly would be wrong. Seriously, I lost track of how many times they just let the villains walk away after they beat them, and it's not like those villains don't come back to cause more trouble later or anything. The royalty totally feel bad about yanking them out of their world into this dangerous world, but they also tell them that after they've finished doing all of the things that the royalty summoned them to get them to do (fight in a civil war of differing policies of Isolation or diplomacy) then they'll start trying to find a way to send them home. Of course, they don't act like the main characters have any options to not participate, and the main characters just kinda go along with it.

The Characters
I feel like a broken record here, but the characters are all exceedingly textbook examples of the roles. The main protagonist wants to protect people and help them, the female lead is similar but less headstrong, the royalty is unremarkable, the villains feel like they are always either ineffectual morons who the main characters can swat away for them to return another day, or brooding masterminds who are still somehow so dumb that they don't realize that the overpowered main characters will just stop all of their plans.

Summary
This show isn't particularly offensive in any way, there aren't any gaping flaws that aren't present in basically any other fairly formulaic isekai out there, but it also has nothing to make you actually particularly enjoy it. It's not even good as a power fantasy, because the main characters are extremely lame at using their powers, and because the battle animation is sorely lacking budget. The fights feel like they're from yugioh, half the time being less blows visibly striking enemies and people moving around, and more ""it is heavily implied that I am punching you!"" ""it is heavily implied that I just got punched!"" For presumably a power fantasy they do a really bad job at making basically any attack feel powerful or have any impact behind it, and it's clear that they didn't really have anyone who knew how to choreograph fight scenes. Watch this if you've watched all of the other isekai out there and want something to pass the time, but there should almost always be better options."
138565,"To Your Eternity is known to many for its methodical, slow-paced story of Fushi’s growth and the despair he faced throughout his life. Unfortunately, Season 1 sputtered to a conclusion following an underwhelming final arc around the events of Jananda, which was more action oriented, and less gripping overall. Season 2 of To Your Eternity literally follows in the footsteps of that arc, as it continued to sputter through quite an underwhelming story, that has lost most of its original charm of slow paced storytelling. The new characters introduced are okay at best, with some being decent, and some being downright awful. The pacing is fast, like an action story, which in my opinion, is not what To Your Eternity’s charm ever was. It felt like a bunch of ideas mashed together, and it felt like the author ran out of ideas now that Fushi is basically just a normal human being now, albeit with world-changing powers.

The plot this season was quite a mess, to put it lightly. Season 1 was an emotional roller coaster, this season lacked most of those charms, and left me baffled at some of the writing decisions that potentially even took away from the emotional moments that we witnessed from Season 1. The timeskips are jarring, the pacing is zooming, and with that, I wasn’t nearly as invested. Fushi learning how to speak was interesting, but him getting every single overpowered skill known to mankind, enough to become an isekai protagonist, now that’s pushing it. With this type of shift, it’s only fitting that the entire season felt way more action oriented, and was less focused on what made Season 1 great, which was the emotional buildup and world building.

Perhaps a reason why the world building felt markedly weaker this season was also a product of the animation this season, headed by Studio Drive, a lesser known studio compared to the likes of Brain’s Base. The backgrounds felt very “static”, if you catch my drift. Very watered down compared to some of the shots that Season 1 provided.

Music wise, nothing to write home about either, and as much as I like “Pink Blood”, the OP, the fact that they reused it is so uninspiring. I’d much rather have heard an inferior OP to it than seeing it reused. The soundtrack was also quite forgettable.

Another huge drop off was the quality of the characters, none of which elicited any emotion out of me. Fushi, being all grown up now, just does not have any meaningful qualities anymore, besides containing the numerous vessels of presumedly dead characters from Season 1. He gets all these powers, he’s like God, but this isn’t the Bible we’re reading here, so being overpowered doesn’t mean a thing to me. A new addition to the cast is Bonchien Nikolai La Tastypeach Uralys (nice name, I know), and I will admit, I liked him, and his mannerisms, but as the series went along, his energy virtually disappeared, and so did my interest in his character, who felt so useless to the story.

A character that frustrated me a lot was Kahaku, a descendant of Hayase, who inherited every single creepy gene, who felt like a manipulative weirdo, trying to form Fushi’s vision of things into a way that benefits his obsession with him. The difference between Kahaku and Hayase seems to be only at a biological level, their gender. The relationships overall in this show befuddle me, because I don’t see how the sexual orientation of Kahaku matters, why let heteronormativity reign? Have some gall and just jump down the same path as Hayase did, regardless of what “gender” Fushi is assuming.

Simply put, To Your Eternity has gone in a completely different direction, and it hasn’t worked out, in virtually every aspect. It feels like an anime that has lost its identity, and is trying so hard to find one, but it’s constantly stuck in a limbo of deciding whether it wants to be slow paced, fast paced, emotional, or epic. There were definitely a few enjoyable episodes here and there, and the effort was there at times, but overall, it just wasn’t all that great, inheriting all the problems that the second half of Season 1 had, and then some."
6033,"THIS REVIEW ENCOMPASSES BOTH THE THREE ARCS COVERED IN 2011's DRAGON BAL KAI AND THE IMPROVEMENTS KAI MADE OVER 1989's Z

THIS REVIEW ALSO ASSUMES YOU ARE AT LEAST FAMILIAR WITH THE EVENTS IN DRAGON BALL LEADING UP TO Z


Need I even explain to you what Dragon Ball Z is? Frankly, without it, anime may not have ever even made an impact outside of some longass island nation and the West would still be viewing animation as nothing more than a way to advertise toys. People love to compare it to a certain group of three series that all ran together in Shounen Jump together, but in reality, it's DB that made profound impacts on THOSE franchises. From [general inspiration](https://www.thegrandline.com/odainterview.html) to even [supposedly DB's mangaka being the reason another series made it to existence](https://screenrant.com/bleach-akira-toriyama-tite-kubo-dragon-ball-manga/), it's obvious that Arika Toriyama and his legendary story are nothing if not groundbreaking. But really, just because something is known across all walks of life, does that REALLY mean it's a goddamn masterpiece? And if so, how the hell do you manage to improve perfection?

""Well then, let me show you a wall that you never be able to get over with effort alone!"" -Vegeta

Four years had passed since [Son Goku](https://anilist.co/character/246/Gokuu-Son)'s defeat over [Piccolo Jr.](https://anilist.co/character/914/Piccolo) at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai, and Goku has settled into a peaceful life with [his wife](https://anilist.co/character/2102/ChiChi) and [4yo son Gohan](https://anilist.co/character/2093/Gohan-Son). However, when introducing Gohan to his friends from throughout the years, [somebody with a tail just like Goku used to have](https://anilist.co/character/6155/Raditz) arrives and proclaims himself as Goku's brother, spouting what seems like utter nonsense about Goku being sent to destroy Earth. After teaming up with his former enemy and defeating this ""brother"" guy Raditz at the cost of his own life, [two more](https://anilist.co/character/5224/Nappa) of these [""Saiyan"" dudes](https://anilist.co/character/913/Vegeta) are on their way to the planet. Goku will soon face an unknowable, otherworldly opponent that brings along with him the truths and horrors of the blood that flows through him. Pride and punches will clash in this galactic uprising between peasant and royalty!

The introduction of Raditz and the reality of Goku's origin may seem like a shock considering the last two arcs of Dragon Ball had both on the menace of Earth's history [King Piccolo](https://anilist.co/character/9767/Piccolo-Daimao) and his offspring respectively, but the introduction of galactic threats actually fits with the escalation of the threats in Dragon Ball. Goku had previously conquered not only the mythological monsters of Earth's past but mankind's greatest military might of the present, the Red Ribbon Army, as well. At this point in time, the Earth had nothing more to challenge Son Goku. All the while he was still a man of mystery considering his unique attributes and the abilities they had given him before being removed. My only gripe with the direction the series took with this move was that such an interesting idea as a long-lost brother was only ever meant for the reveal of the Saiyan Race. Obviously, the focus was on the future generations rather than the past. At least, that's assuming that Goku is the only moving part of the story of the Saiyans.

This arc also marks the introduction of who would eventually serve as the secondary protagonist to Z and the franchise going forward, the Prince of All Saiyans: Vegeta. In this arc, however, he serves as the main antagonist. Vegeta serves to not challenge just Goku's ability as a fighter but also his entire ideology. In Saiyan culture, something Vegeta holds near and dear to his heart and subscribes to wholeheartedly, people are born with an unmovable level of potential and are subjugated accordingly based on their level of strength at birth. Power is an unmoving hierarchy at this point to Vegeta and his race. The strong will always be strong and the weak trash will ALWAYS be weak trash. However, as Goku had come to learn and will be teaching Vegeta, the weak can become the strong through the proper application and improvement of their abilities. Nobody is ever just stuck at the level they reside in at any one point in time. This theme of self-improvement permeates the entirety of the Dragon Ball franchise and, alongside the early Tenkaichi Budokai arcs of the first half of this story, it's at its most pungent and obvious in the Saiyan arc. Even to the point this shit is present in the MOTHERFUCKING CHOREOGRAPHY!




I MEAN GOD JUST LOOK AT THOSE FRAMES! Vegeta, the top of the Saiyan hierarchy, stands over and looks down upon the low-class scum Kakarot. Goku, a warrior trained and disciplined in a manner that has led him through many perils, looks up to see an obstacle he had to improve himself to even have a chance to overcome. A sight he's long become accustomed to, only now it's literal as well.

All of these combine into an elegant blend of thematic and visual perfection. In my personal opinion as someone who loves the theme of self-improvement in Dragon Ball with all his heart, this is where the original story peaks. But much like Kami's Lookout is to the Dragon World, the peak isn't just a small spec that's all downhill in every direction. The Saiyan Saga began the single greatest stretch in ALL of Dragon Ball. As a fucking franchise, not just the original story.




""I am a Saiyan who came here from Earth to defeat you."" -Son Goku

Many died in the vicious battle against the Saiyan Invaders, and on that list was Piccolo. Given his connection to the Guardian of Earth, Kami, his death resulted in the Earth's Dragon Balls becoming inert. Without the Dragon Balls, the damage caused by the Saiyans can't be undone. However, Piccolo and Kami weren't just demons. They were Namekians, and their home planet has its own set of Dragon Balls. As the only hope to restore their friends from a fate they didn't deserve, Son Gohan, [Krillin](https://anilist.co/character/2159/Kuririn), and [Bulma](https://anilist.co/character/678/Bulma) chart a course for Planet Namek with Goku not far behind once he recovers from the previous brawl. Vegeta, after recovering from his humbling defeat at the hands of Goku, also makes a beeline to Namek in hopes of using the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality so he can overthrow his boss, a galactic emperor. Said emperor, the terrible (Frieza) is already on the planet gunning for the Dragon Balls. A trying threeway scramble for the Dragon Balls will lead to life-and-death battles, unforeseeable alliances, and the awakening of a warrior of absolute legend!

For being an arc based entirely on the home of the Namekians, the real focus of the arc is the history of the Saiyan Race and Vegeta's quest for both freedom from and revenge on Frieza. Frieza feared the limitless potential of Saiyans, so he just BLEW THEM ALL THE FUCK UP! There were 4 survivors: Raditz, Vegeta, Nappa, & Goku/Kakarot. As basically no time has passed since the Saiyan Saga, Vegeta is still willing to do anything to get what he wants. Including murdering Namekian villages and ripping through the Frieza Force like a hot knife through butter. The introduction of the Zenkai Boost, while seeming like a cop-out drama generator at first glance, serves to further the theme of the story. No matter how hard you get hit, you can get back up, learn from it, and be better because of it. The phrase ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" is classic because it's true, and it's quite literal in Dragon Ball.

When Goku finally arrives on Namek, the story shifts more toward the effects Frieza had on Vegeta as well as Goku's acceptance of his Saiyan heritage. Vegeta, a man with EXTREME pride in his people and blood, is seen breaking down crying not because he's going to die, but because Frieza will continue to get away with the genocide of his people. He BEGS Goku to kill Frieza. Nothing else matters to him, not even his pride, more than Frieza paying for his crimes. And if anyone should bring Frieza down, it's a Saiyan. It should be Kakarot.

And Kakarot it is. The legendary Super Saiyan is not just something that embodies everything Frieza feared. Not only was it finally the moment a kind and tranquil soul like Goku's fucking SNAPPED. It stays as a final testament to Goku's acceptance of his own person. He may have been raised on Earth, but he is 100% Saiyan. The reason a Super Saiyan hadn't been born in 1,000 years was that all the Saiyans had been monsters compared to Son Goku. His tranquil soul and empathetic heart were awakened by rage. A rage that could only arise from his best friend being lost forever at the hands of the same bastard who also murdered his entire race. It's one of the few times in the series someone has a major effect on Goku instead of the other way around, and Super Saiyan isn't just the textbox example of a ""bullshit power-up"". It may not have trained for like the Kaio-ken, but it was earned in a narrative sense six ways from Sunday.




""It is no sin to fight for what is right..."" -Android 16

All seems well after the humiliating defeat of Frieza at the hands of the Super Saiyan, however, he seems to have survived the detonation of Namek and is hell-bent on destroying the home of Son Goku. He is quickly dispatched by [a mysterious teen](https://anilist.co/character/2707/Trunks) from the future with an ominous message. A [sole survivor](https://anilist.co/character/2146/Dr-Gero) of the destruction of the Red Ribbon Army will [unleash](https://anilist.co/character/2147/Jinzouningen-17gou) [Androids](https://anilist.co/character/4318/Jinzouningen-18gou) with indescribable power that would put Frieza to shame in 3 years. Son Goku will also contract a heart virus and die before the Androids appear. Things don't quite go according to prophecy, however, and there's [a new threat](https://anilist.co/character/3908/Cell) connected to these Androids. One that could very well be the end of Goku. It's time for the next generation to take the lead as ghosts from the past and future corner the Z Fighters from every temporal angle!

This arc immediately shows that it'll be going over some previously treaded ideas again, namely the focus on the next generation that featured heavily in the Tenkaichi Budokai arcs and the more obvious return of the Red Ribbon Army. This arc also does a lot of new as well, don't you worry. The Android Saga features the most focus on the terror of an ordinary Earthling in the face of a seemingly all-powerful murderous creature. They even made a whole game about that! Crazy... anyway, they also give Vegeta more redemption through his genuine connection to his new wife and his son, the time traveler Trunks. The genuine rage near the end when Trunks is killed at the finger of Super Perfect Cell is a great marker as to how far his character has come since the Saiyan Saga. Piccolo also gets a conclusion to his arc that was started in the Namek Saga through his acceptance and being one again with Kami. However, those ain't the character arcs people think of when they think of the Android Saga.

Dragon Ball Z, while Goku is the main protagonist, can really be seen as the story of Son Gohan. From his first ever fight to the defeat of Cell, we've seen Gohan go from a scared toddler to a preteen who's come to terms with all the crazy shit happening around him. However, the exposure to all of this violence made him develop a disdain for combat. A far cry from his father, who literally let the monkey man who nearly nuked the planet go because he wanted to run hands again. Gohan was the next generation, the one who could and did surpass all who came before him, and mentally he wasn't ready to take on the mantle of Earth's Defender. Just as [Master Roshi](https://anilist.co/character/6167/Muten-Roushi) had prepared Goku and Krillin to fight for what's right when he wouldn't be able to, it was time for Goku to prepare his son for the inevitable situation that he be forced to stay dead. He died once already in the Saiyan Saga. If he died again, which he did, he couldn't be brought back with the Dragon Balls. The next generation had to be ready, but try as he might, Goku could never even see the mental barrier Gohan was faced with from his previous experiences on the battlefield. Then, it happened. He saw exactly what was going to happen if he kept running from his newfound ability and responsibility. Everyone was going to be murdered by Cell, one by one. Suffering. And the first to go, the one that Gohan saw with his own eyes: Android 16. His head was crushed under Cell's foot like a wrecking ball through drywall. And if Gohan kept running from his own power, his ability to stop this madness... everyone he ever cared about will meet the same fate. He snapped, just as his old man did back on Planet Namek. And just like his father, he mopped the floor with the one who broke him. The new defender of Earth was born. Once again, the young now takes the mantle left unfilled in the senior's absence. Goku's beginning was Roshi's end, and Goku's end was Gohan's beginning. You know, Dragon Ball was SUPPOSED to end here. And if it did, it would've been real fucking poetic.




Now that we're done with all the major story stuff, I can make this stuff concise without missing critical info. So, why watch Kai over the original Dragon Ball Z? There are a couple of reasons, some relating to the flow of the story, others related to the presentation.

- As may be a BIG point to a huge amount of Dragon Ball fans, the English dub went through a complete rewrite for Kai. And honestly, THANK FUCKING GOD! The original Funimation dub for Z, especially its script, completely changed and transformed a lot of the characters and overall the vast majority of lines were dogshit. The VAs, while a lot of them reprising their roles, are also a lot more comfortable in their roles and sound much more natural considering when Kai dropped, they would have been doing this shit for like 10 years now.
- Speaking of the dub, quiet moments. They ACTUALLY EXIST! The Falconer score had some real bangers, but it was far too overpowering even for Dragon Ball Z in my opinion.
- Even if you watch Dragon Ball subbed, there's still an auditory reason to look into Kai. Toei had thrown out the master audio for the first three Dragon Ball animes and all releases of '86, Z, AND GT use muddied, low-quality audio tracks. For that reason, whilst no dialog was really changed in the Japanese version, the lines were all rerecorded and the audio quality difference is PALPABLE!
- This specific section of Kai is the absolute best Z has ever looked outside of two very limited DVDs that cover only the Saiyan Saga. And even then, the 2011 run of Kai covered here is also the most accurate coloring you'll get in a non-Super home release of Dragon Ball. I'm not ready to talk about the TFC coloring, dear god
- Finally, filler. People don't tend to like it. When done intentionally in service to the story as opposed to just adding SOMETHING in order to drag out the show because you caught up to the still releasing source material a long time ago, adding stuff into your adaptation can be a good thing. Dragon Ball Z definitely falls into the second camp, if you couldn't tell by how specific I got. Kai improves on the show running as slow as Christmas MASSIVELY. There was so much filler footage in some sections that Kai ended up cutting them in HALF in order to match the manga.



Dragon Ball Kai, whilst not a remake and instead being a remaster, is the perfect touch-up and modernization that a series of Dragon Ball's magnitude deserved. Especially when that remaster heights what was already the absolute peak of the franchise. Dragon Ball Kai stands tall as the absolute best way to bare witness to some of the best shit the entire animation medium has to offer. He may squander it these days, but BY GOD Arika Toriyama was on fucking fire when he wrote the original Dragon Ball story. Kai proves something stated by its last episode's title:"
20057,"img()

Shinichiro Watanabe is considered a mastermind by many. He is behind two of the most legendary anime out there, Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Of course, he's done more than that. Kids on the Slope and Terror in Resonance were both directed by him, but these were not as big, so I'll refrain to mention them for now. Both Champloo and Bebop were revolutionary, thanks to their amazing characters, music, animation, and overall vibe and aesthetic. Champloo and Bebop have a very chill and laid-back feel to them, being episodical shows with little continuity, that sometimes devolved into more somber themes. Mugen and Spike are iconic. You can see their similarities in their demeanor, and once you get to know them more, you realize more of why they are alike, but their differences as well. Both absolutely bad-ass, but with this obscure and mysterious aura. Analyzing these shows you start to notice what makes a Watanabe work. Then, there is one question that many people started to wonder about...

What the hell was Watanabe thinking when he directed Space Dandy?!

I mean, a show about an extremely flamboyant alien hunter, who is fixated on women? The vibe of the show is vibrant, it heavily fixates on comedy rather than the introspective nature of his earlier works, the music choice from the chill and calm tunes of jazz in Bebop and hip-hop/lo-fi in Champloo to the disco tracks in Dandy. This must have been some sort of mistake, right? I mean, how can you go from two top-notch, well thought and structured series to a simple-minded show based on boob and ass jokes? Well, let me tell you that Dandy offers a lot more than what meets the eye. Dandy is also a very Watanabe-style anime in its own way. Let me tell you why this is one of my favorite anime, and why it stood out among the rest.


img()

At its core, Space Dandy is a show about a crew of three alien hunters and their misadventures through space. But in reality, one could say that this show is about directors having fun doing whatever they want with the characters and simple plotline they were given. Every episode (or almost every episode) is directed by a different director, for which, every episode is a different experience on all different levels. And that is one of the coolest parts of this series, its originality. The aliens often break the norm of what you'd expect, the rich world is beautifully built and expanded on, and with so much to offer, it is bound to have an episode that is your cup of tea, whether it be for where it takes our main crew, what themes they decide to expand on, what side characters we encounter, or even what type of animation style they use. It uses to its advantage the simple idea of three dudes going through space with the fact that the writers vary so much, to put Dandy and friends through all types of scenarios, from absolutely unique, to scenarios full of tropes but with that Dandy touch that is inherent to the aura of this series.

One reason people don't seem to be interested in checking out Space Dandy would have to do with the fanservice. For some, of course, it's bonus points, but for others, it just feels like it's way too over the top and will taint the watching experience. Before watching Dandy I also felt this way, because let's be real, the promotional art and teasers do not help. But, in reality, it is not as bad as one would imagine. I'd say that the first half of the first season has some noticeable fanservice, but after that, it's never really prevalent, though it doesn't disappear altogether, which is not a bad thing because there is actually some meaning to it. I never really thought about this while watching, but after I read a post about it, it makes sense. The absurdity of the fanservice is ridiculing how we, in real-life, may use it as a selling point for marketing or something to get traction with little to no effort for whatever it may be. Heck, one of Dandy's main motivations is a bar chain called ""Boobies"" which is just giant breasts floating on space served by voluptuous women from all kinds of species. It's truly ridiculous. But even then, when you may see Dandy as a series with purely comedic episodes which mostly center on boob jokes, that is not really the case.

It may surprise you, but one of the things that Dandy does the best is how it manages to maintain and change its tone, and never feeling forced at all. It knows exactly when to get serious. Going from really goofy episodes to heartwarming tearjerker episodes, or stories that talk about very somber or existentialist topics. Season two tends to do a better job at doing this, but season one has its few shares of episodes that go way off from what you'd expect Dandy to be. Some episodes are just comedic for the sake of it throughout, sure but you'll be surprised with the outliers of the comedy and immature formula some episodes seem to have. And the fact that the comedy for the sake of comedy is prevalent in many episodes just makes all that much better those clever and thought-provoking ones. 

The comedy as well is something that for me hit every or almost every episode. It's never something you'll die laughing at, but it consistently made me chuckle or smile while watching it.

In a similar fashion to Bebop or Champloo, it also has its Watanabe style to it, with the vibe being setting this series to be absolutely memorable. And the little continuity between episodes makes it all that more special considering the bizarre nature of it, that later on becomes much more impactful in how the episodes are interconnected with one another.

Dandy, well, he's just a dandy guy in space. But he's also a very interesting character, nothing like what the stereotype of the protagonist could portray. The guy's a jerk, for sure. He is self-centered, selfish, bratty, and incompetent at most things. He's downright flawed. But for that, he's very human. He undergoes many struggles, and he's not always like he portrays himself to be. I really like characters that actually feel real and human, and Dandy is an easy-going and chill guy that could actually be out there. And despite all of his flaws, he is also a very considerate guy, who actually cares for those around him even when he may be too proud of himself to admit it. When he wants to, he is actually a very nice guy that I'd actually appreciate as a friend.

His two companions Meow the Beetlejucian (he's basically just a cat), and the vacuum cleaner QT. Meow has a very is very similar to Dandy, but they often differ in their ideals. They are a great pair together, and he likes Boobies, so bonus points for him. As for QT, he is the only competent member onboard. I never really loved QT but he is a great and necessary addition to the crew, and he has his moment which I very much liked to see.

Apart from Dandy, for me, the character aspect of the series shines in the side characters we meet along the way. It is easy to fall in love with them and hope that they eventually come back down the road. All the aliens have something meaningful to add, and sometimes they just downright steal the spotlight in a single episode. It is easily one of the things that makes this show so memorable. You grow to miss 'em as the series carries on, and there never is one that feels out of place, especially because the world in Space Dandy is that rich and vast.

Art and animation-wise, it's fantastic. The backgrounds are stellar, and the art differs from all kinds of styles going from abstract levels of animation to vivid cheerful and colorful, or even dark and pale when the episode calls for it. The movements are incredibly fluid, and actually feel real. The action is super well done with the most simple of moves being animated incredibly, it really shows how much passion went into making this show. I love how it's animated, and even though I know nothing of animation or drawing, I can still see the beauty and the conquered ambition to create a vibrant atmosphere through its fluid motion and stunning views.

What I can't seem to understand, however, is how godlike the soundtrack is. I can't begin to explain how amazing it is, you should listen to it for yourself, but the music hits every single time. Having pure disco and funky tracks, rock, melancholic tunes, chill, and everything in between, the OST for Space Dandy is absolutely on point, and it's always used at the right time. There are songs like [Hoshikuzu no Pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrrMlOs-Sw0) or [I want to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZyl6HdKQD0) that just really accentuates the emotion on the scene, and leave you with a distinct feeling of pleasure, whether sad or upbeat. The opening is an absolute banger and a song I'll never get over, and the ending not content with only being an amazing song, it is also very meaningful to the story. You'll see what I'm talking about when you finish watching it.


All in all, Space Dandy is a misunderstood piece of media that I very deeply fell in love with. Although not everyone will actually share that emotion, I know it, and I can live with that. But I hope that I made my point across on why I found this show to be one of my favorites. With all of these seasonal anime that look like I've seen them before hundreds of times, Dandy is a series that definitely tries a lot harder than most, and I'll always appreciate that.

137908,"My Review of ""The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic""!





Who knew there was an appropriate wrong way to use healing magic?

Story
Ken Usato, Suzune Inukami, and Kazuki Ryuusen were regular high students until they got summoned into a different world. Discovering that they had their own powers, their mission was to provide assistance in defending the kingdom they stayed in, which would go into a battle with powerful demons. Ken Usato, the main character, was blessed with the rare power of healing magic, leading to an experienced healing commander by the name of Rose to train him with extreme methods to make him a powerful healing user.



Visuals
The visuals are above average. There are definitely a few moments in the anime where I was impressed by the visuals, but they were never really the star of the show.



Characters
Ken Usato is a dedicated and hardworking student. He puts all his effort into his training to improve his abilities as a healing magic user. His leader, Rose, is quite the developed character. Although very tough and strict with her training protocols, she's actually an enjoyable person outside of her work. Her past has shaped her into a great fighter and an even greater healer, making it her goal not to let anyone die. Ken Usato wasn't transported into the new world by himself, however, as his friends Suzune Inukami and Kazuki Ryuusen were summoned alongside him. They're both quite friendly, but they have the powers of light and electricity, making them very strong fighters.



The Good
I loved the way that healing magic was presented in this anime. Although it initially started normally, the ending really showed the creative possibilities of healing, which I was genuinely impressed with. I'm surprised there aren't many other fantasy anime that use healing in the same way. I really liked the charactrers' personalities. The show presented them in ways that don't make them unbearable and completely enjoyable in their own unique ways. I also liked the little comedic moments. They provide a bit of a fun in comparison to most of the seriousness in the show.



The Bad
At first, I was confused what was the ""wrong way to use healing magic."" Has it ever been wrong to heal yourself for your own personal benefit? I don't think so. It's nothing that big, but it was distrubing me through the anime.... and then it made sense a bit over halfway through the show. To be honest, I didn't really care much for the backstory moments. They just didn't interest me as much as the rest of the story and overall disappointed me a bit.



The Downright Ugly
There was nothing downright ugly about this show.



Is It Worth The Watch?
If you want a fantasy show that does something unique and slightly different from other anime, this is a good option. I think that this show is worth the watch. It gave me a new perspective on how healing magic can work.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope this helped you with your decision on whether to watch this anime or not! If you already have watched it, I hope that you can agree with me with some of the points I made. ^^"

〈 𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘥𝘰 𝘥𝘦𝘦𝘳 𝘥𝘰 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘳 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦? 〉

At this point, I am sick and tired of repeating the same thing I have been saying for the past couple of years, but it goes without saying that we all have our own unique sense of humour. What might have person A rolling on the floor laughing could leave person B completely stone-faced and unfazed, and the reverse is just as true. No single style or type of comedy stands head and horns above the others, and anything, no matter how bizarre it seems conceptually, can tickle someone's funny bone.

That said, as much as I love absurdist comedy and tend to laugh at the dumbest stuff possible, Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan—much like both seasons of [Pop Team Epic](https://anilist.co/anime/98549/Poputepipikku/), which I have reviewed before—is not entertaining in the slightest no matter how you decide to slice it. As harsh as it may sound, this fresh-from-the-oven seasonal is nothing more than yet another flavour-of-the-month, gimmick-riddled fad that will soon fade into utter obscurity, leaving barely a hoofprint behind.



So, what is really wrong with the show? Why am I, along with so many other people, so hellbent on voicing our disappointment and frustration with its content? Well, it may come off as a complete shock to some, but the series, despite all its supposed quirkiness and uniqueness, has no clue how to create and maintain a genuinely funny moment. Most if not all of the jokes are inherently and extremely disorganised, nonsensical and haphazard. While that randomness and abnormality are what should make them interesting and compelling, in reality, they lack the timing, delivery and flow needed to pull it off and land effectively. Just because the comedy is meant to be absurd does not mean that the jokes themselves ought to be absurdly wishy-washy. They are simply too lukewarm, scatterbrained and stag-nant to really pack a punch. Naturally, the quality of each of these gags varies from one to another, but they always follow and fall back on the same predictable formula: the punchline is either about the protagonist being a deer, having antlers, or the characters yelling some gibberish at the top of their lungs. Now, you might argue that is exactly what an anime about animated deer should have to offer, and I would agree with you if not for a small yet very crucial fact: there is no deviation from this formula at any point, and the jokes themselves are neither set up properly nor conclude in a satisfying manner. They come and go without affecting you in any way, shape or form. As a result, once a gag concludes, you are left feeling like a deer in the headlights, unsure of what the hell you have just witnessed or how you are supposed to react to it.

But it is not just the writing that bears the blame for the stag-gering lack of humour and hilarity. The central gimmick and other adjacent quirks are equally responsible for completely screwing the show over and burying it alive before it even had the chance to spread its antlers. Turning a generic, cutesy anime girl into our favourite car-loving animal might seem novel or even hilarious at first, yet there is no universe in which this silly premise can carry the entirety of the anime's humour on its back. There is only so much you can do with such an idea, and it quickly becomes apparent how little wit the show possesses. The running gags are overused to the point of inducing nausea, and any and all deer-related skits are not amusing in the slightest. The few scenes that have some comedic potential are the ones that do not rely on Shikanoko's appearance, supernatural ""powers"" or woodland heritage to do the trick. But, as you might have already guessed, they are too scarce and undercooked to be entertaining.

But hey, at least the references the show is very fond of throwing in are silly and savvy, right? Pfft, as if. I firmly believe that references are not funny on their own. Simply showing, mentioning or alluding to a well-known property is not going to make everyone laugh. For references to be truly laughter-worthy, you have to be innovative and playful. You need to forge them into a ridiculous though respectful mockery of the source material that can and will stand on its own even if the addressee does not recognise the thing that is being satirised. Instead of merely slapping them onto the screen and expecting the viewers to giggle out loud because they ""get it,"" the series should have utilised them to create meaningful, well-thought-out skits. As it stands, all of those references peppered throughout do not enhance the jokes at all. Take them away, and nothing of value is lost. The only reference that really stands out to me is the one poking fun at Disney's extreme strictness for copyright violations. It is snappy, out-of-nowhere, and brilliantly introduced in the conversation. Other than that, the references are a whole bunch of tedious drivel and add absolutely nothing to the scenes in which they appear.



What really doomed the show, in retrospect, was its runtime. Shikanoko's twelve standard-length episodes are painfully uneventful and boring to an excruciating degree. While it is not unheard of for a comedy show to work wonderfully as a fully-fledged one-cour show or even a two-cour one, in the case of this daring darling, cutting the episode duration in half would have been a far more efficient but also more logical decision. Though it would not have fixed some of the more inherent issues it suffers from, such a procedure would, at the very least, have made it less monotonous to watch. Being unfunny is one thing, but being boring on top of that should be classified as a health hazard and come with a warning label.

With all of this in mind, it is not difficult to see how and why my enjoyment of the show was flat-out non-existent. Again and again, I was forced to sit through each episode, watching whatever the hell it had in store for me with utter apathy. None of the jokes really landed, none of the references were en-deer-ing or creative enough for me to appreciate them, none of the gimmicks had any staying power, and none of the episodes felt like they actually deserved and needed the 20 or so minutes of run time. Nonetheless, despite my extreme negativity, I would not say that Shikanoko is among the worst things I have seen. In fact, I do not even feel particularly strongly about it as a whole. To put it more bluntly, it is so lukewarm and indifference-engendering that it does not even warrant intense disdain or a SUPER harsh rating. In a few months, I will probably forget about this show's existence—and that might be the most damning and destructive piece of criticism I can direct towards it.

Still, before I leave you with the closing remarks, I have to acknowledge a few positives. Mind you, there are not many of those in here, but I would look like a doe-eyed goober if I did not mention them: the memes, the marketing, and the voice acting. It is easy to see how impactful the anime's marketing was to its initial success and popularity—without the fawn-tastic opening, it would have never taken off the way it did. The same applies to the memes it spawned (and will continue to spawn for the foreseeable future) since they are a hundred times funnier than anything in the actual show. Finally, you can really tell the seiyuu had a blast voicing the characters, doing their best to bring life to the lines they had been given, even though, the final product leaves much to be desired. They, the opening, the gifs and the goddamn brain-rot memes infuse this sorry shitpost of a product with way too much longevity and liveliness for what it is worth, and it is impressive to a depressing degree how deer-ivative and drab it would be without their presence.



Oh, deer.

To cut to the chase and stop beating around the bush like an unruly beast, Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan is undeniably a strange show, both on paper and in practice. Even if you go in with minimal or even zero expectations, the series will still find a way to let you down and bore you to tears. It is supposed to be one of those turn-off-your-brain-and-let-it-rot kind of shows, but by the time you get to episode three, there is nothing left to keep you interested in its antics. ""Haha, she is a deer with antlers sticking out of her empty head! Haha, they are so loud! Haha, there are so many crackers everywhere! Hilarious!""—this shtick can only take you so far, and man, do those gimmicks run out of steam fast.

But hey, at least it is over, right?

106240,"""I just wanted to see her smile again.""

Well, well. What have I got to say... That was some pretty good words coming from a guy who has spent so much time trying to get her to wake up again. This Sci-Fi romance film was something I wouldn't have expected to be extraordinary, I kind of kept my hopes down for the entire film. But after watching the movie, it felt... decent? good? I was confused at that point. However, what I CAN say is that the romance was implied pretty strongly on the main character. Spending 10 years to save a girl you literally just started dating with? That's some sheer determination there my good old friend. Enough sputtering filler phrases, let me start my review on Hello World.

To begin with, the story felt... confusing? Especially at the end, it might make you go, ""what just happened?"" Well yeah, that was me as well. But if you got confused at any part during the movie other than the last, I suggest you go watch Steins;Gate again to turn yourself into a true mad scientist! (Not sponsored by Dr. Pepper) However, you got to catch the information quickly especially at the first when it was the most crucial about his future self explaining about ALLTALE Quantum technology. If you missed that, good luck trying to understand the whole movie. If you didn't miss that however, good for you then! You have just gotten the whole gist of the movie. Now onto the romance, as a romance-freak, I don't know I should be happy or not. But all Naomi did was just follow his future self's instruction and got her in the basement. Why can't that happen to me as well? I want my future self to get me a girlfriend too! Sadly, this is indeed a Sci-Fi movie so I cannot complain and whine about it, but still!

Now onto the art & animation, which the art felt lackluster in emotions for a Romance film. However, do keep in mind that this a full CGI film, so get ready to see some wack animation. I only noticed one however, but it downgraded the whole thing since that animation was literally one of the simplest ones that is given a lot of time, I can probably do it as well. Back to the art, although lackluster, there were a few scenes that were incredibly cute thanks to the visuals. So it depends on whether you care about the Romance or the Sci-Fi, and then you see it yourself from a specific viewpoint then on. What I have to seriously criticize on however is the amount of color they used in the movie. Oh my lord there was so much rainbow beams shining everywhere my eyes actually hurt from watching. That is one thing I want everyone to take note of : A LOT OF RAINBOW

Not to mention, the music was pretty dope. It's honestly personal preference though since we all have different tastes in music. But for me, I loved it. As for the voice actors, they've honestly done a pretty good job at... doing their job? There were some moments however that should've been implied harder than what was screened. So... director's issue? I don't understand the industry that much so I assume I have no say in something trivial like this. But still, good job.

Okay, Ruri and Naomi were so cute together it just felt amazing. (and then the story went downhill from there but let's not talk about the sad times) | Naomi in the future felt like a how a mentor should feel like, although there were some ""disagreements"", he has done his part well at tutoring himself in the past. Naomi in the past wasn't a wimp either, you can see the his development throughout the story through sheer willpower to save Ruri. He isn't that wimpy kid that doesn't even dare to enter the library anymore, he is a reliable and independent teen that people can rely on. As for Ruri, the only true character development she got was only when she is with Naomi. But without her, this whole story wouldn't have existed so she is still crucial for the story.

Haha, I know everyone is waiting for this. If you hated this movie, you will want me to type here : I hated this shit 0/10 no watch pls. Vice versa, if you loved this movie, you will want me to type here : I loved this movie omg 10/10 pls watch. I'll be honest here, I have mixed feelings for the movie. For me, I love sci-fi theories and I read a lot about them. So naturally I understood and enjoyed the movie. But at the same time, I love to look at things on an unbiased scale. What about the people who just came here with no knowledge of sci-fi whatsoever? Will they know what's the butterfly effect? A parallel world? A paradox? Naturally, they will get confused and not enjoy the movie as much as I did. Personally, the romance contributed a great factor for those who did not understand the sci-fi stuff IMO. As I said above, I am a romance-freak, so I savored every moment of romance the movie contained. Now for the big revelation, I will get my enjoyment an 8/10.

Overall, if you have epilepsy, I will not recommend this movie due to the amount of colors and the motion. If you do not however, I can recommend it if you like Sci-Fi or romance. Or else, if you just like anything you watch then why are you here? Go ahead. However, if you are a critic that hates CGI, romance and time traveling. Then please, do not watch this. I already warned you beforehand. Well then, signing off. El Psy Congroo"
139498,"What a movie.

Scarlet Bond is a semi-canon side-story that takes place after season 2, and has new lore, a cool princess named Towa, and focuses on a new character, [Hiiro](https://anilist.co/character/266042/Hiiro), and he's one of the best so far. A fiery, determined ogre hell-bent on avenging his people, yet who is reasonable (and trusting) in the face of genuine people.

He's a compelling character, who falls into bad company later on,  and let's just say he has some.. sad scenes.



After the intro scenes, it only gets better. The first thing you notice then is that it's a perfect recap: making the current situations easy to understand for me who hadn't touched the show in years, and in a fun way, too. The pacing is perfect. The characters are all re-introduced, too, in a concise way, and no matter what character you liked, you're sure to enjoy it: Veldora, Milim, the ogres, etc, all of the rest too (even the most side characters stand up to TenSura character standards). And then Diablo in particular not only has a good introduction here, but is a star of the movie in his own way.



And of course, Rimuru. The movie reminded me why he's an amazing character. Kind, simple, pragmatic, wise, and quick-thinking: he had some really cool scenes and some heartwarming ones, such as when, in a hopeless situation, he silently asked the Great Sage if there was any way to save one of his servants, at the end.

The fights were actually really cool, with all sorts of abilities shown, high power levels (low nuclear level, and the power scalings are kept intact), and amazing animation. Alot of the animation in the first half, though, with the exception of one fight, was alot simpler, and everything was more story-focused. Here's some of the earlier animation (sorry it's a .webm):

webm(https://files.catbox.moe/dn3sh5.webm)

But don't be tricked- the closer it gets to the end of the movie, the better the animation is (and not just for the fights):

Anyway. Death death death so many deaths. The movie opens and ends with deaths. Death gives depth, meaning, and value to the characters' motivations. At the end, (SPOILERS)
!
the same 2 characters die multiple times, yet they're saved in the (very) end. Even though it technically didn't end with either of their deaths, it felt like it would, and when it did it hit pretty hard. The fact that they survived actually didn't lessen the emotions from it all.
!

The non-spoiler version is that there are multiple twists, and while it may seem like alot, it manages to feel natural.

Oh, and the movie has really great music but.. the music for the Diablo vs Violet fight... 10/10, a perfect musical, reminiscent of [Vanitas](https://anilist.co/anime/131646/Vanitas-no-Carte/) music (no visuals to spoil, take a listen!):

youtube(https://youtu.be/AVBSoqajCM4)

So yeah. If you are a TenSura fan then I highly highly recommend this movie."
140596,"This Series is one of my all-time favorites and I implore everybody who gave up on season 1 to give season 2 a real shot. 


Some background on my history with this series: When I first tried to watch season 1 I was immediately turned off by the fanservice. It isn't anything particularly revealing or lewd, it just seemed like the show was going to center around lewd gestures and jokes with a bit of skin shown as well. Which in and of itself isn't a problem, it just isn't really for me. I dropped it after the handwashing scene. I just couldn't. But a friend of mine encouraged me to read the manga so I did and I am so happy that I did because this series is one of the most wholesome series I have ever read. I find myself smiling constantly while reading the manga. This series has a very undeserving bad reputation. For some people, Nagatoro bullies too hard early and they can't get past that, which is understandable, she is quite annoying in the beginning and Hiyakasudere characters aren't for everybody. For some people like me, it was the early nonstop fanservice. I am here to tell you that both of those things gradually calm down, although I would be lying if I said they ever fully go away - they don't. But they do decrease in severity and frequency.

Now on to my actual Season 2 Review

Plot: This season takes a very welcome turn. Not that season 1 was bad, but there was very little plot and the characters didn't really become super likable until the last third of the season. In this season you start to see a plot start to form a little more than just the episodic adventures of two dorks. We still get that, but with the !Judo arc being introduced, we start to see a goal for our leads! and a plot starts to form. There is no Attack on Titan style crazy plot twists or depth, it is very simple and straightforward, but that is all it really needs to be at this point. It is entertaining. 9/10. 

Animation: Slight downgrade from Season 1, which considering the genre, was a very visually appealing season. This season you can feel a slight decrease in quality but the series is still very visually appealing and the animation is done well for what it is. The animation quality does get better as the season goes on. 8/10.

OP: I am a huge fan. I love when you can tell that the musicians are genuinely having fun while playing. There isn't a single instrument in this song that doesn't rock your socks off. The opening sequence is very fun, cute, and actually hilarious. I lost it at the glasses pushing up part, I am not smart enough to find a better way to phrase that so that is what you are all getting. 10/10.

Characters: Most of this will be spoiler tagged because there is a lot to say. But know that I give it a 10/10, the characters that were barely even likable throughout the majority of season 1 all step up. We got some wonderful character and relationship development this season. !We are already seeing the massive changes in Senpai (I don't think they have revealed his name at this point so neither will I) from the sushi scene where he actually goes for the abomination that Nagatoro put together, simultaneously being adventurous (not at all like how he used to be) AND bailing out Nagatoro when she was getting teased for creating that ""sushi violation"". Absolute Chad move. What is interesting and subtle, is that we are seeing Nagatoro battle with herself a little bit more. She still teases him but she backtracks a bit now. Watching her balance her teasing with encouragement when she knew that Senpai was trying to invite her to the zoo was a real treat that didn't seem as apparent to me when I first read it in the manga. Very well done and it shows how she is growing, pushing herself to be better and even though her character development at this point is much more subtle, it is present and it is adorable to witness. Gamo is best girl as always, helping to guide these two dorks towards what they really want (each other) as the perfect wingwoman. We get to meet Anetoro. Need I say more? The characters make this show what it is. Their actions, reactions, personality, and development all feel so natural and unforced. It is so refreshing to see. Easy 10/10 and I would go higher if I could.! 

In Conclusion: This season benefits off of the legwork that the first season did. It makes me appreciate the first season even more, because it had to establish this status quo within the series so that the second season could capitalize on it. In my opinion, Season 2 of Don't Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro should stand alongside the romcom greats like Kaguya-Sama."
143653,"Everybody suffers with something. I think it would be a lie to say that there’s never been a time in your life that you’ve been kept awake at night, or have had to trudge through a day absentmindedly because you had something weighing upon you. And even though you may fight that weight, or deny its existence, there are times when we can’t do anything about it by ourselves. That… is Nakami Ganta and Magari Isaki. Two classmates who can’t sleep until the light of day has broken. One afraid that they may never wake back up, and another who is afraid to let an ‘uncertain’ and possibly worse tomorrow come. The two start an astronomy club to cover up their inability to sleep, and they begin to heal in each other's presence. The concept, beautifully unique. The execution, scarcely lacking. 

img500()

This anime is a breath of fresh air and it took me a couple episodes to truly understand why I felt so refreshed watching it. Then, it hit me. This doesn’t feel like an anime. It doesn’t lean into exhausted tropes and it's never over the top or cliche, it just feels genuine. The characters feel real for their age and I never felt like they were shoehorned in. Most of the struggles and setbacks were never too outlandish that they felt forced either. The only drawback I felt was that Nakami’s personal problems were never truly mulled over and they did feel rushed. He awkwardly runs away halfway through the show blaming himself for rain, and the one time we finally get to see him open up he gets interrupted and that was that. I did not dislike his character, nor any of them in the show, but I felt like he was done a disservice. 

img500()

The animation is not going to blow your socks off, but the attention to detail in scenery and framing really sells a lot of the smaller emotions the show tries to imbue the watcher with. Feelings of nostalgia, the tranquil silence of a sleeping town, the beauty of far-off storms at night, a starry sky that draws you in. I truly loved every one of these sequences because you got to see two people enjoy each other's presence like they were the only ones in the world. The joy I felt watching them escape to the beach or run around town put a genuine smile on my face, and I could never wait until the next time they shared the screen together. As well, I felt that the character designs were very pleasing and original compared to the overused generic style you see everywhere. 

img500()

I don't normally enjoy SOL shows, however I heavily recommend this one because it doesn't lose itself along the way and fizzle out. From the first episode it has purpose, and the characters have aspirations that they actively work towards. The romance is slow but it is earned, and I couldn't have appreciated that more than in this show. As an insomniac photographer myself, I knew I had to check this out when I saw it and although it is not perfect, I pray for a second season."
107068,"Sequels in any form of media are rarely better than their originals, and anime isn't really any different. Of course, we do see continuations that are better than the first part of the series (For example, Boku no Hero Academia season 2 and 3 are both significantly better than the first, Part 2 of Code Geass is generally considered to be better than the first, etc. etc.. Season 2 of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, however, is an enigma in this regard as it improves over its prequel in every conceivable way, down the very core of both the technical side and the story side of the anime. 

On one end, the art and animation have been improved over the first season by a very considerable margin. The art and animation of the character's facial expressions and body movements are far more varied and detailed this time around, providing much better synergy with the once again amazing voice acting from Rie Takahashi and Yuuki Kaji, both masters of their craft and go perfectly together in their roles as the two main characters once again.  The overall expressiveness of Takagi and Nishikata is a true world benchmark for how animated characters should be produced, and is bordering on perfection in this season. This is paired with a much more varied setting for individual chapters, meaning more interesting visuals to go with the new theme around this season's chapter selection. The sound design is also improved, with more music selection and a much more entertaining opening and ending choice, with more music sung by Takahashi, which is a treat as always. 

While the first season almost exclusively focused on the comedy side of the story, this season takes a much larger leap to the romance side. Of course, there's plenty of comedy here, and the character interactions in this regard haven't changed much. The focus on the romance between Takagi and Nishikata, however, not only shows significant plot and character progression from the first season but also provides a much more engaging and dynamic feel from chapter to chapter. The most that was given in regards to romance last season was mostly at the end of the season with Nishikata subconsciously acknowledging his feelings for Takagi, and Takagi showing her clear emotional vulnerability around him. This time around, Takagi is far more bold and daring with how she relentlessly teases and embarrasses Nishikata, making him constantly veer from clear acknowledgement to harsh denial. She goes all the way towards making them a couple to outside observers, knowing full well Nishikata is too shy and is too aware of his feelings to outwardly deny it. The focus on their romance goes wonderfully with the better animation, since the expressive nature lends itself far more to showing what the first season was lacking: body language. Not everything is shown in the face here, a not insignificant amount is shown through how the character is positioned or moves in relation to the other, and it leads to a far less monotonous experience than before. In real life, the majority of communication is non-verbal, and this improvement makes the characters far more believable and fun to watch.

Another very significant improvement is the overall improvement on the chapters from Ashita wa Doyoubi. What was a welcome but extremely lackluster break from the main duo's antics is now a far more entertaining and involved break from the main duo. We get interactions that lend more towards the trio's personalities and they occasionally acknowledge recent events between the main duo itself, or on occasion tying into the same sequence, making the anime as a whole feel more alive and active within itself. More attention has been given to side characters as a whole, like the relationship between Nakai and Mano, or the one between Hamaguchi and Houjo. Once again, this causes the anime to feel much more lifelike and dynamic. 

Takagi-san 2 shows that the show has much more to go off on that season 1 gave the audience, and is well worth its paces. If season 1 did not prove itself, season 2 surely will and then some. Takagi-san 2 is a fantastic piece of work that should be seen as a perfect example of how to improve and rework an anime to give more justice to its premise and story."
116242,"You ever watch something and then realize you wasted time out of your precious life on a pile of shit. That is me as I'm writing this review. You might be wondering, if I hate this show so much why did I bother finishing it? Two reasons. First, momma didn't carry me for nine months, push my head out of her, and work three jobs to feed me for me to grow up and be a little bitch. Second, I had to solve the mystery of how something so terrible would actually get the funding to exist. I'm sad to say that I'm a failure at solving mysteries and I hate humanity more than the shitty main character of this show. I'm Standing on a Million Lives? More like I'm Standing on Zero Interest. Also, watch out because I'm going to spoil the two possible spoilers in this shit show.

Story
Bitches go to another world to save theirs and they do video game quest things. That's it. Now let me say that this doesn't make this show a bad show. Not every anime has to be completely unique and only have concepts nobody else has thought of, it just means you have to do something to set yourself apart. I'm Standing on Zero Effort does not do that and instead has about 4 seconds of original content flowing through its veins. Notice how I'm not talking about the story? Because there is no story.

Characters
Fuck me these characters are trash. I have so little attachment to them that I forgot all of their names and I literally finished this anime twenty minutes ago. We have a generic fuck main boy who is not popular, edgy, and hates the world because of a bear and a tree or some shit. Sports girl who is good at sports but relies on the main dick for about one minute and is never intreasting. Like this bitch gets lost when she has a map in her eye that she can look at any time she wants. The only cool thing about her is when !she catches her own cut of arm.! There is a sick girl who is sick and weak and wants to not be sick and weak. Finally, there is nerd girl who is the only likable character for the sole reason that she is a nerd. Character development? how about instead we give the characters one big moment the exact episode you meet them and call it a day. There is literally an episode 11 emotional character moment in episode 2, pacing is non-existent. Speaking of which.

Pacing
Y'all want twenty minutes of content crammed into four? How about two minutes of content stretched to fill an episode? Why is this section so short? Because if the show doesn't have to pace things out neither do I.

Music
The thing about this anime that I can say is good throughout. The opening and ending are both bops and the soundtrack has some really nice songs in it. It's honestly a shame that such great music is wasted on a fuck boy thinking about how he hates his classmates and his mom forgot to wash his clothes so he had to wear dirty ones and the bus blew up thanks to pirates and his shoes got wet. I never want to watch this shit again but if I did it would be for the music.

The Bad
There's a lot so I'm gonna speedrun this shit.
- Boring as fuck
- The closest characters to good characters are nerd girl and a Darkness rip off
- This show explains things in four-second flashes and expects you to keep up. I still don't know why fuck boy hates things so much. There was a bear and a tree and no fucking explanation.
- Pacing is an absolute mess
- Characters have so little personality that everything they do or say feels out of character
- Some of the ""jokes"" are so unfunny I actually thought they were important plot points
- There are no real villains. Just bad people.
- !The main character kills someone, finds out it was a parallel world and not a virtual one, and starts to hate people in the real world for no reason!
- No actions have consequences
- There is literally almost nothing at stake at any time.
- I hate my life
- There's more my brain has just tried blocking this shit out of my memory

The Good
- Music was good
- I laughed once

Conclusion
The money used for this anime could have been used for cancer research instead..."
20590,"Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, aka Rage of Bahamut: Genesis, is a breathtaking fable about friendship, betrayal, demons, Gods, some unknown creatures, and repentance. While it is not flawless, I believe that this series is worth your free time. Not only the animation, but also the beautifully written story-line will make your viewing unforgettable. Rage of Bahamut will tell you a story, where angels, demons, and humans have no other choice but to fight together against even a greater evil, Bahamut.

The story of Rage of Bahamut: Genesis takes place in an alternative world, where humans, demons, and angels coexist and are even at war with each other. However, one day, the black-and-silver winged Bahamut makes demons and angels cooperate and seal it. This creature is so strong that only Zeus and Satan are able to seal it. Alack, even they are powerless and the both Lords are forced to sacrifice their lives to seal Bahamut.  The key to that seal is split in two: one half is given to the Gods and the other to demons. The both Lords are now dead and no one can imagine what demons and the Gods will do. After two thousand years, a human woman steals the gods' half of the key and the peace is destroyed. Who is that mysterious woman and what is she trying to achieve? Find the answer by watching Rage of Bahamut: Genesis.

While the story is not something new for the anime world: someone steals something, they find friends, and are trying to overcome all the difficulties together; the story of this anime is still very interesting to follow. Some events are easy to foresee, but the most important ones; however, are not. I guess it is always pleasant to find an anime that will be able to amaze you and this series can do that. On top of that, I would like to note that the story is very understandable, every important thing about it is explained, and I cannot name you even one obvious flaw.  Yes, the only obvious flaw of the story is that there should be a new season that will be able to conclude the story and this new season has already been announced, by the way.

The art of Rage of Bahamut: Genesis is controversial. On the one hand, the animation seems very western-influenced, which in some cases might be a one huge disadvantage. However, on the other hand, this series succeeds in presenting its animation; it even does not spare neither strength, nor resources on its OP and ED themes, showing that “yes, we even have enough money for that.” Character designs, a huge variety of spells, creatures, all of them are just so beautiful that you want to see more and more. If it is a demon, then it is dark and horrific. If it is an angel, then it is beautiful and majestic. If it is an undead, then it is frightening and disgusting. Anyways, you can watch the opening theme of this anime and you will immediately understand how beautiful this anime is. 

The music is worthy, as well. I would not say that I am a big fan of the music that is shown in the opening theme, but, at the same time it fits this anime well. The ending theme also brings the feeling of a closure, helping you to relax. Other music pieces included in the OST are also on the level; however, the only noticeable flaw is that there should have been more tracks. Anyways, it is not even something that I would call a flaw. The voice cast of this series is also another reason for you to watch this anime. While I believe that the Japanese cast did a better job, you can watch it in English, if you are not a fan of Japanese voice actors.   
The characters of this series are all interesting to follow: be it a supporting character, or a protagonist, they all receive enough development. Of course, it is an open secret that the main protagonists receive more development, but it is always pleasant to find a series that even pays enough attention to its supporting characters. Anyways, the anime mostly revolves around Favaro Leone and Kaisar Lidfard. They are amazing! At first, what they do and what they are trying to achieve is unclear and you only think that this series is just some ridiculous comedy. But as the series progresses, you find out more and more about the two and from being funny, Rage of Bahamut: Genesis becomes even more dramatic than funny, or action-oriented. The other two main cast members, Amira and Rita, are less entertaining than the male duo, but they complement them, making them one single unit. Separately, the cast members are weak and uninteresting, but together they are very interesting to follow.  
 
All in all, Rage of Bahamut: Genesis seems to be more a long running Hollywood movie than anything else. It is surprising that this anime adapts a mobile game. You can rarely find a good PS anime adaptation, but Bahamut is just a mobile game adaptation and it is very good. The series manages to keep you entertained, leaving you absolutely no time to yawn, or to relax. Yes, at some point, it loses its pace and becomes less action-oriented; however, later episodes compensate well for it. Anyways, if the new season, which has already been announced, does not spoil the reputation of the first season and if it reworks all problems of the first season, becoming even better than the previous one, I am more than sure that Rage of Bahamut will become one of these “must buy anime.” Anyways, I cannot even think of one reason that will make you dislike this anime. I would highly recommend it to everyone, be you a male, or a female, a teenager, or an adult. Even if you want to watch it with your parents, or with your girlfriend, this series will definitely not disappoint you. 

I hope you will enjoy Rage of Bahamut: Genesis."
19221,"Story``
The story is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa, who is cursed with what he calls ""The Absolute choice"" or sometimes translated to Zugzwang, yes the chess move, the curse gives him two options, and he is obliged  to choose one of them, and they're usually VERY BAD AND EMBARRASSING, and it chooses the worst times possible, which put him in the ""Fail Five"" in his school, a group of students who're considered weird by other students, and the story continues with him struggling to save his reputation, until one day he gets to choose if a his ugly neighbor falls on his from the sky(Not sure about the first choice), or a beautiful girls falls on him, he chooses the second choice, a girl falls on him and she calls herself Chocolat. That is when he recieves ""Missions"" on his phone from ""God"", he has to complete the missions to get rid of his curse, if he fails even once, it will stick with him forever, and Chocolat is supposed to be his assistant sent by God, eventhough she's useless and just goes around eating sweets.

Characters
Kanade deals with a lot of characters, there's Furano Yukihira, your typical Tsundere, who also loves making puns (usually very bad ones). Ouka Yuuouji, the over-energetic girl who happens to be the daughter of some company, And a lot more funny characters, my personal favorite was Yuragi Hakoniwa, a girl obsessed with Onii-chans, she makes anybody her ""Onii-chan"", creating an army of them.

Comedy
The show has one of the most absurd yet funny comedy scenes I've ever seen, kind of reminds me of Gintama. got a bit dull after episode 7 or 8 though, but still I really laughed. the absurdity of the action his curse forces him to do and his struggle to deal with the girls around him and his attempts to get rid of his curse will make you laugh.

Art
The art was good, since its a comedy show, it doesn't matter a lot but something pissed me about the girls' drawings, they all have EXTREMELY RED CHEEKS AND IT'S ANNOYING, but overall the studio did a good job.

Overall, it is a nice mix of absurd humor and romance, I recommend it. I rate it 7/10.

Just adding this line so the character count will reach 2200, I am really not sure why is this a thing, when it says 1500 characters and then ""The body has to be 2200 characters"".

99540,"To be honest, if I was not a fan of Nanatsu no Taizai franchise, then I wouldn’t even have possibly given this movie a try. As excited I was to watch it, deep down I knew something major is going to happen that’s going to excite me a lot. While the excitement did manage to stay at the same level, many disappointments also appeared.

Story [7/10]

The synopsis isn’t currently updated by MAL Rewrite but when it’ll be done, it’ll probably not sound much interesting as the story isn’t that fascinating. Surely, some interesting facts and major revelations were done but the impact that a movie can give wasn’t much. The plot was written in a fast-pace due to which powerful fights had to cut short and end quickly. The story shows each Sin to be way powerful than they actually are making this look like One Punch Series where one just can’t be defeatable. Well, that’s that.

But I have to say, this movie coming out is quite a head start for all our excitements to pile up till when Season 3 will be announced. Thankful to a certain someone, we finally uncover the mystery of its existence and why it is so powerful. But after watching this movie, we might come to ask ourselves, “Was it actually necessary for this movie to be created just to show that?”. Well, maybe yes, maybe no. But still, I totally recommend watching this movie after you have completed season 2 because, without this story, we can easily rest assure and continue with Season 3.

Art [9/10]

A1-Pictures surely knows its business. The character art-style, monsters, backgrounds and moreover the Island itself is drawn in such a way that looks really amazing. If this is the case, then why I am giving it 9 out of 10? This is because of the main antagonist’s character sketch. While he sure was powerful enough to cause much damage, he looked exactly like Ban.
It was also a bit hilarious to see him fight with Ban at the end and it looked like twins are fighting with each other. Nonetheless, the rest was amazing.

Sound [7/10]

Not really sure what I should say here but I guess due to its amazing soundtrack, I can give it a 7 out of 10. The Sound has good pacing and is well made for each moment in the movie.

Character [6/10]

This movie has doppelgangers of Meliodas and Elizabeth making it look like they are actually important to the story when they are not so much. It looks a bit idiotic to add them here but I guess the author tried to go with something easy. Trust me, the new characters introduced here aren’t that important at all and seem like a complete joke in front of the seven deadly sins.

Enjoyment [8/10]

This is The Seven Deadly Sins Movie so of course, I get quite tremendous enjoyment from it. Each battle (even if it was short) was entertaining.

Overall [7/10]

This movie is totally extended, fights are kept to a minimum, strongest beasts are played like toys but still, the stretched plot gives us at least an excitement to keep hype for the Season 3. That’s all."
71,"Full Metal Panic! is cute. It's a series where you have to appreciate many of its flaws to be fond of it. Which might not be an easy task for many viewers, myself used to be one of them as I discovered it during 2022 and in my first time viewing it I did not like it very much. Here's a little summarize before going through my opinions: Full Metal Panic! is a story about a young sergeant named Sousuke going on a mission to protect Kaname Chidori (a teenager who unconsciously holds breakthrough scientific knowledge and is considered a ""Whispered"") from intelligence agencies and other organizations pursuing her abilities. And from there, many shenanigans between the two main protagonists will begin. To begin with, I though its inconsistency was way to evident as the tone constantly jumps between ""intense"" action moments and silly slapstick comedy bits; I though it was trying to hard at combining many different genres all at once; some character interactions were simply loud and obnoxious; the overall animation was a mixed bag as it goes from fluent to stiff in almost every episode, notice how I used the """" on intense because it was hard to take the action scenes seriously when the animation quality wasn't top notch. The main reason of why I was checking it in the first place was to just speed running it in order to watch the next two seasons produced by Kyoto Animation that were more well received then season 1. I let these issues biting my throat through out the majority of the run time and I came up with a simple mind that FMP! was a product of its time and it doesn't hold up with a lot of anime that were coming out in future decades, and in a way I still kinda hold to this statement. But then, a year later, something in mind told me to give it a second chance, now that I was fully aware about the craziness of the first season I decided to take it easy and having a more ""easy-going"" experience this time around, you can say I had a bit of ""development"" about my opinions on FMP!



A stable negative for this anime is the pacing. The plot is centered around Sousuke keeping Chidori safe but season 1 has five different side events without even mentioning the filler/school episodes, all in a 24 episodes' space. There're to many things happening in this season that connecting to any minor character is pretty limited, and when some of these guys will slowly pass away during battles they all probably go pass your mind in minutes. That stated, don't go into this series waiting for earth shuddering events that will scar you for days, if you want to take the war side of FMP! seriously then you'll come out disappointed.

The characters grown on me. Sousuke is a strange guy: he has enough intelligence and experience to learn about how mechs are structured and how good they are in fighting mechanics; he is skilled in combat techniques; hes has good knowledge on weapons; he knows how to handle the situation even when it seems all desperate, he's a genius in many circumstances but acts like a complete buffoon when he attempts school to keep an eye on Chidori, and being incapable to behave normally with other schoolmates. Even when it was done on purpose I kept on thinking how nonsensical was this aspect of Sousuke, and I'm sure I'm not the only person in this regard, many would find his half personality cringeworthy and for honestly good reasons, personally I got used to see him being the imbecile for comedy purposes and I think his development with Chidori's feelings helps him being more generally likable. Speaking of Chidori... she's the tsundere of the series, y'know the type of girl who keeps on abusing verbally and physically the main character while also somehow forming a lovely relationship whit him. If that is not the kind of girl that you'd like to see in an anime then she's definitely not for you, but I liked Chidori. I think that her abusing the shit out of Sousuke is pretty justified since I already talked about how that dumb characteristic of him causes awkward and chaotic problems with other students, therefore her being the meany that she is it's the most charming aspect you'll find in FMP, there are simply more egotistical girls in other shows then her and she seems fun to be around next to her closest friends, that is as long as you're not a Sousuke. Finally we have the lovable Testarossa, or Tessa to put it briefly, she's the clumsy Captain of the revered TDD-1 'Tuatha de Danaan' submarine. She's a cute hottie and I dig her clumsiness, she doesn't have significant development outside of her standing more serious and responsible in her role as a captain, but it's nice having her simply interacting with her loved ones as she's caring and gentle with everybody, and I very much appreciate how badass as a captain she is capable of being during the last act with the final Gauron's attempt to attack, I also like how close she's trying to be close with Sousuke, kinda giving the fans a comparison on who should be considered best girl between Chidori and Tessa, in other worlds the ""waifu wars"" that was trendy in the mid 2000', I kinda miss those silly arguments. As for other characters, well I don't have much willing to describe point blank what everyone else is worth about, Kurz is funny dude when it comes to the ""pervy gags"", but that's about it. Everybody else serve their purpose. The worst character might be Gauron, as a villain he kinda just sucks, there's no motive out of him to be found, he has like two or three cool scenes but most of the time he keeps on losing with whatever plans he's trying to accomplish, and to this day I still don't understand how could this motherfucker survive a direct head shot from young Sousuke equipped with a rifle during a war. So this is where I'm at: Sousuke, Chidori, and Tessa are three pleasant characters and they are good enough to carry the all cast and make the story kind of interesting.



Adding some more things to say animation wise, I still stand by saying and it has aged poorly, studio Gonzo doesn't have a big reputation for stable animation and solid adaptations, they're below average in that regard, but there is one thing that helps me like the aesthetics of FMP! and that is the character design and art style, I really like both. The characters are really expressive, they give a sense of emotion for any kind of situation, Chidori in particular is cartoonishly (if that makes sense) expressive and I love it, her smile and angry face shine from miles away. While Sousuke looks pretty generic compared to many other anime male protagonists, every other character has a distinct look to them, my personal favorite is Tessa, I love her adorable and innocent look combined with her long silver/platinum hair.

Looking on the general soundtrack for FMP, it's rather decent, good to listening it once but it isn't that memorable. However, the OP ""Tomorrow"" and ED ""Karenai Hana"" are a blast and I love coming back to listen to then every single time, they're overall (not counting Tassa) my favorite part of the series and they're incredibly nostalgic. Like many theme songs of Haruhi Suzumiya and Lucky☆Star they're time capsules; once I listen to them they bring me back memories of when the early internet was a lot safer and fun to engage. Tomorrow along with the OP for Fumoffu! are perfect to listen for long and relaxing walk among the hills and long fields of grass, I don't think many can relate to that but I'm lucky enough to enjoy these peaceful songs on fresh air and beautiful countryside scenery. Tomorrow helps me to remind that things will get better, maybe not as fast as we'd like but eventually, as long as you're hopeful, life will be great.



Yes I spent hours on writing about an anime that has long lost its relevance for a review that won't get much attention because of that. Full Metal   Alchemist Panic! is dumb fun, nothing deep or special, just simple and coherent FUN. It might not hold big value anymore especially when you consider another show like Gurren Lagann that takes the Mecha/comedy/adventure genres all in one story but has amazing execution and is perfectly consistent from beginning to end, but either way Panic! is worth checking out. The anime died without a conclusive ending but if it holds your interest you can still check the light novel that have finished over a decade ago.

FUMO-FUMO-FUMOFFU!!!"
20614,"The first season of Free! was a fun and emotional romp full of great characters, amazing visuals, great music, and something to say about youthful ambition and friendship-, which is what will stick with you moving into Eternal Summer. Of course, I'll be getting into that, but this season delivers all of that, and so much more of it- all while improving on the dynamics that worked from the 1st.

And friends, Eternal Summer might be a case study on how to make a perfect sequel. it builds on every theme from the first season, expanding one each character's desires and goals, and adding whole new characters with complex stories of their own- but the season doesn't feel like it's struggling to balance any of that, it's all handled with such grace and ease. It even takes the time to explore the little things with the charactyers that were lingering from Season One, and explore our supporting cast a bit more. I still feel that Makoto, Rei and Nagisa are a ltitle udnerexplored, but I was happy to see them make a real effort to dig deeper into them as characters. The supporting case for Samesuka actually had a lot of fleshing out here, and that may have been at Iwatobi's expense, but I quite enjoyed seeing that side of things more this time around. And this season really hones in on the emotion- Haru's breakdown and his subsequent trip with Rin to Australia to recover from that being particular highlights. It was so heartwarming to see Haru and RIn's relationship evolve, as well as Haru's to Maktoto, though this was much more low-key. I also believed I might hate the characters of Sousuke and Momotaro at first, but by the end I really enjoyed them too. Sousuke starts out as a somewhat malicious and enigmatic figure, but his complexity soon shines through, and it's clear that he was simply misguided though he was motivated by his love for RIn, much like Haru is. Momo is a total goofball, but a lovable one by the end. Nitori also deserves a shoutout for how happy I was to see him go from a meek imitator of RIn to someone desiring and eventually achieving greatness outside of his shadow. And, of course, like the first season, it's still really funny even with how emotional and intense the interpersonal drama and sports action gets.Not to mention, it's as beautifully animated as ever, even more so this time around, the last few episodes have a lot of particularly beautiful sunset, water, and nighttime imagery to showcase and it absolutely captures the luster and also the nervousness that these boys feel as they realize that the peak of their high school experience is here and now; and contemplating how they're going to capitalize on that.

I adore this series and I'm so happy that Eternal Summer has struck such a  chord with me. I think this show is going to be one of my all time favorites... well, eternally. And reminder, Rin Matsuoka is the best character in all of fiction (With an honorary shout-out to all the other boys. Nagisa is my secret favorite.)"
21509,"The Danganronpa franchise consists of 3 good video games and a sludge-dump of mediocre anime, manga, novels and other products subcontracted by Danganronpa's parent company to milk the franchise. Danganronpa 3, the anime, is one of these mediocre products. Only watch this if you're a hardcore Danganronpa fan (so it can fill you with despair). I would give this a 7/10 but since you have to play the games first to understand this, it's a 6/10. Normies should watch something else.

After their failure to turn Danganronpa's 1st game into an anime, they decided to make an all-new sequel to both Danganronpa's 1st and 2nd games and call it Danganronpa 3. D3 has adult Makoto and his friends running from Based Munakata and Based Juzo who want to kill them because of hope?!

Makoto, Kyoko, and Busty Aoi are portrayed well enough. Aoi fans will love D3, especially when she quick-changes out of a suit into a tank top and short shorts due to ""clothing damage."" Byakuya, Kyoko, and Yasuhiro make cameos.
Kyosuke Munakata and Juzo Sakakura have nonsensical motivations for wanting to beat up and kill everyone else but watching them fight sure is fun. 
Knife Guy, Candy Girl, and Pill Girl are the B team filler. Their fights are entertaining at first but get boring when flashbacks are added on. Even with these boring flashbacks, it would be hard to understand unless you alternate watching between D3's Future Side and Despair Side like the creators intended.
Monaca and Despair Girls : Characters from the mediocre spin-off video game: Ultra Despair Girls. Their filler takes up a whole episode and ends in an anti-climax. Wasted potential.
The rest of the characters are blah and you won't understand the final antagonists' motivations unless you watch Despair Side.
Despair Side Characters: As a true and honest fan I assume you will watch 1 episode of Future Side followed by 1 Episode of Despair Side as intended. Nagito, Junko, Hajime, and Chiaki are given on par portrayals with Junko being hilarious and campy in the English Dub but the true star is breakout new character Chisa Yukisome. Danganronpa fans who secretly wish that Monomi was replaced by a hot teacher with a personality between older sister and mother will adore Chise.

Turn off your brain. Enjoy the fights. Enjoy the boobs."
1889,"Disclaimer: Given the nature of the story this review will contain spoilers for both S1 and S2 of Higurashi I would cover both seasons in this review since the story is continuous. This is S2. I would suggest you watch S1 before watching this. It gets a recommendation from me after watching the show you may read this review. Also, this is my subjective take on Higurashi. Your view could be different.

- # Introduction:
  One of the reasons why people enjoy mystery shows is because it is engaging. It keeps you in dark and gives you clues one by one and you have to piece them together to make a full picture. We get to visit exotic or interesting places and connect to characters better since you have to think from their perspective and if you figure out everything before the show reveals its mystery you can pretend to be like Sherlock. Higurashi is a supernatural horror mystery show that nails it perfectly and is a good recommendation for anyone who is into mystery shows.  

- # Story:
  The story of Higurashi follows a group of children from a rural Japanese Town called Hinamizawa. The story has many arcs where they focus on a character from the group and the whole story is viewed from that character's point of view until the arc end that is when everyone dies. But when the next arc starts everything is reset to zero and we focus on a new character from the group. Each arc is divided into two groups, a question arc, and an answer arc. In question arc, the story begins from reset and in answer arc, you see that same story from a different point of view. The story will give you clues in both question and answer arc but once in a while, it will you a clue that will make you think whether what you were told before was true or not and on top of that the characters that are focused are usually unreliable (you'll know the reason why). Figuring out five w's is what this makes this show enjoyable. 
One interesting fact about Higurashi is that it is based on Visual Novel. Usually in VN adaptation studios either adapt only one arc or take good parts out of every arc and make it into one package. Higurashi, however, adapts all arcs in VN both bad and good ones each reset is essentially one ending. After each bad ending we know what went wrong after that we fix it and something else goes wrong. This continues are all pieces are placed correctly and then we get the good ending with I believe makes the ending even more satisfying.  

- # Characters:
Each character in Higurashi has a messed up past. Ranging from being tortured to death of parents etc... but despite that our characters are usually upbeat until something pisses them off after which they get cursed by Oyashiro-sama which drives them so nuts that they end up killing everyone and themselves by the time arc end that is the cotton drifting festival. 
I didn't like some characters at the beginning but when their past was explained I started to like them a bit. My main issue is the villain of the show without going into major spoilers I would say I did not like its villain at all. It is fairly easy to catch villain if you know what typical villains are you just won't know why but even that is cliche.   

- # Animation/Sound Track:
The animation of Higurashi is okay neither good or bad. The character design is moe like in the beginning but by the end of arc when curse starts to spread to give them a darker look character's expressions become exaggerated which has become a staple of yandere anime nowadays.

The soundtrack is really good and the main theme of the show is one of the best atmospheric OST I have heard. Unfortunately, the dub of this show is not good and this is coming from someone who likes watching dubs. I would suggest you go for sub it's not like Higurashi has great visuals you have to see therefore you can't watch sub.

- # Final Verdict:
Overall Higurashi is a very good show it is enjoyable and keeps you engaged for the most part. The OST of the show complements it well the only downside is animation and some characters. I have given S1 80 and S2 83. Both of them must be watched to fully understand the story.

I wrote this review on 10/02/2019 since this is October I think this is a really good time to start this show. It won't disappoint you."

Okay. Let me first say that the gayness in Yuru Yuri is more of a thing to embellish the main comedic core than what I'd call real romance. But hey, it's still a fun CGDCT show! And the other dated definition of gay means cheerful anyways, which fits the show, so yeah...I guess it's actually quite gay!

When there's a school club, and it's rightfully termed the Amusement Club, you know a whole lotta mischiefs are awaiting ahead of you. Mischiefs inside their club room. Mischiefs in the comfort of their homes. Mischiefs pretty much everywhere! For Kyouko, the founder of this amusing club, all she wants in life is to simply have fun and do whatever she wants. And you can bet that wild antic of hers ain't stopping anytime soon, as she drags Yui, Chinatsu, Ayano, Chitose, Sakurako, Himawari, and more girls down her fun-filled life. Little did they know they're about to undergo the wonderful process of yurification...

Ah right, there's Akarin too. Let's be sure not to forget about this poor girl

Anywho...where was I? The characters? Souka. Yuru Yuri is basically a hilarious mash-up of personalities given life in true moe fashion. Messing about and triggering all kinds of silly gags, those are really the only things they do each episode. It's just like what the name of their club implies: a show dedicated solely to amuse us and themselves, or well, Kyouko mostly. Because all these fun hilarities are emphasized against your typical slice-of-life setting, it's easy to indulge in their playful banters and get a giggle or two here and there...at worst! At best, you might wanna relax your lungs in case an uncontrollable laughter is about to ensue.

As if the comedy isn't enough already, the show thrives on its sweet girl-love moments, giving extra amusements, increased affections, and...uhh...some suggestively lewd stuff through Chitose's poor vision and nosebleeds. But I promise, it's nothing too extreme! About the only sexual thing outside the realm of imagination is with the whole oppai gag between the love-hate Sakurako and Himawari. Other than that, the yuri undertones here multiply the endearment to a whole another level. Packed full with flusters and blushes, the show is definitely not afraid to crumble me down with the power of kawaii.

While all these dimwits are great comically, I'm also fond of those heartwarming bits where things tone down slightly. You know, unless you love to be on the verge of death laughing all day long. Yuru Yuri's more level-headed girls, such as Yui and Ayano, have their moments where they talk good things about their friends and it's wholesome to see these slices of warmth. Even Chinatsu, a cute girl who may or may not be harboring some crazy personality, has her own moments too. It's not much, but it's certainly enough to get me more attached to them.

And life wouldn't be so much fun without its colorful shapes and sounds! Eyes so round they'll put a circle to shame. Voices so cute hearing one episode is enough to meet your daily sugar intake. Expressions so funny you'll...well, I'm sure you get what I mean already. All I'm saying is the chibi-looking art style, smooth animation, visual gags, emotive voice acting, and light background tunes work well together to create such a fun atmosphere. Even if they didn't put in any heart effects, it still feels like you can see hearts all over your screen. Truly the works of Moe Moe Kyun!

By the way, beware of the catchy opening and ending songs. The use of consonance with the show's name may give you earworms.

So yeah! What else are you waiting for? Go on and enter the Amusement Club and meet all the amusing girls of Yuru Yuri as they spend their days doing fun things together, with some enjoyable bits of homo-cuteness of course! It's about time Akarin greets you on the title scre—Oh...

I forgot to talk about her, didn't I? Whoopsie!

21006,"This, series is like Akame ga Kill where you will think about it even after its finished for at least a couple of days. For me, i bet ill think about it even after months or years because i can definetly see a little bit of real life inspiration here and there, story wise. Either that or the author was exceptionaly good at understanding the lives a lot of people live. Personalitys are all unique and not just the typical anime character types although they seem to be on the outside, although the main character is quite the edgelord and harem magnet on the outside, it does not hurt at all from my point of view for what he has been through, the looks and the experience (and humor). Im glad this anime or rather concept/story got so far as having multiple movies and seasons but im suprised that this anime, like for example Zankyo no Terror, Jormungand or a couple of other series is not really popular or heard of and easily forgotten in todays typical anime. This anime earned a that high score because of what i felt, the way it catched me and my friends while watching it, the humor and funny moments that anime had, the decently fleshed out characters, the crazy (and a bit shenanigan) but impressive story and story telling and how it threw in the gunplay, even if its nothing like Jormungand or Upotte. The things that have been bothering me however is that its pretty much almost the best possible ending you could ask for which kind of made it more or less predictable how the anime would turn out (like a certain series called SAO where you dont have to worry about the main character dying because of overpowering him). The first and noww this season had a lot to teach aswell and a couple of smal life lessons which this time, arent even cringe.  My final thoughts on this are: This anime is one of my favorites so far and i bet something like that wont appear for a very long time because of how the world currently handles anime and adaptations etc. But Wonder Egg Priority and Vivy seem to prove otherwise, luckly for now...this is probably one of the few or even the only review ill ever write on here...well this anime is extremyl inspiring for what im planning to do and a decent reference for future...lets say creations. And if you have read this far ...im kinda interessted in what the hell we would talk about in a smal talk or discord call to be fairly honest because its definetly narrowing the people down that dont care reading things like this. So if you definetly did, youre just pog and i hope ill maybe get to talk to you somewhere.

If you just want to know how good this anime is: 

IT MADE ME WRITE OVER 2.2k WORDS JUST TO MAKE THIS TEXT AN REVIEW SO WATCH IT BECAUSE YOURE NOT GOING TO COME ACROSS SOMETHING OF THIS CALIBER FOR A LONG TIME."
21517,"It’s kinda weird, seeing these low ratings for such a stupid anime, but that’s expected. I feel like this show shouldn't have gotten a below 7 score, but I guess too much stupidity really affects it all.

I’ll say it right now, this show is dumb. Like, really dumb. But it keeps its fun.

I have read the manga and I know the events that are coming out as they unfold, but seeing it animated is a beauty to see. Don’t take this seriously. If you try to analyze and try to criticize this anime, well, you will succeed. You’ll find a lot of flaws with everything and find it easy to criticize it.

This over-the-top harem parody anime is somewhat a nice fresh of air as it’s great to just sit down and laugh your ass off, because a comedy like this is quite hard to come by.

The story itself is already dumb, it’s about a kiss note (clearly not a death note reference right?) which allows love to bloom once names have been written and those 2 people kiss. Guri, who is the “cupid”, has been put in charge of it. Seiji, our main character, has been pulled into a situation that any man would die for, but it is a living hell. 

Seiji’s crush is Akane, a yandere who also has feelings for Seiji. Guri writes those 2 names, they kiss, and boom easy relationship. Things seem to coast along just fine, until more girls come in. We have run away Yuzu, as well as Best Girl Shikimi. Those names are all written into the harem. Apparently you become immortal once you’re written into the book and gain powers, which is good cause if not for that trait, Seiji would’ve died already.

So what happens when Seiji and Akane gets written into a book…Oh, plus like 3 other girls including Guri? Well, you get the harem that you would always want, but looking at the anime, it would make yo have second thoughts.

You gotta feel bad for Seiji at least a little. He has the weirdest harem any man can hope to have, and he tries his best to treat them with kindness, despite the differences in their personality. But sometimes that kindness doesn't bode well with some of the girls.

Of course this anime is not all comedy. There aren't certain points of the anime where it gets you thinking, and there are like tiny hints of drama in some parts. It takes on the topic with love most of the time, and coming to realize what love is and if you have feelings for someone. It’s interesting to see how the characters interact with each other in terms of love, but you can clearly see some characters trying to decide who they really want, but some, they seem pretty open about it (like very open).


With the comedy, the slight drama, and the romantic realizations, Renai Boukun was able to deliver these certain aspects that make the story more enjoyable.

Now I was quite surprised to see the studio behind this, and they haven't done many anime’s before. Some of their works are shorts, and some are just, not that good.

I was kinda satisfied with their adaptation, although not “completely” faithful in terms of faithfulness, or just reorganization (which i’m pretty ok with)

The art style really gives you a nickelodeon feel for some reason, the character design just feels cartoony it’s so weird XD. But of course, I got used to it over the time. But It’s pretty average and it stands out quite a bit.

The sound track really fits all the scenes that it has. Not to mention the very catchy OP and ED. So I do like the soundtrack, but I wish there was more. I did hear some or lots of repeats, or maybe that’s just me.

With Seiji and his harem, they need to solve conflicts together, and some characters have some thoughts on what their heart really desires.

So why should you watch Renai Boukun? 
-Pretty great comedy with “many” stupid facial expressions
-Good deliverance with their story and how it’s presented
-A Yandere, and a Sadist Masochist in one anime
-A Funny Parody of Death Note
-Catchy OP, ED, and overall Soundtrack
-Touches on the seriousness of Romance
-Guri is basically a yaoi lover
-A Pretty Good Harem Series
-An interesting cast of characters

Now of course, this anime isn't the best, and it’s pretty average for its case. However, this parody, harem, and comedic type of anime is sometimes a nice catch to come upon.

If you happen to like a nice parody, serious romance/comedic romance, harem, yanderes, sadists/masochists, funny faces, or very over-the top humour, then sit back, relax, and enjoy this cluster of madness."
486,"Kino’s Journey (Kino no Tabi) is a masterful collection of short stories which ingeniously explore the thought-provoking, socio-political issues faced by independent countries with distinctive cultures. Whether the country is big or small, rich or poor, authoritarian or libertarian; nothing is off the table – allowing for the multitude of countries’ philosophical underpinnings to be construed to their fullest potential by the audience, whilst also having their true purposes left deliberately ambiguous by the creators, so to allow for the audience to interpret the moral messages in a meaningful way.

These stories are told through the eyes of the observant, young, androgynous female traveller, Kino – the protagonist – who appears to take a rather laissez-faire stance towards the struggles of the people in the majority of countries she embarks. Hence, Kino is a character almost entirely lacking any desire to change the world around her. Although this may normally be portrayed as negative, and can be a little bit frustrating, here, this only helps to heighten the audience’s appreciation of the show, as it allows us to self-insert and breathe in the magnificence of the beautiful world. Furthermore, this also serves to let the stories of these countries play out naturally; as Kino usually has little, if nil, influence over the story as a whole. However, when necessary, Kino’s quick-wit and impressive marksmanship allow her to take any necessary action against threats that seek to cut her journey short, be it for the best or worst. On the other hand, Hermes – Kino’s trusted motorrad (a motorbike) and sidekick – often aids to lighten the show’s sinister tone through his rather humorous misunderstanding of common human phrases, whilst also furthering our understanding of the different countries in his own, subtle, quirky way.

Kino and Hermes’ relationship is a tragic telling of selfish loneliness. Upon Kino’s meeting with Hermes, we are starkly informed of their means for unification; “I’ll give him balance, and he will give me speed.” We realise that the two cannot function without one another, which strikingly illustrates the profound sense of travel that the two crave, as Kino is willing to risk her life to journey with a single companion, who is simply glad to be ridden. Although Kino is happy, it is hard to feel that way for her, as her hidden isolation makes us question the critical choices she has made in her life.

What is arguably most interesting about the show is its sluggish pace, which contrasts with the ruthless sins juxtaposed on screen. Even though there is plenty of gunfire, the show manages to hold true to itself and avoid plunging through the gaping hole into pure action. There are a few episodes, which I believe are worse than the rest, that rely too heavily on action to push their messages, but are so few and far between, that they do not steal from the show’s overall enjoyment at all. 

Due to the nature of the show, the unpleasantness of many countries and the various aspects of the human condition, with all of its flaws, is hyperbolised to such an extent that it may feel as if the show is enforcing some sort of biased message on the audience – even though this is not the case. This may be a concern for a few, but I thought that the borderline amusing, yet tragic exaggeration worked incredibly well, as it helped to bring the show’s obscure messages to the forefront. 

It must be noted that what will become apparent early on to newcomers is the show’s fairly odd art style. The show is from 2003, which, subsequently, makes it a little bit outdated for today’s standards. The character designs are all very simplistic, the scenery is drab and there is a lack of fluidity in animation. However, this is still an incredibly charming and pleasant experience, which cannot be found elsewhere easily. The art style is consistent and never strays away from what has been established. Furthermore, the use of the interlaced video effect gives the show a coat of distinctiveness that I have yet to see used as effectively elsewhere. Despite this, it can be hard to convince people who only watch new, mainstream anime to watch an old show or one with a unique art style, as it is not the same as what they are used to. If you happen to be one of these people, please do not be turned off by this show’s individuality. You will definitely get used to it, and you will regret dropping it over something so petty. 

Similarly, whilst we are on the topic of the show’s production quality, the sound design – although not particularly impressive – helps to maintain the show’s seriousness and maturity. The voice acting, especially for Kino and Hermes, is solid. None of the characters’ voices come off as unrealistic, which retains the show’s down to earth atmosphere. The background music is practically non-existent, yet this is not a negative. Throughout the whole show, the absence of music actually meant that there was not one situation in which it felt like music was missing. This, subsequently, meant that when the sparingly used music was utilised, it ended up having the clever effect of locking the audience’s attention towards certain key scenes, highlighting their importance.

To conclude, regardless of some of Kino’s Journey’s downsides, it has been made clear that this well-written and important show is deserving of your time and thought. The show does not shy away from dark themes – with the insincerity and ignorance of man constantly leading to abhorrent suffering being just one reoccurring theme. However, at the heart of all this agony is a definitive road of hope. Despite the dangers, we are encouraged to begin our own journey, to take to the sky and fly with the birds. As we peak into the livelihoods of those who miraculously live, we cannot help but feel enlightened in humanities’ duality.

>“I wonder…what they are doing right now. There were seven men who survived rather grand days at the bottom of the cauldron of hell, inside a cell, fifty years ago.


 Dark, gritty, and powerful is how i would describe this show. the dark tone of this anime leaves almost no time for any comedy. this show is a good portrayal of post WWII Japan and of general Japanese-American sentiment. its a story of 7 friends facing lifes struggles by sticking with each other till the end even in the most cruelest moments of tragedy. Trust is something that is earned. This anime teaches you that even though people and this world may be cruel, there is a friend in this world that you are destined to meet. This friend will always have your back and stick with you through the very end. Even if you do not have that friend right now, this anime becomes that comfort for you.

it is not one of those animes you watch for its escapism or happy entertainment value, its one of those Animes with serious themes and really makes you contemplate and ponder about the brutal realities in life. Rainbow is categorised in the Seinen genre as it does unquestionably appeal to a mature male demographic because of the grim, dark and rebellious undertone throughout the series, so be warned about its explicit imagery considering there are many explicit scenes highlighting rpe, torture, psychological abuse and more.

every character is fleshed out in the 2nd part of the show. while alot of people may have had a problem with a 2nd half becomes of something that happened. i had no problem with it and thought it still maintained the good vibes from this anime. I loved all the seven characters and the character development is really awesome I lived with each one  of every moment and I enjoyed every part of it. the villians are literally pure evil and the designs makes them look like fucking devils.

now lets tak about sakuragi or ""an chan/bro"" the best character

img800()

the man, the bro, the gigachad an chan is the oldest of the seven inmates. a troubled man who has learnt to live looking forward, a character with a huge heart and street wisedom that fights every single day to find a bit of happiness in this dark world. He's pretty well developed and is easy to feel him as a natural leader while he guides the boys through that dark path. strong benevolent young man who is treasured by his friends and considered a role model to them and to myself. he quickly gains their respect in a short period of time. he gets beat up by the guards for the sake of his friends and somehow gets used to it. i liked his arc more than the others.Sakuragi knowing of a dark secret that unfolded years ago in the Reform Jail. Is haunted endlessly by a corrupt guard & perverted Doctor, who's goal is nothing more than keep that dark secret from reaching the light of day. Forcing Sakuragi in an empty life behind bars. Following this exhilarating story of the bonds of friendship, dreams, & the struggle for survival.

Art and sound:

MADHOUSE is madhouse after all. the art fits perfectly with the tone of the series. the animation isnt that bad as well with gorgeous music and a banger opening. the visual style has atmosphere and the painterly stills during key moments are gorgeous, full of emotion. opening is awesome and makes you hyped up to watch the anime and the ending is a good cool down song that makes you just want to process everything that's happened. The OSTs are also very memorable and fitting.

if i break down some of the negatives it would probably be that there are some corny scenes that got me cringe the entire time but really the realistic characters are truly what makes this anime special.

this anime uses the same concept as Shawshank Redemption, Prison Break, Green Mile, all these fantastic dramas have one thing in common: prison. Prison is naturally going to pull viewers in, but why, I don't know. Perhaps its the despair people feel when they are stripped of everything, even their dignity, and how they struggle to survive in their hostile environment. Or maybe its the strong bonds created through prisoners holding on to hope by sharing it with prisoners who understand the pain and sorrow. Whatever the case may be, Rainbow is nothing short of a great prison drama.

Final thoughts:

i enjoyed this alot more than i thought i would, while i wouldnt consider it as a masterpiece, it was a very beautiful mature story. and definitely one of the better animes out their that deserves more recognition. Rainbow gives us the light at the end of the tunnel at just the right times and the strength of the friendship and bond between the seven boys powers the viewer through all the despair. It connects us to the characters even more and you truly end up sympathizing and rooting for these guys throughout the show. It truly is awe-inspiring how the guys kept a positive outlook even in the worst of circumstances. Some elements I particularly liked about this Anime such as the calm demeanour of the narration within the Anime, I felt, added to an effectively compelling atmosphere they were trying to depict and the range of colours and props used throughout the Anime also contributed to an already fixed tonal nature and represents its time period commendably.

TL;DR: good shit plus bros before hoes"
45,"The story of atonement for past sins is a subject often explored in various works of art. A quick look at the synopsis of this series tells us that this story is no different. Set during the early Meiji era, a former assassin, now a wandering swordsman named Himura Kenshin wielding a non-lethal blade, offering protection and aid to those in need. The recurring theme in the anime is Kenshin's oath not to kill, when facing fanatics and revolutionists who are willing to die for their cause.

img360()

The anime, also known as Samurai X, first aired in the winter season of 1996, in a time when Neon Genesis Evangelion, Slam Dunk and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing aired, just to name a few. Rurouni Kenshin is one of the more popular series of the 90s. The anime can be chopped up into three parts: The Introduction Arc, the Kyoto Arc and the Filler Arc. I think it is important to describe each part individually.



The Introduction Arc, the first 27 episodes, are a bunch of shorter stories, where the cast and era are being introduced and about a third of them are filler episodes. Most if not all of these filler episodes are simply skippable, you could describe some of these as 'gag-episodes'. They are pretty bad and simply there to slow the anime down from catching up to the manga, because the manga was still being made at the time. I must say that there is a lot of criticism on the filler episodes and for good reason, the comedy is pretty repetitive, there is never any real danger, and the characters become caricatures of their own selves. I would suggest skipping the early filler episodes entirely.



The Kyoto Arc, episodes 28 to 62, is where the anime truly shines. Without spoiling the story, the stakes are at an all time high when a mighty warlord threatens the peace in Japan. The story takes a more serious turn and cuts no corners in terms of animation. This is immediately noticeable in the first episodes of the arc, when an old rival of Kenshin makes his appearance and sets the mood for the rest of the arc. The introduction of this anti-hero shifts the entire tone of the story from a more dreamy, idealistic goody-two-shoes can never lose to a more ruthless and realistic approach of dealing with your problems, even if it means abandoning everything you represent and fight for. You don't always get to choose and you don't always get it your way. To live in peace you sometimes need to get your hands dirty.




I wouldn't blame anyone for stopping after the Kyoto Arc, because it's pretty much downhill from here. Episodes 63 to 94 are a few episodic filler stories and three longer filler stories, all pretty disappointing. The first features a swordman using the same style as Kenshin, the second story is about black knights and the third is about warring clans of feng shui users. Nothing worth your time here except maybe the opening, which they changed to show the filler's antagonists in the flickering flame effect. Despite promising starts of the first two of these filler stories, I felt like it never truly becomes engaging and I lost interest pretty fast.



There is more to the story of Kenshin, unfortunately it would never be translated from manga to anime as the show was cancelled while the manga was still being made. I would recommend reading the manga after the Kyoto Arc, because the final arc is absolutely worth it. Also with two new movies releasing in the summer of 2020, concluding the story of Kenshin with the 'missing final arc' and the new sequel manga of Kenshin's travels to Hokkaido, there should be plenty of new material for fans. But, do not miss out on this show! It captures the spirit of Kenshin in a way no adaption afterwards was able to.



I can highly recommend Kenshin for it's cannon material. It is a must-watch show if you like intense samurai action. The show features some cool techniques and powers and it does not have the problem of escalating power levels. Overall I feel the story of Kenshin deserved better. I would give the Kyoto Arc a 9, but that would be too high of a rating for all 94 episodes."

 Lieutenant loli is back, and she’s still the most spiteful atheist of the 20th century. This movie takes a look at both the offensive and defensive battles Tanya Degurechaff fights for the Imperial army. Instead of showcasing the horrors of war, the movie instead focuses on the chaos and destruction of each battle. Usually no match for any enemy, Tanya and her unit suddenly face an actually challenging foe in the form of numbers and a certain vengeful individual. But of course, going from salaryman, to warmonger, to strategist, and scariest of all a child, Degurechaff won’t let anyone stand in her way of a dream job in the rear lines.

Overview

Plot: Solid, good at showing battle(7.3/10)

Characters: Same as the show, with a new basic vengeful woman (7.3/10)

Visuals: Great animation on the fight scenes(8.2/10)

Audio: Good timing is the only thing it's got going for it (7.2/10)

Enjoyment: Pretty good I guess (8.5/10)

Plot (7.3/10)

It was alright. It wasn’t bad, but there wasn’t anything outstanding about it either. The emotions of the soldiers were mostly brushed over, save but a few instances such as when celebrating victory or a few moments when they’re in the trenches. Battlefields are the natural habitat of a frontline warmonger like Tanya, and I feel like the movie did a great job of portraying the chaos of combat, with bullets whizzing past, shells exploding seemingly at random, brimstone from above, and hellfire from beneath, with war cries and screams. Other than that I honestly can’t praise it or rebuke anything. It did its job, it was entertaining, solidly written, but overall lackluster.

Characters: (7.3/10)

I’m assuming you’ve seen the first season, and therefore are somewhat familiar with most of the characters already. You got: spiteful loli, bubbly underling, plot fodder subordinates, that one guy, and some grumpy old man. The audience is introduced to a new antagonist relatively early on, and she may have been alluded to in the original series but I don’t remember. Anyways, she’s your basic “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" type person who is somehow incompetent but also extremely overpowered through the magic that is vengeful spite and willpower. A few other people are introduced, but she’s the only one consequential enough to mention. Like I said before, well written, definitely not bad, but pretty average compared to most other anime.

Visuals (8.2/10)

Pretty dang good actually. There’s a lot of flying and fight scenes, and they’re all detailed. The camerawork (I don’t know if I should call it camerawork since there’s not technically a camera) is really well done, and does a good job of showcasing the ariel battles. It’s constantly showing different angles and rotating a bit to get a full picture of everything going on, while also not being overly busy. There's one scene near the end when they're flying through a city, and it was, well, good enough for me to mention here. Animation wise, everything’s also pretty solid, especially when fighting, which is like half the movie. The color scheme is well suited to the theme, and backgrounds have a decent amount of effort.

Audio (7.2)

I thought the music did a good job of capturing the emotions of the scenes, which was needed especially since the rest of the focus seemed to be directed elsewhere. The sound effects were also kind of satisfying. Both those things were perfectly used in the right times and places, however, good timing and a few particularly nice effects and pieces is all the movie has going for it in this aspect.

Enjoyment (8.5)

Despite it sounding like I’m just calling this movie average with a few redeemable qualities, I did enjoy it. Was I on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen, anxious to know what happens next? Kinda. I mean, it’s good, at the risk of sounding redundant, not great. It's not something that's going to leave an impact on me where I'll be thinking about it months from now, but at the same time I can't say anything bad about it. Luckily, a movie doesn’t need to check all the boxes of whatever criteria there is to be entertaining and watchable. It was solid the whole way through, and while having some room for improvement, there was even less for critique."
16762,"This is a review based on my own opinon of the Future Diaries (Mirai Nikki) anime. If you agree or disagree with the review and opinions below, please message me or start a thread. I would love to hear all viewpoints and what you liked or didn't like about the OVA or show as a whole.

In my full and honest opinion, from what I got from this show is that as we are following the ""protagonists"" of the show. We start to see them fall from grace and turn bad.


Let's start with Yuki: In the beginning, all the diary users they must defeat are murders, terrorists, cult leaders, and genuine sociopaths. But as the show goes on, the people Yuki and Yuno battle are relatable people who are not an antagonist. A cop who wants to bring his son back and even a poor pacifist old lady who just takes care of orphans. But Yuki, under the belief that he can just bring everyone back after he kills them, gains the courage to kill, even more passive and innocent diary users. His ignorance and arrogance gets to the point where he mows down his friends who aren't even trying to kill him and warn him about Yuno. 

Now on to Yuno: She is the true antagonist of this show, starting off as the generic crazy girlfriend type, before we learn her backstory and discover that she truly is the victim of unfortunate circumstance. While a victim, the actions she takes from suffering cross the boundaries of what is ok and out of line, as her madness and selfishness boil over, fearing loosing Yuki again.

As the show goes on, it becomes difficult to identify who the protagonist is, and not really providing an easy answer for the who is the enemy. While at the end Yuno and Yuki were able to somewhat redeem themselves, or at least face up to their mistakes, both have committed sins and atrocities that deserve punishment, which I felt the end of Future Diaries gave them. Yuki is forever banished to live with his actions and face the consequences of what he has done, with Yuno will forget all that has happened, and in a way, be reborn, with the old Yuno dying, while her alternate self will live a normal life. 


This OVA seeks to change the end, and give Yuno and Yuki a more happy ending, with them able to reunite finally, and while some may enjoy this end, it can't help but feel my stomach twist and turn doing this special. Yuki does not deserve a happy ending, and Yuno doesn't either, there actions are not noble, and the journey to get to each other with covered with mistakes and actions of a villain. The actions taken in the back of their minds were justified, a means to a greater good. In fact, if in the same circumstance, many of us, may have taken the same actions they did. That's what was great about the show, it made you think: ""How far would I go to save a friend? A family member? A lover?"" That's what was so interesting (terrifying) about the show, is how it made you realize how far you would go, make you wonder if I saw what I had to do to get back the one I love, could I live with myself or look at myself the same?

I relate this show a lot to the Joker movie, specifically the character Arthur Fleck. Without going into to much detail (or spoilers), Arthur is a character that, while the focus of the movie, is not a hero. We see his life, we understand his actions, we know it is not his fault where he is, and so we do not cheer to see the rise of Joker, but cry at the fall of Arthur. Much like the show, we are not watching the rise of Yuki to be reunited with his lover, we are watching the fall of an innocent boy who lost his way due to terrible circumstance.



On the production side: this OVA does not dip in animation, character writing, music, or anything else we are use to in the Future Diaries series, so if you are worried about an OVA that doesn't match the quality of the original show, have no fear, it feels like an episode straight out the anime.


The main show isn't a great anime, nor is it one I say is bad and I regret watching, but this OVA to me, destroyed the core message and tone of what the show led to, changing the ending from a bitter sweet end of the death game with no true winner, to a victory for two characters who frankly, did not deserve the win. It is because of this, that I personally did not enjoy this OVA.

If you like the ending to the OVA, that is totally fine. From what I've seen, a lot of people seemed to really enjoy this OVA and ending it brought. I just wanted to provide a different perspective to what someone got out of the Future Diaries OVA."

 Illustrations for Texhnolyze, Haibane Renmei and Serial Experiments Lain by Yoshitoshi ABe.

Discovered by avant-garde anime producer Yasuyuki Ueda, it was quickly recognized that Yoshitoshi ABe's talents reach far beyond his stunning illustration skills when he was entrusted with increasing creative control early in his anime career. Starting as character designer for the mind-bending and introspective cyberpunk classic Serial Experiments Lain, ABe was subsequently given the opportunity to adapt two of his dōjinshi manga into animated form with the help of Ueda as a producer: first with the little-known NieA under 7, which was co-produced by ABe, and finally with his masterpiece Haibane Renmei, for which he served as main showrunner. Concurrently to his work on the latter, ABe also served as character designer for his hitherto final collaboration with Ueda, the notoriously difficult Texhnolyze, another dark and cryptic cyberpunk drama written by Lain author Chiaki J. Konaka. The creative output of the Ueda coalition has since been recognized as ranking among the most unique and groundbreaking works the world of serialized animation has to offer. It cannot be overstated how much said world has lost when this creative streak was tragically cut short by the untimely death of Lain director Ryūtarō Nakamura in 2013, who was supposed to direct a spiritual sequel by the name of Despera. Stuck in development hell ever since (though with the occasional Twitter confirmation that the project is still alive), Despera would have marked the reunion of much of the Lain crew, including Konaka and ABe. 

As it stands, the Ueda coalition is mostly known for Lain, Texhnolyze and Renmei. The fact that ABe served as scenario creator and showrunner for the latter makes it the obvious odd one out: Renmei is without a doubt the most approachable of these works, although without sacrificing any of the integrity and thoughtfulness that these works have come to be known for. ABe also replaces Konaka's grim cyberpunk settings with a gentle but no less enigmatic magical realist world inspired by Haruki Murakami's Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and he even borrows some of Murakmai's more typical motifs such as the psychological turmoil caused by the sudden vanishing of a loved one and the symbolic power and strange allure of dried-out wells. Despite those inspirations from Japan's best-selling author, Haibane Renmei absolutely boasts its own distinctive identity and firmly stands as one of the most unique works in the anime canon.

 The quiet town of Glie. Not visible are the surrounding walls, as they enclose quite a large area.

The 13-episode show tells the story of a small community of mysterious beings called the Haibane (Charcoal Feathers), who are visually reminiscent of angels and born into cocoons with cryptic dreams of their former lives as humans. Living in the outskirts of the serene, isolated, European-style town of Glie, the Haibane are tasked with integrating into human society and submitting to the ancient traditions of the secretive but not unsympathetic Haibane Renmei (Charcoal Feather Association). The symbolic character designs of the Haibane, combined with the fact that Glie is metaphysically isolated from the rest of the world by dangerous and impenetrable walls, quickly makes it clear that we are looking at some sort of liminal stage of the afterlife here, though I hesitate to use the word ""purgatory"" due to its associations with temporary punishment and suffering. In any case, this show strikes quite a remarkable balance between gradually revealing just enough of the layers of its fascinating world to spark the viewer's intrigue and leaving the rest open to interpretation. This may be perceived as a weakness by viewers expecting more straightforward answers, but I consider this kind of deliberate ambiguity to be an essential component for the show's tonal and thematic success.

While the first half of Haibane Renmei is mostly delivered in a slow and relaxing slice of life format to introduce the town and its characters, the second half ventures to some quite emotionally dark places, so much so that I have included a content warning at the end of this review. It also dives deep into the psychology of its two most important characters: Rakka, the protagonist in search of answers as the newest of the Haibane, and Reki, the experienced, older sister figure whose kind nature hides a troubled past. The relationship formed by these two and the subtle but profound character arcs they experience rank among the most acutely devastating but also deeply hopeful I have seen.

The thematic thrust of the show revolves around issues of sin, salvation and purpose, as well as the complex relationship between mutual dependence and support, which is expertly conveyed via outstanding character writing and worldbuilding alike. Glie is presented as a warm and comforting place, a sanctuary for lost souls to grow and learn important truths about themselves. However, it is also a stagnant and limiting place, from which always looms the danger of the Haibane growing too accustomed to the comfort and not making it to the next stage of their spiritual journey. Nonetheless, it is clear that there is nothing that this show wants more than for its characters to find the strength to reach their ""Day of Flight"" and ascend beyond Glie's walls, so much so that I consider it to be one of the most profoundly empathetic and earnest works in this medium.

 Reki and her charcoal grey feathers.

Aesthetically, there is an understated, rustic beauty to the show's visuals that should not go unmentioned. That said, the technical quality of the production suffers a bit from the inexperience of the early days of anime's digipaint revolution, which occasionally results in sloppy animation and a generally blurred look. Despite those shortcomings, the show's visuals do a fairly good job evoking the distinct mood of ABe's work as an illustrator and mangaka, which is not easy to translate into animated form. While his illustrations prominently feature character designs that are not particularly atypical for modern anime and manga, he imbues them with an acutely spellbinding and otherworldly quality that makes his work instantly recognizable. 

Unhindered by technical flaws is the gorgeous, pastoral chamber music soundtrack by Kow Otani, best known as the composer for one of the most iconic and acclaimed video games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus. I don't bring up this title in vain, as Haibane Renmei feels very spiritually connected to the unmistakable atmosphere, aesthetics, worldbuilding and thematic ambition of Fumito Ueda's Team Ico trilogy, which also includes the highly influential ICO and the underappreciated The Last Guardian. In fact, if there is one thing I wish this show had explored more thoroughly, it is the setting. I feel like there is some untapped potential for additional moments of breathtaking scenery and ancient architecture lurking in here, something that the Team Ico trilogy offers in spades. Apart from this little nitpick and the previously mentioned technical difficulties, there is really not much to critique here. Quiet, thoughtful, and deeply therapeutic, Haibane Renmei is a must-see for anyone who is feeling a little lost.

! Heavy implications of suicide, so much so that it can be considered a major theme of the show. !"
21825,"Note: This review is only covering the Despair Arc and not the Future Arc.


 Intro  

I never have written an anime review before nor did I ever plan to but after seeing no reviews for this show at the time I am writing this, I decided to give it a shot. So bear with me. 

Danganronpa is a franchise that I am going through right now and I have been enjoying it. I played through the first and second games and decided to skip over Ultra Despair Girls because, well, for no reason in particular. As per the usual path, I decided to watch the animes after finishing DR2. Let me be extremely clear about this, you NEED to play the games to enjoy the animes at all. Since the setting of Danganronpa is so complex, reading a summary of the games will not do you justice. Furthermore, there will be jokes in the anime that will seem to make no sense or seem very odd if you have not played the games. Finally, the games are fun so you should try them. There will be SPOILERS for the first two games and the anime ahead. 


 Plot  

Let me start with a quick synopsis. The Despair Arc details the events leading up to The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History. It explains how Junko Enoshima got control of Hope's Peak Academy by initiating The Tragedy of Hope's Peak Academy and causing the Reserve Course students to rise up. The transformation of Hajime Hinata into Izuru Kamukura is also explained.

I came into this anime with a lot of excitement as I had just finished DR2 so my expectations were quite high. I actually didn't expect the show to meet my expectation (and it never did) but the Despair Arc is still a decent show. Ignoring the anime-original characters and their plotlines for a moment, there wasn't anything that I didn't expect due to the fact the events leading up to The Tragedy were explained within DR1 and DR2. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed watching them take place rather than just reading about them. I loved watching interactions within the 77th Class and seeing how Junko slowly extended her control over the school. Despite this, I still have three major problems with this show.


The Twilight Murder Syndrome Case was extremely boring. This can probably be attributed to the fact that I already knew everything about the case and who killed who, so it ruined the mystery. Although I understand that it had to be included, it still was a boring arc. 

The way that the Remnants of Despair were formed was terrible. Coming into this anime I was expecting that Junko would win the school over due to her charisma or some other method and not due to some brainwashing video. I was disappointed by this boring and unoriginal explanation. 

My biggest gripe with this anime, was The Tragedy of Hope's Peak High School scene. Coming from a person who believes he is already desensitized with violence and gore, I was shocked by this scene. The grizzly way the people were killed was horrifying. I hate to go into detail about how the people were killed, but if you want to refresh your memory you can watch this Youtube video (at your own risk). 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu7q1MlP-c)

I understand why this was included, but this was way too far. A simple before and after scene would have worked fine. I even think the way Chiaki died, which many already consider quite shocking, was not as half as bad as this. 

 


With the anime-original characters, that were originally introduced in the Future Arc, seeing their history at the academy is interesting. I especially liked the fourth episode which told of the three students' expulsion from the academy as well as the twist where Chisa is shown to actually be a Remnant of Despair. Nothing really stood out to me as bad in the plotlines not explained in DR1 or DR2. 


 Characters  

I have mixed feelings about the characters in this show. As I stated earlier, I loved seeing the interactions between the members of the 77th Class, but Nagito basically carries them. He is my favorite character from the first and second games so when the writers decided to remove him I was furious. I was even more furious when he came back after a supposedly long absence and have absolutely nothing change about him. What was even the point of removing him? Junko is even worse. At first, she's bearable but then she just gets outright annoying as her personality NEVER  changes (I get that's kinda a paradox because her personality is that she has many personalities but you get what I mean). Her insanity isn't even close to being entertaining as Nagito's so it's very painful to watch. I understand that the writers couldn't change her personality because it was already established within the games, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't have added something extra to make her character more enjoyable. 

On the other hand, Chiaki proves to be a great character as well as Hajime, and seeing their friendship as well as Hajime's transformation was something that I always looked forward to watching. As for the anime-original characters, the dysfunctional relationship between the Ultimate Pharmacist and the Ultimate Confectioner and Ryota being manipulated by Junko were both very enjoyable. 


 Sound/Animation 

As for the sound and animation, there isn't much to note other than that it was mediocre. Reusing the Danganronpa OST and keeping with the Danganronpa art style was to be expected. 


 Conclusion  

The Despair Arc was a good show that was enjoyable to watch but with some flaws. I'd probably never rewatch it simply due to the fact that there are better shows to watch. However, the Danganronpa 3 animes are certainly a must-watch for anyone advancing through the Danganronpa franchise."
9617,"K-On is one of the most well-known slices of life out there and, in my opinion, it's popularity is fair. Despite being an incredibly simple show in plot terms its characters make it shine and be very enjoyable and fun.
Specifically talking about this film I think it's the pinnacle of the series, showing all what it can deliver and with astonishing visuals and direction. In this review I will try to express why I think that way in a (probably) very vague way. I'll try to make it spoiler free (and putting spoiler tags when necessary) so you can read without worrying. Sorry about my english mistakes, as always!
 
All of this being said, I hope you like my thoughts on it and let's start!


As I said, K-On does not shine because of a complex or even an incredibly well thought plot. It's, in fact, pretty simple and only serving to the characters. But this movie, despite mantaining the master-lines used in the show, gives a more interesting view on it. The plot in the movie is now more focused on music, the girls relationship and their adventures (in this case travelling abroad to London!) and less on drinking tea all the time (while watching the show I'd have liked to see less of it to have more of the other). 

Has to be said that the movie is little inconsistent (at the beginning) with the introductory OVA, thing that annoyed me a little bit. Why would they make an OVA that would be practically discarded in the proper movie? Idk, but I felt that they did that. Some other little issues are present on this movie (like some akward scenes in terms of ¿logic? but I think they dont really lack the whole movie. 

Some spoilers here, commenting a little more on the events of the movie:
!This movie sets between the last chapters of the Season 2, when the 4 older girls prepare a song to little Azusa. I think the travelling abroad experience with K-On girls' pesonality is probably one of the best ideas to end the franchise. I has a LOT of fun moments in the process of adaptating to live in another country (only for a week as tourists!) and also a little bit of drama associated with composing the song for Azusa. The perfect example is the Sushi Bar misunderstanding with (to me best girl) Ritsu talking confidently her Engrish. 
img(

I gotta say that I enjoyed a lot more the last scene when they perform in front of her here in the movie than in the second season just because of the building. !

Nothing much else to say about it, it's a really fun story that appeals the show perfectly, with the right amount of comedy and the little drama, couldn't think about a better plot on this movie. 



The characters on K-On are its essence and its absolute nuclei. In fact all the plot orbits around them and their crazy ideas. Again they're not intrincated or very complex but serve perfectly for the tag ""Cute Girls doing Cute Things"". They portray a healthy and heart-warming teen friendship and all what it can contribute to one's life. This is pretty clear with the (apparently) main protagonist, Yui. 

Specifically on this film, they seem to evolve a little bit more in their relationship and also show their silliest side to our entertainment. As I already said on the plot part there are a lot of fun scenes that are possible because of the travel mood and their reactions to all what's happening around them. 

Characters are, as I said, essencial on this series because they're the core of it. They give you the feels, they make you laugh and they're the ones making the plot move (instead, there's no plot without them but they could be there with a different plot). 

I'll make little comments on the main characters and their role on this movie: 

1. Yui Hirasawa: The silliest and clumsiest of all  the girls, but kindhearted as no one. Personally my least favorite of the 5 main girls but still very likeable.
!She's the main character dealing with Azusa on their plan of composing her a song. As clumsy as she is, Azusa gets a lof of hints from her and makes her worry, but she tries to make Azusa clear that she (they) love her. !

1. Azusa Nakano: The little girl of the group and also the most serious of them. Very basic but still very likeable, like all the cast. 
!She's the main focus on this movie because of the song they are composing for her. I felt a little bad for her because she was worrying but knew the reward she was going to get. I liked her evolution from strict and serious to a more relaxed version of her. !

1. Ritsu Tainaka: My personal favorite on the movie and the whole series. She's the most prankster but also has a serious side inside her. I like her view on music and nearly all of her scenes on this movie. 

1. Mio Akiyama: The best vocalist of the group, his songs are fire. She's easy to scare and also very shy but very concerned about her friends. It's the character i resemble the most. 

1. Tsumugi Kotobuki: Our sweet and kindhearted pickle-eyebrowed rich girl. She's probably the cutest of the group and enjoys really much every little moment with her friends, portraying that healthy friendship I commented before.

The instruments they play suits them quite good and are well choosen. I really don't have nearly anything wrong to say about the characters, they're the essence of K-On and they are irreplaceable.




In this movie music is one of the protagonists alongside the characters. I really like it since I expected a little more of it in the previous seasons and got a little bit annoyed (even though I enjoyed them pretty much). Now in the movie we have more live concerts and all the band having fun playing music together. 

The music composed by Houkago Tea Time is varied; I like more the songs where Mio is the vocalist because of her stronger voice, but sincerely I like all their songs (I personally love ""No, Thank You"" and ""Listen!, from the previous seasons). 

The voice acting is perfect imo, just as in all the series. A pretty good job incarnating those peculiar characters in their adventures on Europe.




When I watched the movie I got astonished by the visuals. All the transitions seemed smooth, professional and beautiful. Also the artstyle is the cleanest on the series and the backgrounds are incredible, it's like to be in London for real. I stayed all the movie thinking how beautiful and smooth it was, and enjoying the visuals and the plot itself very much. 

I'm not an expert and I don't usually pay too much attention on the technical aspects so I can't really give ""objective"" arguments, but I can really say that the direction work on this movie is exceptional, it enhances every aspect of it and makes the characters shine even more. KyoAni does it again and wow, I really loved the animation and direction (have I said it enough times? xd). Thank you, Naoko Yamada for such a nice well-done work!

An incredibly enjoyable movie with little minor flaws that can annoy you a little bit but still an exceptional technical work and, to me, the funniest and most enjoyable part of the K-On series. I personally recommend it if you liked K-On, I expect you to love it as much as I do. 

Thank you for your read, I wanted to express myself again!"
98861,"I've played my fair share of games. I will fully admit that I have played games since I was 4, and I managed to git gud at some pretty hard games, like the Megaman Zero games and Robotech Battlecry. Now, I must confess:

I am not a pro or competitive gamer. 

I've never done any E-Sports, nor have I done any real competitive gaming. The closest I've gotten to is dabbling in some online Pokémon battles and some ""For Glory"" on Smash Bros. 3DS. So, this was certainly an interesting series to look forward to, as while we've definitely had some game-oriented anime in the past that ended up being popular (namely SAO and No Game No Life), we never had one that showed the competitive side of gaming, since other game anime merely used gaming to basically flesh out a fictional game by putting players in it or have them celebrate them. This anime, made in China, shows a true badass in the realm of E-Sports. Given that China is more passionate about E-Sports than any country in the world (if World of Warcraft is any indication), it's no surprise that they would make the plunge into this before the japs would. I'm sure that plenty of E-sports players find this show to be great since it seems to really understand the terminology and what makes a good MMO game that is capable of E-sports. As for me, this show is, for most part, will adequate, if not amazing. Again, if I were someone who dabbled in E-sports, I’d probably be even more fond of this show but nonetheless, it's still a good series to have come out, and is proof that even a Chinese anime can be not only popular but good as well since those have been getting a lot of bad rep recently with titles like “Cheating Craft” and “Bloodivores”. So, how did this series do it? Well, let’s find out, shall we?

Ye Xiu (formerly known in-game as Ye Qiu) has just been forced into retirement of the team and of the game “Glory” by his old team “One Autumn Leaf”, and interestingly and refreshingly enough, we see a protagonist (him) keep a level head in all this as opposed to the traditional angry retorts we’d normally hear from a situation like this. This 25 year-old man is a bit rusty, but given that he is still basically a gaming god, it's frustrating to see his team just discard him and lock him into taking only one approach for his contract. Afterwards, he simply goes “oh well” and begins like working at a café. Even though he starts a new account (Lord Grim) and decimates everyone, we still see a really human touch that is somewhat prevalent in this series. After all, like any real-life sport, people take it very seriously, and people do have to retire earlier than with most jobs. We see moments of true, civil familiarity that doesn't remotely touch the realm of melodrama like most anime do, like when he and his old friend Mucheng meet up again in episode 5 long after he was kicked and she had to watch, or when he and one of his old rivals square off in the finale, only for us to see their battle history in the middle of this to really sell us on their relationship. It's refreshing to see all of this. To add onto how refreshing this show is, I should make note that every single character here is a full-fledged adult, which is insanely rare nowadays.

I don't have any major problems with the story to speak of in terms of any plot holes or inconsistencies or major leaps in logic, and in fact, any and all worries I began having were actually addressed. When I began wondering “how come no one realizes that Lord Grim is Ye Qiu”, we see veterans hypothesize and come to that exact conclusion. After I thought “man, you'd think more people would be apprehensive to his assholish behavior and start turning him down”, we see him fail to score a bargain in episode 9 for demanding too high a price. I really like when a story can assuage our worries of it. I'm not gonna spoil anything much, but the story does pick up after the first 4 episodes and we really get to see all sides grow tensions and even some members in many teams grow as people,and the finale, while not really giving a sense of finality, even for a season finale that will segue into a sequel, it still builds character and shows up a pretty well done human side to this whole thing. The story isn't grand or anything, but it is really solid, do I have to give it that much credit, especially since it actually assuages certain fears we have. Plus, it's very in touch with E-sports culture given how they  properly use terms like “aggro”, “PK”, etc.

Apparently, there are a number of people sort of upset about character development, or lack thereof, namely for our protagonist. Let me tell you why, in this particular instance, this isn't that much of a bad thing. The main character, Ye Xiu has already grown into an expert, and it's not only about seeing him deal with new situations in his already grown state as opposed to most characters growing while dealing with their problems, but it's about seeing how he makes others develop, not only as people, but often as rivals that team up to try to surpass him. It's not like Mahouka in which the show is about GodSuya trouncing everyone and no almost no one developing as a result of trying to reach his level since everything is all about him and how “badass” he is. We see Ye handle things in a way that actually forces others to grow. Also, he is a total dick, often making witty trash talk comments at anyone and everyone, or exploiting people for his own personal revenge in episodes 1 and 4. He is still a good person at heart, like how he encourages Yi Fan to grow by changing styles. That's what this show is all about: seeing a cocky bit usually well-meaning badass adapt and force others to grow, which more shows that have OP protagonists should focus on instead of the usual “look at our main character, he’s so cool that he dominated everything effortlessly and everything revolves around him” like that other show I brought up.

Admittedly, most of the characters here aren't inherently very memorable, even if I like how they bounce off each other. That does become a problem given how many characters there are to keep track of, so I'll say that they are all pretty decently characterized despite not having much to them, and leave it at that for everyone but the major protagonists that Ye recruits for the second half of the show (and onwards). Mucheng is a beautiful badass who seems almost romantically interested in Ye, and is almost as playful as him in some regards, even if her role is more minimal than the rest of the team. Guo is the manager who has the most banter with Ye and is probably my least favorite, since honestly, after the initial episodes, she hardly provides anything to the story, bit even being part of the major team. Rou ultimately had to nod to learn since while she was powerful with hand speed, she was beyond unskilled for her talk, but ultimately, she became one of the more prominent characters to the team, even if she doesn't have that much to her personality, even less so than most of the characters. Rao Xing (Steam bun) is definitely a more nooblike, almost idiotic character who has muscle, but he actually provides some amounts of cleverness that save him from truly falling to that dreaded archetype. Ultimately, Ye carries the show in terms of the characters since we don't really see much nuance to them, but we do get to see some of them grow, whether it be these guys or some of Ye’s rivals, even if I'm not showing the full extent of that (for brevity and spoiler reasons).

To be honest, I’m aware that this one of G.CMay Animation and Film’s first anime projects, but there are some things I’d like to see them improve on. The character designs are pretty good, and the flashy animation is well, flashy, but the choreography isn't anything really great. Their use of CGI is...interesting. On the one hand, when doing establishing shots and first-person perspectives on certain things in their real world, it can look pretty good, sort of like a trailer at EA for a PS4 game (especially in the first few episodes), but when they get to using character models or other objects in either stock-footage or CGI, it all looks terrible, and honestly, a lot of the techniques here, especially the ones that don't work out well, remind me of Hand Shakers, which is frightening. It doesn't do any of that anywhere near as badly as that show did, so that's a plus. However, there is an unnerving amount of reused animation, particularly when Ye switches his weapon to gun mode or when he is battling goblins (namely him throwing them and them colliding and falling in CGI “glory”). Certain CGI models either look pretty bad or look like bad claymation models that were simply painted on to the point where they look melted. Overall, the series isn't badly animated, at least for a newer studio, but I hope they can tweak the CGI and improve on the choreography.

The OP, “Xin Yang (信仰)"" by Zhang Jie (张杰), is just an eh OP to me. Maybe it's partially due to me never hearing Chinese music before, but it's just rather meh to me. Same applies to the ED, ""Rong Yao Zai Lin (荣耀再临)"" by Da Dan Yin Zu (大胆音组). In fact, the OST, while it does fit everything, it's rather meh and unmemorable, though the alternate rendition of the OP in the later moments of the final episode was pretty nice. Not a bad OST, and both the OP and ED were simply ok, but overall, it's just meh.

Ultimately, this first outing of The King’s Avatar has more substance than some people might give it credit for, but despite the relatively entertaining humor and action, the characters and production values don't hold up all that well, even with the surprisingly solid story. Again, I imagine that E-sports players (or MMO players in general) on the whole, probably find this show more enjoyable than I do, but that doesn't mean it's not a pretty decent show, because it is. I just hope that when the next outing of this show arrives, some of these issues are ironed out and that we get to have more reasons to invest in the characters. Either way, I'm really looking forward to what the rest of the series has in store if they choose to keep animating it. With all that said, I bid you adieu."
112649,"Some shows make me question just what happened with it over the course of it’s development. And surprisingly this question for Suppose a Kid from the Last Dungeon Boonies moved to a starter town isn’t raised over visual quality like I normally expect, but more about the quality of the jokes and general enjoyment. Very quickly I lost interest in the show as it had less and less moments that I honestly enjoyed. By the end, I was finishing it up more over just how much time I had already put into the show. Side note, the title of this anime is just way too long.

The original draw for me was the jokes. And we started off good with the first couple episodes just filled with good puns and jokes that made me laugh constantly. The entire episode was funny and enjoyable and just made me want to watch more. And than it all just kinda ended. The jokes became more repetitive and boring with them just eventually just stopping pretty much all together, instead they focused more heavily on story and the characters.

For the story characters, they both ended up being rather generic and uninteresting. Most of the characters are overpowered compared to normal people, but under powered compared to the truly powerful hero’s in the world. But in this lays the issue for me. We are supposed to get invested in stories that involve world ending events and demon lords. While knowing you have an entire village of entirely overpowered people who could solve the issue in moments if they ever bothered to show up. So they have to create excuses to keep them away or distracted, or just make them idiots. I can say that they attempted to do some character arcs, some of the worked out well. But in the end, not enough for me to really enjoy the characters in the arcs.

One final issue is the ending. It just, wasn’t very good. Over the course of the show they didn’t do a good job at pacing, so the final big fight was rushed. We get introduced to the final villains just a short while before the show ends. With the final fight and defeat of the villain happening all in a single episode. So it all ended up being rushed and unsatisfying to watch. With a feeling that I was meant to go read the source to experience the true story.

When it comes to the visuals, in general I figured they were pretty average. Nothing it did from the slower slice of life stuff, to the various animated puns and jokes, to the various battles really stood out. Sure it wasn’t in any way terrible, I would never call it that. But it definitely isn’t the type of show I would recommend if you want to be stunned by what you are watching.

So my honest conclusion for this show would be, it isn’t all that important to watch. Nothing it does it all that great. And comes in being below average for me. You have much better options for both action shows involving overpowered characters, or comedy shows with good puns and jokes."
2246,"The wooden curtain opens with a sinister smile revealing the first scene:

A wave of vibrant, whirling umbrellas cascade down the street; the rain continues to pour in assorted shapes, accompanied by the patter of hollow conversations latching on to the sounds of its perpetual fall. On top of the path rests a towering hotel embellished by color, wood, and ruse. Slowly, an enigmatic wanderer appears at the gate of the inn, with a wooden box strapped on his back requesting to stay there. He is identified as the medicine seller. Shortly after, a young pregnant woman, dressed in desperation, finds herself at the same inn; seeking shelter and protection.

There is, however, something amiss in the rainbow-tinted inn, and right away, its secrets provoke the senses; they seem to be everywhere – in the walls, in the unseen guests, in the corridor. After a heated argument between the innkeeper and the girl, she finds herself in an isolated room, lathered in opulence but infested by shadows of all shades. Following this unsettling vision, the show starts to bare its true face. There is something indeed amiss here and the Medicine Seller’s true purpose is brought forth: he came to hunt the horrors that plague the inn, otherwise known as “Mononoke”.

That is the basic premise of the 12-episode series titled Mononoke. The series is divided into five arcs, in which, the Medicine Seller (or Kusuriuri) attempts to seek, hunt, and exorcise these otherworldly spirits known as Mononoke. Essentially, Mononoke could be defined as a class of spirits, however, the ones Kusuriuri is concerned with are closest to humans, because they manifest from humans. These are corrupted entities that seem to bring sorrow, suffering, and destruction where they go and to who they haunt. Thus, this is a tale of the unknown, of mystery, of psychology and pathos, of ancient lore, and lastly, of horror that may disguise itself as a series of ghost stories, but only superficially.

One of Mononoke’s greatest strengths is its ability to intertwine the aforesaid elements with subliminal insight that gives it its multi-dimensional form. Most supernatural stories will focus on the imminent horror factor, or inducing temporary fear simply by virtue. Mononoke does something completely different. Rather than focusing on the external fear synonymous with the spirit(s) and their curses, it looks inward, to the living, rather than the dead. This is meticulously explicated by Kusuriuri’s methodology. In order to exorcise any Mononoke, he needs to first recognize its Form (physical), Truth (circumstance), and Reason (motivation). Much of this is revealed through digressing into the psyche of the parties involved in each arc, where Kusuriuri exploits the inner turmoil of each respective character and how that turmoil projects itself on to the Mononoke in ways that are not just terrifying, but often times, heartbreaking and utterly human.

Really, it’s the “human” element of the series that makes it so compelling which is mostly through the manner it incites and decrypts human nature and its capacity to wander in the dark. It’s carnivorous, yearning for fear and emotion; yet, it isn’t done through manipulation, shock value, or contrivance. Rather, Mononoke opts for psychological precision. The show doesn’t aim to deliver some insane amount of singular “character development” but rather uncover what lies in the dark, and thereby showing the ability for what is presented as good, innocent, virtuous to be equally bad, tainted, and sinful. Consequently, the show is heavily driven by its themes and self-contained plot rather than individual characters.

The aforesaid will lead many to flock to the notion of “bad characterization” or not enough “character” “development”, but one needs to contextualize what a work is actually trying to do/achieve before arbitrarily applying a set of self-drawn commandments. Characters can be utilized in many different ways as can a story be told in multiple ways. The characters of Mononoke are outwardly static, including Kusuriuri but that does not mean they are superfluous. They are internalized or “developed”/personified in many ways, whether it be through human analytics brought forth by yours truly the Medicine Man or the interactions, actions, and reactions that are revealed as a product of surfacing truths and unearthing secrets. Mononoke functions as a collective exploration of the temporal realm through the supernatural and both are interlocked by these ordinary characters that are deeper than they may initially look. Essentially, the characters are immensely important, for it is through them and their stagnation that the show is able to conduct its psychological experimentation.

Each character’s predicament is sealed by fate, but the stories aren’t about the end; they’re about how such an end could come about and the choices that led to it. By dissecting the unknown, Kusuriuri finds himself in the middle of intersecting realities that are as terrifying as they are tragic. What makes all the stories consistently effective is the finesse with which the show handles each character’s state, and the mononoke that transpires from them (whether they be a projection of corrupted desires, or a product of unrequited yearning, or a manifestation of unspoken crimes). Therefore, the “unknown” or “horror” isn’t really about the monsters or ghosts, but what creeps inside seemingly ordinary folk, and the will that could innately exist to ignite suffering. Through these various arcs, the characters in those arcs, and Kusuriuri himself, Mononoke presents accounts that are deeply disturbing and equally enlightening.

Furthermore, this also reinforces the unacknowledged strength of episodic structures. Mononoke shows that the quality of the plot or other elements isn’t internally compromised if the work lacks a continuous/overarching plot or a constant cast developing linearly and consistently. Its anthological nature fares well for it and its intentions for it turns out to be far more vicious in its horror, tragic in its drama and stylized in its art that every piece of it comes together effortlessly. It fully embraces the power of the medium and extends its boundaries far beyond traditional story-telling into a work of innovation, wonder, mysticism, and art.

And, elementally, nowhere else does this concentrated sublimity appear more than in Mononoke’s visual presentation. The best way to describe the art and animation of Mononoke is: idiosyncratic. It is so particular and unique that I’d be willing to wager it exists only to tell the stories that Mononoke did.

Right off the bat, the art style may come off as incredibly gaudy, over-the-top, and immensely theatrical (Curtains open and close at whim supported by decisive gongs dictating the flow of various scenes; highly sensitized color palettes are constantly at the forefront, clashing in folly, but never jarring; costumes and getups are so lurid that they seem to have fallen right out of a stage set; faces are painted with perfect expression that each frame seems like a change of masks, rather than emotion). Yet all of this works beautifully. Mononoke reminds me of something running in an aged-Kabuki theater, at least aesthetically, which is actualized through the bizarre sets of color, costume, and personalities, the artistically-tuned performances, and the emphasis on extravagance.

Mononoke’s visuals are a feat in and of themselves, but the real laudable aspect is how that art is integrated into the narrative. The reason I stress to call this work, a work of “art” (besides its literal merits) is because of its ability to use its elements to create something whole that transcends its own platform and deliver – with individuality, acuity, and sincerity – its subject and themes with clear prowess and understanding (of itself and its ambitions). Take its approach to horror for example. Even though the art-style is the last thing from traditional horror, given how theatrical it is, the way it infuses horror is with complete subtlety.

To elaborate, each arc is extremely claustrophobic, as in, the framing or setting of the arcs always occur in a juxtaposed manner. Whether it be stuck in a room of a humongous hotel, or a ship on the open seas, or a prison cell, or a train car speeding through a tunnel, the unsettling feeling of being “boxed-in” never leaves. It produces this inescapable void from the get-go and maintains that in the background, but it’s by far one of the most prominent things it does to invoke and sustain fear and discomfort. Not only are we forced into the corners of depraved minds, but we are confined there, with an evil that has the capability to exist everywhere, and within everyone. Furthermore, its usage of color is one of the best I’ve seen. Works of horror will generally opt for a gloomy, desolate mood which favors subdued grays, blacks, with the exception of red for obvious reasons. Mononoke on the other hand probably utilizes every color on the spectrum but does so effectively. I would never have imagined that such a palette could ever tell stories so terrifying and do so with the power that they do. Combined with its psychological propensity, the visual direction of the series is one of the best I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing; both as a work of Horror, and as a work of Art (and for once, we don’t have to separate the two).

Mononoke is a superb show, but it isn’t for everyone. It is unconventional in every sense of the word. It relies heavily on its own art, such as the barrage of interconnected, but flashing painting like images, or color-doused symbolism to tell its story. Not everything is spelled out here, and a lot of the stories feel like stories within stories since they do stem from various Japanese lore (such as about the concept of Mononoke itself, or what certain acts/paintings/symbols signify). Yet, it is accessible enough, universal enough, that it still communicates the stories of these people, spirits, and time wonderfully. Additionally, as much as I have praised the art, this style can be off-putting to many since often times it might prove to be distracting enough to deviate from the actual narrative. The cut-out style of many backgrounds is a good example of this. Lastly, people under the impression that this is a run-of-the-mill horror featuring gore porn or cool fights/deaths, let me be the first to convey that is not the case. The horror is more personalized through the tragedies of each situation, not through spirits killing randomly (as one would find in a Hollywood tale of biblical possession).

Truly, there is no better way to watch Mononoke, than as if watching a play. Yet, good art has the ability to transfer fiction into reality, and acquaint its consumer with its own feelings and dilemmas. In effect then, the shadows that lurk on the stage also lurk off-stage. And as the wooden curtain closes with the last gong and a similar smile, and the once busy street full of spinning umbrellas is left barren, Mononoke will also leave you with shadows of your own; standing on what you thought was a stage."

SPOILERS AHEAD.
At this point, I think almost everyone in the anime community knows what Kaguya-sama: love is war is. It's the show that made many of us laugh constantly while we also enjoy the characters (ishigami) but now, with the OVA being out, the franchise has finally reached its peak (at least for now). keep in mind that up until now the ishigami arc in the second season  was the ultimate Kaguya arc.
In this review, I will mostly talk about the first half of the OVA for obvious reasons.

Animation:
img320()
img320()

I think most of us can obviously see a significant improvement in the animation department, especially when it comes to its fluidity. The camera shots are nothing less than superb and we can see that the director has finally taken a step up in the ladder towards making Kaguya-sama: love is war nothing short of a masterpiece.

Plot:
img320()
img320()

What can I say? amazing, superb, fantastic, exceeded my expectations with ease, I came into this OVA expecting pretty much nothing but it left me speechless with its touching moments during the first half of the show, moments like the bonding of ishigami and shirogane have left me feeling all emotional and I found myself ""saluting"" to the screen while feeling like a proud father. Seeing how far their relationship has gone since season one, from being quite ""far"" from each other they have now come to a point where they can enjoy an adult magazine together in public, needless to say, its something I have never seen done before in anime, the author is definitely on its way to the top.

Cooking Contest:

Now let us talk for a bit about the cooking contest, ultimately it felt like every other gag in Kaguya thus ill not write much about it. In the cooking showdown, we saw Kaguya cooking in order to impress shirogane with her cooking, obviously, it failed miserably, as iino decide to eat it all. After that ishigami and shirogane have also presented their cooking to the judges, iino, and chika, surprisingly ishigami's cooking was very good but iino was to shy to rate it and shiroganes cooking ended up with them laughing at his family situation, as i said, nothing really outstanding like the first half.

Negatives:

even if it is masterclass when it comes to Kaguya-sama: love is war, I still found something negative about it, the lack of Hayasaka screentime is a crime that should have not happened. Hayasaka could have easily made this OVA even better than it is now making it even BETTER, yes, even BETTER.

Summary:

In conclusion, the amount of emotions I have felt watching this superb OVA is something I can not embody through words, you will have to watch it for yourself in order to felt what I have felt. I full-heartedly recommend it.
Peace out.

12445,"I wasn't planning to watch this anime, but I had read the manga a long time ago and really enjoyed it. For those unaware, the story is about an amnesiac ghost who wants to figure out how she died while falling in love with the boy who is trying to help her. I thought it would be an easy nostalgic watch.

And it was... for one episode. The pilot is an anime original that introduces us to Yuuko, Kirie, Okonogi and Niiya as well as the overall tone of the anime in a way that was unique and refreshing for a ghost show- even if half of it was the same thing but with Yuuko's layer unmasked. If there's one reason to watch this show, it's this. 

Because it's in the following episodes that I started seeing the issues with this show. Instead of rolling with the pilot that already introduced us to the main cast, we're treated to forty minutes of what are in fact flashbacks of the club members meeting each other. While this information is useful and necessary, it could've absolutely been made in one episode or cut entirely- I'm looking at you Okonogi.

Episodes 5-7 are full of fanservice, romance and characters being cute with a moderate focus on the actual plot. It was passable if you ignore Okonogi, who suddenly thinks this is a harem and keeps asking out Niiya, who accepts almost every time even when he knows Yuuko gets jealous. We're also introduced to Shadow Yuuko, or the other Yuuko, a hateful version of Yuuko. 

The real pain starts at episode 9, where the spoilers begin. The only reason I wouldn't recommend you read them is to read the manga, which is about a thousand times better. !So Yuuko has forgotten Niiya due to his inconsideration and her own hate towards the other Yuuko. And instead of trying to help her, reforging the relationship they had, Niiya just... gives up. I'm serious. He says he's sad, he misses Yuuko, he cries, then a wild Okonogi appears and Yuuko is forgotten to go eat with her for what likes months on end. It gets so bad he can't even see Yuuko anymore. But then he falls on her boobs and she remembers.! 

Episode 10 is where the score went from a likely 5 to a 3. Yuuko's past is finally revealed after Niiya convinces her that the other Yuuko is just another part of her and they accept her death together as the events from 60 years ago unravel. (This is the manga's version.)

Wait, no? That's not what happens? If you want to know: !What happens is that Niiya runs away from the other Yuuko while telling Yuuko that she needs to figure out her past and the other Yuuko shows it to an unwilling Niiya instead to the willing Yuuko and Niiya. Then there's bullshit about Niiya having literally absorbed Yuuko's past and now she can't see him. But then he kicks a doll and she can and she finally accepts the other Yuuko. (This is the anime's version.)!

Why did they change that? At that point everyone watching had already figured out what the other Yuuko was and I was screaming at Niiya that what he'd wanted from the start was literally offering itself to him on a silver platter.

But this is far, far from the worst things the staff changed, and I was mad when I realized what they were doing. If you thought Yuuko's death was tragic in the anime, you know nothing.

In the anime, they changed one of the cruelest twist in manga history and destroyed Yuuko's character for... nothing! There's nothing in the manga that would need censure! Why did they do it?. !So she goes to save a random ass kid and is sacrificed. She breaks her leg falling and just sits there dying until at the last moment she lets go of hatred as she dies.!

I guess they wanted to keep her pure and nice? But wouldn't that have made her pass away in peace and you know, not become a ghost? Because she was still alive. Am I supposed to believe that your emotions have a will of their own?

Here is the manga version, highly recommend you go read it, even if it's just the ending.

!In the manga, Yuuko goes after her vanished sister instead of some random kid. When she gets to the school, screaming at the elders to let her sister go, she sees that Yukariko is Akahito. 

Then her sister turns to her and says: ""Kanoe Yuuko is the sacrifice!""

The elders break Yuuko's goddamn leg- no, it wasn't broken in the fall- and toss her into the darkness of the buried shrine room and Yukariko orders they close off the opening and stands there as her sister screams her name, begging for her life as she's being buried alive. 

You think that's all? Months later, Yukariko returns after her dad killed himself over Yuuko's death and finds the comb Yuuko used to brush her hair one last time. Overcome by guilt and regret, she tears away the planks and finds Yuuko's rotting body. She weeps her sister's death until Yuuko's ghost shows up, warped by hate. She strangles Yukariko, who decides she deserves it and wants to be with her sister more than anything. But her loving words bring Yuuko back and she leaves. It's implied she severed her hateful self soon after that. Yukariko kept living in guilt, thinking it Yuuko's revenge. !

I went back to look at the dates and ok the manga finished a year after the anime but couldn't they have asked the author what they were going to do? Because this is so, so inferior to the manga and it pisses me off because you need to have read the manga to see. Everyone else just thinks this is sad as it is when in fact it's so much worse.

And I am far from someone who rages every time an adaptation changes the littlest thing. But the changes need to mean something? Like when they use the movement of the elevator in episode 1. But this was 100% plot and there was nothing to change. 

So... if you're interested in this, highly recommend the manga if only for the ending and look at the first episode if you really want, it's the best one.

About the animation, it was alright. I didn't like how they let go of the roundness of author's style. But the use of black bars, the old Japanese artstyle and the colors switches, while a little out of place, brought back memories of Bakemonogatari. The sunsets were amazing and when there's horror it's pretty well done- in the first part at least.

I didn't like Yuuko's voice actress tho. I felt like she was way miscasted and that the character would've gained more from a less high-pitched and cute voice. She's still a ghost, after all, and this is supposed to be horror. The romance was... okay, I guess, if you count fanservice as romance, but can you really cheer for these guys? Yuuko's already dead! Niiya's gonna grow old and she's going to stay at 15 years old in mind and body. And he's going to stop going to school one day. 

The characters weren't particularly unique. Yuuko was 75% fanservice, Kirie is a tsundere, Okonogi's an idiot and Niiya's the male protagonist. The only interesting thing that was happening was the Kirie/Okonogi ship but that was dropped immediately after it started.

I can't really think of anyone to recommend this too when the manga's so much better in everything."
20031,"THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE

Story
(7/10)

The story revolves about everything being treated as a game and never goes anywhere beyond that, which is completely fine and I liked it for what it was, there was a little bit of romance and other stuff but it never went anywhere beyond little hints and fragments of other stuff here and there which was a big let-down but oh well, would have been a bit better of a show. 
Nothing about it was crazy and it was pretty straightforward yet not entirely predictable, there were little plot twist to each and every interaction between characters which kept me liking the show more and more as I've progressed through the episodes.
It a while to get me invested (5 episodes) and I was honestly almost getting bored with the show but then I slowly realized that it isn't your average show with the mc being a harem magnet who's being surrounded by chick, something I feared this show would be at the first sight but I couldn't have been more wrong.
The best thing with the story is that it builds up on whatever happened in the previous episode and actually manages to tell us a good story because of it, if it wasn't for that I doubt I'd be writing this review.
The only thing I dislike about this show is the comedy which is funny considering I also liked the comedy. 
Most of the comedy stuff was done well enough to keep me in front of my screen and each episode made me laugh and smile a bit however I really dislike the adult comedy with the side characters where they just got to comment on girls' appearances, nothing too crazy but it left me with a bit of a bitterness in my mouth.
However reader if you're up for that stuff that's fine, just not my thing. ^^

Characters
(7.5/10)

I feel that the characters are the strongest point this anime has.
Interactions between the supporting characters and the main character are very well done.
Each and every one of them has a purpose within the show and does their role pretty well, before I started watching this show I was fearing that most of the characters are only gonna have one or two personalities but it was a little bit more than that and what makes them shine is interacting with each others.
Just as I said previously my main issue with the show was with the side characters, they could have been written a bit better and there actually are a few which I really liked but most of them were just there to say one joke never to be seen again.

Pacing
(7/10)

Pretty solid, everything was paced well and I can't really complain. 

Art/Animation
(5/10)(5/10)

I think that this is the most average an anime can look. 
Everything about visuals screams average.
There's not much more to say about it.
It is neither good nor bad and doesn't really add to how much I enjoyed or disliked the show.

Music/Sound
(5.5/10)

Both opening and ending were good but besides that the show didn't have much to offer in terms of SFX and background music.

Personal Enjoyment
(7/10)

Overall I enjoyed this show more than I expected I would've. It took a while to get completely but it was very well worth a watch and I think it is a good show.

Conclusion
(6.8/10)

I think this show is worth a watch, it may not be anything special but is simply one of those shows that are just good.
Ultra average animation consistency and art style are the only reasons why I won't give it a clean 7/10 but I still think that it has It's charms in some other shapes and forms ;w;"
131680,"Note: Watch Black Clover before watching this movie, also yes this movie is canon fr
Minimal Spoilers


Story/Plot: 
Brief Synopsis (since the Anilist description doesn't say much): 
Conrad Leto, the wizard king before Julius Novachrono, is here to wreck the Clover Kingdom. He was previously sealed by Julius's time magic 10 years ago but after getting destroyed by Patri his time magic sealing broke on Conrad Leto.
Conrad now plans to reenact his previous plan that got him sealed in the first place, destroy the Clover Kingdom, and remake it anew. This time he plans to do it with the help of Elsdocia (legendary sword crafted by the 1st Wizard King) and reviving 3 former Wizard Kings.
Asta and the Clover Kingdom must now stop them to prevent the destruction of their kingdom
Thoughts: 
- I loved the premise of this movie. It greatly expanded on the minimal lore that the Clover Kingdom had. Before this, we only knew of the most recent and the first Wizard King. We knew that the Clover Kingdom had been dealing with discrimination between classes (poor vs rich) and races (elves) but this expands on it a bit more with the conflict between the former Wizard Kings and the Clover Kingdom cast. 
- The pacing was a perfect balance of speeding up on fight scenes and letting emotional scenes hang
- I wish they adapted more of the backstories of the 4 WKs from the novel though
- I will say that the powers-up are kind of bananas but extremely unique at the same time (Pincia and Jester had the best ones) it doesn't break the BC world so I'm chilling and getting hyped about it idc. 

Characters & Dynamics: 
- Asta & Conrad:
I grouped these two because they had an amazing dynamic and parallel throughout the movie. I love how the parallel is a callback to Asta's whole identity. 
Asta also had an amazing moment post fighting the Wizards Kings in round 1. He essentially dropped an amazing motivational patriotic speech that lowkey made me want to go out for my country
Conrad mainly served as a great foil to Asta. Kind of like Obito to Naruto, Obito had a dumbass plan but was cool because of his parallel (Obito's aura farmed more tho)
Lowkey expanded on the Asta and Noelle relationship a bit more thanks to Conrad
- Princia Funnybunny, Jester Garandos, Edward Avalance: 
Very cool characters. Aura was unmatched to the end for these 3 especially Jester, man was on demon time
I wish they adapted their novel backstories in this movie though
https://x.com/nitebaron/status/1670392528204357634 (Thread on extra content that was left out, I recommend reading these if you want additional depth to the movie)
- Side Characters
        - Vermillion Family: Melerona continues to prove why she's goated in this movie. Rare Leopold sighting in this movie too lmao (if you read the manga yk).
        - Yuno, Yami, Fuegoleon, and Nozel Silva: This team had aura
        - Sekke, Liebe, & Julius: Foreshadowing done in an anime original movie, very nice. Some might say Peak Clover


Visuals & Sound: 
- It's easily the best animation that Black Clover has ever received. There was not one memeable trashy piece of animation like the BC anime. 
- The fights were amazing and hype especially with the addition of the music. Hakurai Mirai playing in the background of Asta vs Conrad hit different
- Legit nothing bad to say about these two aspects, if you don't like BC that much you could still enjoy this movie because of these two aspects 
- Voice acting was great for the 4 Wizard Kings, especially Jester 

youtube(https://youtu.be/CSR7V02S5Y?si=QnyYQg2cBhafivGL)
Wouldn't be a Black Clover project if there wasn't a new banger song



 Big movie for Black Clover. Adding more depth to Asta and the entire Clover kingdom lore. Good characterization for a 2 hour movie, could be better. Had great fights due to the amazing matchmaking (Tabata cooked with matchmaking Princia and Jester), great magic abilities for the Wizard Kings, and the best visuals and sound you will see from a Black Clover product (imagine peak BC season 1 animation but for 2 hours).

Side note: I'm a big Black Clover fan so BC fans add me fr lol. Totally unbiased review though, TRUST"
98384,"SPOILERS TAGGED

 I wasn’t planning on writing a review, but when I noticed nobody else had, I figured I might as well. So, here we go. This review should still make sense even if you don’t read the spoilers.

I rewatched this movie recently on impulse and let me tell you. It does not get any less confusing the second time through. Well, ok, it might actually have made a little bit more sense if I’d rewatched the entire series and not just this movie, but I was still pretty confused.

This movie had a lot of potential. Three masterminds as the antagonists with an interesting direct conflict meant there were a lot of good places this movie could go, but I feel like there were some issues with execution.

First off, this movie was more confusing to me than Howl’s Moving Castle. That was the first ghibli movie I watched and I was quite lost, so for Dead Apple to confuse me more—that’s a real accomplishment. I think after watching the first time I was able to piece together more of what happened through reading several different summaries, but I can’t say I feel like doing that again (I have a very poor memory), so I guess I’ll just forever remain confused. I mean, I understand that there were three masterminds coming together to outwit each other, but still! If the story isn’t written and explained in a way for the audience to understand what's going on, then what’s the point? To me, it seemed like they tried to explain some things, but there wasn’t enough context or information given for it all to click. Plus, they didn’t even try to explain everything (at least not that I caught). There were just too many missing pieces to make this movie enjoyable for me. A complicated plot with complex characters is no reason not to explain crucial elements of the story.

Another issue for me was the animation. In some parts it was great, but in others, it definitely seemed like they were working on a low budget. I know Bungou Stray Dogs isn’t known for its outstanding animation, but a lot of moments were lacking where that’s concerned. I did appreciate, however, their use of Deadly Drive, Reason Living, and Bokura during various scenes.

Now, although a lot of the philosophy and motivations went over my head, there were still a lot of beautiful parts of this story that I was able to catch.
!I loved Fyodor’s bit about why he wasn’t having any problems with his gift. I’ve read the sparknotes of Crime and Punishment, and so his line about how intertwined crime and punishment are really stuck out to me.!
!I also loved how Atsushi came to accept his gift. Throughout the series he’s struggled to come to terms with the tiger, and then, once he’s separated from it, he realizes how much he needs it. Even though it’s done a lot of harm to those around him, it’s still saved him and he uses it to save others as well.!
!I’m also just a huge sucker for how well Dazai and Chuuya complement each other. I know they’re literally designed to be yin and yang but the way Dazai anticipated that Chuuya would punch him in the mouth and break the antidote capsule so that Dazai could nullify Chuuya’s corruption—my heart cannot handle this pls!
!not beautiful exactly, but while I'm listing things I liked, I thought it was so funny how Ranpo appeared at the end of the movie on the desk with his safe of snacks. He's always one step ahead of the game lol!
Also, the second time around, I noticed a lot more of how different colors were used. I loved some of the contrasts created using color and who doesn’t love Dazai in white.

TL;DR: there were problems at the base of this movie. The premise, though interesting, did not get enough justice in its execution; it was a hard story to follow in some places since many aspects were left poorly explained or unexplained altogether. The animation was poor in many places as well. Some parts of the movie were beautiful, but were they good enough to overshadow the ugly? Not for me. Still, despite numerous execution issues, I have to applaud the thought that went into crafting this story and plot. 8/10 overall.

an 8/10 on my rating scale is “amazing but less enjoyable”"
153930,"Romantic Killer is a 12 episode Netflix-produced anime adapted from an award-winning manga of the same name. The colored manga concluded in 2020 with a total of four volumes, and this animated series sees that content to its very end. Unfortunately, the official English translation licensed by Viz has only just finished the first volume, but luckily the rest is on the way.Romantic Killer came out of nowhere and left me pleasantly surprised. From the main character's menacing dark side, the hilarious faces, and the chaotic yellow behelit that masquerades as a Cupid-esque wizard, there's really something for everyone here. This Rom-com does a lot of things right while straying from what might've been expected. However, not all of its silly charades land flat on their feet and the quality of the writing wasn't always consistent.The plot. With the wizard Riri on a corporate mission from the magic world to abate Japan's declining population, they turn Anzu Hoshino, the ""romance noob,"" into their first guinea pig by filling her life with hot men and taking away her three favorite things; chocolate, video games, and her cat Momohiki. The world of ""otome games"" become a reality for her and she fights against romance for the sake of having her three favorite things returned. It sounded unique to me, but I didn't feel like it was doing anything special or new going into it. Having finished it, I realize now that the execution and production is what really sells this show, not the plot. Nearly every encounter is either a staple trope or scene taken from otome games and old romance anime that we've seen dozens of times, but it is Anzu herself that takes what should've been cringe to an enjoyable level.
img300()The characters. Anzu Hoshino, our female protaganist, undoubtedly carries the show. From her obsession with cats and fear of roaches to her brazen and good nature, she really is an excellent character to tell this story. Unfortunately, a lot of the rest begin to fall flat the further the story progresses. Even though each of the men have their own spot light moments and backstories, it is extremely clear that the author has a favorite. While some of the characters are able to make progress, they mostly stay in line with their original cliches which I think is just an unfortunate result of the source material being short and complete. I often felt that the author had a lot they wanted to say as new characters and dark backstories begin to litter the latter half of the series, but its a shame that they stopped themselves short.
img300()
Lastly, the production. I watched this show in Japanese and I can say that the cast really shined here. Rie Takahashi's performance as Anzu was incredible and she gave this character so much life. This anime was a textbook example of how studios should adapt a manga, because I found it actually improved upon it in many aspects. From added scenes to exagerated art, I felt it all made for a more enjoyable experience. 
img300()With teases of a second season but no further source material to adapt, its possible the author wants to make a comeback and continue to expand the world and fix the criticisms I had... Or it was just Netflix baiting us. Netflix has once again dropped an entire show in the middle of seasonal anime releases where anime fans are desperate for something complete, and this was a fairly enjoyable mess of fun that you can binge today. Enjoy!"
1840,"Zero no Tsukaima is by no means a GREAT anime, but it had the qualities of a GOOD anime. The animation and art style was comedic and fitting of the story, the characters had defined motives, and an ultimate choice was made defining a change in the characters. I found the anime interesting for these points and watched the second season to enjoy them again --except...

The second season, Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, threw those qualities away. They changed the tone of the story, art, and animation of the anime from the first season. The tone of the first season was light and comedic which worked well with aspects of the story such as the protagonist's perverseness, the heroine's condescending nature, and the idea of a person being a familiar in a world where creatures are familiars. In the second season, the tone of the animation, art, and story are more thick and serious which work terribly with the anime's whole concept. The protagonist is annoying and no longer funny and the heroine is overly jealous and down right abusive.

The change in character is reset and they act the same way they did before the resolution of the conflict. Additionally, new plot devices were added that diluted the focus of the anime and previous almost Deus Ex Machina devices were humiliatingly weak this time around. Not to mention, when the characters previously had no problems about killing thousands of soldiers, they suddenly have a moral code for no killing without any kind of spark that would've lit such a moral code. What I mean by this is that; Spider-man's motivation for fighting crime is because of his conceited actions that caused Uncle Ben to get killed. --Zero no Tsukaima has nothing like that. Ultimately, the second season is riddled with plot holes that greatly weakens the immersion of an isekai anime.

I have no problem with the studio deciding to pursue a different theme for the second season. However, to completely disregard the first season by breaking the rules it established for itself is completely unacceptable. If the studio wanted to make an anime about an abusive girlfriend who has family problems, they should've made a completely different anime, not disgrace the first season by only loosely following the previous season's plot."
21258,"A new chapter in a story.... that's what a sequel is. That new chapter may improve the story, or it may make it worse. However, there's also the possibility that you may enjoy the sequel as much as the story that came before it; for me, that was the case with Snow White with the Red Hair. I had actually watched the first season (and reviewed it), and I really adored it; since I reviewed the first season, I decided that I would review the second season when it was done airing. That's proving to be a difficult task; I mean, what is there to be said about this season that I already said about the first season?

In case you are not familiar with this series, Snow White with the Red Hair follows a girl named Shirayuki, who is an herbalist known for her unusual, apple-colored hair. When the prince of her country of Tanbarun, Raj, tries to make her his concubine, she cuts her red hair and escapes to the neighboring country of Clarines. On the way there, she meets Prince Zen and his two aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki, who help her when she's in a real pinch involving Prince Raj. Upon arrival to the castle in Clarines, Shirayuki aims to become a court herbalist, working diligently toward her goal. Oh, and should I mention the blossoming romance between Shirayuki and Zen?

The art in this anime is as beautiful as ever; Bones really does a great job in this department. The ending theme, ""Page Kimi to Tsuzuru Monogatari"" by eyelis, is also quite a beautiful song, and I honestly liked it more than the ending theme for the first season. As for the opening theme, ""Sono Koe ga Chizu ni Naru"" by Saori Hayami..... well, it can never be better than the opening theme for the first season, but it's still a very nice song! Unlike the first season, which I watched the English dub of, I watched the Japanese version of the second season. I must say, these seiyuus really nailed their roles, especially Saori Hayami as Shirayuki! (Maybe I'm just being a Saori Hayami fangirl when I say that, but still!)

The story is still kind of easygoing, but there is one arc in particular that may really leave you on the edge of your seats. As for the characters, along with the great character development for the characters already in this anime, there are even more likable characters introduced in this season, especially Raj's younger siblings; they just put a smile on my face! Speaking of Raj, I never thought I'd come to like him, but believe it or not, I did; his character developed into one that was less....selfish, to say the least. The romance between Shirayuki and Zen was as sweet as ever, too, and it never failed to bring a smile to my face in this season.

Overall, season two of Snow White with the Red Hair is as great as season one. If you watched season one of Snow White with the Red Hair and liked it, I recommend for you to watch season two. Now that I've finished the anime, I've either got to read the manga or wait for a third season of this anime about a romance between a girl with hair the color of apples and a prince of the country she arrived in!"
15037,"If you want to know what the deal with Corpse Party is and were hoping to watch this instead of play the game, you'll be disappointed. And confused. Mostly disappointed.

Story: There's a good one in here somewhere. But they tried to crunch way too much plot into way too little time, and an otherwise gruesome, horrific mystery turned into a rushed, hackneyed, nonsensical excuse for blood and gore. Every time a new plot point blew by I thought 'this would be interesting if there had been any build up or care given to the story whatsoev-- whups, there goes another head.' If they had turned this into a full series and given the story half a chance to breathe, this could have been a gut-churning downward spiral into some of the darkest subject matter I've ever seen. Instead, they took something with decent potential and turned it into pure torture porn. You get desensitized really  quickly, until even the unthinkable (like children being brutally murdered) becomes so much viscera covered in so much red paint and blah blah whatever.

Characters: Cannon fodder. You get their names, told they're friends, and then they drop so fast you can barely keep anything straight. The final shot at the end would have unnerved me for days if they had let us feel anything. For anyone. At all. Any attempt to garner some empathy passes by so fast you can barely recognize it before the character is killed off.

Animation: I thought it was passable for something that came out around 2005. Then I saw it was released in 2013. Ouch.

Voice Acting: Not worth commenting on simply because the actors were given nothing to do but cry and scream.

Music: Served it's purpose.
 

Don't get me wrong, torture porn may be your cup of tea, which is fine. If you're looking for something more, however, save yourself the two hours and avoid this completely. Watch 'Another' instead."
21520,"When I review things I try to consider what that thing is trying to be. We can judge something for both what it’s trying to be and how well it achieve that. In comparison to the rest of Monogatari, Koyomimonogatari is unimpressive. But it’s trying to be something very, very different from a typical Monogatari series. So, because Koyomimonogatari is a series of short episodic ghost stories, we shouldn’t judge it the same way we judge the other series. 

To save you some time, my three word review for Koyomimonogatari: “It was neat.”

The stories aren’t particularly interesting, but each time the episode wrapped up the inevitable conclusion got a good chuckle out of me, or at least a warm smile. It was enjoyable enough without being dramatic or exciting like other Monogatari series.

In part I think this is because Koyomimonogatari is completely episodic. If my memory is correct, the only time a single story has been covered in one episode was the Ougi Formula arc in Owarimonogatari, and even this was done as a special double length episode. 

The Monogatari storytelling style doesn’t work at 14 minutes, consequentially, to put it quite harshly, the series does vaguely feel like an imitation of something it cannot be. 



The title, Koyomimonogatari, reveals what the series really is, a calendar tale – a series of stories that take place over the timeline of Monogatari. The series essentially acts as a recap of the timeline without actually recovering the specific events or arcs we’ve already seen. 

And to be fair, this was useful. My understanding of the timeline was a bit foggy and I’ve actually been trying to keep track of it (I don’t want people to yell at me about my reviews).

In this, the series provided an opportunity to look at how the world has changed. It was nice to go back and see Oshino or Mayoi, and to see Hanekawa and Senjougahara with their long hair. I liked watching the openings from the old series again. I think Koyomimonogatari was a very clever way of looking back on Monogatari and in that regard, it was neat.

And in exploring the more everyday events of stuff we’ve seen before, there were some interesting new little perspectives and insights. This was particularly so in episode eight and ten. 

Episode eleven and twelve are the exception to the theme of the series, and present the major plot developments that set up Owarimonogatari Second Season. And, I must say, it’s some very dramatic set up. But to keep this review spoiler free, I won’t discuss them any further.



To actually provide some use for this review, to any fence-sitters out there, here’s what I know and my advice. (I don’t know why you’d be sitting on the fence now, it’s the ninth fucking series, but whatever)

From my asking around, the consensus seems that only the last two episodes are required viewing. I’d agree with this. The rest of the series is completely irrelevant to the plot. But there’s a couple of interesting episodes, and a few that I think are pretty good.  

I’d honestly just say watch the whole thing, it’s so short. But if you insist on not watching it all (or you just want to revisit interesting parts of the series), again, I’d argue episode eight and ten touch on some stuff that isn’t essential, per se, but is constructive to the narrative. 

Otherwise, I consider the better, albeit non-essential, episodes to be one, five, six and nine. 



And so for what you’d call an epilogue or punch line for this review…

Koyomimonogatari is a weird little series. It’s not bad, but I’d be hard pressed to present an argument to suggest that it shouldn’t be the lowest rated Monogatari series. It really is Monogatari at its least interesting. Until the last two episodes, it’s devoid of tension or drama, and there’s nothing much in its place except some light comedy.
 
Despite all the criticisms, though, I really just think it was neat. It really wasn’t excellent. It’s probably the weakest Monogatari series, but it was neat."
59,"Have you ever wondered what the future of human-machine interaction will look like? A question that by its very nature doesn't only concern the people working in its respective industries but a question that has the potential to affect us all. One only has to take a look at the invention of smart-devices over the last two decades to properly understand the significance of the question ""How will technology shape our understanding of human interaction as well as our understanding of decidedly non-human interaction?"". 
Chobits as a series falls exactly under this umbrella-term of ""Human-computer interaction"". As part of the romance and sci-fi genre this really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. Still it's interesting to look at this show from 2002 under this light. And that is part of what I will attempt to do right now. 

Still I'd like to begin the actual review section of this review with the usual topics: 
1. General Overview
The anime (an adaptation of a manga series with the same name) follows the ""everyday life"" of the young and technologically (and academically) inept Hideki Motosuwa and his robot companion Chi in 22nd century Tokyo. A city that still feels decidedly ""antiquated"".
2. Soundtrack
The soundtrack is nothing to write home about to be honest. It basically is what you'd expect from a romance and comedy focused show from the early 2000s. Slow melodies, soft female voices as backdrop whenever needed and overall nothing too special. Though I have to admit that the first few seconds of the opening theme are quite catchy in combination with the accompanying visuals. Chi comes to life and so does the song and the visual punctuation in the form of a spark is a really fitting start for each episode. 
3. Animation and Art
Speaking of visual clues this is an area that didn't manage to leave an overall positive impression. While I don't expect stunning visuals and animation quality from a romance show I'd still like to see proper lip syncing...or rather I'd like to see lip movements at all. There were quite a lot of scenes (even if far from the majority) in which the characters conversed without any noticable lip movement at all wich unfortunately is enough to break your immersion a bit. Other than that though I hardly have any complaints. 

Now that that's out of the way we can focus on plot and themes a bit more. As mentioned in the introductionary section of this review the show does indeed tackle the topic of technology's effects on human interaction both with humans and with technology (in this case robots). The focus obviously is on the interaction between humans and human like robots (so called Persocoms). Unfortunately the show really only begins to dive a little bit deeper into these concepts towards the end of its episode count. Nonetheless it is the source of most major conflicts that arise over the course of its plot. Many characters are burdened with a negative past due to this invention called persocoms. The loss of real human connection is the most commonly seen theme in this regard. A real problem once we take a look at our current social problems. The show is at its best in exactly these kinds of moments. When our characters (and towards the end especially our main character) are forced to confront their own reality and to ask themselves the questions ""Are persocoms better than humans?"", ""In which way are they different?"" and ""What does it mean to love a machine compared to loving a human"". 

Since this show belongs to the romance genre it is quite self explanatory that it allocates a lot of its time towards the very last of those questions. The manga and the anime also differ quite widely in this regard (especially due to the very different endings). While I don't want to spoil anything I do see it as necessary to point out that the manga ending (from what I know) seems far more nuanced and especially less like utter wish-fulfillment. I will let you explore the show's answers to the above questions on your own though I wish it spent more time tackling each in a more fleshed out manner. Especially interesting are the peculiarities of Chi in comparison to the rest of the persocoms and how her being a far superior model to the rest affect both the nature of all thematic questions I have brought up so far as well as their answers or even potential sets of considerations. 

Now for one final critique: The nature in which romance and especially its sexual component was portrayed, bordered on utter cringe for me personally. Seemingly random ""sexual"" mini skits are a regular occurrence. And the slapstick soundbites in the backgroudn really don't help to lessen the nosebleeding immaturity. Some might call that comedy I call it a waste of screentime especially after a certain amount of repeating interactions. In the same vein I find the obsession with the phrase and concept of the ""one just for me"" one of foolish naivety. And while you can certainly explain these behavioral characteristics from a pure logical perspective in the show (programming of course) I fail to see the necessity of the inclusion of such a blatant focus. In fact such a concept (I guess its equivalent would be the concept of soulmates in human terms) if one wants to include it at all would work far better in moderation. At least in my opinion. 

But enough cirticism. I stil enjoyed a large part of the show. And Chi is obviously extremely cute. There is no arguing about that. So do I recommend it? Sure I do (if you can endure its negatives). Though it might be a better idea to read the manga is this particular case. I myself haven't yet done so but from what I've heard it's usually regarded to be the superior version of the story. So what are you waiting for? Strange coincidences, weird technological design decisions and a tokyo straight from the 1990s await you on this journey through the past's future."

Finally, after a long time, I enjoyed a good Isekai anime with an awesome Slice of life.

One line:

The Adventures of a Normal cook in an Isekai world.

Plot:



'Tsuyoshi Mukouda' (Protagonist), summoned with other heroes to save an isekai nation but he understood that with his skill he can't be helped, so he gets separated and lives as a normal citizen doing his adventures with his epic familiars.


Protagonist:

img220()


Tsuyoshi Mukouda 

Truly a different anime hero who lives exactly like a normal human from earth (A reality person).

Apart from other Isekai protagonists, he is not an overpowered character but a great cook. 

He truly archived a name with his great cooking skill and had the potential to change our minds about OP heroes in Isekai anime.

The way how he was written is unique, kind, and a Protagonist who hates violence. it's new to us while watching the anime.






Let's talk about the anime:


 The main plus for this anime is its story which is quite different from most of the Isekai anime. The story didn't deviate from its plot which made this interesting. 

The ideology of the characters was fixed up to the end that's one of the things I liked the most.
Apart from the other Isekai heroes, In this, the protagonist is a different character who wants to live a quiet life without any violence.

Other than our Protagonist, his familiars Fel and Sui 


img220(:large)


I liked their duo who made this show extra special especially sui, I loved these Kawai moments.

The way they show their feeling towards each really worked well in this anime.

The comedy part worked well which is a boost to this anime.

I liked the goddess part which is fun to watch
img220()

It's really named for its cooking, which made me hungry with their cooking skills, I personally used to watch this show while am eating my food.

The skill he was granted was really unique at least for me I really wish to have it in my life

As usual, MAPPA nailed its work with excellent animation which took this anime to a different level, especially the cooking part.

The main drawback I personally felt is that the story doesn't accelerate to a high point. instead, it moved in a straight line without any up and down. because of that, I can't feel anything other than feel-good at the end of each episode. I can't feel any other emotions in this anime, which is the thing I hate the most about this anime but I can't blame it as it's written in that way.

I really can't find any negatives in this feel-good, comedy anime, and it's the only negative point.(lol)

Finally, it's just the beginning, there will be more in Season 2.




If you wished to make your heart cool down and get relieved from your stress, I recommend you to watch this anime up to the end without the rush. It's great slice-of-life anime without any romance/stuff.

It may not be a masterpiece but it's really a great Isekai anime to watch."
119683,"From the creator of Fairy Tail and Rave Master comes a new Space Adventure, Edens Zero. Edens Zero follows the main characters of Shiki and Rebecca as they embark on a whimsical space adventure in search of the fabled space goddess, Mother. In their way they come across various impediments yet still push forward to reach their goal.

STORY:

Positives:

If you're familiar with Hiro Mashima's past works, you'll notice the core values of Mashima's writing style being reflected in this particular work as well. His writing has always been polarizing but its strength lies in terms of building an entertaining world and having a cast of characters you can care for, and then having them go on an adventure filled with wonders and mysteries. Edens Zero works on the tried and true formula of adventure fantasies. Yes, it is more of a Space fantasy than a straight up Sci-fi despite the world being filled with robots and other such advanced beings. Season 1 of Edens Zero is in its building stage and is slow in its approach. The world, characters and the goals are gradually introduced. Edens Zero distinguishes itself from its contamporaries as Edens Zero unlike them isn't focused on bombastic introductions and dark subject matter, rather it's about going on a fun adventure and checking out the outer cosmos, which frankly has been lacking from a lot of current Shonen in the popular demographic. Each and every planet that Shiki and the crew visits has its own history, culture and environment. Some are discussed in details while some aren't, but regardless you're able to determine the vastness and the variety in the world that Mashima has created for Edens Zero. We follow a standard video game pattern of going through stages of building the team till the end of the season, and as a result the show also does become very predictable at times. But you're thrown with so much new stuff regarding the adventure itself and the lore of the world that it becomes impossible to not feel immersed in the story for even a bit. While most of the arcs range from being decent to good, the one that stood out the most was the last arc of the season; not because its anything extraordinary but rather it is where the writing shines the brightest in terms of emotional engagement between the story and the audience, and developing the characters. It is really well structured and shows the capabilities of the main cast while also setting up for future events. The first arc of the season, Norma, is a close second because it introduces you to the mechanics of the world in a rather fun way as the mystery grips you.

img350()

Talking about themes now, the major ones which are visited over and over are Friendship and Equality. Yes, the ever so polarizing theme of Friendship is still present in Edens Zero, but the theme is dealt in a more efficient manner. Shiki was a loner living in a world of bots all by himself, so its only given he would crave for more social contact and as such wants to make friends. Yes, he does want to make friends with everybody, while it may come across as annoying to some, I found it rather endearing at times. Besides, the rest of the characters do advice him on how to actually make friends and make fun of the troupe on their own. But where the series differs from rest of Mashima's works is in the fact that the story establishes that not everyone is good and is deserving of being one's friend. Equality between humans and the machines is always brought up, and the show does a good job in portraying how everyone deserves to be treated equally regardless of their race/origin. We also see oppressors and supremacists all along the way, it is so frustrating to deal with them but this also makes Edens Zero rather grounded as it deals with something we see in our daily lives, discrimination and injustices of the society. The second half of the season especially deals with the theme of equality in a rather delicate manner. 

Negatives:

Up to this point I have highlighted the positive aspects of Edens Zero, but I would also like to share some aspects of the show I have problem with (I believe others might as well). First and foremost, the fan service. Fan service goes hand in hand with the media that anime is, but it is just way too much in Edens Zero. Bath scenes can be handled, but when you build a whole arc around having nude women running to save themselves it becomes too hard to pass off as something little, rather it takes away from the story itself. And as such that particular arc ended up being the worst in the whole season. Its not just nudity, so many people in this world are lecherous to the point you question if they have interest in anything else. And how one character's end of story is brought upon is rather disturbing. The action is another problem, while it isn't bad, most of the action sequences just aren't exciting enough. They lack in both emotional impact as well as choreography. They need to lengthen the fights, and have them become engaging like how one particular fight was in the last arc. Shiki being overly powerful in comparison to others also takes away from the stakes, while it is understandable why he is so powerful given his background it still diminishes the impact an action sequence should have. 

Img350()

CHARACTERS:

Now moving on to the characters, the cast is a fun one. I won't say so far anyone has shown much depth beyond a few exceptions. The character writing is pretty straight forward in nature, but still is able to make characters you can have lots of fun with. Shiki our mc, as I wrote before is a friendship enthusiast but is good when it comes to fights. He is able to make good use of his head and use his powers in varying ways to win a battle. He follows the archaic Shonen protagonist traits, but it is his nature of seeing everyone the same is what I appreciate the most about him.  He is rather endearing in his acts, just like a precious little kitten. But beware the kitten has its fangs, one that he only bares for his crew. How he handled one particular delicate moment with Homura in the last arc, is what made me like him more. If I have to name my favorite characters, it would be Pino and Weisz. Pino is just absolutely precious, one that has a lot of comic scenes surprisingly. She is one of the few characters who has already has duties to fulfill and dreams to make true. Her wish is both a beautiful and sad one, if done correctly she can become one of the best written characters in the story, she has that much potential. Weisz is a pervert but a mild one, it never goes towards sexual harrassment so you can just enjoy the snarky comments he makes and have lots of fun watching him on screen. Rebecca is alright, she hasn't really shown anything that makes her standout, dare i say she is boring aside from the backstory we got on her. The rest of the crew members though, they are really fun to watch especially sister and witch. Homura is also quite fine especially her habit of speaking out loud. The show has villain problem though, most are one-dimensional and their actions and motivations don't match at times. They are evil for just being evil. Only one man has the potential to be great, but he has yet to take the centre stage (until season 2 arrives). 

Img350(v)

AUDIO-VISUALS:

The art and animation in Edens zero is actually quite decent, and at times becomes really great especially those done in-house and not outsourced. But I think it is wise to tackle the elephant in the room i.e. the character designs being too familiar to Mashima's previous works. With the exceptions of Rebecca, Shiki, Happy, Elsie and Justice, I don't think others look identical to those in Mashima's previous works. It is redundant to criticize Edens Zero and not give it a chance just for that, when so many other artists are doing the same, the art style is such that many faces look similar. But that being said, I can't overlook the lack of creativity while designing the MCs. And the copy pasting of Erza and calling her Elsie is just beyond ridiculous, I can understand the concept of taking the mascot of previous story and giving them a supporting role to build the brand but taking such a popular character such as Erza and then doing nothing interesting with her isn't right. On a more positive note, I really like the character designs of the supporting cast especially Witch, Sister and Jin. A lot of them look really cool. The animation looks really good at times like in episode 5 and 25, but also at times there are many unappealing scenes with too many freeze frames. Camera work for Shiki's gravity power has always been great. The background art is Edens Zero is really strong and very consistent. The environments look gorgeous, so many interesting looking planets. On the other hand, the character art isn't the best, it lacks details and the edge in design that Mashima's characters usually have. The shading on characters also need some work, so does the expressions. The expressions look really flat at times. The cgi work can be better too, though there are instances of some good cgi work here and there (but thankfully the show isn't heavy on cgi). As for the audio, the ost is decent. There are moments where it shines like during action sequences but at other times it falls flat like with the tracks created for emotional scenes. The title theme and some of the character themes are really great though. Both the opening and ending songs are pleasant, with special mention to the second ed by Sayuri which has become one of my favorite songs of 2021. I checked out the show in both japanese and english dubs, and they are pretty good. You can go either way and enjoy the show to its fullest. 

▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎

So, overall all I have to say is that give Edens Zero a chance if you want to embark on an adventure that will make you feel like a kid watching anime for the first time. It is not innovative sure, but who is to say that deriving something that has been tested right by many to be wrong? Edens Zero is a fun adventure that has good world building with a fun cast of characters. Personally, I enjoyed this a lot. Give Edens Zero a chance and it might end up being an entertaining ride for you as well."
157198,"From GeekToys, the studio behind Plunderer and Hensuki, comes some more bizarre and fucked up shit.

Dead Mount Death Play’s plot is overstuffed to the point of bursting. The ensemble cast and multiple interconnected plotlines is reminiscent of Durarara or Baccano, if they were written by someone on stimulants. There are like four plotlines occurring at once and only one is remotely enjoyable—the main characters just chilling in their apartment, running an amateur fortune telling business. Its plot is rapidly paced, wildly unpredictable, infrequently funny, and borderline incoherent, resulting in genre-bending trash. The premiere will give you the impression that the whole series won’t take itself too seriously, but that is not the case.

A necromancer named Corpse God dies in an epic battle, then finds himself reincarnated in the body of a recently murdered Japanese boy, Polka Shinoyama. He quickly becomes entangled with gangs, criminals, police, and other killers. As soon as he assumes the boy’s form, he fights off some crazy woman, Misaki Sakimiya (an assassin who murders assassins?). Corpse quickly kills her with necromancer magic. After Misaki failed to kill Polka, she Corpse resurrects her as a zombie. Corpse is morally centered, despite his name, he only wants a peaceful life, resulting in a very dull and monotone character. One of his first actions is transferring the original Polka's spirit to an adorable shark toy.

Throw all your logical thinking out the window because none of this shit makes sense. Corpse's powers are inconsistent, characters behave in unbelievable ways. I can't grasp how this came to be. It’s like the writers simply expected viewers to be children who’d follow along with whatever nonsense shit they threw at the wall. There’s barely any character progression, but there are a few flashbacks to develop the main characters.

Upon resurrecting Misaki, her mediator, Clarissa, strangely grants Corpse God a place to live as long as he works for her group. Clarissa has two people in her group join Corpse God, Misaki and an info broker, Takumi Kuruya: a Shinjuku informant who collects data illegally using drones. Corpse puts a police investigator's spirit in a pen to obtain information, which slowly reveals clues to solve mysteries. The little CGI pen writes on its own and wows clients. These oddballs form a found family and help Corpse work as a fortune teller, as well as dealing with Polka’s very wealthy family. As the story progresses, it becomes more complex, and new questions arise, leaving you wanting a clearer sense of where it's heading. Ghosts, gangs, supernatural criminals, magicians, etcetera are thrown into the melting pot with little cohesion. Despite its flaws, Dead Mount offers LGBTQ+ representation through Clarissa... and Misaki? She is working through it. For ecchi fans, you get some steamy lesbian action. The fanservice seems pretty intense for a show as edgy and juvenile as this one, but we already have all the other genres, why not add ecchi?

At the very least, there’s occasionally a fight scene involving thrilling necromancy magic.
The action scenes themselves? Meh. The choreography isn't the best out there, if you know what I mean. On the bright side, the characters have simplified designs that make fights look more dynamic. But hey, don't expect consistent quality here, folks. Sometimes, it feels like you're staring at talking heads and struggling to pay attention. Oh, and let's not forget the chibi art style they throw in during funny moments. The jokes rarely land, but it's cute, sure, and probably saved them budget. Overall, the animation is okay. Though the art has improved from previous Geek Toys animated eyesores, it's not going to blow you away.

Dead Mount's biggest selling point is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not as funny as it should be. With the help of Misaki and Takumi's colorful personalities, Corpse God's fortune-telling business was consistently the funniest plotline in the series. They successfully run the business using genuine readings and gimmicks. It’s pretty comical and they use ghosts to solve mysteries. The sixth episode played off their fortune-telling scheme. It was perhaps the most exciting episode for telling a self-contained murder mystery story, including espionage, natural world building, and a shocking conclusion. As well as developing a couple of characters without relying on flashbacks or exposition dumps, as the series does.

You must pay VERY close attention to the plot at all times, despite the monotonous by-the-numbers storytelling, or you’ll lose track of the sequence of events and complicated character motivations. Due to the rapid pacing, lackluster storytelling, numerous colorful characters, an overstuffed plot, and rapid tonal shifts, it quickly becomes a confusing viewing experience. It’s a shame because I love Baccano and can see the inspiration in Dead Mount.

Dead Mount Death Play pushes storytelling boundaries, but for the wrong reasons. It presents an ensemble cast and multiple interconnected plotlines reminiscent of Durarara and Baccano. However, the rapid pacing, excessive characters, and lack of coherence make it a tedious watch. While the main character's found-family provides comedic relief and the occasional fight scene adds excitement, the overall execution falls into monotony. Although the series attempts to balance humor and serious storytelling, it struggles to do so. Ultimately, Dead Mount Death Play may appeal to those who enjoy genre-bending narratives with ensemble casts and are willing to overlook its shortcomings, but for others, it may prove to be too confusing and inconsistent."

As the first season of the new adaptation comes to a close it becomes time to ponder on we have experienced. Over the last three and a half months we watched and discussed what we thought about it. Many questions have been long since asked and answered, but one still remains: Was it worth it?

I'd say so.

I'll admit, it's been a while since I watched the original series. However, I do fondly remember it as one of my favorite animated series of the 2000's.  From the world building and to the foil between the two leads, The 2008 adaptation very quickly became a cult classic. However, the cliffhanger ending at the end of the second season left many watchers (your truly included) wanting for more. When the new project was announced I believe we all were excited to see the journey we loved continue. Coming from this, I was a little scared when it was announced that this was going to be a different adaptation of the light novels, and became even more so when it was revealed that Studio Passione (of high school DXD 2018 and Higurashi: Gou infamy) would be leading the reigns.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. This show, though maybe not at exactly on the level of the first adaptation, was still perfectly enjoyable in its own right. The story followed the original Light Novels very closely, sticking even more accurately to the books than the originals. This not only kept the story from veering off into stupidity, but also sets up for future seasons better than how the originals (With their changed continuity) did. Along with preserving the story the same, the characters also kept their wonderful foil that made them so enjoyable, and with the Original VA's coming back they feel nearly identical to their first roles.

One big change that the series had was the hiring of Kevin Penkin as the score composer. Kevin, if you did not know, was the composer for both Made in Abyss and The Rising of The Shield Hero, along with co-writing the soundtrack for The Apothecary Diaries. Through his works, he has won several awards and is regarded as one of the best composers in the Anime Industry, and with this series he bring his A game. Though the original soundtrack was amazing in its own right, no-one can beat Kevin.

However, I will day that the opening and ending of this season (though perfectly serviceable in their own rights) pale In comparison to Tabi no Tochuu and Jitsu no Yoake. Though I like the new ones, a part of me wishes that they just did a cover of the originals due to how freaking good they are. This is a pretty small issue overall, but still kind of irks me.

Last thing I want to talk about is the animation and artwork style. Despite my worries, I feel like Studio Passione did a serviceable job updating the original works to a modern style. Being perfectly honest, the animation of the original was not one of its strong suits, especially given that Studio imagin was a small and irrelevant studio that immediately went belly up after finishing season 2. Studio Passione also successfully made the art style more faithful to the original novels, which I believe is generally a good thing. However, as to be expected, the art style (in my personal opinion) was significantly less passionate compared to the original, and had a glossy and corporate feel that many Passione projects have. Additionally, the increased use of CGI in some scenes broke my immersion a little. Overall, though it did pass my approval (For what little that's worth) it did not leave me wowed.

To sum up, I think this project was a good attempt at adapting the original VN's. Though I may not have liked as much as the originals in some aspects, I think it was a good Anime regardless. Overall, I am quite happy with this and I can't wait for season 2."

This anime found any hidden expectations I had and surpassed them. With just a few episodes I was captivated and forced to follow its lead. All I could think was, ""Finally! A sports anime done right!"" I cannot express in words just how enjoyable this was for me. 

What's there to say? It's your normal 'I just discovered a new sport and like watching it, now let me try it and level up faster than everyone for the sake of chasing my dreams!' except it's not.. is what I'd say but it is. It very much is. However, for some reason, I feel like this was different to other sports anime. It felt like there was real progress for Tatara. He went from being a dull middle schooler with no ambitions to being able to dance to his emotions. And no, he doesn't suddenly become number 1 nor stand anywhere near the top 10. He just becomes good. Plus, this anime wasn't afraid to focus on other characters' development. And the thing is, they did it and managed to not make it tiring to watch, uninteresting or a complete waste. They were quick to get to the point even though it didn't seem fast. The pacing of the story never felt odd and out of place.

Seriously stunning! It takes a bit of getting used to but after an episode or two, you get used to the style. The beautiful eyes that draw you in and the eyelashes that set it apart from others give the characters a more appealing look. Even the nicely animated bodies are incredibly attractive! It fit this kind of anime perfectly. Don't forget the animation 一 them dancing and how the dress is just swung around is so charming! It's like candy for my eyes. If the story was a flower then the visuals would be the frame.

I don't think footsteps are talked about enough. I mean who doesn't love a good clickity-clack? This may have been the bare minimum, but well, it was enough. I really love the sound of the shoes clicking together and hitting the ground. Like music to my ears! Speaking about music.. 'Brilliant'! was the song in the soundtrack that was a literal banger, on and on for days. It was always the songs during the Quickstep and Tango matches that were the most exciting if it isn't obvious...

I really loved how every character was unique. What I mean by that is based on appearance alone you can't really group them together (unless they are family). Each character looked like themselves. But keep in mind that this is because this anime was very focused on its main characters and did not have many background characters feeding the story.
I've said this earlier and I'll say it again. This anime was able to insert characters' backgrounds and stories without messing up the pacing. It never felt odd and out of place, it didn't necessarily fit what was happening nor do I think it was needed but it worked.

Also, this [hilarious scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0aj9hf3WfA) which I cannot forget no matter how hard I try. The pause, the silence, and the reaction are beautiful. Don't know what this anime would do without Vassily...

Well then thanks for reading this far or.. skipping (sounds like something I would do). Ballroom e Youkoso was an outright joy to watch. If you haven't watched it already, you should definitely give it a shot.

21051,"I’ll put it simply: this is one of the most fantastic anime I’ve ever seen. I’d even go so far as to put it in my all-time favourite top three. It’s a roller-coaster ride that takes you from comedy to drama to mystery, and grips you from start to finish. The story is at times so ridiculously comical that it’s obviously a parody of the genre, and at other times so deep and heart-wrenching that you’ll wonder if you’re even watching the same anime as moments before. 

That’s not to mention the sheer fabulousness of all the characters, and the setting. Steer far away from this if you don’t like sparkles, because Nanbaka does not stop sparkling. Ever. Even at the climax of the story each character is surrounded by glitter and bright colours. Some people won’t like the stark contrast between the content and the setting, but I think it summed up the tone of Nanbaka perfectly. The series isn’t meant to be realistic, even though the characters are some of the most relatable I’ve seen in anime. The entire show is a parody, and the fact that it can be both satirical and emotional at the same time – successfully – just shows me how brilliantly it was done.

The story starts off as a lot of nonsensical fun; a bunch of wacky inmates who constantly try to escape from the most secure prison in the world. This is an arc that’s purely comedy, you’re introduced to the characters and the setting, and get a taste of their daily life. The type of comedy is something I would describe as similar to Gintama or Nichijou, it’s very self-aware and basically just random. There are a lot of references, the gag humour is hilarious, and there’s a lot of witty dry humour too. It caters to most areas of comedy at one point or another (although it doesn’t tend to be crude). It’s awesome if you like that kind of thing.

The second arc veers off topic slightly, dealing with special events in the prison. The tone starts off similar to the first – very heavy focus on pure comedy - but shifts near the end and becomes altogether more serious. 

This leads into the third arc, which is a masterful depiction of the main character’s mental state. There’s some amazing character development in this arc, and it’s what cemented this anime as a favourite for me. Sure, it’s very different to the previous arcs, but the shift was actually needed at about this time – it’s just when the audience starts to get tired of the endless humour and want a more fleshed-out story. The mystery element was also expanded on here, and was quite frankly unusual and really intriguing. It provided an understandable explanation of the MC’s reasons for his actions, and served another purpose in that it allowed for some meaningful interactions between the inmates and the guards which added more depth to all their characters and the story. 

Almost all of the characters are good. And I don’t mean that in like a ‘righteous’ kind of way. I mean that they’re done really well. Each and every character has some sort of ridiculous but memorable design and quirk, which makes watching them really fun and ensures you don’t constantly have to check who’s who by referring to previous episodes. Minor characters get development that can change your whole view of them, each challenge plays a major part in understanding or developing a character, and the no one is introduced and then never seen again. 

Juugo, Nico, Uno and Hajime felt like real people, despite how exaggerated their characters were. The way they cared about each other was strangely relatable, and very touching to watch. The concept of family was presented beautifully. Forget Fairy Tail and the power of Nakama, this anime shows how a group of misfits can become family in an incredibly heart-warming way which somehow still seems realistic. (Odd, considering that it’s meant to be a parody and all, but that’s part of what was nice about it.)

The art is…unique. All the characters have these elaborate multicoloured hairstyles, long painted nails and weird eye colours. If you can get used to that, or find it entertaining, you’ll enjoy the anime much more, because bear in mind the art is a big part of this anime. It’s a part of the anime’s identity – Nanbaka wouldn’t be Nanbaka without the art. 

The animation is captivating, particularly around the action scenes, and the sound is superb. I absolutely loved the opening, ending, seiyuus, and sound effects. They added so much to the anime. 
Okay, hold up. So I’m aware that I haven’t been strictly objective. It’s hard to remain unbiased in a review when I actually love the show so much. So now I’ll try and list a few of the things the anime could have done better in, for the sake of being fair:
•	Rock really needed some more development; all the other characters were explored beyond their basic hobbies but he stayed a one-dimensional foodie to the end.
•	The mood shifts – I personally liked this but it could be confusing at times, and the heavy parts were a big leap from the comedy it proclaimed itself to be. The sparkles also really shouldn’t have been in at the more emotional points.
•	The warden’s crush was irritating after a while, too much time was spent on it without any progress.
•	There were a lot of unanswered questions at the end (although there is a second season which I’m assuming resolves this).

So, what do I think about Nanbaka? 
It’s wacky. It’s zany. It’s sparkly. It’s utterly ridiculous at some points, and deep and thought-provoking at others. It will make you chuckle, snort, laugh and show other expressions of joy. It might also make you smile sadly, clutch your heart and wipe away a tear or two (although the last is unlikely).
Overall, it’s a reminder of why anime is a medium unto itself; for better or for worse. Where else would you find something like this? I can’t recommend it highly enough. XD

NB: Obviously, I’m talking to fans of comedy and the like here. Don’t come hear looking for a realistic slice-of-life, romance or thriller. Duh."
237,"Besides poking fun at Christianity, one genre that seems to be a writing gold mine for anime is the coming-of-age tale. Taking a character who is in their teens, a period where they start to shape themselves to soon ingress into adulthood, and make them face reality in its different shades up until they become completely rounded figures is a setup that offers a vast range of opportunities for writers. The deal is that, the main character being a kid or a pre-teen, you can make them as immature as you can get away without making the audience hate the little twerp and slowly improve them into a better person. Also, being animation such a versatile media, you can deliver as much of that development in one full season without having to deal with the difficulties of live-action.

So, which one is the best coming-of-age story in anime? Of course, that is not a question with definitive answer, if any question in regards to art is, but I’d like to offer my pick for the best one I watched so far: Eureka Seven.

Story and Characters

Eureka Seven (E7 for short) caps at 50 episodes, which is by no means a shy length for any series. Any anime packing that number of episodes can be an absolute chore to sit through if it doesn’t offer the content to hold the viewer and enough quality-development to justify its size. Luckily there’s no shortage of either for this series. During its running time, E7 builds its fantastic world and addresses multiple character arcs and themes, from religious conflict to environmentalism, leaving very little to be fully explained, and even in these cases it’s not anything that represents a driving force of the plot. Before we talk about that, though, let’s discuss the characters.

Renton, the main protagonist, is unusually relatable for a character of this kind of story. He is immature, sure, but also displays grounded morals and is, at least initially, driven by an adventurous spirit. Being the son of the late hero responsible for saving the world, Adroc Thurston, he would have some pretty big shoes to fill, however, Renton doesn’t really want to deal with that kind of responsibility. Like many other teenagers, he wants simply to enjoy his younger years dedicating himself to his hobby and expanding his horizons, which primarily motivates him to join Gekkostate. That would lead him to face a reality much harsher than what he was originally prepared for and forces him to strengthen his ideals in order to push himself through the struggles he faces. So, yeah, Renton is amazing, quote me on that.

The titular Eureka is Renton’s love interest for the story and the center of many conflicts both in the overall plot, as well as the tension between Renton and Holland. While not exactly emotionless, she has difficulty properly dealing with the emotions she slowly develops, and Renton plays a big role in leading her to understand how to better interact with others. She is naturally kind-mannered and loyal, but when it comes to dealing with failure or regret, more complex feelings in general, she has significantly harder time processing those emotions.

Holland is the leader of Gekkostate, a cool figure outside, but a very contrasting person for those who get to know him closely. Jealous, easily angered, unusually immature and quick to lash out against weaker characters who dare to upset him, most of the time Renton and frequently with violence, he is possibly the one that goes through the most sizeable development in the series, and a very positive one. That development though, takes some time to manifest, so while he acts like an absolute asshole, don’t be surprised if you find yourself enjoying his suffering. I sure did.

Talho is the main pilot of Gekkostate and Holland’s lover. Being the only person who Holland accepts to have challenging him, she is the main agent to his development, but before that happens she is also forced to grow and properly understand her role in the group.

Charles Beams, along with his wife, Ray, is one of the antagonists, appearing mid-run in the anime. Even though he is technically placed on the “bad guys” side, he is still a very honored, responsible and loyal figure, which is why he plays a big role in Renton’s development. He is also Eureka Seven’s embodiment of MANLINESS. Seriously, I bet the guy had chest hair when he was 8.

Dewey is Holland’s older brother and the main antagonist for the series. Initially very mysterious, his motivations seem to fluctuate as the anime goes on, up until they are properly revealed and sadly place him among the “Destroy the World” kind of villain, the least compelling kind. That was the only meaningful issue I was able to find in the series: villains of this category hardly ever work, and in cases they do work they often go for the type that is so crazy it doesn’t matter or so powerful that destroying the world isn’t a big deal for them. Dewey is mostly portrayed as a collected and calculating individual, so this motivation is all the more out-of-place. Lastly, there are Dominic and Anemone. Their role in the story is to serve as a parallel to Renton and Eureka’s relationship, but at the side of the antagonists, for the most part. 

Ok, tackling the coming-of-age aspect first, Renton’s development is triggered mostly by the use of an interesting contrast: without giving too much away, halfway through the series he gets separated from the Gekkostate, who at this point were not the most responsible folks to serve as an example. While in their company, it was difficult to side against him, as there was a clear lack of proper orientation from the crew. The point where they get separated is the moment his character-arc truly starts to shine, it’s the moment when he’s able to do his biggest mistakes and witness the impact they have. As an effect of that, Renton begins to develop higher respect for other’s resolve, as well as the importance of keeping himself loyal to the responsibilities he takes. When he finally reunites with the Gekkostate, he is better prepared to face the challenges they would find up ahead. His development doesn’t stop there, however, as there’s much work to be done in his relationship with Eureka and the strengthening of his values, but that is something you should witness on your own.

In Eureka’s case, the development kicks in early on, since it’s not so much focused on maturing but in learning to deal with issues she was never forced to deal with in her blank-slate condition. Due to Renton’s influence, not only over her but also the Nirvash, she begins to be exposed to feelings she was not used to, not all of them positive. During the boy’s absence, she starts to understand that the reason why she misses him might be romantic feelings and the sudden need for his companionship also plays a huge part on forcing Holland to mature himself. All of this makes for deeply dynamic characterization, as in Eureka Seven characters don’t simply decide to change or shift on a whim depending on plot convenience (No, I’ll not make a “cough, cough” joke!), they influence each other, stumble, hurt themselves and make amendments, the way well-written interaction is supposed to do. The side-characters in the other hand have fairly straight personalities and stay pretty much the same along the series. Is that a problem? No. Keep that in mind, folks: a large cast doesn’t mean everyone should receive in-depth development, some characters are nice the way they are, just adding some flavor to the series

Now, when learning that a series tackles subjects like religious conflict or environmentalism, many people would be immediately put off, in fear that it might end up featuring very preachy writing. Eureka Seven, however, gracefully avoids this trap. The subjects in question are all swiftly introduced as the plot progresses, and now and then play their role in the story by being naturally integrated in the arc, without any moralism being spelled out by anyone in ham-fisted manner. The environmental aspect, for once, is not directly brought up, but subtly conveyed throughout the series, as it’s an integral part of the overarching plot, and the series manages to do such a thing even as these themes become ever more present in the story. By the end, it’s not hard to grasp how such elements are a natural component of the world presented in the anime.

Presentation

By the Gods, that looks beautiful!

Ok, professionalism dictates I have to be more specific. Made in 2005 by Studio Bones, Eureka Seven is, to this day, one of the best looking anime ever made. Bones is a studio used to make anime where characters are realistically proportioned, but still retain anime-like features and that allows them to have distinct expressions. You will hardly find a relevant character that expresses in the same manner as the others, tying perfectly with their personalities and demeanors. With the exception of some episodes of minor importance, like the soccer episode, the figures show steady consistency in their character models, retaining natural proportion even when seen from a distance. This is often the animation issue that is most noticeable in other works, but E7 manages to avoid it and deliver stellar animation with beautifully fluid movement without losing its consistency and detail. 

Character designs are striking and memorable. They follow the seinen logic of packing details that by themselves are nothing special, but when placed together form a design that is at the same time harmonic and distinct. Now, all of that aside, the real kicker that makes the series such a visual marvel is its use of colors. From the character designs, both human and mechs, to the machinery, the effects and explosions, E7 always brings the most vibrant and impactful colors. The shining green of the trapar waves, the perfectly toned shades of orange used for the sunset, the lightly flavored natural environments and even pink-colored explosions, everything immediately pops out on the screen, and coupled with the sharp use of lighting, it drives perfectly the mood of the scene, be it action or just moments of important dialogue. When you consider that alongside the number of episodes and characters, it only makes the work Bones displayed all the more impressive. There is nothing I can complain in regards to the visuals that doesn’t boil down to nitpick, as the overall package is consistently pleasing.

Eureka Seven’s soundtrack has its fair share of exciting, blood-pumping tracks to help make the action all the more energetic and even some to evoke a grandiose feeling, but what stands out the most are its emotional pieces. They come in at the exact moment to make you know that you’re about to watch a meaningful moment of character interaction or to highlight development that is about to happen. If you don’t find these tracks memorable, better look for a medic, you might have faulty memory or be lacking a heart. On the voice acting department (Japanese, off course), the most notable detail is Renton’s seiyuu, Sanpei Yuuko. Renton is another teenage-boy played by a female. Let that information sink in for a minute: does the acting, at any moment, denounce that the character is not played by a man? This is without a doubt the most convincing case of a female seiyuu playing a male role I’ve ever seen and can easily dethrone Paku Romi or Takeuchi Junko in this category. Not to say that the rest of the cast doesn’t range from solid to excellent. Fujiwara Keiji plays Holland, so if you are familiar with his work you know there’s no worry and Nazuka Kaori’s portrayal of Eureka reflects with no problem the image of a girl learning to process newly-found emotions, while maintaining a sweet vibe to her acting.

Personal Ramblings

Now, there’s an aspect I’d like to comment on this section specifically. Eureka Seven has some of those moments you could call “shounen moments”, where the logic is made to obey more the emotions the characters are facing at the time and the ones the anime wants to pull out of the viewer, then the internal rules established in the story. This might be just my bias speaking, as I have a soft spot for the shounen genre myself, but I believe these instances enhance the series instead of detracting from it. Sure, they may seem corny to some, but not just of logic you build a cathartic and fulfilling story, emotion is also important and as long as it doesn’t stretch believability beyond what the audience was accustomed to give, or contradicts other rules of the setting, I say “go for it”.

If WattheWut doesn’t mind me borrowing his rating system for a while, Eureka Seven is a Must Watch. Sure, this review might not have convinced you, as I spent little time dissecting how the story unfolds, but trust me, it’s better that you experience that for yourself. Safe to say, I believe this series uses with effect its runtime, as there was a lot to be handled and the manner in which it did was very solid, paced out with no issue. You can call Eureka Seven a perfectly rounded series: it has a tightly fleshed out world with a story that fully utilizes its setting and dynamic, likeable and developed characters, fitting without a problem the universe they live in.

I’m running out of things to say, so go watch the anime."
100179,"Ok, so I saw some of those reviews here, and I was quite shocked, cause I thought that people here have better taste than this.

To start off, Tadakoi is show with great art, and great music, in this part, most of reviewers stopped here, and said how bad it is, I must disappoint you, I am not that type of reviewer, I review only shows that I liked, because I know that bad review can ruin your experience from the show, and that is exactly what happened to me, if you are reading this review, and you havent seen Tadakoi, I would recommend watching it without reading any other review, high expectation, or in the worst case, bad expectations, we humans tend to group up, and you wont like it, if people in your group hate it. (Thanks reviewers, I would give higher rating, but you guys ruined this show for me)

...........................................................................................................................................

Tadakoi isnt standart romance show that you might be used to, I would recommend it for those people, that enjoy shows like: Sakurasou pet na kanojo or amagami ss, because I am on of those people, I loved this show really much, 

art: art in this show, how even worst reviewers here acknowledged top tier, it is comparable to art in sakurasou pet na kanojo, but only comparable, cause that show was 100/100, sometimes I had feeling that art couldnt get any better, and it slapped me right in my face... 

drama- this show isnt drama show, so you cant expect anything depressing to happen, but even so it has some emotional moments, if you want something drama heavy, watch sakurasou pet na kanojo

romance- if you are fan of romance, unlike few of these reviewers, you will like this anime, only thing that was quite disappointing, is that ending was quite rushed, but I mostly like open endings, we got few indications of how other characters ended, but I would still love to see short ova, or something in that matter. 

music- I dont know if anybody here already talked about music in this anime, but I also dont know anybody who would hate music from tadakoi, I even heard it in few videos, as background music, witch proves that I am not only one who likes it, You might be watching this show because of its legendary opening, but opening isnt all, I would like to point out how beautiful is ed from this show, we can hear it being sung by both male and female, and art in that ending, is one of things that create good memories of this show. 

 

some words to end this review- I hope that you enjoyed my review, cause it was first one ive ever done, I hope that you will be able to enjoy this show, without expecting it to be bad, dont get overhyped either, but if you will enjoy this show, you might also like amagami ss or sakurasou pet na kanojo, I know that I named those two shows quite few times, but those are my ideal romance shows, that I gave 100/100."
12549,"-Some spoilers.

Like your average high school boy, Ryosuke Kaga can’t stop thinking perverted thoughts. Unlike the average high school boy, he won’t shut up about it, and cares little for anything other than breasts, butts, breasts, napes, breasts, panties, breasts, and… Um… Underarms. It makes more sense when he says it.  Yes, they may have debunked the theory that men think about sex every seven seconds, but that’s only because nobody studied this kid.

Anyway, on his way home from school, he sees a beautiful red-haired girl standing all alone in the rain outside of his house. Not content to just stare at her wet, transparent shirt, he offers her his umbrella, and invites her in for a change and a shower. No sooner are they indoors and alone then she begins to hold him close… And just when he’s getting ready to ditch his V-card, she winds up penetrating him… through the heart with a giant sword.

As it turns out, her name is Lisara, and she’s a grim reaper… You know, those things that were cool until Soul Eater… And in order to complete her mission on earth, she needed to form a contract with somebody who had inexplicably high amounts of life energy. Which Ryosuke apparently has in spades. Once a contract is made, she draws her power directly from the one thing that makes her new partner love his life so much. Unfortunately for her, she finds out that Ryosuke drives his passion from his perversion, so she can only be at full power when he’s popping a woody… Which works out perfectly, because without that power, she gets her ass kicked faster than Lina Inverse on her period, losing her clothes in the process.

At first glance, you’d think this was the perfect set-up for an ecchi fanservice series… Well, yes and no. We’ll get to the meat of this review in a few paragraphs, but for the moment, I must give credit where credit is due.

So I Can’t Play H… Which I’ll simply be calling H from now on… Was produced by a company called feel, and while I’d love to say some smart-sounding words about their track record and production history, I’ve never actually heard of this company before. They’ve done in-between animation on a few shows I’ve seen, but up until now, the only show they’ve directly produced and animated that I’ve actually seen was Corpse Princess… Which I only remember dropping out of boredom.

I can’t say anything about feel, but whatever their eternally lower-cased history may be, this show is drop dead gorgeous. The occasional CG is breathtaking, whether it’s taking the form of a simple escalator or the teleportation field around a reaper. This is CG rendering that even Sword Art Online would be gasping at, even if the color scheme does kind of become an eyesore in the final few episodes. The backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, expertly framed, and they will absolutely dazzle you with their use of lighting and shading.

The animation for the characters is much simpler, but not bad by any means… Their designs are very standard, a little on the bland side, and nowhere near as realistic as the aesthetic would have you believe, but their movement is still quite a bit more fluid than what you’d find in most shows of a similar ilk. Key frames and speedlines are rare, and they’re used fairly well for what they are.

So, when you’re talking about ecchi titles, the bar is consistently a low one… Titty showcases aren’t typically known for having good writing, original ideas, or any value outside of the perverse. It’s entirely possible for ecchi shows to be enjoyable outside of the skin content that they offer… Strike Witches is a prime example of this… But actual depth and creativity are rare elements indeed. So why am I bringing this up, while talking about a show that’s basically just Bleach meets Girls Bravo, with an older version of Shana in the lead role? Because, believe it or not, So I Can’t Play H came dangerously close to impressing me.

With the plot being set up the way it is, H had a potentially brilliant subversion right in the palm of it’s hand. With Ryosuke being a hopeless pervert who values women solely for their bodies, and who’s depth of character only reaches the level of ‘I like different poses,’ and Lisara drawing her energy from that pervert power, the only thing this show had to do to have me eating out of it’s hand was to not have anybody fall in love with him. If he was simply used as an object, as Lisara proclaimed in episode 1, then it would have been a very clever play on his habit of objectifying women. I can take the plot at face value… Trust me, there’s a lot worse ideas out there… And it makes sense that, under this arrangement she’d eventually get used to being naked around him. From there, she should have grown to see him as a necessary annoyance… A being less than a man, who she doesn’t feel remotely threatened by, like a little kid, or a brainless dog. In fact, the entire harem could have seen him this way, adding a surprising edge of feminism to the heaping helping of boobs that the show throws at us.

And as far as the romantic aspect of H goes, this change would have also helped Ryosuke become a much better character… He could have been emasculated by their treatment of him, faced his immature flaws, and forced himself to develop and grow in order to win more than just Lisara’s time. I can’t even begin to describe how refreshing a dynamic this would be, and I certainly can’t express how much good will I would have had for this title. But alas, this isn’t how things went… Lisara’s promise to use him as a power source was nothing more than the same old cliched Tsundere bullshit that we’ve grown accustomed to.

Every girl in the harem falls madly in love with this skeezwad, and he doesn’t start to show monogamous interest in anybody until the third quarter of the series, and it comes from pretty much out of nowhere, proving to the viewer that male perversion can only be overcome if a woman is willing to accept and tolerate it. Yeah, just love that womanizing douchebag, and he’ll only have eyes for you eventually. I wasn’t really expecting any better than that, but it would have been nice.

Then again, it’s not like that message will ever reach the ears of anybody whom it could damage… I can’t for the life of me imagine anybody enjoying this show without a bottle of lotion sitting beside them, and any negative message it sends will fly right over the heads of THAT market.

Oh, and speaking of all the girls falling in love with him, the funniest thing about H by far is how little it understands human emotion… Yeah, I know, big surprise, no harem characters are realistic. But we’re talking about a whole other level here. It’s not uncommon for harem girls to fall in love with the main character for no reason whatsoever, but this has to be the first anime I’ve ever seen where one of the girls doesn’t start to show an interest in him until another girl suggests it. Yep… No exaggeration there. One of them says “We both like Ryosuke,” and in so many words, the other one says “I do? Oh yeah, I do!” And the laziest love interest in the series was born.

Do I even have to mention that it gets worse than that? There’s a reveal halfway through that’s probably one of the most bewildering anime moments I’ve seen in a long time. Ryosuke skypes his mother for spoiler reasons, and a girl in the room asks her for some information regarding his bloodline. She says, in so many words, “Oh, by the way, I lied about your father being dead.” That’s it. No hesitation, no reluctance, she just drops what should have been a ton of bricks on him out of nowhere and with not nearly enough prodding to suddenly break sixteen years of silence. And his reaction? Mild surprise at best. She gives him a quick explanation, and the subject gets dropped faster than the beat at a Skrillex concert. And no, that’s not a spoiler worthy of a warning… I wanted it to be, as I was pretty damn sure the villain would turn out to be his father in a mask, but it never gets brought up again. It’s even more bafflingly stupid than Ryosuke’s mental dictionary.

Which reminds me… Remember that plot I mentioned earlier? The one I begrudgingly decided to take at face value? Yeah, it’s about as consistent as an everlasting gobstopper. According to the back of the DVD cover, Ryosuke can’t be perverted after Lisara’s used him for power, so he wants to help her so she can leave and his life can return to normal. Yeah, at no point in the show is that ever true. First of all, that’s not the reason he’s helping her… He’s doing it because she says he only has 3 months to live, and he wants her to save him. Second of all, he never stops being perverted… Although even when she’s buck naked right in front of him, he has to (I wish I didn’t remember this) memorize all of the dirty words in a dictionary, so he can call any dirty word to his mind when needed. Because it takes obsessive studying to come up with the word “Bath.”

And third of all, his childhood friend makes a contract with Lisara’s childhood friend, and her passion for life comes from her love of Ryosuke… Spoiler, yes, but you’ll figure that out long before it’s revealed. And get this… The exploitation of her life force NEVER causes her to stop being in love with him. I think that’s a problem, don’t you? That is, aside from the problem of her being in love with a skeezwad.

And oh, I know what you’re thinking… “It doesn’t matter if it’s stupid, and shamelessly puts flesh on parade despite some gaping plot holes, inhuman behavior, and elements that make absolutely no sense. Hell, Strike Witches was a booby show, and the logic revolving around the panties makes for an incomprehensible plot hole, and you love Strike Witches!.” Yeah, you’re right. Strike Witches was a stupid, idiotic mess with copious amounts of bare boobs. But you know what it wasn’t? Pretentious. Strike Witches was a blast from start to finish because it never tried to be anything deeper than action-packed cheesecake. But that wasn’t enough for H.

See, the story gets serious in the second half… Well, at least it tries, but all it ends up doing is making even less sense… And it tries it’s hand at some real drama. I’ll spare you most of it, including Ryosuke’s uncanny transformation into a perfect gentleman the moment he gets a legitimate chance to pork somebody… And talk about the villain’s motive, which is going to be a difficult thing to do without giving away any spoilers.

To put it in ambiguous terms, the villain’s motivation is driven by a disturbingly real threat to the very existence of life on this planet… It’s a threat that nobody is talking about yet, as it’s even more controversial than climate change, and the people who try to take a stand against it are demonized for their efforts. This is quite possibly the first time I’ve seen a fictional story try to tackle this issue, but as I learned before, I wasn’t expecting too much. Ryosuke and his harem are conflicted over this issue, which seems to be far too great a necessary evil to face… And I swear to god, the solution this story comes up with is one of the most contrived fictional solutions I have ever heard for anything. It’s steeped entirely in ignorance of human nature and whimsical sci-fi fantasy, which makes H feel all the more shallow and stupid for it’s efforts. It’s like listening to a ten year old say that Israel and Palestine should just hug it out, or seeing Superman solve the world’s problems by sending all the nukes into space. It’s a cute idea, but for the love of god, please don’t write a freaking story bout it!

If I haven’t already made this clear, H is incompetent down to it’s lowest possible level. The jokes are bad, none of the characters are likeable, the nudity is too constant and over-saturated to remain sexy for longer than the space of a single episode, and the music is made up of cookie-cutter dating sim tunes. It’s childish and stupid down to it’s very core, and while it’s offensive to women in some very creative ways, the only thing that keeps it from becoming completely morally repulsive is the fact that the harem in question doesn’t include any incestuous or lolicon characters. Hell, the one harem girl who’s still in junior high is also the only girl in the entire show who never does any unobscured nudity, because yeah, THAT’s going to save it at this point. The only reason I can see anybody watching this is because of the boobs… And if that’s enough for you, then congratulations, you’re eternally 14.

So I Can’t Play H is available on DVD and Blu-ray from Sentai Filmworks. It’s fairly inexpensive on most sites, with Amazon copies selling from 26 to 35 dollars, but if you were lucky enough, Rightstuf.com had it for 17.99 or 23.99, depending on your preferred format. There’s no dub as of yet, but knowing Sentai, they’re probably just waiting tentatively to see if this title is popular enough to justify spending money on a dub. It’s a shame they have the rights to it, because a show like this really belongs in the hands of Funimation. It’s one of the few titles I’d actually LIKE to see Jamie Marchi write the script for.

The DVD doesn’t include the final thirteenth OVA episode, and while that omission may be a completionist’s nightmare, I really think it’s better to just pretend that episode doesn’t exist. Why? Well, remember all those female characters that you’ve already seen naked in every possible form of undress, and from every possible angle that won’t violate Japan’s decency laws? Well, the final episode is a swimsuit competition! Yeah, that’s exactly what this show needed! No, I don’t want to learn more about the villain, or the whereabouts of Ryosuke’s dad, or the societal results of this show’s idiotic conclusion… I wanna see my fetishes catered to even harder and more gratuitously than before, in an episode that isn’t even a tenth as well animated as the series that preceded it.

So, as worthless as this show is, I can’t really call it the bottom of the barrel. The animation, quite frankly, is too beautiful for that. But it’s close. And keep in mind, the ecchi genre dwells in a barrel that’s every bit as deep as the Mariana trench, and it’s bottom is littered with even more despicable 1/10(or below) titles like Dears, Eiken, Love Love, Popotan, and Master of Martial Hearts. H is floating just a few feet above those titles, and about a dozen feet below School Days. That’s not a place any anime wants to be… Trust me, it’s really cold and dark down there, but it’s where this title belongs, and I can’t wait to post this review and instantly go about the task of forgetting about it. I give So I Can’t Play H a 2/10."
100815,"The aim of this short review is not to get into the technical side of the anime as this is my very first review and I'm not going to pretend I know how to do it. It is my humble way to share with you the feelings I have about this anime.

This spoiler-free review will cover Zoku Owarimonogatari as well as my experience with the entire monogatari series and will try to portray, in my eyes, why this work is unmatched in every aspect of an anime and can be called a masterpiece.

My first experience with the series does not stick at all with the opinion that I have of the series now since I took more than 3 years to finish the first opus, Bakemonogatari. First of all, I discovered an extravagantly animated anime, strewn with sequences containing text too fast to read, which supported a plot as mysterious as bizarre with very atypical characters that I did not understand. In fact, it would be fair to say that I didn't understand anything at all. The misunderstanding that I had for the series quickly turned into discomfort which caused this prolonged break.

But when I decided to let go of my old feelings three years later and paid more attention to the many details that this show contains, I found myself gradually hooked by a unique atmosphere built of all the very details I did not understand before. I realised that this show was a giant puzzle and each season developing a certain character was a piece completing the unordered chronology of the series.

Everything started to sound more and more correct during the episodes until the second season of the show which orchestrated in such a unique way the characters remarkably well developed during the previous seasons. All the emotions came to me perfectly: fear, intrigue, anguish, solace and many more delivered by stunning visuals and ost which mixed well with each other. While I was already filled with this experience so unique in the world of the japanese animation that I knew, the show surprised me once again by introducing the most mysterious and intriguing character in the series so far, Ougi Oshino, in a final arc separated in two parts.

And finally after two whole years came Zoku Owarimonogatari, this separated arc serving as an epilogue to a real singularity among animes.
In just a few hours, a digest is delivered to us which loses by no means the peculiar and unique flavour of the series, following a completely new plot to which Araragi is confronted despite himself. We discover a new facet of each character that we learned to love during the series.

Thus, this epilogue closes magnificently a series which I have no doubt marked the minds of many and I hope will continue to do so."
8676,"I myself am not a very big fan of romances. To be frank, there are not a lot of romances that even appeal to me anymore. After a couple episodes, most romances get branded as bland, boring, plain and cliche. Amagami SS is an exception. After watching countless romances, I've lost that feeling and excitement you get when watching your first ever romance anime. That weird jittery feeling that makes your stomach feel like it's on a rollercoaster. How you toss and turn hugging a pillow after your best girl has a cute scene. Amagami SS somehow made me feel like that once again and I'm grateful for that. Look I know the show isn't perfect, there are flaws that you can point out to me and I won't turn a blind eye to it, I'll probably even agree with you. But here's to why I think it's one of a kind and stands to be one of my favorite shows of all time.

What stands out to me the most about this series is how it's structured. Based off a PS2 dating sim, you get a 4 episode arc for each of the girls. At the beginning of each arc you reset to where Junichi is stood up on Christmas Day which scars him from trying to find love once again. Each arc explores the girls personalities, how they come to love Junichi and how Junichi is able to open up his scared heart once again to try to find love. 

I myself haven't played very many VNs or dating sims, only really ever watching anime. So to me, I found this concept to be alien-like and a really nice twist to the romance genre. Made in 2010, it's crazy to me how this show isn't very recognized and how there aren't very much shows like this. I think this is one of the only shows that takes the dating sim concept and turns it into an anime format. The fact I haven't seen anything like this nowadays and is able to execute all the romance well in a not too cliche way to point it hurts, makes it one hell of a gem in my opinion.

Again made in 2010, just by looking at the cover art or the first couple seconds of the first episode you can tell it was made during that time. Usually this kind of art style would be grating and unappealing to the eye, but after giving it a bit of a chance I grew to love it. I think the art style fits all the cliche romance scenes perfectly and really captures that 2000s anime aura without making my head and eyes hurt.

All the VAs fit perfectly into the characters they were cast into. The VAs were able to perfectly convey what kind of personalities the characters had during the whole show. As a little bonus during each arc's ED contained the VAs version of the song and I found it to be very pleasant to the ear. Both OPs sang by azusa were amazing and also very pleasant to the ear.

The characters are what make up this show. They are what shaped and helped me enjoy the show as much as I did. With the exception of Sae and Rihoko (though they do make up for the Rihoko's in SS+), all the character arcs were amazing and were what gave me that jittery feeling once again. The 3 episodes leading up to that amazing finale where each of the girls get their special moment during Christmas with Junichi, was like a cake. You eat up the middle of that cake (the first 3 episodes) and then you wrap it all up perfectly together with that cherry (the final episode). Makes me jealous thinking about it, damn you Junichi! 

As I said before, this show made me feel feelings I haven't felt in ages. The pure enjoyment and satisfaction I got off of this show was truly amazing and I can't thank enough all the people who contributed to the making of this wonderful series.

If you're looking for a pretty unique twist on the romance genre, with arguable harem elements, this is the show for you! I can't recommend this show enough! Trust me it'll be worth every second of your time!"
759,"Satoshi Kon is widely considered an auteur of bizarre masterpieces. Perfect Blue, Paprika, and Millennium Actress are all strange, high-concept films to varying degrees. However, Tokyo Godfathers might somehow be his oddest film. This isn't due to the film taking the concepts of blurring reality and fiction to insane new levels while incorporating even crazier ideas. The film barely even touches the idea, and it barely even mentions the concept of film in any way. These are two of the greatest hallmarks of a Satoshi Kon movie, and they're largely absent. Therefore, this film is the biggest risk the late director had taken as it seems to be out of his traditional wheelhouse...or is it?

Millennium Actress is my personal favorite of his, and while one of those reasons is due to the beautiful blending of reality and fiction as the film pays tribute to cinema, another is how beautiful and personal it is. The film is about a girl recounting the turbulent upbringing and stardom phases of her life which were predicated on a fantastical idea of romance. If was a story of and by a passionate human being, told to people who were willing to dive deep in and even roleplay parts of the story with her. The film is genuine and human. This sense of humanity is not only present in his other works, but is what Tokyo Godfathers chooses to shine a light on the most. 

This aforementioned sense of humanity is no more apparent than with our main leads: a diverse group of homeless people. The first of this trio is Hana, a transgender woman with a temper and the desire to be a mother. Then there’s Miyuki, a runaway teenager with a real sense of snark. Lastly, there’s Gin, a deadbeat, mouthy asshat who is the first to give up at the moment of resistance, as well as the one with perhaps the most baggage related to his family of anyone in the film. All 3 of them are of varying backgrounds and disasters that led them to where they are now, that being the lowest of the low in society. Yet, these crass individuals are extremely likable, with a sense of chemistry that makes every interaction joyous as the three continuously butt heads. As their backstories unravel, it’s hard to pick a favorite as all of them become fully-realized, sometimes tragic people. 

Even the antagonists of the film, which range from Hispanic gangsters to dysfunctional couples, are all given moments to have redeeming and sympathetic qualities. Much like our main trio, all of them are just people struggling with the bad choices they’ve made, making often dark and risky decisions as a result of where they end up and what they have to do. Each of them also get a chance to connect with one of our main characters in some way as they either darkly reflect our unconventional heroes, or remind them of a piece of themselves they’d rather forget. Several of these scenes make for some of the most powerful moments in the film, and most of them are driven by coincidences.

Contrivance is a flaw with a lot of scripts, as it’s the result of coincidences or in-universe decisions that feel artificially made to force pivotal and dramatic moments in the story to take place when they otherwise would not happen. Despite many of the film’s plot points and emotional moments being driven by coincidences, the film manages to avoid feeling contrived. Everything feels natural and earned, and that’s thanks to how believable these people in the story are, and how powerful and personal their tales are. While the sheer number of coincidences might turn some people off regardless, I personally don’t mind it here. Satoshi Kon’s and Keiko Nobumoto’s script weaponizes them with a level of finesse I have never seen before. Barring some minor loose ends by the end, I barely had a problem with the film, as its pacing always kept the film feeling fresh and exciting.

Speaking of Satoshi Kon, his direction shines in this film once again. He and the animators at Madhouse have produced yet another rich and lively setting thanks to some wonderful art direction. A major factor as to why the city fo Tokyo looks so lively and believable is because of how the animators often took pictures of everyday sights of the city on their way to work, often using them as references. The digital effects they put on the snow that litters the city, and the seas of trashbags that pile up near our homeless trio also look gorgeous. The film’s soft yet dark color pallet, as well as the outfits our characters wear further accentuate the gorgeous, everyday vibe. Everything adds up to a beautiful, often nocturnal city aesthetic that emphasizes how gorgeous a city looks every day and especially every night. It makes for the perfect setting for the characters to frantically run around in, with a sense of weight to the characters’ movements as they desperately run after each other in the film’s many climactic setpieces. The characters’ vibrant facial expressions also sell the lively animation on display. There are frankly, very few off moments in this film, as it remains aesthetically gorgeous and lavishly animated throughout.

Perhaps the least standout thing in this film is its score. This isn’t to say the music was bad, as Keiichi Suzuki still has some nice tracks scattered throughout the movie such as the track “Sannigumi”. He even incorporates a piece by Franz Gruber in one of the many emotional climaxes in a way that feels both hilarious and epic in context. The tracklist generally fits with the casual, often vibrant tone of the film as well as with the everyday setting it takes place in. This might be the weakest OST of any Kon film, but that in no way invalidates what’s present here. 

If Millennium Actress was an ode to cinema, then Tokyo Godfathers is a celebration of humanity, of flawed and underrepresented people as human beings. It’s a charming, exciting, and wonderful film of a diverse group of people engulfed in wild escapades. It’s a lively movie in general, with an aesthetic and sense of emotion to match. On top of that, the movie is deceptively humorous, and unlike anything Kon has made before or since in many aspects. It’s the third masterpiece of Satoshi Kon’s cinematic career, and I am incredibly lucky to have seen this earnest left turn in theaters."
11433,"""They say that once you die, you go to Heaven, but I disagree. I believe that when you die, you travel to somebody's heart, and live on as a memory.""

What I expected from this anime: a group of friends travel to some new town and film some movie. 
What this anime gave me: something infinitely many times better. JC Staff deliver once again.

This anime, under no circumstances, should be classified as a romcom. This is not a romcom. This is a beautiful slice of life romance anime which happens to have comedy in it. And also some aliens. There should be no romcom stigma directed towards it. 

Also, I like romance anime based on more rural areas. The characters feel more tight knit, like they've known eachother since childhood and they live close to eachother or whatever. The relationships and bonds seem closer and this show portrays that feeling of familiarity and coziness between the characters very well.

""But even memories fade with time. That's why people yearn to leave something behind - so they wont be forgotten. So they won't forget. ""

This anime's story is a bit all over the place, right? There seems to be an infinitely long love chain (not to be mistaken for a love polygon; alas the first vertex and the last vertex have no romantic feelings towards eachother), aliens, and MIB to go with them (???), Highschool of the Dead reference (pleasant surprise), and a seemingly amazing summer which holds memories of shooting an amateur movie that these students will never forget. 

Despite this, I only have a few concerns towards it which hold it back from being very close, if not, a 10/10 for me. 
1) The animation. It is very close to being very good. It is very smooth at times, but it is not consistent. This is understandable, as it is hard to keep up smooth animation throughout the whole of 12 episodes. If the animation had been a bit better in a couple more scenes, the score would have gone up.
2) The art. I grew to love it, of course, but I think it could have been done better somehow. I think Kimi no Na Wa's art would have matched this anime more. Maybe something like the illustration in it's Anilist page's banner? Then again, I'm not too sure. The more I think about it, the less I think it would suit the anime. Either way, I'm a fan of the art used. It's a bit generic, sure, and maybe even an overused style but it really grew on me in this show.
3) The emotional scenes. They seemed a bit out of place. I'm not quite sure why. Maybe a lack of buildup up to them, or maybe something else. They in themselves were very good. Smooth animation, extremely good art, good music, etc. I just feel like they could have been 10x more powerful if the buildup was done better (of course, I say that but I'm not actually sure what could have been done better about the buildup), and there was less of the following point;
4) Genericity. Predictability. Cliche. Tropes. Every episode I felt like I could predict exactly what a character was going to say next, or what event would take place next as a response to the previous event or action a character did. However, that in of itself is not necessarily an issue. It can be chalked up to perhaps my experience having watched close to 200 anime at this point. The problem was, as soon as Ichika was even hinted at being an alien, I immediately generated an idea for how the show would end ""I'm sorry... Kaito. I'm an alien and you're a human and even though I have feelings for you, we just can't be... I'm sorry but I have to go to my home planet."" And even though the ending proved me wrong (thank fuck), the anime got surprisingly close to reaching that conclusion. However, this is not about stuff like that. No, no no. This is about Ichika's denseness. And I don't mean the turnip sandwiches. I did not like the 'selfless-ness' aspect of her character one bit - ""I'm just causing harm to everybody here"", ""I am hurting Kaito-san"", ""It'd just be better if I leave them alone as it was before""... That type of stuff. That type of stuff really grinds my gears and every occurrence of it in every show irritates me. I understand why it is done (somewhat) but nontheless it is weak plot/character-building, if you can even call it that. 

Correct these 4 elements and you'd have had something very close to a masterpiece on your hands, J.C Staff.

""That's why I'll keep the film rolling. So I can continue the tale we filmed that summer.""

The anime started with a group of 4 high school friends, and the anime ended with a group of 4 high school friends. (kind of). 

I really liked the show. Kaito was not a generic isekai-esque MC scared to hell of having a girl even look in his direction. But he was no [Sakuta](https://anilist.co/character/127221/Sakuta-Azusagawa) either. If anything, his romance with Ichika was actually kind of what I'd imagine a shy teenage boy's romance to be like. He even pulls of a couple kisses, and arguably weighs the Earth down with the sheer size of his balls at times.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the scenes where Kanna puts her emotions aside to help bring Ichika's out. Kanna selfless as hell. She a real one. Mio a real one as well. She isn't afraid to be thought of as clingy or whatever, she has her eyes on a man she god damn is not letting go. Need me a girl like Mio. It's clear she will always have Tetsurou's back no matter what. I wish he appreciated her a bit more.

The lack of a real plot in the show makes a lot of space for romance in it. And I admit the drama is not perfect, though it is clear JC tried their best to make do with what they had. It is not bad drama by any my standards. 

Lemon is perfect comic relief, and honestly I was a bit sad at her parting in the end. She really was a massive help to the gang's movie-shooting adventure. Her character grew on me.

The ending is really good. It reminded me of Toradora's. Kaito's sister giving him that cardigan for Ichika was a perfect setup to make it clear she had returned to Earth in that ending scene, where she is seen wearing it. It's also mentioned that the movie the school kids are watching post-credits was from ""graduates"" - i.e. by the time we reach the post-credits on the final episode, the group had already graduated. I really can't help but cheer Mio on with Testsurou. I'm so happy she finally caught him. And also wish Kaito and Ichika the best. And hope they meet up Lemon again, somehow someday. As for Kanna... I guess I wish her all the best too."
99088,"What can I say... When I watched the trailer, my expectations were modest, to be honest. I knew Naoki Urasawa was a master of storytelling and story creation, having previously been amazed by his work, “Monster.” However, seeing the “Netflix” mention and the graphic aesthetic, I anticipated a completely conventional adaptation. This is why it took me so long to get into this anime.

From the outset, “Pluto” propels us into a futuristic universe where advanced robots and artificial intelligence coexist with human beings. The narrative involves the detective's remarkable humanoid machine, tasked with solving a series of disturbing homicides. During the investigation, Gesicht discovers cryptic information that he will have to link throughout the work.

Please note that Pluto is an adaptation of the manga “Astro Boy” by Osamu Tezuka.

“Pluto” explores deep and universal themes, such as humanity, artificial intelligence, justice and morality, while bringing to life complex and mature characters. This anime inspires us to ponder moral issues while maintaining our interest with a gripping plot.

To be completely honest, I'm not a great analyst, I'm a visionary, a bit and naive, so if you want a good analysis, won't find it here. This review covers both the story and the manga as well as its adaptation into anime, because it is obvious that evaluating an anime solely on its simplistic story. 

Thus, I believe that “Pluto” fully deserves the title of masterpiece. Its main strength lies in its story and narration. It's a type of story that particularly delights me , where the information gradually reveals everything throughout the story, ultimately revealing its deeper meaning to the whole of the anime. The way in which the story is told simply overlooks the interweaving of the destinies of the characters, each in their own way. manner. And that's where the characters themselves come in 
In “Pluto,” the characters have a complex, human nature, an irony that occurs when robots appear to have more human attributes than other, less complex anime characters. In addition, the development of the characters is of exceptional quality, particularly with regard to the treatment of the character of Gesicht, whose mental development is one of the greatest successes of the composition. Seeing him go through different mental stages allows the viewer to better appreciate this character.

Some may argue that the philosophy behind ""Pluto"" is simplistic, and in part I can agree with that idea. Indeed, the theme of hatred can seem to be used excessively, as if it were the only scourge of humanity. Perhaps it would have been more appealing to explore other vices than the seven deadly sins, which would have made the moral of the story less naive by avoiding raising issues of hatred at all.
But personally, I liked seeing Robots behave more like humans than humans themselves, whether for the good or the bad sides of human nature.

As for the anime adaptation, I was pleasantly surprised. My fears of disappointment quickly dissipated. Admittedly, it's not the most lavish animation around, and I was slightly disturbed by some of the CGI effects. However, these moments of discomfort were few and far between, over the anime's total length of approximately nine hours. Overall, the adaptation turned out to be a success.

In addition, a positive point also on the music which transcribes the emotions very well and which, for some, will be one of the reasons why ""Pluto"" is a masterpiece.

Finally, this is my opinion. Some people might be surprised by my high rating for “Pluto.” However, how can a work be called a masterpiece? These are the emotions, these are the abilities of a work to give us the desired emotions. I have been happy in happy scenes, sad to tears in sad scenes, and angry in angry scenes. This is how I measure the quality of a work, and in my eyes, “Pluto” is undoubtedly a masterpiece."
142455,"https://anilist.co/anime/142455/Bubble/


""Bubble"" is a hyped Anime backed up by some of the most appreciated names in the industry like; it's written by ""Gen Urobuchi"" who also written Madoka, Fate/Zero & Psycho Pass; directed by ""Tetsurou Araraki"" who also directed Death Note & Attack on Titan, music is done by ""Hiroki Sawano"" who also made amazing OSTs for Anime like 86 & Attack on Titan, character designs by ""Takeshi Obata"" who also did character designs for ""Death Note, Bakuman & Platinum End"" and it's animated by ""studio WiT"". So a lot of expectations are surrounding it but;
Did it really lived up to the hype?

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo where mysterious bubbles are still raining down, even though it stopped raining on the remaining world. Some angsty teens started to go into the bubbled Tokyo in order to flex their parkour skills by having tournaments in it's one of a kind track. One day, a guy named 'Hibiki' gets saved by a girl who was later named 'Uta' while climbing the Tokyo tower and then she starts to hang out with him.
The parkour scenes are all what I came for and they did a pretty good job. The choreography is decent, dynamic camera movements & the bright lighting gets a plus, and the backgrounds & scenery are really great. They set the mood & atmosphere pretty well and I really liked them.

All the characters have some eye catching character designs but don't really have interesting traits to compliment their looks. Uta is a damsel in distress who came out of a bubble, Hibiki is your cool MC with some understandable backstory and remaining characters aren't even worth discussing because your first impression of them will gives away everything about them. It's whole 'mermaid' story is very predictable yet gets so much attention that it forgets that it's also a sci-fi. It wanted viewers to care for the story but did a very underwhelming job at it. They focused too much on drama but ended on a poor note. This whole story reminded me of 'Weathering with You' a bit and honestly, that did a better job at drama than this.

The sound is one thing that didn't disappoint. The dramatic & mysterious vocals and the action inducing music, really did a great job at bringing the best out of the scene. Both Eve opening and Riria Ending themes are pretty good too.


If you go into the movie in anticipation of something great, you might get sorely disappointed. It used it's setting only for the parkour which was good but didn't explored it more than the vague plain, it has a fairly big cast who doesn't even have enough screentime to care or develop, which lead to a soap opera of a drama that is simply melodramatic in the end.

- Eye candied Character Designs & Backgrounds
- Good music
- Pretty great Parkour scenes
- Simply bland characters
- Boring melodrama
- Poorly explored setting"
20555,"Conveying Emotions Through Visuals
(Warning: Contains Spoilers)



For three decades, Studio Ghibli has enthralled people with their fantastical narratives, hand-drawn animation, memorable characters, and depiction of emotions. Sadly, When Marnie Was There marked the end of an era for a studio which was home to the likes of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, as Studio Ghibli is on an indefinite hiatus from feature length films. Amidst all the grand castles, whimsical creatures, and gutsy female heroines, is a more subdued tale that is about an introverted girl dealing with her inner problems. In its story and in its characters, When Marnie Was There is different from what Ghibli normally produces. What it does retain, however, is the studio's incredible ability to depict human emotions through the use of visuals.



Story:
Stories of characters creating an imaginary friend in order to deal with their psychological problems is an all too familiar one. Often enough, imaginary characters are products of a protagonist's need for a friend. It is their need for someone who can understand them and guide them. When Marnie Was There adds a twist to this by turning the story into a mystery, but it never really presents itself as a mystery. According to Alfred Hitchcock, mysteries are an ""intellectual process"", but  When Marnie Was There does not focus on the intellectual process. Instead, it focuses primarily on the friendship between Anna and Marnie. It is best to suspend one's critical or analytical thinking as the story goes on because it's not really much of a mystery. 



The friendship between Anna and Marnie is an interesting one. There are tensions and misunderstandings, but the friendship between the two is so strong that it may be interpreted by some people as a romantic relationship. The film is not without its faults because it tries to be two things at once, and the pacing of the narrative is quite slow so things never turn as complex or deeply-layered as they seem. As the film progresses, blurred lines between reality and fantasy become more imminent, particularly in the second half of the film. Whilst this blurring of reality and fantasy can happen to people who have psychological problems like Anna, the execution or approach could have been handled better. Often enough, viewers may have to interpret what is being shown to them because of the fact that information is withheld. This means that the film can get too mysterious or puzzling for its own good. If you take away the supernatural element, then it seems like an odd story about a girl consistently hallucinating and passing out in different places. Although there are hints and foreshadowing on the eventual plot twist, the film's climax is just simply an exposition dump, but can nonetheless, hit you as something that is emotionally strong.



 When Marnie Was There deals with dark themes right from the onset of the film, but it never touches too deeply into them and instead, offers quick resolutions to the problems that are presented. It's not the best or most complex out there, but it is a story that is melancholic and poignant in beauty even for a film that is geared towards children.



Art and Animation:
It is difficult to not be swept away by the beauty of this film. There is a bucolic beauty that comes with the landscapes, nostalgia in the town and architecture, and sublimity in the details of the environment and character expressions. When Marnie Was There is such a picturesque film, that is brings not only the seaside town to life, but also the characters. From the onset of the film, we are already treated to the depiction of emotions through the movement of characters. Anna’s environment is one that is bustling with life, a place that does not befit a person who is dealing with her inner problems. There is a scene near the beginning of the film that I like where in Anna hops off the train and arrives at the seaside town. As the train behind Anna finally pulls away, we are revealed to a more quiet and subtle environment. A perfect transition where I think the animators did one hell of a job. The way the seaside town is presented is that it is made into a place of psychological healing. The characters and the setting blended very well together, giving off a feeling of realism. It is clear that the visuals were made to be the center of attention because it feels like a story on its own. There is not a literal need for dialogue or development in the emotional story that the visuals are trying to convey because it is being done with beautiful shots of moments and the natural setting.



There are misconceptions that the characters are presented with blandness, and that there is also a lack of subtlety to how expressions suddenly jump from neutral to astonished. There are moments when Anna smiles (usually around Marnie, who empathizes with her), but it has to be taken note of, that the protagonist is going through a rough time, so jumping from a neutral to an astonished face is normal. Studio Ghibli has in no way, mitigated their ability to bring their characters to life. They just managed to express the characters in a more subtle way.

img280() img280() img280() img280() img280() img280() 

>""I think the environments and relationships that surround people who are afflicted have a great impact on their psychological healing. This is why I chose to express the sensation we feel in the coldness of water, and in smell and taste. In my films, I place emphasis on the re-creation of what we can feel with our senses. Dramatic expression is certainly one of animation’s strengths, but I believe hand-drawn animation is particularly effective with films like Marnie that appeal to the senses. With hand-drawn animation we get to choose what we want to bring across to the viewer. We can effectively show wind blowing during a moving scene and such. Because it’s drawn, we can draw things to be more beautiful than if they were filmed in live-action.""  - Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi



Sound and Music:
The music in this film was never obtrusive. There wasn't a piece that really stood out in a scene or completely took over it because the main function of the music was to just simply be an accompaniment. To serve as a compliment so that it may further strengthen the feelings that were evoked by the setting. This is a good thing because like the visuals, the music evoked feelings of subtlety and poignancy. These feelings are all the more true for the theme; Fine on the Outside by Priscilla Ahn. It is a beautiful song that was written back in 2005, but was never released because it is quite personal. The artist finally decided to release it along with the film because she saw herself in the protagonist; Anna. The sounds for this film were also pretty good. I thought that the seiyuus for Anna and Marnie did great, and the sound effects blended well with the atmosphere to create a sense of realism.





Characters:
Anna is certainly different from many other female protagonists of Ghibli films. She is lonely, she represses her feelings, and she is in anguish. Anna is a representation of the dark emotions that  a kid can feel and go through. Anna even keeps saying throughout the film that she hates herself which hints at the possibility of suicidal intentions if she had stayed in the city. The playground scene at the beginning of the film is a very good one because it is embedded with meaning, telling us what Anna is like. In the scene, we are shown children playing in the playground and students in groups, but Anna is all alone. We see her drawing something out of fantasy, and it shows that both drawing and creating fantastical things eases her. It gives her relief even it may be a temporary form of relief. The scene gets followed by a teacher asking if he could see Anna's drawing. Anna is hesitant to show her drawing at first, but slowly decides to show and handover the drawing. As she is about to give the drawing, the teacher gets distracted by a kid who is seen crying, so he decides to head over to the scene and leave Anna behind. It's a fleeting moment that shows Anna's shyness, her hesitance to accept help, and her repression of feelings. 



Marnie is an ambiguous character that is the opposite of Anna. She is a manifestation of what Anna desires to be. The fact that her being a ghost or hallucination is never made clear, but it adds to the level of mysticism or ambiguity which she has. At its core, however, When Marnie Was There is about the friendship between Anna and Marnie. It is a very strong friendship that can come off as being a romance even though it is not. Their friendship is one that is heart-warming because many moments between the two characters are handled with subtlety. You won't get a complex character catharsis, but there remains a fact that this is a mature film for children."
20462,"While the premise of a group of people adventuring in a medieval-esque world is admittedly a tad too common in TV media, the same can’t be said for anime.  While some animes do have this as their base premise, they usually deviate from it well into their mid-point. Very few animes follow this premise as closely as Hitsugi no Chaika does, and that’s what makes it one of the better animes of last season.

Story: 16/20 and Characters: 14/20

The story follows Toru Acura, a saboteur – basically a hired gun - who’s out of jobs due to the war being over. While scavenging for food in the forest, he meets Chaika Trabant, a peculiar girl who carries with her everywhere a coffin (hence the title, “Chaika the coffin princess”). It turns out that Chaika is the daughter of the late Emperor Gaz, the person who plunged the world into war years prior. Things happened, and eventually they, along with Toru’s sister, decided to embark on an adventure to collect the late emperor’s remains in order  for Chaika to give him a proper funeral.

The premise itself is already quite interesting. It grants infinite possibilities in where they  would go next and what obstacles await them in their next destinantion. Usually this comes in the form of a former hero who is over-protective of the remains,  but the show throws you a curveball every now and then. It keeps you hooked and wondering what happens next. Chaika is certainly one of the few animes this season that kept me counting the hours to the next episode.

That said, Chaika isn’t without its shortcomings. The pacing can sometimes feel rushed – this is mostly evident in season one’s ending – an additional episode would’ve done much better for the series. It also contains many harem-like elements, and I heard many people despise that. But the biggest shortcoming is surprisingly  the titular heroine – Chaika herself. It’s not that she’s unlikable or anything, you’ll likely find yourself attached to her once you’re at the anime’s midpoint. The problem is that she has a very peculiar way of speaking. If you don’t have the patience, you’ll likely drop this anime just because you couldn’t stand her speech.

Other than that, the other characters are quite likable. While many of them can be shallow at times, and there’s little to no character development, you’ll likely find them hard to hate.

Animation: 10/20

The animation of Chaika is very bones. It has thick outlines, it’s mostly hand-drawn, and anything that moves looks different to anything that doesn’t move. That said, the animation isn’t bad per se, it’s just quite average. You won’t find any eye-popping or ridiculously beautiful scenes  that are better described as works of art, and neither will you find scenes which are dissapointing. Still, if you’re a fan of bones’ animation style, you may find the animation in Chaika to be very good.

Sound and Music: 15/20

First of all, the OP and ED were pretty catchy. It doesn’t particularly stand out, and most of you will probably find it average, but I found that it is quite suiting to the show’s tone. The background music, on the other hand, were pretty neat. They really  fit with the show’s medieval-esque backdrop, and they often add emotional impact to the scenes in which they were played.

In the voice acting department, I don’t have anything to complain about. You may find Chaika’s (the character) voice acting to be very annoying at first, as I said above, but trust me, you’ll get used to it. The voice acting doesn’t particularly stand out like say, Ping Pong The Animation, but it does the job.

Enjoyment: 20/20

Most of Chaika’s pieces may be the very definition of average, but as they say, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The beauty of Chaika shows when it all comes together. No episode felt unnecessary, and you wouldn’t even notice bones slipped an anime original episode somewhere in there. 

Unlike many animes of Spring 2014, Chaika is very consistent, and you’ll never felt you’ve wasted a week waiting in anticipation for a new episode. There’s always a new development around the corner. I’ll give the anime an additional 5 points for this.

Conclusion: Not particularly a stand out, but this is something I’d definitely recommend, given the proper context."
124675,"This is my first review, so don’t expect it to be perfect. I will try my best to be as “objective” as possible when writing this. My review is spoiler free for the most part, so you can rest assured. Without further ado, let's begin, shall we?

“Osananajimi ga Zettai ni Makenai Love Come” or “OsaMake”, for short, is a romantic comedy centered around our three main protagonists: Sueharu Maru, and his two childhood friends, Kuroha Shida and Shirokusa Kachi. Stereotypically in anime/manga, the childhood friend usually doesn’t win the affections of the protagonist, but the author of OsaMake tries to remedy this by making both our heroines the childhood friend, thus meaning that no matter who Sueharu picks in the end, a childhood friend will finally win. However, the problem with that is, while the two childhood friends in the story don't lose like the title suggests. Another problem also arises, they don’t win, as ironic as that sounds. Why? Because of the fact that they're both childhood friends. As far as I know, it's the norm in our society to only date one girl, so no matter what happens, theoretically, there has to be a loser in the end. Sure, it's a temporary win-win and a lose-lose situation created by the author, but it doesn't actually solve the issue of no one wins in the end.



The basic story of OsaMake is a love triangle between the primary protagonists: Sueharu Maru, Kuroha Shida, and Shirokusa Kachi. The premise of the show is that Sueharu has a crush on Shirokusa, who is an extremely popular girl and an award winning high school author. However, his childhood friend, Kuroha Shida, is madly in love with Sueharu and confesses to him, but he only has eyes for Shirokusa, thus rejecting her in the process. Sueharu plans to confess his feelings to Shirokusa, but is devastated after finding out she has a boyfriend. Feeling down, his childhood friend, Kuroha, offers Sueharu to help him get revenge on Shirokusa and her boyfriend. After the matter gets resolved, the plot goes absolutely nowhere because the characters are being stubborn and illogical.



Oh boy, where do I even begin? Out of the various romantic comedies I’ve watched, the characters in this show were one of the most insufferable for me. I’ve watched a myriad of romantic comedies before and I at least liked a few of characters no matter how bad the show was. For this show? I hated almost all the characters in this show, except for Shiro. The main character, Sueharu, is bland and lame; Kuro is extremely annoying and illogical; Maria is a conniving bitch; and Tetsuhiko is, well, simply put, a scumbag. Shiro is the only character I didn't dislike in the show. Okay, the best way to explain this to you is: Let's say you're visiting a farm, and everywhere in the farm you went to, you find a pile of cow poop. Then suddenly, amongst all the cow poop, you find a beautiful flower. Yeah, that flower is Shiro for me. For me personally, I highly value having likeable characters in a show in order for me to fully enjoy it. This show doesn’t fulfill that requirement, therefore, the show is not going to be a fun ride for me. “Why don’t you just drop it?” you might be wondering. Well, my retort to that would be: Why drop it when I could instead finish it and roast it?

img350()



Believe it or not, I actually think the art is one of two strong points for this show. The visuals in this show are pretty colorful and are nice to look at for the most part. The art style is pretty faithful to the original style in the light novel. It’s nothing too outstanding, but it’s not outright terrible also, so I’ll give it some credit for doing something right. Ui Shigure did a great job designing the characters, but man, if only most of the characters in the series weren’t so unlikeable. I actually like the art quite a bit. As a fan of Ui Shigure, it's truly disappointing that her work is being wasted like this.



The only thing that is saving this absolute dumpster fire of a show from being truly terrible for me is its amazing seiyuu cast. The seiyuu cast is absolutely stacked, ladies and gentlemen! We have the legendary king of harem protagonists himself, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, voicing as Sueharu Maru; Inori Minase voicing as Kuroha Shida; Ayane Sakura voicing as Shirokusa Kachi; Saori Oonishi voicing as Maria Momosaka; and last, but not least, Nobunaga Shimazaki voicing as Tetsuhiko Kai. There are many more noticeable seiyuus voicing in the show as well, but those are the main cast. The stacked seiyuu cast alone earned the show 40 points from me. As for where the remaining 20 points are coming from, it came from the opening and ending being slightly above average in my opinion, and the seiyuus did a phenomenal job bringing life to the characters. As much as Kuro pisses me off, I want to give a huge applause to Inorin for making her so mischievous and annoying. Hate Kuro all you want, but without her, the show wouldn’t be what it is (for the better or worse). Once again, I want to give a huge applause to all the seiyuus who had to voice act in this dumpster fire of a show.



Please forgive me after being as objective as I could because I’m going to be absolutely blunt here: This show is trash. I can speak Japanese to a proficient level, so when I saw the title of this show for the first time, I had a gut feeling that it’ll be terrible. The literal translation of OsaMake is “The Romantic Comedy Where the Childhood Friend Won't Lose”. Yeah… You instantly know the show will probably be bad from reading the title. However, I wanted to be wrong on this, so I gave it a shot to prove me wrong. I gave it as minimal of an expectation as I possibly can to surprise me, but it failed. The first two episodes weren't too bad, but after that, oh boy, my pre-expectations were proven right: It was terrible! It was painful to watch this show without turning off your brain, but I would be lying to y’all if I told you I didn’t enjoy it at least a bit. Nothing in this show made sense, but that's precisely why I sort of find it entertaining. There were so many instances the show made me facepalm and make me ask myself, ""but why though?"" Make no mistake though, my homies, this show is bad. Very, very bad as a matter of fact. However, it’s one of those shows that is so bad, it’s actually good.



In conclusion, OsaMake is not a show I would recommend to you if you want a good story. It’s more of a show to watch if you're seeking for a good laugh because of how bad it is. If that’s what you want, then I would suggest giving this a shot. As I mentioned earlier in the enjoyment section, you shouldn’t expect too much from the show. I feel like it could be better than what it is right now if the characters weren't so unlikeable. My closing thought for this show is: It’s a show that is so bad, that it’s actually good.

All right, math time: 150/500 = 0.30; 0.30 x 100 = 30/100"
21659,"Having released in Summer 2016, Amaama to Inazuma is something I admittedly missed. At first glance it just seemed like an anime about a Dad and his daughter doing things, and that really didn’t interest me at the time. Having seen the scene with Tsumugi (the grade school aged daughter) singing the shark song, I decided to give it a watch.

The anime starts by introducing the Tsumugi and Kouhei (the father) waking up, getting prepared for the day ahead and leaving to go about their day. This scene sets up 2 important things that are central points to the anime. Kouhei’s wife (Tsumugi's mom) passed on not too long before the series starts, and Kouhei really doesn’t cook. Later in the first episode, they meet a crying Kotori by herself. She invites them to her mom’s restaurant, giving them a business card. That night, they decide to go, only to find Kotori by herself (what’s worse is that Kotori’s mom is out, and Kotori can’t cook). She barely makes rice, but after the 3 eat together, Kouhei starts to understand how much eating together means to him and his daughter. He then decides to promise to make food. Kotori also requests to have Kouhei make food at the restaurant with her from that point, for Kotori isn’t very good at cooking either. 



STORY
From episode 2 and onward, Amaama to Inazuma has a formulaic episode structure. The first half usually has more slice of life elements, setting up what is going to be cooked in the second half. It isn’t a complicated narrative, and it focuses more on the characters and their interactions with each other, which is very important in this sort of anime. The anime focuses on mostly Koukei and Tsumugi, with Kotori sprinkled in (Kouhei is a teacher in a school, with Kotori in his class. They usually discuss whatever will be cooked in the episode, and Kotori later asking for the recipe from her mother, most of time).


CHARACTERS
Kouhei tries his best to be a great father, and it really shows. Unfortunately, Kouhei’s pretty boring, and it doesn’t feel like his character is fleshed out. Sure what he’s doing is for the good of his daughter, but it just feels like he doesn’t get enough attention in other regards. I would argue that the anime is more about Tsumugi, and she’s fleshed out well. There were a handful of times where I questioned if she did or said something someone her age would actually do. Making child characters is hard sometimes, but other than a few times, her character was done pretty well. I thought Kotori was fleshed out more than Kouhei but less than Tsumugi. It might seem like I didn’t like the characters, but it’s actually just the opposite. I loved it when the anime nailed when and how a kid would act, and I think it does it quite often. Kotori shows a deep care for Kouhei and Tsumugi, which is very clearly hinted at to be love. I am glad that that only made an appearance once though. Amaama to Inazuma’s narrative is a simple one, and by having the anime try to do too many things and having really complex characters would kill its charm.

ART & SOUND
Aesthetically, the anime looks nice for 2016. It isn’t anything mold-breaking in terms of animation quality or music and sound. They are both good, but the OST feels a little on the generic side. The music does take advantage of tone color to emphasize cute and childish, and that’s something I really like about this anime. There were maybe a couple songs out of the whole OST that really resonated with me. The music was far from bad though. Art-wise, it’s pretty Moe, but not overly so. Fortunately, it seemed like a lot of love went into drawing it, even though there were a few times something didn’t look right. Those times were few or I just didn’t notice them. The anime is simple, so having simpler animation and music actually works to its advantage.

ENJOYMENT
Now, I can say that despite my nitpicks, I really liked Amaama to Inazuma. It’s fun to see what Kouhei decides to make and the trial of making it with the others, and that’s the key theme of the anime. It’s wholesome, and this is the thing that it does really well (when it isn't reminding us of Kouhei's late wife). It is truly better than the sum of its parts. Sometimes, it’s a little too dramatic, and that can kill the enjoyment, but it’s good most of the time. If you like cuter anime that you can shut your brain off to, even if only a little, then I would give it a shot.

10721,"If I were to summarize Ikuhara’s Penguindrum in a single word, it would be “bold”.  

Be it direction, thematic exploration, presentation, it screams being the artistic expression of a man who marches to his own (penguin)drum. 

Partially psychological, partially absurdist comedy and partially mystery, but 100% a brain broiler, it is neither orthodox nor easily digestible. Controversial themes are included, and the narrative is not to be taken face-value. I recommend against nitpicking at first watch, opting instead for an empty and open mind intuitively absorbing information.
 img() 
Episodes are rollercoasters (or rather, trains) alternating or mixing seemingly incongruous elements, such as offbeat comedy, intrapersonal and societal themes, liberal use of plot twists, metaphors:
-	Despite not being purely comedic, there is a wide gamut of jokes/gags, some vocal, some visual, some self-standing and some parodies. Those occur even during serious scenes; a bit hit or miss element but also part of Penguindrum's charm.
-	Better not spoil too much on themes, but I note those three outside fate and predestination: conformism, repressed desire and “inherited sins”. 
-	Ikuhara excels at constantly dismantling expectations and presenting new angles to characters or issues. Some narrative tools are abused back and forth, but not haphazardly at all.
-	For metaphors, one of the trademarks of Ikuhara’s style, see section [2.].

On characters, stars are the Takakura siblings as well as Ringo Oginome, yet the whole cast is functional within the narrative. Various outlooks on fate are presented depending on each one’s experiences, e.g., more cynical outlooks being juxtaposed against more romantic ones.



 [1. A few words on soundscape] 
Sound quality is all-round good, be it voice acting, music or ambient sounds. Himari’s seiyuu is in my opinion the #1, especially before and during the iconic musical scene, but other voice actors are not far behind, although I believe a couple of voices mismatch their roles (e.g., Kanba’s). 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlEmAcDm8pY) 

Music is varied, including but obviously not limited to multiple spicy endings, two bittersweet openings and even some classical insert music here and then, such as the Blue Danube. Tracks harmoniously match with respective scenes and/or thematic exploration, and so do ambient sounds. On occasions I also appreciated the lack of background music, that allowed other elements to add their own sound.



 [2. And on Penguindrum's aesthetics] 

Penguindrum thrives on visual storytelling, with images as a narrative tool on their own right. Always keep in mind it is highly symbolical. Be it trains and train lines, the iconic penguins, bird (no, I'm not referring to the penguins) and apple motifs or even the first opening’s title, there is often more than what one only sees. Say penguins: outside providing comic reliefs even during somber scenes, they also serve e.g. as a Ring of Gyges parallel.

 img() 

Even the presentation of the world follows this philosophy, for scenes can be highly stylistic overall or certain colorful ones can make vivid contrasts with more mundane-looking scenery. Either way, there is much screenshot material to be found, I assure you. 

 img500() 
On direction, Ikuhara is influenced by theater, opting for a stage play-like presentation where key details are highlighted whereas secondary ones are minimal. 

Other than being economical, this approach allows to pinpoint focus on what truly matters, evident in e.g., extras being represented by signpost figures. There might also be a metaphorical reason behind this approach, but I cannot judge this easily.

All in all, within animation Penguindrum is a highly unconventional work, displaying vision, passion and much technical skill from its staff. Please give it a chance; you might not appreciate it but you will never ever forget it.

 Hope you enjoyed my review!"
15417,"Gintama is a fantastic series, and one that quickly became a favorite of mine, although not without problems. One of my biggest problems with this series when first watching it was season 3, and Courtesan of a Nation in specific. My feelings on the arc now are much different, but let's just go over my entire experience up to this point and explain why Courtesan disappointed me at first and what I feel about it now after a rewatch of the arc. Spoilers for The first 3 seasons of Gintama. 

I initial dropped Gintama after about 6 episodes, much like a few of my other favorites, and it took me until episode 8 to really get invested and grow to love this series. A lot of ups and downs along the way, but the main things I want to highlight for season 1 here are Yoshiwara in Flames and Red Spider. Yoshiwara was my short term goal when picking up Gintama for the second time. I wanted to meet Tsukuyo. I thought she would be a great character and fit my taste extremely well, and I was right. As soon as I saw her I fell in love with her character. She ended up being my favorite in the series by the end of Yoshiwara. Although the arc had some incredible moments alongside her, she was the main reason I enjoyed this arc as much as I did. Later in season 1 she fully became my irreplacable favorite in Gintama, and also my fourth overall. Red Spider is my favorite arc in Gintama, even anime as a whole. It resonated deeply with me and it meant a lot to me seeing this story in Gintama. 

Tsukuyo's story in Yoshiwara is great. She's adorable and sweet, but also very strong and capable. It doesn't have to give you much more than what it does to make Tsukuyo a great character and get my hopes up for even more of her story, but Red Spider blows it out of the water. An entire arc dedicated to Tsukuyo and her own weaknesses and past traumas. Not to mention the incredible use of color and symbolism in this arc. It's my favorite because of those things and my own personal experiences with trauma and how I cope and deal with my problems. I see so much of my self in Tsukuyo and this arc only reinforces those feelings. Seeing her struggle to open up and rely on others, being afraid of being a burden, and ultimately Gintoki helping her and telling her it's okay meant a lot to me. Although Gakkou Gurashi helped me learn these lessons already, Gintama truly struck a cord with me. It's exploration of Tsukuyo and those traumatic experiences and feelings are incredible. ""It's a pretty face carrying a clean soul."" My favorite Gintama quote and one that captures the entire essence and feeling of Tsukuyo as a character. Her scars are the path she chose to lead, and although they may be a result of those traumatic experiences they will always be hopeful and a reminder that Tsukuyo controls her own path in life and no one else. She found people to love and cherish, who will help her through her problems. That is why this arc is so important and meaningful to me. 

Season 2 doesn't have any arcs dedicated to Tsukuyo and her growth, but does have a lot of really great stand alone episodes with her and I love all of them. What's most important about S2 in this case is Four Devas. My second favorite arc, and one moment in specific that absolutely amazed and shocked me. Gintoki and Jirocho's fight. Seeing Gin snap hit me incredibly hard. It is one of my favorite moments in the entire series, and practically made the entire arc on it's own, but why is it important for season 3? More specifically Courtesan? 

It's one of the biggest reasons Courtesan disappointed me. I watched all of Gintama in about 3 months so when I got to Courtesan I was still sort of fresh off the excitement of Four Devas and had very high hopes that it would go beyond those moments and give me even more incredible moments. It did not do that the first time around. Gintoki DOES snap again, but it is short lived this time around so I waited the entire arc for him to get badass and do it again, but it never came. I ended up disappointed despite crying at the ending and thinking it was gorgeous. Despite the beginning being incredible and everything interesting going on with Nobume. My expectations from prior arcs made Courtesan worse. However, on rewatch I loved this arc. It became one of my favorites almost immediately and I loved every moment of it. Parts that disappointed me originally were beautifully done, and even fantastic. I think part of that is because I knew where the story was going from there, but I also recognized just how incredible it is as closure for Tsukuyo this time around. 

Tsukuyo is a major part of Courtesan of a Nation. Her last time being in the spotlight of a ""serious"" arc, although her character grows more even beyond this point. She is the most important character in it. She finally begins to trust in others and get help from her friends. She made the promise with everyone to come back safe and alive. When Gintoki got shot by Isaburo she was the one to put her life at risk to protect him. Courtesan completes Tsukuyo's arc in a beautiful way, and gives closure to her past mistakes. She becomes more open and loving towards those she cares about and more accepting of her femininity (although still a little embarrassed by it). This is why I love Courtesan of a Nation now. For the closure it gives on Tsukuyo's story."
132456,"Contains very minor spoilers.I know what I said when I titled this review, but please, before you immediately scroll past it in its entirety to slam that thumbs-down button in an indignant fit of “how dare they say my loli fantasy anime isn't original?”-induced rage, hear me out for a minute.

As you can tell from the second half of rest of the title, I think this anime is good. I’m by no means writing this review just to take a big ol' shit on it, I just have a lot to say about it and I figured barfing it all out on a review would be the most productive way to get that all out. It's been a hell of a ride watching it release these past couple of months, so I hope you'll join me.

Heads-up, I’ll talk about this series both as a standalone anime and as an adaptation of a manga I like, but if you’re here because you only care about the show, I won’t bore you too much with all of that so don’t worry.

The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated! tells the story of Jahy, the Dark Realm’s fearsome second-in-command, who’s suddenly stripped of most of her powers and transported to the human realm after an attack by a Magical Girl leaves the Dark Realm’s mana crystal in pieces.

Jahy plots to rebuild her realm with the mana crystal shards that have now been scattered across the human realm as well as seek revenge on the Magical Girl who caused her world to fall, but this is no easy feat when she’s tasked with both trying to keep her job and pay rent for her cramped apartment in this unforgiving world.

Put simply, it’s your standard isekai sob story of losing everything and being made to live in an unfamiliar world. Sounds depressing, doesn’t it?

I think now would be a good time to mention that it's a comedy.

Despite having a premise that you’d usually expect to find in a 100k words slowburn hurt/comfort isekai AU fanfiction, it’s far, far more light-hearted than it sounds on paper. Each episode is essentially a set of skits that sometimes end in happiness and sometimes in frustration, but all in Jahy making her way towards the reconstruction of her realm with the help of the friends she quickly makes in the human realm. It’s really wholesome and quite motivating, actually, and is basically just a story of this stuck-up loli girl learning to open up to others and managing to work towards her goals, even if only a little at a time.

It deals with usually pretty tiring issues like work and rent, but thanks to its slapstick theme it never makes them seem as depressing as we all know far too well that they are in real life. It’s refreshing in this sense, and although the idea of making stuff that’s a pain in the ass in real life into a comedic gag isn’t exactly new, it still seems fresh when said stuff is experienced by a chuuni Dark Realm lord.

Its comedy doesn’t mean it’s devoid of genuine emotion though, and it has its moments of sadness and regret. We all know that feeling of having a goal we just have to complete but becoming intimidated by the mountain of work ahead of us that we’ll have to climb over to achieve this goal, and the one thing The Great Jahy is somewhat realistic about is this. It’s heartfelt and down-to-earth in this regard, but it also doesn’t linger on it long enough for it to actually get us down and break the fluffiness that the rest of the show creates, whether that be for the best or otherwise.

In terms of how it adapted the manga, aside from reordering a few chapters and skipping one or two where they weren’t needed, I’d say the anime was almost entirely faithful. It adapted around 70 chapters and even added relevant filler in some places, but it was paced well and never felt like it was trying to speedrun to the end thanks to its two cour run. The way it mixed actual plot progression with simpler skits was also wonderful, and it wasn’t ruined by its ending either like some other comedy and/or isekai shows.

If I had to pick one aspect of this show to call its strongest suit, the characters are no doubt what I’d go for.

To describe them in one word, they’re colourful. From Jahy, the kusogaki pain-in-the-ass who isn’t actually quite as unfeeling as she thinks she is, to the seemingly evil but honestly just misunderstood Magical Girl Kyoko, each character has their own very unique personality and gimmick that never really seems to get old. Almost every interaction is absolutely hilarious, and the characters bounce off of each other wonderfully.

What’s most genius to me is that, thanks to the series’ more episodic format, characters are never overused. Aside from, obviously, the main character, and to an extent the Boss and Landlord as the secondary protagonists, each character will dip in and out of the story at different intervals, meaning that enough time will have passed since their previous appearance for them to feel fresh once they come back in. It’s this that really makes this show work as well as it does, and what keeps it watchable for the entire 20 episode run.

Additionally, despite this anime’s simple and light-hearted premise of “what kinda funny and slightly unfortunate demon bullshit can we pull next?”, characters aren’t at all devoid of development. Jahy in particular really changes for the better over the course of the series, and even colder characters like the Landlord soften up a bit as her bonds with her new friends start to strengthen. The Great Jahy is ultimately a story about making the best of bad experiences, and it doesn’t fail to deliver those teetee wholesome moments of reflection alongside its slapstick comedy.

Design-wise, the characters are just as eye-catching as you’d guess from their vibrant personalities. Jahy’s two forms are both great in different ways, and I really have to take my hat off to Konbu-sensei for managing to have her switch between being a loli and an absolute milf without ever carrying over the horniness of her latter design to the former. It’s a comedic gag that works without feeling weird and I honestly really like it for that.

The other characters are definitely worth mentioning as well, as they’re plain enough to avoid being Mary Sue-ish, but they’re not so plain that they just look like background characters. I like the demons’ designs in particular, specifically Saurva’s, as she looks demonic enough to fit in at an anime con but isn’t stupidly over-the-top about it like many other anime girl demons are.


Honestly, considering how much I adore the manga’s art, I was thinking I was really gonna love the anime’s as well provided it was a decently-accurate adaptation.

I was wrong.

While not offensively bad, the show’s animation is lackluster to say the least. It’s honestly disappointingly amateurish, and while studio SILVER LINK. isn’t exactly up there with KyoAni and ufotable in terms of reputation, it’s still produced shows with far better animation than can be seen in The Great Jahy. It’s just utterly devoid of any care it could’ve been given had more time been spent on it.

Character movement often feels stiff and wonky even during repeated scenes such as the openings, and backgrounds sometimes even look like they’ve been created from photobashed free use pngs some tired animator found on Google dot com after their third coffee of the evening, making it frighteningly obvious how low-budget the show is and what little was done to rectify that.
img400()
Look at the foreground. This is an actual unedited screenshot.

That being said, it’s not absolutely unwatchable, and it tells the story well enough to leave one satisfied after an episode. As I mentioned earlier, the character designs for one are nice, and I also liked how closely the art style sticks to the source material’s, as that’s definitely one of the manga’s strong points for me. It’s faithful and I guess that’s what ultimately matters, but that won’t stop me from wanting to punch a wall every time I see that one specific shot of Jahy flinging her arms up at the end of Fightin★Pose.


I don’t have a lot to say about this anime’s voice acting, and that’s because it can be summed up pretty quickly: it was really, really good.

The anime has a lineup of fan-favourite VAs, and they’re casted absolutely perfectly. Each character sounds pretty much exactly how you’d picture them sounding if you glanced over their design sheets–aside from Kyoko, but that’s only because I literally had no idea what I expected her to sound like, and, honestly, I dig deeper voices anyway so this is a win for me.

My singular complaint? Small Jahy’s voice can kind of grate on you after a while. This isn’t at all because of Ozora’s performance though, it’s simply because small Jahy is really that annoying sometimes and her VA brings it to life far too perfectly.


As a perfect point to lead off from the previous section on, all but one of the anime’s openings and endings were actually sung by the voice actors, and they’re honestly really good as far as VA songs go.

While none of them are particularly memorable and all failed to make it onto my Top 10 2021 Anime Songs I’d Get Drunk In My Girlfriend’s Basement To list, they’re still catchy enough to not be immediate skip material. None were stand-out enough for me to feel the need to do an individual review of them all, but they all fit the anime’s tone perfectly, especially the second opening: Life is Hard DAME DINERO, which is basically “I’m poor give me money” in genki anime song form, and what is The Great Jahy if not that?

In terms of op/ed animation, however, I wasn’t really feeling it as much. The animation sticks to one specific aesthetic across both openings, and while it isn’t ugly by any means, it kind of feels like a mental breakdown of bright colours and repeated animation loops that exist to look nice while eating as little of the budget as possible, which didn’t do either song justice. The endings I liked more, honestly, as while they’re equally as low-effort, I really dug the chibi style and all the cute little storylines they tell throughout the songs. But I realise I’m just going back to my animation bashing, so let’s move on.

The OST wasn’t anything to write home about, in all honesty. It hit at all the right points, but not one song was memorable enough for me to recognise it, and I’d be hard-pressed to answer if you asked me how many times each one had played throughout the series’ run. That’s less of a complaint and more of an observation though, because only very few anime OST composers have ever managed to impress me to the point at which I actually recognised different songs in different episodes.

All in all, good, maybe even great, but too average to ever be something I’d recommend this anime to someone on the basis of unless they were a Hololive fan.


Is this anime perfect? No. Is it still worth watching anyway? Yes.

I’ll be the first to say as a manga fan that I was disappointed by this adaptation, but it wasn’t so devastatingly awful that I started to resent it as a result. It’s a fun show and I loved watching it be brought to life by the wonderful team that worked on it, despite all my complaints about certain aspects of it.

The Great Jahy is essentially just a prime example of why you shouldn’t sleep too hard on the slapstick surreal comedy genre. It’s not the best anime ever and it’s definitely not for everyone, that much is obvious, but it’s worth at least trying a couple episodes of if it’s something that piques your interest. Or, hey, embrace your inner manga reader and give its superior source material a shot.

I’d recommend this to, of course, fellow chad enjoyers of reverse isekai and fun characters with slightly horny designs, but also to anyone who just needs a low-braincell show to senselessly switch off to and enjoy. The Great Jahy is by no means the most revolutionary anime to drop this year–I mean, it’s not even in my top 5 for this season in that regard–but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good watch for anyone who needs a bit of dumb comedy to make them smile in these trying times.



Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you got at least something out of it. I appreciate it!"
104723,"Just your generic Ecchi Harem, but this time it includes the mother.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
The story focuses on a Mother and a Son being transported into a game world. Masato, being the epic gamer he is, wanted to show off his incredible skill to all the gals to impress them but his mother, who somehow managed to take out two swords instead of one like you're supposed to, takes the spotlight everytime.

The story is about the bond between the child and the mother and how it never can fade away, our main characters are tasked with fixing all of the bond betweens these mothers and their children. We soon learn that there are these evil gems that might actually be controlling the mothers behaviour and making it much more extreme therefor ruining that existing bond.

Thats about it, this show is filled with many ecchi moments between the mother and the son, thats what ruined the show for me. Like my dude, stop that please. Where's the step prefix part at?



[CHARACTERS:]()
Masato - The main character, he is an epic gamer who wanted to flex his gamer skills to all the ladies but ended up getting his spotlight by his mother. 

Mamako - The second main character and also the mother of Masato, she doesn't know much about Video Games but still manages to kick ass to all the bad guys. She also ends up in very ecchi moments with her son. Sweet home Alabama.

Porta - A lil gal who wants to help people by making use of her pouch to store items. She can't fight. She is also really cheerful.

Wise - A tsundere, she always kills Masato. She is a mage who has many cool capabilities. Also gets into ecchi moments with Masato. Her mother isn't the nicest person, she left her in real life but suddenly came back to make her come into the game world only to be affected by the gems from a mysterious donator.

Medhi - Big tiddy healer that Masato fell inlove with at first sight. She is also gets into ecchi moments with him. Her mother wants her to be #1 and because of the gems that ideal got 100x stronger. Medhi just wants to be a normal girl.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The animation isn't half-bad to be honest. It's watchable. 
In combat scenes its nice and fluid, and in the Ecchi scenes the physics go haywire and there is jiggling everywhere. But heya, what can ya do.

The art style is also good but does have that generic feeling to it, you probably couldn't tell it apart from many other low budget shows. But it doesn't look bad at least.




[MUSIC:]()
OP and ED are okay, catchy to be honest. But nothing more than that, I haven't really listened much to them outside of the show. The OST was kinda meh, already forgot about it to be honest.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
First episode was decent-ish but then it devolved into ecchi-fest filled with mother and son ""bonds"". Also it felt like Slime in the sense that you already knew that each encounter was gonna be won by the same character but despite that the other still tried to fight the monsters."
98820,"The end of high school is commonly portrayed as an extremely nostalgic period of time, especially in anime. It’s the symbolic end of youth, the moment you stop following the beaten path, say goodbye to your friends, and go your separate ways. It’s often used as a motif in stories of young adults having trouble finding themselves and still longing for those school days, but also as the symbol of inevitability for freshman and sophomores who ponder about the flow of time and come to realize how soon their youth will end.

But it’s suprisingly rare to see a story that actually focuses on the very last stage of student life, those last few months of senior year, when it becomes apparent how different everyone’s lives will become soon. Some people already have their college recommendations, others are busy studying for exams, and there are even those who are already done with their education and will join the workforce immediately after receiving their diploma. It’s the twilight of high school, and you’re at the crossroads of how you’ll begin your adulthood. On one hand it feels like being suspended between these two completely different phases of your life, on the other it’s the last minute to do the things you can only do now, before moving on. Confess love to your long-time crush, rethink your career path. Try to find a surrogate for the achievement you were never able to accomplish, in hopes of having fewer hang-ups going forward.



Just Because is brimming with the atmosphere of fleeting time. Between washed-out color palette, grounded designs and quiet, calm soundtrack, the show drowns the viewers in nostalgia and melting mood. The timeframe of late autumn-early winter definitely helps in creating a very somber, but warm and charming story. It can also feel very personal and touching at times, thanks to detailed animation of faces and gestures. This show associates a particular taste with this time period, a taste not everyone will recall from their own last few months of high school, but it’s so palpable here that almost everyone should be able to empathize with some of the characters in one way or another.

On a different note, it’s worth mentioning that this is first and foremost a love story. Some kids have feelings for one another, which they explore and decide how to act upon. Perhaps all I’ve been writing about, the atmosphere, the theme, are just a window dressing for the events of love lives of a couple of teenagers. But for me, it’s the exact opposite - the drama is just there to drive the plot, while main focus is on those little touches, background events and other aspects of the show, that combined together create its mood. 

The characters aren’t very complex, largely defined by just few traits and interests, but there is some nuance to at least a few of them. The relationships between them seem to work largely on the things unsaid, and on how they dance around topics and keep thoughts for themselves, afraid of the other party’s reaction. This leads to a lot of nice, subdued moments, and a few emotional outbursts which appear powerful by contrast.

img220()

All this results in quite a unique show. Between the unexpectedly rare timeframe, lowkey drama and nostalgia oozing out of every moment, Just Because manages to find its niche in the everbusy high-school-slice-of-life genre. It’s hardly revolutionary, but it delivers on its promise and I could definitely see it being exactly what people longing for their high school days might be looking for. It’s comfy as hell, and that’s as much as anyone could ask of such show."
129191,"Note: TLDR at the very bottom.

Story - 4

Shikkakumon no Saikyou Kenja is technically not an Isekai anime but also felt like an Isekai anime. The protagonist became the strongest he can be with the crest he is born with but he wants to get more overpowered so he reincarnated himself into the same world but many years later. His aim is to get the strongest crest. Technically, he re-spec in gamer term.

Matty, the protagonist of the show reincarnated himself in the future and got himself the strongest crest but a lot of things in the world have changed. The weakest crest is now understood wrongly as the strongest while the strongest is understood as the weakest. Humanity has also lost the ability to cast spells without chanting. Matty found out that it is the demon’s doing and embarked on the journey with his party to uncover their plan.

I have no issue with power fantasy if it is done right with an interesting story and plot but Shikkakumon no Saikyou Kenja is not that. The show is very simple and predictable. Matty is going to enrol into an academy, geez I wonder who is going to ace the entrance exam? Of cause it is Matty. He was even made an instructor.




Matty is also very overpowered thus he just steam-rolled over everything be it fighting, uncovering mystery or investigating demons. He literally can sense where the demons are or see invisible demons. The show also constantly loves to remind us that Matty is overpowered for some weird reason.

Matty is not only overpowered with his skills and spells. The kings and the academy principal also bow down to Matty a lot just because he is powerful. It almost feels like the kings and the principal have zero wisdom and will be helpless without Matty.

Worldbuilding is weak since the story is mostly shown from Matty's point of view and he mostly narrates everything that is happening. The comedy is not great either, I get zero amused moments let alone laughing out loud. Iris, a dragon who turned herself into a human form tries to pull some comedic moments but I just find her cute instead. 



Then if the plot is not interesting, the combat has to be good right? Well, it is very average. Combat feels very repetitive with Matty and Party doing the same thing over and over again without much clever tactical in early episodes. The way they slowly thin the number in a town controlled by demons in a later episode with teamwork is okay but still very straightforward.

The anime is not a harem show despite Matty being surrounded by girls. There are some hints of romance but It doesn’t go anywhere and goes no further than blushing. 

Character - 4

Since the plot is pretty “meh”, the character got to be interesting to carry the story, right? Well, no. Since the story is mostly from Matty’s PoV and he is the main character that is moving the plot forward, the side characters have almost no development. This is also bad since Matty is a bland protagonist.



Matty is a monotone character who stays the same throughout the show. He is very overpowered and has a lot of knowledge due to his past life. Matty is also kind of arrogant but sometimes the author tries to force him to do some comedy and it just feels awkward. Matty is also bad with girl's touches like some generic harem MC. If you are this overpowered, at least be a sigma male.



Lurie and Alma are part of Matty’s party and both of them have a tiny bit of character development in early anime when Matty trains them but they stay the same throughout the show after that. Even the way they fight didn’t change. The interaction between the two and Matty is also uninteresting, sometimes even feels distanced. Both of them exist only to support Matty. Lurie does have some romance happening with Matty but it doesn’t go anywhere.



Iris is a dragon girl and an old friend of Matty. She took the form of a human girl to accompany Matty on his adventure and she is the best character in this show. Unfortunately, she also has the least amount of screen time out of the four characters. With her clumsy personality, she tries her best to amuse the viewer from casually bending a sword and scaring people to destroying things.

There are other characters in this show but they are just background characters who make no difference to the story. 

Art & Animation - 5.5

Shikkakumon no Saikyou Kenja’s general art and animation are average at best. Overall it looks more like a budget JRPG looking arts and colour usage.

Character art wise, they are okay but they do look like generic budget JRPG game characters. I read the manga a bit and I can see the studio adapted the art style to be the same as the source.



Background art styles are okay, very generic fantasy looking indoor, shops, houses, castles, etc... The details are also fairly decent. What is not so decent is the feel of the town, it feels empty. What is awkward is that there are parts where the close up scene got people around but the view from the sky of the area is empty.



Animations are okay but won’t blow you away. Combat got some slight choreography and animation and is not all close up camera tricks with some background effects. I won’t say the choreographies are good, they are simple and the magic spells are generic looking. The show also loves to add more magic circles and rings to show that the spell is powerful but the spells themselves are not impressive.

Sound - 5

The opening song sounds generic even if it does fit the theme of the show. The ending song is pretty good with its chill and cute vibe.
Background music exists only to support the scene. Nothing fantastic or memorable but the music does fit the theme.



The sound effects are okay. Didn’t notice anything missing but some choice of sound effects such as clashing of the sword and shooting of smaller spells sounded very generic as if they are some stock sounds.

The voice acting is pretty decent. Matty's voice feels a little bit bland or monotonous but the rest of the characters have good voice acting especially Iris with her accent and cute voice.

TLDR:

A generic fantasy anime with a bland story, simple plot and uninteresting characters. Can summarize the story as demons are bad, they mess with humanity's progress so the overpowered protagonist fights them with his party."
155211,"Introduction (Spoiler Free Thoughts on the prior seasons)

For better or for worse, DanMachi’s full title of “Is it Wrong to Try to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon” has always acted as a filter of sorts to screen out people looking for a good story and filter in people who were just looking for a fun anime to watch.  And through the first 3 seasons, the anime acted the part as it leaned into the haremy aspects of the story while keeping things fast enough paced to make sure it was never boring.  The collective opinion on it was that it worked well for Season 1, failed for Season 2 and was somewhere in-between for Season 3.  When Season 4 came around, most were expecting more of the same, but instead the bold decision was made to change up the strategy to align more with the source material which paid immediate dividends.  Season 4 Part 1 was darker and more intense than any prior season.  There was palpable danger at every turn, and the side characters got more focus than ever before.  If there was one issue with it, it felt like it dragged a little as it did everything it could to fill the 11 episodes and end on a huge cliff hanger, all to set up this season.

Season 4 Part 2 (Spoiler Free Thoughts)

I’ll be giving my spoiler filled thoughts in the next section but wanted to provide this section specifically for people who wanted to hear about the season without being spoiled.  If you have already watched the show, you can save yourself a little time and skip to the Spoiler Section. 
 
Calamity had struck in the lower levels of the Dungeon as Bell and Ryu had been badly injured and fallen a full 10 floors below their comfort zone with the Dungeon’s “Cleaner” hot on their tails.  Meanwhile, the rest of the party who had been relying on Bell a lot in Part 1 were in equally dire straits matched up with a high-level floor boss.  This season was all about their struggles to survive the unparalleled dangers that they now faced. 

The perspective flipped from one group to the other and back again with the party getting more of the focus in the first half of the season and Bell and Ryu getting the focus in the second half.  The second half was the clear highlight of the season with the final 4 episodes (especially episode 9) being particularly great, but the first half, especially the first 3 episodes, was also pretty strong.  This season, more than any other allowed for nearly all of the individual characters (Bell, Ryu, Welf, Lili, Mikoto, Haruhime, Cassandra, Daphne, Ouka, Chigusa and Aisha) to shine with Welf, Mikoto and Cassandra getting particular focus from the party and Bell also getting his usual time to shine as the MC.  

But the star of the season was without a doubt Ryu to the point where she often outshined even Bell.  A character who had always had supporting roles in past seasons, Ryu finally got her own arc and absolutely owned it.  Her character arc touched all points of the spectrum from hype to devastating to heart melting to solemn.  We got her back story and finally got to understand the motivations behind one of the most complex characters in the series.

From a production standpoint, this was probably the best season yet as JC Staff put out strong episode after strong episode, only noticeably slacking on one episode (which I’ll discuss in the spoilers section).  Overall, it was a great experience, and I’d highly recommend watching it.

Season 4 Part 2 (Spoiler Included Review)
For this section, I’ll be splitting the Review into 3 parts to discuss three different groupings of episodes that go together and signify shifts in the quality of the season respectively.  I apologize in advance for the length.  I had a lot of thoughts.

Part 1 (Episodes 1-3) The Amphisbaena Fight
The primary focus of the first 3 episodes of the season was the Party’s Battle with the Amphisbaena (Floor 27 Boss), and it was much better animated and directed than I was honestly expecting.  Pretty much every character got their chance to shine with Mikoto, Haruhime and Aisha having particularly big roles.  The fight kept up the intensity throughout and flipped back and forth between the party and the Amphisbaena having the advantage with there being moments such as the end of episode 2 where it looked like a few party members really were about to die.  Speaking of that, if I had one complaint about the fight it’s that it made it look like Haruhime survived the Amphisbaena’s fire breath attack due to plot armor rather than the Goliath Cloak she was wearing.  

The climax of the fight was awesome with Mikoto and Haruhime epically starting their spell chants as last-ditch efforts after getting hit by the Amphisbaena’s attacks.  The rest of the party took advantage and delivered the winning blows to the Amphisbaena.  And after the battle, Cassandra got her chance to shine as well when she finally convinced Daphne to believe in her visions which ended up saving the party.

At the same time that all of this was happening, Bell and Ryu were struggling on the 37th floor.  Bell looked the part of a newbie in the Dungeon again as he was scared and unable to think straight.  Ryu was even more out of it as she had to be convinced by Bell to even try to survive.  She was emotionally ready to die there but decided that she should at least do everything she could to help Bell survive the ordeal.  Bell struggled mightily against his first monster on the floor and barely won while tiring himself out.  If not for Ryu’s guidance, he probably would have died, and that was against a mere common monster on the floor.  And when the Juggernaut came calling, Bell panicked even more and launched off several firebolts which luckily for them succeeded in piling up enough rubble to block off the Juggernaut.  Bell and Ryu eventually found a cave where they were able to get a little rest.

One thing I liked in particular about this group of episodes was its see-sawing from the Party’s perspective to Bell and Ryu’s perspective.  When the party was making some headway, Bell and Ryu were in mortal danger, and when Bell and Ryu had gotten a respite, the party was in mortal danger.  It kept up the tension really well and made these three episodes really strong.
Episodes 1-3 Rating: 8.9/10

Part 2 (Episodes 4-7) Fighting the way through the Dungeon
After the highs of the first 3 episodes, this part was more of a transition part, including the necessary in-between details to get from the climax of the season for the Party to the climax of the season for Bell and Ryu.  

Starting off with the Party again, the Dungeon was not about to let the Party off with just a Floor Boss battle.  It followed up from the Amphisbaena by sending all the monsters on the floor after them.  With the party backed into a corner, Welf made the bold decision to make a never-before-seen type of magic sword while the rest of the party held off the monsters.  It was time to take the first step towards fulfilling his dream, and he was doing it in a do-or-die situation.  Having read the series, this was supposed to be one of the most hype parts of the entire season, but due to past seasons largely ignoring Welf and his motivations, it fell kind of flat and made it seem more like power of friendship than anything which was disappointing.

The other highlight for the party from this section was the Xenos and Benevolent Mistress members saving them once Welf had done everything he could to hold the monsters at bay with his new sword.  It was a lot of fun seeing the Hestia Familia members interact briefly with the Xenos again, particularly Haruhime and Wiene.  Anya was also a joy to watch with all of her CATch phrases (sorry for the bad pun).

Moving back to the Bell and Ryu side of things, each episode began with a minute or two long glimpse of Ryu’s life with her Familia before they were slaughtered by the Juggernaut, giving insight into who these people were that Ryu had sworn to avenge and into who Ryu used to be.  Interestingly enough, younger Ryu was an idealist much like Bell. Through debates around justice with her 3 best friends in Alize, Kaguya and Lyra, we got to understand both what their characters were like as well as what their relationships with Ryu were like.  Kaguya was her rival, Lyra was her sempai who taught her many skills and Alize was the person Ryu cherished most in the world.

As for what Bell and Ryu were doing during this part, they were doing whatever they could to try to find a way back to the main path.  These episodes were a training arc of sorts for Bell as Ryu advised him on how to fight more efficiently and combining it with the advice he had gotten from Aiz, Bell improved his fighting style to the point where he was now able to go 1 on 4 with Level 37 Monsters.  Ryu only participated in the fights as necessary since she had used all her healing powers on Bell rather than herself and hadn't healed her leg.  There were some nice moments between Bell and Ryu in this part such as them making a pinkie promise and Ryu getting embarrassed about drinking from the same cup as Bell, but there wasn’t a whole lot of progress being made.  Ryu had the foreboding thought that eventually she would likely have to sacrifice herself for Bell to survive, and as if to prove her right, episode 7 ended with Ryu noticing that their path was blocked by the Colosseum, the most dangerous place on the entire floor.

Overall, these episodes on their own would still be strong points of one of the prior seasons, but they felt lacking compared to the other parts of the season.  I maintain that they could have cut an episode from this part without losing much.
Episodes 4-7 Rating: 8/10

Part 3 (Episodes 8-11) Ryu and the Juggernaut
And finally we are at the climax.  Episodes 8-11 were the highlight not only of the season but of the entire series to date with episode 9 being not only the best episode of the series but potentially the best episode that JC Staff has ever made, and this is coming from a huge Railgun fan. 

Starting off with the weakest episode of the group, all things considered, episode 8 was kind of disappointing.  It had the potential itself to be the best episode of the series, but JC Staff notably slacked on it.  They filled the Colosseum of infinite monsters with just enough of them to make it look very threatening but by no means the impossible challenge that it should have been.  As a result, Ryu’s sacrifice on the bridge to save Bell, while touching, felt kind of unnecessary while Bell coming back to save Ryu didn’t feel as epic as it otherwise could have.  It was still a strong episode, probably the best of the season at that point, but it was disappointing that it wasn’t even better.

But then we got the absolute banger that was episode 9 which immediately washed away every complaint I had about episode 8.  Episode 8 walked so episode 9 could soar.  Not only was there no OP or ED animation, but there was also an amazing insert song by Hayamin called 'not meet doubt'.  In Episode 9 we finally got the payoff to Ryu’s flashbacks in seeing the tragedy that befell her Familia and boy was it devastating, especially seeing her being forced to kill Alize.  The animation and directing was amazing, and they did a magnificent job showcasing exactly why Ryu was so willing to die this entire season.  Her talk with Bell as he convinced her that she really was worth saving and that he had always viewed her as the hero of justice that she had so desperately strived to be ever since her Familia's demise was incredible.  Equally incredible was the next scene where Bell played dead in an attempt to get an easy kill on a monster after it had blind sided him, triggering Ryu's trauma of how the Juggernaut killed her Familia.  Ryu pleaded passionately with Bell to never do that again even calling him Bell rather than Mr. Cranel for the first time as she realized just how much Bell meant to her.

Episode 10 built on Episode 9's momentum to further expand on Ryu’s newfound feelings for Bell.  There were some fun awkward moments as expected from 2 of the most virtuous people in the series, but Ryu managed to use the excuse of needing to stay warm to initiate an extremely intimate moment where they cuddled half naked by a fire.  Ryu used this situation to finally fill Bell in on her tragic past.  They then slept together like that to gain some much needed stamina back and allow Ryu to finally heal up her broken leg.  But just as they had finally started hoping again, they came face to face with the Juggernaut. After they narrowly escaped from the Juggernaut with injuries, the episode ended with a really touching but tragic moment where Ryu, thinking this was the end for her, threw away all of her ingrained caution and asked Bell to hold her.  Bell lied to her saying he’d stay with her as Ryu fell asleep in his arms as he instead headed off to face down the Juggernaut that had for so long tormented Ryu, vowing to protect her.

And then we got the finale, and in a fantastic reversal of everything we thought we knew about the series, Bell wasn't the star of the final showdown.  It was Ryu.  But before she could get there, Ryu met her Familia in her dream allowing her to get the cathartic confirmation that her Familia members were proud of everything she’d done to honor their legacy over the past 5 years.  It was super emotional and was the boost Ryu needed to finally face down the Juggernaut.  Bell’s role in the battle was to take out the Juggernaut’s magic reflection armor which he did spectacularly through his signature Argo Vesta and Firebolt attacks.  And Ryu’s role was to land the finishing blow.  As she was chanting her spell, Ryu recalled back to the mistakes she made 5 years ago resolute not to make them again.  But despite all of her resolve, her Luminous Wind failed again...or so we momentarily thought before Ryu revealed that she’d strategically held back 10 orbs this time, one for each member of her Familia and initiated her Astrea Familia Charge.  The charge was simultaneously epic and emotional as she used the orbs to boost herself into point blank range of the Juggernaut so that she wouldn't miss this time. We saw the Astral Body Illusions of the respective Astrea Familia Member that Ryu saw each time she called out their names symbolizing their undying support of their dear friend.  Ryu even held hands with Astral Alize before her decisive strike on the Juggernaut.  It was absolutely beautiful.

And with that, the fight was over.  The rescue party heard the sounds from the fight and made it to a fading Bell and Ryu in time.  They had all survived and could go home now.  We got a short epilogue where Ryu was both thanked by Hestia Familia for saving Bell and thanked Bell for saving her, and the season finished with Bell and Ryu going on a date, Bell calling Ryu’s first smile in the entire series beautiful, and Ryu getting embarrassed about it and running off.  At the end, we heard Alize give one final piece of advice to Ryu, to not let Bell get away. 
Episodes 8-11 Rating: 9.7/10

Overall Thoughts
In totality, Season 4 Part 2 was far and away the best season of the series and redefined everything we thought we knew about the previously fun and fan-servicy series.  The characters were awesome, the music was awesome, the animation was on point, the directing was strong and most of all, Ryu was awesome."
114446,"If you stumbled upon this article because you're curious about Higurashi and think you can start from here. This is the place for you. Don't worry. I won't include any spoilers at all. Now let me tell you, this is not a remake, a reboot, a spin-off, or any of that. It's a bonafide sequel. Whoever told you otherwise is a liar and should be ashamed of themselves. When it comes to the haters. Are there what seems to be what you call plotholes, or simply that things don't make sense? What did you expect? If you have watched the prequel and not wandered into Gou just cause, you'd know these things. I want to say I am honestly disappointed in those who dare call themselves fans of the visual novel. Did you even realize that Gou is by far the most consistent Higurashi to date that follows the style of the visual novel to the teeth and Ryukishi's writing? It's answering questions that only true fans are aware of from the prequel, expanding on topics hinted at in Higurashi, all the while establishing a proper connection to Umineko and even the newly WTC (When They Cry) visual novel Ciconia. On top of all that, while building upon the finer details from previous Higurashi. It's giving us a new story that still manages to retain the mysterious and other aspects we love from Higurashi. In other words, if you are a Ryukishi07 enthusiast. It doesn't get any better than this.

I have seen all kinds of nonsensical reasons to justify the hate. If you are talking about production being a hit or miss or other inconsistencies. I get where you're coming from, even if I don't entirely agree, but having seen all of Higurashi, followed by Gou. All this should have at least told you from a writing point of view that Ryukishi's the kind of writer that likes to confuzzle the audience, make them feel utterly lost, give them a reason to use the mind. Hence leave enough evidence and clues to give them a crack at solving the puzzle pieces. The WTC franchise has always been the kind of story where you have to go through the entire story to genuinely appreciate it because it's designed that way. We only got parts of the pages in the book, but many are still missing, though it will be filled by Sotsu when it rolls around 2021 07/07. Bless you, for that reference, Ryukishi07. Higurashi Gou is first and foremost a sequel. In which case, it means we got five seasons of Higurashi (Rei and Sotsu included). I cannot even begin to express my happiness at the thought of that. Ryukishi is known to write his story in a way where each work influences the other, making the experience richer and even savourier. Hence, reading another work from WTC might give you a completely new perception of what Higurashi as a whole is about. 

It might make things even easier to follow or hard, depending on how you take it. Regardless, if you're done with Higurashi, I highly suggest checking out Umineko's visual novel or the manga (not the awful anime adaptation). Another masterpiece by the hands of Ryukishi. It'll definitely clear your mind and give you a completely new comprehension. Let me throw this out there the ""origin of miracles"" and the ""origin of certainty."" If you've read Umineko already, then you should know what I am hinting at here. I won't include direct spoilers as I want everyone the joy of figuring it out for themselves. After all, part of the fun about any entries of WTC (When They Cry) is being able to predict and theorize to your heart's content. Oh, not to mention witnessing how completely off the mark you are when your ideas fall flat as Ryukishi sneers at you. I will admit it was not cool of Ryukishi to introduce Gou as a remake or a reboot. That even the newcomers can watch it. Considering it spoils major chunks of Higurashi in the second episode. In contrast, in the first episode, things are not as clear. Sadly, not everyone knows that Ryukishi is a major troll that lies as naturally as he breathes. But you have to be lying to me if you said nothing felt off by the second episode. It's true Higurashi is meant to give you a sense of feeling lost, things not making sense, but Gou took that to another level. If you watched it without having seen previous installments, you could tell it was clearly not friendly to newcomers even for a bit, suggesting it might've been a sequel, which it happened to be.

There's no denying the new art's more lighthearted than the previous Higurashi, which might ruin the atmospheric tone for some. In my case, I love it. Why? Because it's the most faithful style to the visual novel, we've received yet. I adore the good old art-style from the Deen adaptation, too, but when it comes to expressions and comedy, it hits far stronger with this new style. The characters have never been so expressive without looking all messy and off-modeled, which is a recurring issue in the Deen version. Even voice-acting has been absolutely top-notch and cleaner, as you would expect with upgraded software and hardware. No, the production and direction are not perfect, but would you seriously call it terrible? Not even close. I have nothing but praise for Akio Watanabe's gorgeous and rich art-style and Keiichiro Kawaguchi's strong direction, which never made me wonder if I was watching anything but Higurashi. One specific episode was a genuine masterpiece, from the direction to the voice acting, to the shot composition, to the way the colors were used to emphasize the severity of the situation. Oh, let's not forget about the gore and the sound effects, which make you so uncomfortable that you have to turn away or cover your eyes. It was gruesome, but it also illustrated the unstable mind of a certain someone.

And Most of the few animation inconsistencies here and there can easily be fixed in the BD release. Studio Passione didn't even shy away from gore by giving us an early release of few uncensored episodes. Sadly, haters somehow found a way to insult it even that, failing to notice how good the effects, the tone, and brutality were. Trust me, this was gore without any limitations whatsoever. I was cringing like mad, had to even cover my eyes since it was truly a visceral spectacle. Don't get me wrong here. I loved it, even if it made me hold onto my gut as my life counted on it. Gou also got a manga adaptation that was released at the same time as the anime. It includes more details that anime cut out. The art-style of Tomose Akase is absolutely gorgeous, as is the execution of the tone and paneling. Think of the manga as a supplementary to the anime. It's amazing so far. Chapter comes out on a bi-monthly basis.

Did you know Higurashi has always been more of a mystery than a horror story, but not many seem to not understand that? Sure, the first part clearly had lots of jumpscares and other terrifying moments that made you jump out of your seat. But Higurashi always has been a circle of tragedies with a big dash of mystery to make you feel lost, question things, and so on. The unfamiliarity of Hinamizawa and the things going on there had us under the influence of paranoia. But at the end of the road, we got our answers, and we knew where and how to connect the dots. In Gou's case, it's trying to sell itself even more as a tragedy than horror. That might be why you don't feel as frightened, but you're straight out lying if you said you're not feeling lost either. An example of this is the iconic main theme of Higurashi. The original version has a more scary and paranoid vibe, while the Gou version sounds sad and emanates a feeling of loss and suffering. In other words, tragedy. Hopefully, you see the point I am trying to make here. Gou is a completely new take on our beloved Higurashi without losing key elements of the prequel. On another note, the soundtrack in Higurashi Gou is phenomenal and nails its relevant themes Gou is trying to showcase. We had Asaka on the opening, blessing us with a bopper track. Ayane returned again with more striking and beautiful tunes. Mind you, both songs include heavy symbolism, foreshadowing, context. Even the dialogue is super important. You can tell Ryukishi was there with Passion supporting them and instructing them as clearly, his fingerprints are everywhere.

Yes, I loved Higurashi Gou as if it was not obvious already, plus evidently, I am biased with it, but that's fine. I am not forcing you to take things I am writing her for granted. If I can offer you a new perspective and give you some value, then that's enough for me. I don't like seeing one of my favorite writers being insulted when haters aren't even able to provide logical reasoning to support their rant. So here I will state who Higurashi and WTC franchise as a whole is truly meant for. Are you on the lookout for a puzzle that might seem hazy not make sense at first, but gradually as the pieces get revealed, it falls in places? Do you love the idea of been giving the room to theorize and predict events? Then there you go. It's also worth noting, you need to patient, have your brain on at all times, be open-minded, able to think outside of the box. Higurashi is not meant for your average watcher or reader. What's so good about Higurashi? It's the fact Ryukishi utilizes details from his enormous WTC collection to build upon and expand the story further. Plus, he somehow makes things always connect when it seems impossible and does a wonderful job of explaining it. He writes the works to also gives out a very meaningful and emotional message that is relevant in the current day and even the past. If you are curious about more of those takes, I suggest reading my first Higurashi review, which also includes no spoilers and delves into characters, among other things. Since I mainly wanted this review to show you why Gou was always meant to be a thing, should you watch it and dispel some of the hate it's been received by others.

In any case, Higurashi Gou is my favorite anime of the 2021 Spring season, and with Sotsu right around the corner. This new installment of Higurashi most likely will be my AOTY of 2021. My hats off to Ryukishi-sensei and the entirety staff off Passione. They killed it. If you have not already started Higurashi. I highly recommend it. Whether it be the superior visual novel, solid manga adaptation, or the a-okay but not even close to terrible anime. Sure, it's low-cost, but Deen nailed the atmospheric tone, even if many details from the manga and especially the visual novel got cut out. It's completely worth your time and a good way to dip your toes into WTC verse, even if it's not the best way and definite way to experience Higurashi. I didn't include any spoilers since Gou is so fragile that slipping some can ruin it completely. I want everyone to watch Higurashi and the second part of Higurashi, starting with Gou, ending with Sotsu. As blind as possible, you don't want to ruin this unique gem's once-in-a-lifetime experience. By the subtext, hints, even the writing, it's clear a lot of time and effort went into writing Gou. If you go ahead and reread Higurashi, you could see that it was even planned. 

It should be noted, my score encompasses my enjoyment and the faith I have in Ryukishi when everything is complete, that's why it's already so high. Despite so, I also had moments where I was not entirely on board and failed to understand things in Gou, but in the last two arcs, I was completely absorbed into the story. I should've expected as much since I was lost during the very first Higurashi. Still, I was addicted the deeper I went into it. It tells me on a new rewatch, I will be able to appreciate it far more since now some key things do make sense. We know whodunnit, whydunnit, howdunnit, but clearly, there is a lot more story to tell. We have some of the keys to grasp certain details and comprehend them, even if the puzzle got holes left to fill. That's what makes Ryukishi such a brilliant writer since you know it's all intentional. There are hints of the events of Gou in the prequel even before it was a thing. You'd most likely only realize it first now since your perception will once again increase, alongside your passion for WTC. After all, this franchise is the kind of story that revisiting would be much more rewarding than the first time. Plus, reading other WTC works will again influence your feelings about other products from the WTC franchise. 

At last, I want you to know Higurashi Gou (karma) is playing out like Kai because it answers parts of the questions but leaves the rest for a sequel. You might be confused about what's going on, but this will clearly be answered in Sotsu. All your worries will be laid to rest. The anime adaptation of Kai had two answers arc, so does Gou. But like prequel Higurashi, we might have eight arcs in total. Four of which are questions and the remeaning being the answers. In other words, Sotsu is the answer to all our questions. Plus, it will be the graduation, the ultimate closure to the whole Higurashi franchise. It's been going for over 20+ years, but Ryukishi can finally complete the whole puzzle at last. This is again hinting at Higurashi Gou always being planned.  Don't even get me started on how Gou might be the segue into the events of Ciconia. If my words were able to pique your curiosity even slightly, take this chance to dip your toes in WTC, starting with Higurashi. Welcome to Hinamiazwa."

At the core, adaptations are an incredible concept. Having the ability and opportunity to breathe new life into a story by giving it a fresh and distinctive coat of paint is nothing to scoff at, and time and time again, we are reminded how these creations can elevate both the source material and the narrative itself, especially since audiovisual formats tend to attract a broader audience due to their sheer accessibility.

Given all of this, it is no wonder that countless creative teams have rolled up their sleeves and had a crack at bringing [Junji Ito](https://anilist.co/staff/97410/Junji-Itou)'s manga to the small screen, hoping to marry his haunting imagery with equally effective animation and sound design. Yet, despite their sky-high hopes and ambitions, these ill-fated projects have all crashed and burnt in spectacular fashion, and the 2024 adaptation of Uzumaki is no exception. To be perfectly blunt, this might just be one of the most disrespectful, disgusting and downright disheartening adaptations I have ever had the misfortune of seeing.



Before I get to the meat and potatoes—or rather, address the elephant in the room—there is something I need to make crystal clear. I am in no position to ponder, speculate or fill anyone in on what exactly happened behind the scenes or why the final outcome turned out to be so repulsively lacklustre. Frankly, even if I had the full lowdown on the whole predicament, it would not excuse or justify the atrocious quality of the production one bit. While I have the utmost respect and adoration for every animator who pours their heart and soul into their work, in the end, what really counts is the finished product, and, oh boy, what a terrifying sight it is.

To call Uzumaki's production values a laughable mess would be an understatement of the century, as this multi-year endeavour feels more like something cobbled together on a shoestring budget, rather than the aftermath of numerous months of hard work spent on tirelessly bringing Ito's poster child to life. However, I am getting way ahead of myself, so we need to rewind and take a closer look, step by step.

Before the series spirals into the meme-worthy fiasco that it is, for a solid 25% (meaning the first episode) of its run, Uzumaki actually looks like it has some real potential, at least from a purely visual standpoint. While I personally would have preferred to see the manga's impeccable, memorable surroundings and body horror rendered in grim, cold, and otherwordly colours—a palette like this would have allowed the twisted narrative to truly get its claws into you and send a shiver down your spine in a unique manner—the anime seems adamant about staying true to the manga's black-and-white aesthetic, almost frantically and passionately following the source material's style and vibe down to the smallest detail where not even a single pebble is allowed to be out of place. In a sense, the adaptation's mission might have been a one-to-one recreation, which, while not the best way to ""translate"" stories between media, shows a genuine fondness for the original. The first episode's art style is on point to a surprising degree, adequately reproducing the locations, character designs and overall atmosphere. What is more, the liberal use of rotoscoping throughout the episode adds a lot of flair and stylishness to an already impressive-looking premiere.

Nevertheless, that is precisely where my praise comes to a screeching halt and hits a brick wall. The remaining 75% of Uzumaki is nothing short of embarrassing, and the way it violates your eyes with its hideousness should be studied for years to come. From episode two onward, the quality takes a nosedive, and it is downright ridiculous how many animation and drawing errors made it through. I will not supply you with actual examples of those things appearing on the screen—you can easily find them online if you are morbidly curious—but imagine something very much akin to [Berserk 2016](https://anilist.co/anime/21560/Berserk/) in terms of visual clarity, and you will have a good idea of what you are in for. Episodes three and four may not be as utterly irredeemable as the infamous second one, yet their quality is still woefully horrendous across the board:

- The art style goes from vibrant to watered-down, lifeless and merely ugly, which is surprising considering how promising it seemed at first. 
- The once impressive animation becomes laughably rigid and primitive, making many scenes look like something straight out of an old-school, low-quality video game. 
- The lighting is atrocious, adding insult to injury by making the already hard-to-look-at stills and scenes that much more unbearable. 
- The chaotic editing has no sense of timing or interconnectedness, as it glues every sequence with little to no care for fluidity or cohesion. 
- The camerawork seems oddly comedic, thus completely undermining the eerie feel the manga is known for. 
- The goofy sound effects wholly ruin the atmosphere beyond repair. 
- The voice acting is sufficient but nothing to write home about.There are many, many more inadequacies and shortcomings within the audiovisuals department, each one chipping away at both the core essence of the original and the show's ability to stand on its own two feet. The only shining light in this otherwise dark tunnel is the soundtrack by [Colin Stetson](https://anilist.co/staff/144471/Colin-Stetson). It is an absolute banger that deserves all the praise and love it gets, but sadly, it cannot singlehandedly save the rest of the production from falling apart.

And yet, even these depressing issues and flaws are nothing in comparison to the treatment the narrative received.



Let me get this off my chest first—[Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/manga/30436/Uzumaki/) is not a well-written manga. Even though the atmosphere and horror elements are phenomenal, the story and the characters become progressively more lukewarm and shallow as the chapters progress. Yes, the plot itself has its moments and some of the mini-arcs peppered throughout the earlier chapters can pack a punch, but, ultimately, it is the visuals that do all the talking and heavy lifting. So, does the anime manage to smooth out these rough edges with clever techniques and creative ideas? Not in the slightest. In fact, it completely shits all over every single cool and unique plot point in the most banal, brutish, and brainless way possible. 

The root of the problem lies in what might just be the worst pacing I have ever witnessed, which somehow makes the oftentimes goofy and unintentionally unserious events and happenings of the manga look infinitely worse. For those not in the know, Uzumaki is essentially a collection of chapter-long stories that form one, somewhat understandable storyline. The order in which they appear is by no means random—they follow the chronology of events, each one revolving around a specific object of horror that is inevitably connected to the spiral motif. The climax of these short tales is always the protagonists' confrontation with some grotesque monstrosity, which leads to the pièce de résistance of the entire manga: the twisted, nightmarish reveal of said entity's contorted, inhuman appearance. While the manga does tread at a rather hasty pace that can deter some people from liking it, it still retains some of its inherent charm. Sadly, the anime does not follow suit.

You see, the anime throws caution to the wind and decides to experiment. Thus, it comes to the insane conclusion that mixing and intertwining the stories so that they create one continuous string of events happening simultaneously is a wise idea. As you can imagine, this bold move backfires spectacularly. Picture a [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) playlist where every single song is from a different genre, in a different language, and plays at varying volumes; or those cartoon cooking pots filled with every random ingredient the characters could get their hands on; or a joke with no setup, where the punchline falls on deaf ears—that is what watching this anime feels like. By getting rid of the stories' independence, the show robs them of their proper setups and makes them feel incoherent. How can the horrifying, iconic imagery be considered striking when the build-up that is supposed to lead to them is flat-out non-existent? How can the stories be considered logical or impactful when their chronology is all over the place? How can the sincerely frightening content affect the viewer in any way, shape or form when they are presented in such a nonsensical, haphazard fashion? This is, in my eyes, the anime's gravest sin, as it turned something painfully lukewarm into something absolutely unwatchable.



So, is there something to enjoy here? The answer is a resounding no. Sure, the first episode may be pleasing to look at, but all the issues mentioned above utterly sucked the enjoyment out of the experience. Now, throw in the absolute abomination that is the second episode and the half-baked, low-effort slop that makes up the rest, and it is no surprise I found myself bored to bloody tears while watching. In other words, there is zero reason to waste your time on this steaming pile of excrement. If you are genuinely itching to check out Ito's most iconic scenes and imagery, do yourself a favour and pick up the manga instead. It might not be that compelling of a read, but the atmosphere and the art style make it worthwhile.

All in all, the meme about the Junji Ito manga adaptations being horrible is still alive and kicking, and Uzumaki might have permanently killed my interest in any future ""passion projects"" that aim to convert the horrifying manga panels into a TV series. We waited years for this to come out, and the payoff for all that waiting and anticipation is a product that not only should have been baked for a little longer but honestly should have stayed in the oven until it was charred beyond recognition.

Twist, turn and spiral down—this is easily the worst advertisement the manga could have asked for, and I am well and truly sick of thinking about it.

11785,"By the end of Nyaruko Season 1, I have come to the conclusion that this show can easily go on my guilty pleasures list of shows. Nothing in this show was groundbreaking of course or all that really different. After-all it is a parody show that is based on all the stupid and silly harem rom-coms, and the various tropes and character traits that they all use. But for a parody show, it does the one thing it needs to really well. It is incredibly enjoyable to watch; the characters are amazing and fun, the world is kinda unique and not boring, and the story is super simple. I really couldn't ask any more from the show at all. 

So what exactly is this show that I really enjoyed? Basic premise is that various creatures from the Lovecraftian universe actually exist and are various races from space. And they have all come down to Earth for the vague premise of protecting it from other Lovecraftian races, though their real reason to come down to Earth is the desire to play video games and enjoy Earth's culture. Which apparently is among the best in the universe. Through some events Mahiro gets involved with these races, and essentially opens his home and becomes the host for these various races who decide to show up and enjoy life.

Of course now that we have a much of people in one house, the next step is to of course introduce the romance and harem. After-all why do you put all these people in one place surrounding some male character if it doesn't become a harem. This leads to the character developments that the show has, and does surprisingly well. I wasn't expecting to see actual character development and a romance actually start to form over the course of the season at all, mainly occurring between our main characters of Mahiro and Nyaruko. What starts off as a pretty rough relationship of just kinda getting along, and Mahiro just kinda casually dealing with Nyaruko and not really caring all that much about her. Becomes something that you can see could easily develop into something more, maybe an actually romance, in the second season. The feelings are there for both the characters, it is just a matter of if this silly parody wants to go in that route. Alongside this romance is the more general character and friendship stories between the rest of the cast, which follows the traditional harem tropes and slowly grows over the course of the season. I'm also glad to say it isn't going in a normal harem route, where the MC tries to date and falls in love with everyone.

Honestly, this show is a bit rough for me to say what I loved about it in the end. I guess I could sum it all up as, a really well done parody show based on the normal harem and rom-com tropes. That I have just thoroughly enjoyed, and look forward to watching the next season of next year."
21096,"I recently re-watched Doukyuusei because I was feeling down, which should tell you already how I feel about the movie. I’m a big BL fan, being bisexual myself and knowing the Yaoi/Shounen Ai genre is abundant. I almost hesitate to say it based on how much BL manga I’ve read that I deeply enjoy, but the BL anime genre is sadly lacking both in quantity and quality. I won’t go into too much detail here as I’m not Japanese and can’t speak for LGBTQ Japanese people, but nearly all BL is pandering cliche tropes for the enjoyment and titillation of straight girls and women. Doukyuusei, while branded as BL and also aimed at straight girls, is a gentle blossoming love story that doesn’t pander but respects each character, their identities, and their relationships.



Told in four parts, Doukyuusei’s plot feels as warm and lazy as the summer days it shows. The two main characters Kusakabe Hikaru and Sajou Rihito are high school classmates, as the title states, who bond over a song they have to sing for class. The first part covers how they meet and start dating. The second part goes into more of Sajou’s insecurities with regards to Kusakabe and his sexuality. However, he’s not angsting about internal homophobia but rather whether Kusakabe takes him and their relationship seriously. (This chapter also includes my least favorite part: the adult teacher who comes onto a young and confused Sajou. He also gets his own spin-off manga, but I still don’t care for him for what I think are obvious reasons!) The last part is about Kusakabe’s band and again Sajou’s insecurities surrounding Kusakabe’s popularity. The fourth and final part focuses more on Kusakabe’s problems in the relationship, as Sajou studies for college entrance exams. [SLIGHT SPOILERS] Kusakabe says the line: “You know, I think no matter how you choose to live, there will be regrets,” but goes on to talk about how he wants to choose Sajou. Generally summing up the movie, this line describes both the pair’s anxiety towards their paths while reinforcing their active choice to follow their feelings and strengthen their bond despite an uncertain future. [END SPOILERS]

This is a very brief summary of the events though, and each chapter has its own vibe while also contributing to the overall feeling of the couple’s new relationship. Doukyuusei excels in exploring both the feeling of first love as a teen (“The fizzling soda.”) and the anxiety of entering the “adult world.”



Nakamura Asumiko was a common name to me from her BL manga, as she has a very unique and fluid style. When I heard Doukyuusei was going to be made into a movie, I was worried about that transition from manga to anime. However, A-1 Pictures nailed it and I didn’t really need to worry at all. I know very little on the subject of animation actually, but both capturing Nakamura’s fluid style and the watercolor backgrounds in nearly every scene not only impressed but helped develop the peaceful feeling of the story. Further still on a technical note, the soundtrack was soft with relaxing or dramatic riffs as needed. And as an additional bonus, the now disbanded popular indie rock band Galileo Galilei performed the ending theme.

The only flaws I can see—biased as I obviously am—are slow pacing, long introspective narration, and some manga-esque scenes that couldn’t be translated any other way. I believe these are matters of taste but can make a movie challenging to watch if you aren’t into the leisurely tone. For me, Kusakabe’s loud personality and dramatics (thanks to the spectacular Kamiya Hiroshi as always) more than make up for any pacing I found disjointed or slow.

In more than one way, Doukyuusei is a breath of fresh air. This slice of life BL takes a simple feeling and setting and shapes them into a moving and enjoyable movie that values and respects its gay characters and their relationship. I also recommend the manga, there are more volumes and one shots after the events of the movie that do the trick as well.

20972,"Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is very highly rated by almost everyone who’s watched it, so I can’t really call it underrated, but it’s certainly extremely underwatched. 

When Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu originally came out, it got swept under the radar by hugely popular shows like Konosuba and Erased. It starts a bit slow, taking time to develop characters in a way that makes their growth meaningful, and doesn’t truly show its greatest strengths until our third main character shows up around episode four. That, paired with its unique way of storytelling and focus on a niche part of Japanese culture, may make it feel like something too weird to watch, which is super unfortunate. It’s one of my favorite shows of all time, and one of the shows I’d place near the top of my list for any friends interested in trying out anime (although that goes for anyone searching for recommendations, regardless of how many shows they’ve seen). Although unusual for the modern anime scene, a lack of conventional anime tropes and clichés allow Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu’s story to soar, free from a desire to appeal to fans and sell merchandise – it’s a show that exists to tell a beautiful story with perfectly flawed characters, and it certainly does.

“Rakugo” is a Japanese storytelling art, essentially the art of creating a “one man show” and acting out an entire story by oneself. The stories are generally Japanese folk tales, so there might be punchlines and themes that don’t translate the best culturally or linguistically (many attempts at subtitling puns fall woefully flat) but everyone enjoys Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu’s rakugo to varying extents. 

Rakugo is one of the greatest strengths of the show, tying characters and plot points together and holding a huge amount of emotion and significance, but it’s also one of its greatest pitfalls early on. Take season one, episode one, for example – not only is it a double episode (and essentially a prologue for season one at that), it’s a double episode with a large amount of time dedicated to rakugo. Without the emotional weight rakugo earns later in the series, anyone who isn’t the biggest fan of the art may be easily bored (and I’ll admit, the rakugo displayed in the first episode is some of my least favorite in the series). However, that doesn’t change the fact that the rakugo is phenomenal overall. I can’t fathom the amount of skill it took for the voice actors to convey it so perfectly; it’s as if they’re masters of rakugo themselves (in fact, some of them actually are). Besides that, Studio DEEN does a fantastic job playing with imagery and dynamic camera angles to keep later performances visually engaging and captivating.

As the show progresses, you realize that rakugo isn’t the primary focus of the show at all – it’s the complex, realistic, and flawed characters and their relationships. Rakugo begins to symbolize the lives of the characters that make the show grow ever more enthralling. No matter whether you originally watched Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu for the superb rakugo or not, the main draw makes a clear shift to the pure storytelling in the show. The depth of the characters is steeped in spoilers, however, so I can’t quite attempt to convince you on that.
>“All the good, all the bad… your rakugo has given me every emotion imaginable.”

It’s honestly difficult to describe Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu in a way that truly does it justice. The OST, the animation, the meticulous detail – everything about the show culminates into a masterpiece of writing that keeps me hooked every time I rewatch it. Watching hours of video essays and reading hundreds of reviews and reddit threads only cemented my adoration for the show’s narrative, convincing me to rewatch it multiple times in an attempt to gain the full picture. The subtleties in storytelling and incredibly human characters never fail to astound me, and the amount of analysis done on the show proves how deep the character relationships are. They’re perfectly imperfect and multifaceted to the point of allowing a breadth of interpretations of their motivations, and season two does a fantastic job building upon the characters from season one.

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is one of the most rewarding anime I’ve ever watched, with an unparalleled storytelling journey and wonderfully cathartic ending. It’s a genuine story of the past and the present with hope for the future. Every time I rewatch SGRS, it feels like I’m watching a film packed with detail that I can’t look away from. I cannot stress how much I believe that every person who watches the series to its conclusion, with full attention, will walk away from it positively. No other anime has made me want to rerate every single show I’ve ever watched. It’s the first thing I’d show to anyone who said anime is just for kids, and remains one of the most profound and moving experiences I’ve ever had watching one. 

From the start, the title tells you some key parts of the narrative: it roughly translates into “Flourishing mid-Shouwa period rakugo lover’s suicide” representing the setting, the device binding the characters together, and the end of season one. It doesn’t tell you about the character drama, realistic flaws, and mature themes in the show, but I hope I was able to convince you at least a little bit on that front in this review.

\ \ \

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu delivers an unmatched, layered narrative experience that few other anime I’ve watched have even come close to reaching. It might not be your thing if you need waifus and action, but if you’re looking for a fantastic story and can dedicate yourself to watching it all the way through, I couldn’t imagine recommending anything else."
98762,"!They played a really dangerous game with this one.  The idea of ""growing out"" of chuunibyou is something which has the power to completely fuck up everything that the series up until that point had stood for, something that if you've made it this far in the series, you're likely attached to.  Chuunibyou stands out precisely because it takes a hardline stance on becoming serious, down-to-earth, and growing up: it rejects the necessity of them.

Despite the dangerous territory, this movie takes the step and decides to tackle the questions of ""growing up"" head-on.  Does love and long-term commitment require one to grow up?  Are you still the same person?  Will the people around you still love you?  Needless to say, this had me on edge.  I loved it the whole ride through, but there was a growing weight on me as I worried: would they fuck it up?  Luckily, they don't at all, and it feels like a natural extension of the series.  There was never any doubt that Yuuta and Rikka would be in love no matter how she turned out, but for a while it honestly looked like the movie would hold the position that being in a long term relationship means Rikka will have to ""grow up,"" or at least that she'd be better off that way.  Luckily, it instead says that it's okay to grow out of your chuunibyou...or it's okay to stay like that forever if you feel like it.

This all wraps up and defeats one impression that I never got, but that I can see one taking away from the series beforehand: That having chuunibyou and acting like a child is better than how others think and act, and that everyone else is just stuffy and not embracing their true selves.  This film makes it exceedingly clear that the characters with chuunibyou, without it, and those stuck in-between are all right to act as they feel like.  It's okay to change, and it's certain that you will in some form, and that's okay.  In the context of a story also strictly about how it's okay not to change, that's a beautiful message.  It's probably a bit of an unnecessary point to make, but to take the risk to go there in a movie that's otherwise a celebratory crowd-pleaser for fans is a move deserving of respect.

While I prefer the purer approach of the second season, which focuses almost entirely on the beauty of embracing your chuunibyou, something that's a lot more of a pressing issue (after all, no one in real life is expecting you to keep acting like you did in middle school!), this is a worthy followup and I appreciated the opportunity to sit with these characters again.  The humor's on point, and it's an adorable heart-swelling ride the whole way through.

It's a joy, really.!"
481,"Ever since Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series by LittleKuriboh came out, it seems like every semi-popular anime has to get an abridged series eventually. Unfortunately, I think Dragon Ball Z Abridged laid out a really cringe, loud, unfunny, tryhard humor style template that basically every abridged series since has followed.

I will always maintain that LittleKuriboh’s wit and dry British humor is the whole reason abridged series even work. Making fun of the silly stuff that happens in the show he’s abridging works because the actual show is hard to watch—especially these days.

In theory, this Yu-Gi-Oh! anime is supposed to advertise the cards so Konami can jip people out of their money while hopefully having good characters and a solid story.

Well… they did succeed in making the cards look cool when they’re on the field. There’s a reason that, despite all the meta changes, people always find a way to casually play Dark Magician or Blue-Eyes White Dragon decks, and they continue to get a ton of support from Konami in both the trading card game and the anime.

For better or worse, Yu-Gi-Oh! is a kids’ show that gets surprisingly dark at times. People who grew up with the 4Kids English dub will make fun of things like the Shadow Realm, especially because of the abridged series, but anybody with a brain knows this whole story is literally about people willing to kill others through Egyptian artifacts and a card game. That just creates a hilarious secondary layer of ironic entertainment, after the cool trading card monsters of course.

As the abridged series has consistently pointed out, there’s a lot of cheesy power-of-friendship stuff, which isn’t unexpected from a shounen. But in the original show, some of it does kind of hit emotionally, since there are a few cases of actual interesting character development—mostly related to Joey/Jonouchi and Mai.

Unfortunately, this Yu-Gi-Oh! series fumbles in a lot of important ways, which makes it hard for me to recommend in its original form, whether that’s the Japanese version or the English dub.

Since the anime was meant to sell the trading card game, you’d think it would actually follow the rules—but instead, the characters constantly do things that you can’t do in the real game.

The first arc, Duelist Kingdom, is the worst about this. It had some weird beta version of the rules where you could just summon any monster at any time, you apparently couldn’t attack life points directly, and the characters just randomly making up monster rules on the spot. It created a lot of hilarious scenarios, but none that reflect what you can actually do in the trading card game.

The second arc, Battle City, finally lets the series use a sort of version of the official rules, but even then, some abilities are way more overpowered in the show—like everything related to the Egyptian Gods and the Seal of Orichalcos. But given this was before broken mechanics like Synchros existed, the way characters got powerful monsters on the field was just way too convenient. So many characters also just used straight-up bad cards that it’s really hard to watch.

While I mentioned that a few characters like Joey and Mai get decent development, the vast majority of the cast just isn’t that interesting. Yugi/Yami Yugi is your typical overpowered shounen protagonist, Téa/Anzu and Honda/Tristan are literally just boring cheerleaders, and Kaiba and Yami Bakura are funny mostly because they’re cheesy over-the-top antagonists. Everyone else is either forgettable or annoying when you strip away their Abridged personalities.

The show is over 200 episodes, which is rare. Only a few long-running series stay consistently entertaining—stuff like DBZ and One Piece.

Meanwhile, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Season 1 is not consistently entertaining. Sure, there are some hype duels, usually in the climatic ones in each major arc, but so many side duels are either pointless or focus on antagonists or side characters no one cares about. Plus, there’s way too much filler slice-of-life episodes, weird side plots, or even entire filler arcs (Noah Kaiba’s arc was especially egregious since it literally interrupted the Battle City finals, one of the few consistently good arcs in the series).

I’m all for series not taking themselves too seriously, but Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Season 1 constantly mixes serious psychological character development with cheesy friendship speeches and crazy magic… all for a trading card game. It’s really hard to take seriously, especially with how ridiculously slow-paced some episodes and arcs are.

LittleKuriboh’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Abridged didn’t help, but these days, it’s hard to unironically enjoy the original show. It’s so slow, has too many boring characters, and the novelty of recognizing certain cards and cool attacks only goes so far.

At best, this is a series for hardcore Yu-Gi-Oh! fans only. Casuals would probably have a better time with later Yu-Gi-Oh! series that actually follow the game’s rules and have faster-paced, more interesting stories.

If you just want to see how ridiculous the plot and characters get, just watch LittleKuriboh’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Abridged on YouTube. He somehow still hasn’t finished it as of 2025, and at this rate, he probably won’t finish the entire series until the 2030s. But it’s a much quicker and much more entertaining way to enjoy the trading card game monsters aspect of this show."

At first glance, The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague might seem similar to a known romcom anime: Wotakoi.
Is this true?
Only in some ways.
Like Wotakoi, we have a colorful main cast of four, with one couple taking center stage and the second couple getting not that much some attention. And we also have another couple more towards the back. And of course, it takes place in an office setting in Japan.
The similarities pretty much end there.
Were you expecting something like Wotakoi, where the couples get together early on?
If you were, well…
This show is absolutely not like that.
You were warned!
Himuro is the descendant of a yuki-onna yokai, aka snow woman. Somehow, this is why he makes winter weather – snow, ice, blizzards, you name it, he makes it –whenever he feels strong emotions. This guy literally freezes up when he’s nervous and makes snowmen when he’s happy.
Anyone can tell how he’s feeling with a glance.
Then we have the polar opposite of him: Fuyutsuki. (who is human btw)
She’s pretty, but her face is expressionless most of the time. She was called cold and stoic for most of her life.
You can’t tell what she’s feeling without practice, and even then it’s a bit hard.
They say opposites attract, don’t they?
And this couple is no exception.
There is no linear plot, mostly we just see the work and daily lives of the characters as they blush and get to know each other. 
In case this wasn’t hinted at enough already, 
! This is a situationship show and the couple never actually confesses or becomes official. Just blush blush, and acting obviously way more than just colleagues. It’s absolutely frustrating ! 

Now that you have a general idea of what to expect, I can move on to the next topic.  


So, what is the first thing worth mentioning, hm…

The art style/animation is of decent quality, that much I can say. A show that’s worth its appearances. It’s not stunning or anything, don’t get me wrong, it is just an office romcom after all. It’s worth noticing if you pay attention to those kinds of details though. 
What do I mainly notice about it? The eye movements, that’s what made it more unique and gave the art style/animation more than a single sentence. It doesn’t have a huge impact, but I haven’t really seen any shows that pay attention to little eye movements. 
I think it was mostly because Fuyutsuki needed a way to express her feelings to the audience without stating them outright or using a thought voice-over. Or even just to amplify the effect, since she’s known to be expressionless after all. 
Even so, it’s a nice little Easter egg detail. Points added. 


I like how they mixed the supernatural and office work together. It's one of those contrasts that mix well: the normal and mundane, and the strange and uncommon. 
I honestly wasn't expecting that when I heard the word ""ice guy"", since I didn't really look at it too hard when I started. This overall idea is just nice. Points added. 

All the couples' interactions are fun to watch, if I had to name the best one it'd probably be Komori and Saejima. (I like Komori's personality and her literal foxy ness ngl) Himuro and Fuyustuki can be nice too, and even though Komori and Saejima needed more screentime, it wasn't annoying how centered in the spotlight they (Himuro and Fuyustuki) were. As frustrating as it was, the blush blush and ""she's too damn cute!"" was pretty entertaining. Points added. 

Shout out to Himuro's VA, good work Kobayashi Chiaki 

Some other good random details? 

Fuyustuki is pretty, I like her design. Her outfits look great too. It feels realistic, the way she switches them everyday. 

Komori's ears and tail match her quite well

Moving on.... 



The main thing I have to rant about is how they NEVER become official
We have dates, we have hand holding, we have blushing, matching sets.... 
 !BUT NO CONFESSION !
We build up and up over 12 eps...
 But nothing happens. 
A spark is felt, they get close, 
But the couple in the spotlight doesn't actually become a couple
Extremely disappointing and frustrating. 

Not enough attention, imo, is given to Komori and Saejima, even though they deserve it. Otonashi and Katori got enough time for me, but I'd have enjoyed more Komori screentime. 
This can be a common issue in romcoms, unfortunately

Other point deductions are non-existent or come from lack of excitement. I was more eager to watch the Campfire Cooking ep every Tuesday when it aired, and watched this after. 
So yeah, not that excited, although I prioritize this over some other shows this season. 

Let's move to the last section. 


Tricky question. 
Are you looking for a decent to tolerable office romcom? A unique idea of supernatural mixed with mundane? 
Looking to try a situationship anime, or increasing the count for a genre? 
If so, yeah. 
Since bullet points are easier to understand, I'll restate that in simpler terms (and because that's just how I write reviews) 

- decent office romance 
- supernatural stuff, like ayakashi/yokai 
- situationship (this is less about enjoying it and more about tolerating it cough cough) 
- a male lead with an intense crush on female lead 
- blush blush between adults
- zero lewdness, unless ! Hand holding and that overused ""fall on top of the other person"" ! counts


Then go ahead! 
Watch Ice Guy. 
I warned you about the frustration though.

105989,"I was just going to watch an episode, but ended up finishing the series instead. Season 2, when?



Let me tell you: It was a wild ride. Kinda stupid at times, really, but hilariously so. Made me go pffft more times than I can recall! Also a lot of kyaas and a few ehhh--it was an experience! But enough about me already, let's talk about Ao-Chan Can't Study!

A summary of the story: The story follows the high school girl Ao-Chan, who stuggles with childhood trauma from being the daughter of an erotic fiction author who has made her life miserable with his pervy ways. Ashamed of his existence she dedicates all her time to studying so she can get into a good university and move as far away from him as she possibly can. Since all of her time goes to studying she's a loner, having no time for friends, and especially not for boys. Because of her father she distrusts all men, thinking them all perverts and wolves, and so she does her best to avoid them, but all of that changes when the popular boy, Takumi Kijima, confesses that he has a crush on her. Ao-chan makes every effort to reject him, having no time for boys and dating, but fails miserably everytime she looks at Kijima, thinking about all the things she wants him to do to her, while he is trying his hardest to make his true feelings come through to her. It's all very will they, won't they. (And surprisingly sweet and wholesome.)
And so begins our rom-com adventure! (and, as mentioned earlier; it was a wild ride.)

My thoughts: For an ecchi anime I found it to be surprisingly adorable. It had a great cast of supporting characters as well, my favourite being Soichiro Yabe, her fathers editor and a cutie. (Who would have been perfect for a love triangle, but I guess not. Hmpf. Anyway...)
The storyline can be very predictable at times but I found it very enjoyable to watch! And with every episode being just 12 minutes long it's perfect if you're looking to watch something new while not having to dedicate too much time to it. (Which, I think we all can agree can be a nice change at times!) It has a fun cast of characters, and a banger of an opening. It's super catchy. Don't believe me? here, judge for yourself.

youtube(https://youtu.be/IqxqhMclCs8)

Right? right? told you.

Conclusion: would I recommend it? Yes, yes I would. It was a lot of fun! and I liked it enough that I would watch season 2 if it ever were to come out. It probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, but you won't know until you give it a chance, right? (So... Go do that. You won't regret it. Probably?)"

Best girl



 So uh... Finally finished the anime.. WILL DEFINITELY READ THE MANGA because I just want more of this. The bond between Yuiga and the girls IS SO PURE, but I liked Fumino & Sensei the most (but Fumino best girl) 

Okay okay. So this  show is a rom-com harem anime. Really great. It has similar things with Quintuplets but I prefer BOKUBEN's events and interaction between the girls. You'll enjoy the bond between the girls and Yuiga-kun as he find himself on different awkward situations (I feel like ""misunderstandings"" is what make rom-com fun lol) 

I love how the anime ""take turns"" between the girls and together with Yuiga-kun and I think that's a pretty good balance (Fumino best girl) 

Yuiga
! So.. Yuiga is a hardworking student and he's pretty good at teaching people. He's pretty dense and.. FUMINO IS BEST GIRL...He's a pure hearted guy and looooooooooooves his friends. ;-; FUMINOO..! Fumino
! Fumino is best girl and the only girl for Yuiga-kun. She is so fucking pure and her interactions and moments with Yuiga-kun is just fucking amazing. She can be very bashful but SHE HAS THIS PURE SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO YUIGA-KUN (Fumino best girl). She's just a really sweet girl ;-; Wish there were more scenes of her and Yuiga-kun ! Sensei (Mafuyu Kirisu)
! Sensei is mature and hot. I find her interactions with Yuiga-kun in the anime really good. She's a pretty strict person but SHE HOT.. Yuiga-kun carrying her was pretty good I wish there were more scenes of her and Yuiga-kun too! Uruka
! She swims a lot and asks Fumino love advice...for her friend..lol..She's Yuiga-kun's childhood friend and she gets a long with Yuiga-kun until she realized that she likes him lol. She's a pretty bashful girl but she had good scenes alone together with Yuiga-kun.!  Ogata ! Pretty cute girl...pretty sweet with Yuiga-kun though, I don't think she really likes him as boyfriend-girlfriend but she's pretty sweet (idk that's what I saw in the anime lol will read manga..wait no i think she really likes him ) She has some good scenes with Yuiga-kun but overall, she just looks like a kid to me LOL. ! Kominami-senpai
! She's pretty lit ngl. Teases Yuiga-kun a lot, I wouldn't mind them being girlfriend-boyfriend tbh and I think she's a pretty sweet girl (come on, tbh they're all sweet) She's pretty mature too..  !

AAAAAAAA
Overall, I really liked this anime because of Yuiga-kun's interaction between the girls. It's really fun to see them study and good around with Yuiga-kun and I think he's pretty lucky lol. Wish there was more of Fumino and Sensei sweet moments tho

Fumino>Sensei>Kominami>Uruka & Ogata

Would be awesome if there was a season 3, would love to see more of Fumino & Sensei <3
Oh and it's a solid 8/10.

158928,"Decided to go to the local AMC to catch Code White in theaters. And it was really good and did exactly what I wanted from the series for once. Sure I’ve enjoyed the Spy x Family series over time, but despite really enjoying it the whole time I’ve always felt it just wasn’t reaching it’s full potential at all. And honestly I blame how popular it got for that.

Nearly 5 years after this series first started in the manga, we still haven’t made much progress at all in anything. And sure I’ve enjoyed everything along the way, I love the characters and their interactions and the atmosphere of it all. But what happened to the interest concept of this super spy, super assassin, mind reading girl, and future predicting dog living together and being a family. All the interesting and great moments that could have been built with this group, getting involved with crazy missions and events all the time trying to keep their individual secrets. And along the way they would grow closer and become a real family and all that. And yet in nearly 5 years, most of what we have gotten now is Aya slice of life stuff, with an occasional arc for Loid or Yor that just doesn’t feel like it moves things forward at all. In 5 years the relationship between these characters has barely moved, and I just feel disappointment at what could have been with this series. But I feel it exploded in popularity, everyone noticed, and now it needs to go forever so they can sell Aya spin-off games and merch for all time.

But this movie switches things up a whole bunch. And really does exactly what I wanted from the series. It puts the family in a situation in which everyone’s unique abilities get shown off. And are useful and help progress the plot and relationship in the family. Along with finally showing more of the serious side of this world that really should exist, and puts it in the proper context. This is a universe with two powerful enemy countries locked in a cold war, the threats should be big and the possible consequences of failure should feel important.

Now I didn’t love everything about the movie. It has moments that feel very unnecessary, along with a major plot point I just didn’t love. It was an attempt to merge the silly side that the manga/anime have embraced more with a very serious story. And at times that silliness just ruins a moment that should have been powerful and emotional, just to get a laugh out of the audience I feel. In general though, I feel it worked well enough.

I have to also mention the movie looks really good, with the visuals and animation in general just being great. They had some amazing action scenes that are better than anything we have seen in the anime thus far. And you can tell this isn’t just a couple episodes from the show, or an extended OVA, and instead a real movie with a decent budget behind it for making it look really good. And I am glad we are getting more anime movies that seem to have a good budget to look good, even if I wish it released faster.

In the end, I have to recommend the movie if you are a fan of the anime/manga. I think it is worth going to see if you get the chance in theaters to support bringing more anime movies to western theaters. But even if not it is well worth the time, and I think everyone will be satisfied with the story and characters in the movie."

Zetsuboushita!

""Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei"", ou como dito em português, ""Adeus, Professor Desespero"", é a história de um professor do ensino médio, que por conta de uma das formas que o seu nome pode ser escrito, acaba formando a palavra ""desespero"", assim, sendo carinhosamente apelidado pelos seus alunos de ""Professor Desespero"", apelido esse que caiu muito bem já que a todo momento Nozomu Itoshiki, ou melhor, Zetsubou Sensei, está desesperado.
؜

A história que nós observamos durante todas as temporadas do anime é puramente baseada em contexto. Apesar de haver uma progressão, os episódios são basicamente guiados por uma questão abordada no mesmo. Melhor dizendo, a história do anime basicamente gira em torno das situações que os personagens se encontram e em como elas serão resolvidas. O anime não adapta o mangá por completo, então acho válido informar que se você por algum acaso quiser ver a conclusão da obra, os últimos 10 capítulos do mangá cobrem o ""último arco"" e o desfecho da história.

؜ 

Apesar de serem simples, os personagens da obra são bem trabalhados e carismáticos. Cada personagem no anime possui uma característica que definirá o tipo de humor trabalhado nas cenas que eles estão presentes. O elenco é vasto e há personagens de todos os tipos (em sua maioria, personagens femininas). Exemplificando, irei falar sobre o Zetsubou Sensei e a Kafuka Fuura, os dois personagens principais da obra.
- Nozomu Itoshiki


O professor da classe 2-F e personagem principal da obra, como o seu apelido sugere, é um professor que está a todo tempo desesperado por conta das questões que aparecem durante o Anime. Possui sua famosa fala ""Zetsuboushita!"" (Estou em desespero!) e a todo momento entra em mal-entendidos, assim, desenvolvendo as relações com seus alunos e pessoas ao seu redor.

- Kafuka Fuura

Uma garota otimista que vê praticamente tudo pelo seu ""lado bom"". Sendo a primeira a ter contato com o professor, Kafuka leva a vida tentando enxergar o lado bom de todas as coisas e acredita que coisas mais pesadas não podem estar acontecendo na escola em que ela estuda por ser algo que ""apenas se vê na televisão"".

A trilha sonora do anime se encaixa muito bem nas cenas e com o tema do anime. As openings e endings são maravilhosas, em especial para as openings que além de terem um ótimo visual, as músicas são muito boas e viciantes, facilmente entram nas minhas favoritas. Um dos motivos que me fez querer assistir o anime foi justamente o aspecto visual. O visual simples e marcante é bem utilizado, ainda mais com a técnica ""Unmoving Plaid"" (técnica que quando os personagens se movem, a textura de suas roupas se mantém, assim como no desenho ""Chowder"" ou no anime ""Gankutsuou""), dando um charme a mais na obra. O estilo da Shaft de animação e direção agregaram bastante pra obra, e em minha opinião, a escolha de estúdio foi excelente para adaptar uma obra como essa.

O anime todo é bem divertido de se assistir, ainda mais quando o seu conhecimento sobre a cultura japonesa é um pouco mais aprofundado, já que boa parte do humor é feita através de referências a outros animes ou até a própria cultura nipônica. Apesar disso, ainda é possível aproveitar a obra sem pegar boa parte das referências (admito que isso aconteceu comigo algumas vezes).

Zetsuboushita!

""Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei"", or in english, ""Goodbye, Mr. Despair"", is a story about a highschool teacher, and because of a way that his name can be written, the word ""Despair"" is formed, that said, his students starts to call him by the nickname ""Mr. Despair"", nickname that fitted well as Nozomu Itoshiki is always in despair.
؜

The story that follows all seasons of the anime is purely based in context. Besides it having little progression, the episodes are basically guided by a question that appears in the chapter. In other words, the story is oriented in the situation a character is in and how they will solve it. The anime doesn't adapt all of the manga, so it is valid to state that if you want the ending of the story, you should read the last 10 chapters of the manga.


؜ 

Although the characters are simple, they are really well worked and charismatic. Each character has their own characteristic that defines the type of comedy that will be presented in the scene they are on. The cast is big and has characters of every type (in its majority female). Exemplifying, I will talk about Zetsubou Sensei and Kafufa Fuura, the main characters of the show.

- Nozomu Itoshiki
 

The teacher of class 2-F and main character of the show, as his nickname suggests, is a teacher that is always in despair because of the issues that appear throughout the anime. He has his famous speech ""Zetsuboushita!"" (Im in despair!) and all the time is involved in misunderstandings that shape the relationship with his students and people arround him.

- Kafuka Fuura

An optimist girl that sees pretty much everything on its ""good side"". Being the first to make contact with the teacher, Kafuka lives trying to see the good side of everything and believes that heavy themes can't be happening on the same school as she studies because those things ""only happens on TV"".

The anime soundtrack fits well in the scenes and with the main theme. The openings and endings are wonderful, in special the openings that have such nice visuals and the songs are really good and catchy, being some of my favorites. One of the reasons that made me start watching the show was its visual aspect. The simple and remarking visual is really well used, further more with the ""Unmoving Plaid"" technique (technique that when a character moves, the texture of its clothing remain still, like on the cartoon ""Chowder"" or ""Gankutsuou"" anime), giving the show a bit more charm. Shaft's animation and direction style added a lot to the anime, and in my opinion, the studio choice was excellent to adapt this work.

The anime is really fun to watch, adding more to the experience if your knowledge of japanese culture is a little more in-depth, as a great part of the comedy is made through references to other anime or the japanese culture itself. Nevertheless, it is possible to enjoy the show without getting all the references (I admit that this happened to me a few times).

Hey you there, do you like TANKS?
Do you like Cute girls IN TANKS?
Do you like Schools that are inexplicably GIANT WARSHIPS?
Do you like WAR GAMES?
Do you like Government programs that are almost certainly fascist governmental propaganda that's being used to indoctrinate a young female base into being normalized to the prospects of brutal mobile warfare in giant hulking deathboxes?

You do? Hell yeah, me too.

This show is like a gift sent from God, probably not specifically to me, but it certainly hit all the aspects of being exactly my kind of show. As a fan of stupid war shenanigans, anti-fascism, and cute anime girls, I was right in the demographic to be swept away by this anime's wiles.

I love this show. I am EXTREMELY BIASED.

The plot of Girls und Panzer is actually pretty simple. A quick rundown that only has spoilers for the first episode goes like this: Miho has transferred to a new school to avoid her previous schools Tankery Program, only to be roped into Oarai High School’s recently restarted Tankery program against her will. 

What is Tankery, you ask?

I’d love to tell you, young padawan. In the Girls und Panzer Universe™, at some point in the 1920s, a sport developed around playing mock battles with the Giant death boxes that are commonly referred to as Tanks (Assumedly involving the Type 87 Chi-I  and other future Japanese tank models). Why do they ride tanks, why do the use live Ammunition (that’s not a fucking joke it’s mentioned on two ocassions), why do the commercials for Tankery mention it’s a female-associated sport, why does it feel like this is a government propaganda campaign to recruit female child soldiers?

Fuck you, go along with it. Overthinking this anime will drive you insane.

So to elaborate a bit more, Tankery’s operation is pretty simple. You have two types of match, Team Deathmatch and a Pseudo-Capture-the-Flag. In Team Deathmatch, the winner is the team with either the last tank standing, or the team that eliminates all other tanks of the opposing team, depending. In the CTF, A single tank is designated, which when destroyed, loses the team that tanks the game. Most matches in the anime are the CTF kind, which is actually something I’m sad about. The Team Deathmatch format is a lot more interesting to me personally and incentivizes actual battles instead of bullheaded going for a single Target

Tiny Ender’s Game (an Orson Scott Card Book) Spoiler that reminds me of the CTF system
! (in a lot of ways, it reminds me of the flaws with the Battle Game in Ender’s Game, where Ender later exploits the game’s victory scenario for quick victories.)!

Anyhow, back to my quick plot description. Miho is now in the Tankery club, and needs to reshape it to make it competitive for Tankery Nationals. A wide variety of girls join the club for so many different reasons, and Oarai Academy battles it out to be Top Dog in the nation.

One really funny scene in the first episode mentions all the benefits that the girls in the Tankery club get (to incentivise joining).

I can’t help but find it genuinely hilarious that they get such a ridiculous amount of stuff for a course that I would 100% be down to do. Well maybe not being a woman for me personally, but I'm sure that appeals to some people!

Further Plot Developments Past Episode 1, Broadly Spoils Entire Series:

!Eventually we find out that the Tankery Club being reestablished is due to school budgetary issues, which has caused the school to be given a one year closing deadline, unless they can pull through a victory in the Tankery nationals. It’s a neat bit of foreshadowing that the School Council, which is promoting the club, is so desperate to get new Tankery members as to give out all these privileges.!




In this section I will talk about Individual characters I have something to say about, and Tankery Teams that make more sense to talk about as a whole (this will make more sense as I continue talking)


img()

This group are the main characters, and group with the most individual notable characters, composing the entire team


img()

!Miho is a very serviceable protagonist for Girls und Panzer. She’s got a do-gooder personality with relatively strong leadership skills. Her backstory with her Sister and mother are relatively interesting, and provide some good tension for her battles with said sister. She’s generic, to put it bluntly, but I like her enough for there to be nothing that I want to detract from. She’s a bit awkward in public, so it is nice to see her taking charge of situations when forced into a leadership role.!


img()

!It’s not that I dislike Hana. I think she’s a really nice character, but unfortunately she's just kinda… Is boring. She’s the motherly shy figure of the lot, she gets a lot of screen time throughout the anime, even having a plotline involving her mother’s disapproval of her Tankery. Her mother expected her refined daughter to take up flower arrangement and doesn’t approve of Hana’s sport, which she sees as unwomanly (which is weird because it’s established many times that Tankery is seen as a feminine-coded sport).

But this resides in the issue. Hana’s plotline is set up in Episode 4, but unless I missed something massive, nothing ever resolves it! Don’t mistake me saying that for her and her mother not reconciling, they DO reconcile, but it’s apparently offscreen, because we later get a scene where Hana’s (non-club) flower arrangement is praised and her mother walks in, already at peace with the situation. It’s genuinely confusing to me, because we never see Hana and her Mother hash it out. Her mother just relents offscreen. It's baffling! Anyhow, these factors combined make her my least favorite of the main five.!


img()

!Mako is one of the more interesting girls in the Tankery club, she comes in a bit later then the other girls, and has a cute personality of being slightly sleep deprived, having a complex relationship with her Grandmother, and even a Tragic backstory. She also probably has the most notable role in the tanking itself, with her driving skills being extremely necessary for winning many of the battles. I like her overall.!


img()

!Saori is pretty boy-crazy, largely joining up with the Tankery club because she thinks it’ll improve her chances with boys in Orarai city. She’s a social creature, probably the most personable of the main group, very kind, and gives advice to girls when they ask her. She is probably my second or Third favorite character. She doesn’t really have a plotline, unlike the rest of the characters. The closest thing she has to one is her developing an actual interest in Tankery and ultimately becoming a Radio Operator. That was pretty cool.!


img()

!Holy Best Girl Alert
I unironically love Yukari, she’s cute, sweet, (best girl). She’s such a funny character, being an outcast who has an obsession with Tanks, her finding the Tankery program, being able to be in her element in front of everyone, it’s the cutest shit. She is extremely active in the plot, being essential to multiple fights and even doing Recon for the Tankery Team.

She is also coded as being into Miho, which is something I wasn’t expecting. Point is, I love this character, she’s amazing, she’s good enough to be the sole reason I’d watch the anime. The heart of the show, she makes for a really fun time to watch. Best character, easily.!


img()

The people who got the Tankery club together, largely, with a few notable characters. From here on all other Orarai groups are easily consolidated into one block of people. Also only two characters from here where notable enough.


img()

!The Student Council President, she is the person who gets the Tankery Club together. She's good friends with the rest of the student council, and the school closing is her main motivation to join. She's a generally domineering person, very bossy, but she knows she's lost when it comes to tankery leadership, and leaves that roll to Miho. She's not an amazing character but she's fine enough to note.!


img()

!Momo really shines in later episodes. Initially billed as the stricter member of the Student council, she is initially rather unlikeable, almost filling the role of a pseudo-antagonist (the student council in general feels like the antagonist for the first episode or two), but as the series continues forward, she really shows alot more of her kinder side, especially developing the relationship between her and the rest of the Student council.!


img()

For an anime about tanks, we of course need a group that are obsessed with tanks, history, fascism, the various World War Two nations, and so forth. None of the characters stand out, and to be honest none from group 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 stand out either, they are rather more applicable as a single block of characters, maybe with a unique joke assigned to each of them. Of these six, my personal favorite is the History Buffs. Not exactly because they are good people, I think they have a slightly weird obsession with WW2 Germany in particular that leads to some fridge horror when you realize what they are attempting to say (specifically a reference to Stalingrad), but overall they make so many references that it’s really fun to see them around.


Yeah my stuff to say really dries up past here, I’m not really gonna add pictures cause that’d take alot longer and to be honest, 4-8 are all relatively minor.

!Sudoku come in a little later in the series. For most of the show she serves as a skit character who’s a hall monitor. Sudoku ends up joining the Tankery club with two girls that look similar to her. That’s it.!


This group fixes the tanks, and later also joins the Tankery Club.


The least interesting group other than group 7, they have no real defining traits other than some of them being a little Nerdy.


!Also not a very notable clique, they just come in near the end and don’t do anything particularly interesting.!


img()

Not too notable, they have a running joke where they are sad about their Volleyball club getting closed down, but overall they don’t make a massive impact. They can be funny sometimes.

(Welp, That's all the different groups. Initially I had a section here going over every opposition school, but I cut it to be a more reasonable length.)




Girls und Panzer is not an Infallible anime. It has a lot of smaller and bigger issues, most of which I personally look past, but I can’t write a review in good faith without mentioning them.

First thing’s first, technical issues. While I personally have not watched this anime subbed, I can say without a doubt that the dub for this anime is extremely flawed. I personally like it, it’s got a charm to it that undoubtedly just works for me, but from a purely technical standpoint it can sound downright bad at times.

There’s a few animation errors, and depending on your tolerance for CGI, you may consider that bad. One very funny animation error happens in Episode 8, about a minute and a half in, where a character licks a spoon of jam, which suddenly appears to be spread all over her face. I’m sure if you really scrutinized the anime you could find a number of others.

The other flaws largely stem around plot issues, and shall thus be spoilered:

!There are 3 big plot issues. The easiest to tackle is the Battle with Anzio, which gets awkwardly skipped in Episode 7, which while not inherently bad, does feel very sudden and ultimately leads to it being included as an OVA. It’s just odd due to the episode itself being named after Anzio, so it may feel like a letdown.!

!The next two focus on two plots for specific characters in the anime. Mako and Hana’s plotlines. Mako has issues with her grandmother, Hana has issues with her Mother who doesn’t like her doing tankery. The exact details aren’t super important, but the way it’s resolved in the anime is really weird. Specifically that it just kinda… isn’t? Hana’s mother just accepts her with no scene where they hash things out, and Mako’s grandmother recovers from her sickness. It doesn’t really feel like the plots are being resolved so much as dropped without the time to really develop them to a proper conclusion. It’s genuinely one of the most negative aspects in the show for me and I’m sad they couldn’t get it to work out better, I can only assume it was due to production issues.!




I love this anime, it has so many stupid aspects, cute characters, and funny moments that I really had a blast while watching it.

There are so many different things I love from this show, so I’ll just give a blanket minor spoiler warning for this section as spoilering images doesn’t really work super great.

Each of the Schools the girls face against are full of Larpers. From Anzio’s Italian Larpers, to St. Gloriana’s teaboos with characters literally named after Teas like Darjeeling and Assam. Alot of the best references come through on from this.

Talking of references in this anime, it gets to the degree where the fact that I’m a history nerd massively improved my liking of the anime, like a scene where Katyusha, from the Soviet Larper school, Pravda, drives to the battle site in a Katyusha Rocket Launcher, and then later she and her team sing the Soviet song called Katyusha, which just so happens to be one of my favourite pieces of Soviet music.

img()

Pravda in general is pretty Great, they have a lot of good jokes and the battle site they fight in is easily the most unique of the lot. Katyusha and her friend (Nonna is the black-haired one and Katyusha is the blondie), have a great dynamic and in general makes for a neat Tankery battle.

img()

There’s also just some good plain old visual humor, like the tank-shaped food that’s shown in the fifth episode,

img()

or how Yukari's room is a goofy nerd cave.

img()

And there’s also a few historical references like in a scene where some characters are asked to surrender, the characters respond with “Nuts!”, which was a famous line from Anthony McAuliffe, when he refused to surrender.

There’s alot of other stuff I’d like to put here, but I actually want you to watch the anime, and I also personally just won’t be able to make it much longer without driving myself entirely insane. I love this show, this is my recommendation to watch it, now.




The show has a great atmosphere, I really like it. It’s characters are fun, it goes on about subjects that interest me, I love it.

Watch it, or don’t. I know it’s not for everyone. It’s kinda cringy sometimes, and definitely not the best anime that exists, but it suits my interests perfectly. Thanks for reading my several page long unhinged rant about why the funny Child soldiers tank anime is good. If you notice any errors, wanna compliment or criticize me, or just want to rant, you can @ me any time, friendo!

- Signed Kronos Bach"
97731,"A simple yet touching narrative, gorgeous stylized visuals with interesting designs and ideas, and a beautiful weeb-friendly electronic song to guide you through it all.

NOTE - This review will be basically spoiler filled. I’ll still be vague about the details but you may as well just watch it before reading. It’s like 6 minutes long. It’s worth your time.


The story is simple - it’s about a single character, Rin, her environment, and her memories. And the implications of her future and the shape it will take. 
    It’s told with grace and simplicity by slowly peeling away the layers and revealing bits of information to the audience, all of which build into something profound and heart tugging. This is done largely with visuals - the only dialogue being the introduction of Rin’s present psychological condition and ‘location’ even and then at the end when she resolves the conflicts she introduced in the beginning, by reconciling with her past, present, and future. Taking on a new and better mindset. That’s the story. There’s some ‘lore’ that fills out the space between and it gives weight to Rin’s conflict and situation, strengthening the empathetic bond between her and the audience. Even had the music not been a part of it, it still would have made me cry. Those suffering from mental illness may find it especially impactful - they may find it allegorically relevant to themselves, which, as a work of art, is everything it could ever hope to be for someone. 

Tonally (and this is crafted through the visuals, the writing, and the sound design/editing) it’s largely warm and hopeful, but as it progresses and reveals more it shows the darkness that Rin lives with. The audience follows right along side her as she remembers it and eventually confronts it. The sound design and editing in particular add so much to portraying the tone and narrative. Two points in particular, the ending and the beginning, when the music is introduced and stopped. It begins in silence, followed by a melancholic monologue by Rin. She exhales. Her eyes are low. She’s been ‘here’ in this place physically but also mentally for a painfully long time. Another moment of silence and stillness on the screen. And then the first note of the music breaks it, bringing hope and light to the audience as the visuals bring hope and light to Rin - she begins creating, dreaming, exploring. And then the ending, when the music stops and Rin’s real physical body is revealed for the first time - we see her hunched over with mechanical wires and mechanisms protruding all along her back. She seems lifeless. We then zoom out to see the small, lonely spacecraft she resides in, drifting completely alone through space. We hear what sounds like a faint breeze or a distant fading echo. Everything on the screen and in our ears is dark and hopeless, and then everything becomes black and silent, and we hear one last thing - “Arigato”. Rin expressing gratitude. 

The saddest thing we learn about Rin is that she’s lived her entire adolescence in her mind. Her father placed her in the ship and the computerized reality when she was a child. And she only realizes this when she stumbles upon those memories by accident. But the story concludes with a hopeful open end - the possibility that her craft is directed to some specific location - that her father didn’t just send her to escape the destruction of her own world but to find oasis in a new one. 

Visually Shelter is outstanding. It’s A1 Pictures at their best - crafting a unique and memorable style, giving lots of motion and life to the characters and the world, putting lots of thought into framing and editing. Rin’s character designs both in the present and as a child are adorable. The nature of the story means there are a lot of abstract sequences and locations that are all fascinating and eye catching. The colors themselves are mesmerizing.

Now, the actual song ‘Shelter’ composed by Porter Robinson and Madeon which plays for the majority of the anime. It fits with the visuals and the story, whether you enjoy it or not. It’s certainly well crafted, with a tremendous amount of polish for every note and sound. And it plays such a pivotal role in the artwork as a whole that were it not fitting for the animation and story, then the video wouldn’t have been as successful as it was.

If you don’t know anything about the making of this anime or how it came to be, I recommend watching Crunchyroll’s behind the scenes video of it on youtube. It’s pretty fascinating. It’s one of the very few times that someone from the West has been involved with the writing and production of an anime. Just so everyone is clear, Porter Robinson wrote the script himself and seems to have played a prominent role in the production. Which is just insane.

Shelter is a simple, small anime, with a bold and powerful voice. The hardest part of this review was trying not to just gush over how much I love this anime. It means so much to me. It was one of the first anime that I ever saw. It helped me reconcile with my own mental health troubles. It was pivotal in sparking my interest in anime and my reconnection with my younger self. And it’s just beautiful."
5,"Neither Cowboy Bebop nor this movie need any introduction, you know what this series is and how much it's praised by a lot of people; I am part of that crowd who absolutely adores it, so there's a spoiler for how this review is gonna go. Many anime movies tend to be just extended episodes, usually a similar formula to one off episodes and extending it to fill a movie runtime, rarely adding too much into the mix. Knockin' On Heaven's Door is one of these type of movies, but I believe there's more going on here than it simply being ""more Cowboy Bebop"".

To begin with, the animation is absolutely stellar, every scene is incredibly well made and every movement feels natural. This bleeds into one of the best parts about Cowboy Bebop, and that's the setting; the few montages we have of the gang investigating this bounty showcase the world of Cowboy Bebop perfectly. It's a drab and gritty world, where people are all just trying to get by, people's stories are all being told as we're watching and they're not going to wait for our main cast to catch up. This level of quality is maintained all the way up to the final fight scene which is arguably one of, if not the best hand-to-hand fight scene in anime history.

Another high point of praise (of many) I have is that pacing of this movie is close to being absolutely perfect; it's brisk but it isn't too fast to the point where it feels like it's skipping over details, everything is laid out but nothing outstays its welcome. Well, that's aside from the climax going on for a little too long, particularly the battle with the aircraft, but that's really the only complaint I have with this movie. Quite literally every other scene besides is perfectly paced from start to finish. This, combined with the beautiful animation, gives this movie and incredible sense of ""flow"". You really have to just watch it for yourself in order to understand what I mean.

Now let's get into the main meat of this movie: the story, and it's damn good. We begin when the status quo is still being maintained, Faye and Ed are in the Bebop and the gang are still struggling to afford food, when on one day, a man named Vincent blows up a tanker on a highway, with his accomplice, Lee, which leads the gang to discover he has a massive bounty on his head. The rest of the movie follows the Bebop crew investigating Vincent and trying to stop his master plan.

We have 2 new big players to talk about with this movie, the first being the aforementioned Vincent. He was once a soldier in an unnamed war on Titan, who was experimented on with a nanomachine virus that infects the blood of people and kills them by destroying their brains, Vincent was the only one with the vaccine. Abandoned by his government, he returns to the world wishing to release the virus unto it because of the vaccine turning him insane. He's a very mysterious and melancholic man, stripped of all his memories, his motivations for doing what he does are unclear, perhaps out of some twisted sense of duty, but in his mystique, he can be seen as a mirror to Spike, with how he uses guns and martial arts, alongside the similar hair, the connection to a woman in their past and similar clothing to that of Spike's when he worked for the Syndicate. Similarly to the other ""cowboys"" present in the series, Vincent also reflects a part of Spike's character; whereas Vicious was the embodiment of his dark past and Andy a parody of his cowboy persona, Vincent shares his apathy. Both men can be neglectful at times, but both also cared deeply about the woman they loved.

Electra is that woman to Vincent, she was a soldier whom he gave the nanomachine vaccine to and fell in love with, but stopped their relationship because of Vincent's lost memory. Her personality isn't very deep and she mostly serves as a plot device but her relationship to Vincent and the whole story cannot be overlooked. Understandably, like how Vincent is a reflection of a facet of Spike's character, Electra has many similarities to Julia, with how she was forced away from her partner and were both motivated to kill that person by an outside source. I mention all of this because it leads to probably my favourite scene in the movie, where Spike and Electra are held up in cells and have nothing to do but talk to each other, and Spike opens up to her. It's never entirely explained why he does this, but I chalk it up to her few similarities to Julia. 

Nevertheless, this is one of the few times in the whole series where we get an insight into Spike's character, where he explains that he had never really feared anything before he met Julia, and when he was in her company, he felt afraid to die. This does so much for Spike's character because it says so much about his actions throughout the main series, he realises that his time with Julia is what truly mattered in the world, but he couldn't put the past behind him and this, similarly, is what Vincent goes through in his final moments, when he remembers Electra and his love for her, and they both die, trying to get over their past (or lack thereof). 

An interesting angle to view this movie in is that this could be a long dream that Spike has as he's dying in the main series, I don't think it's entirely likely that's exactly what's happening, but throughout this whole movie there's a strange ""dream-like"" vibe to it, with a lot more imagery of spiritual/fantastical elements, such as zombies and vampires, as well as a native-American shaman being featured at one point when Spike had seemingly died. It makes sense considering the context this movie was released in, as this was released years after Cowboy Bebop had ended. This is the ""encore"", all the main characters are still here and they haven't completely met their depressing ends yet.

While that interpretation is debatable, this movie does still reflect the series' most prominent themes, being ""death"" and ""vulnerability"". Vincent, similarly to many of the other one-off characters in the series, has a vulnerability to him, being his relationship to Electra and as the main series showed frequently, having that vulnerability is not a good thing, it will get you hurt and it ends up getting Vincent killed, we can see this in a lot of side characters in the series, such as Katerina from the first episode and her longing for a better life on Mars or Grencia from the Jupiter Blues arc and how he was used as a test subject. Death is obviously present here, with a few characters dying, Vincent's apocalyptic plan, I mean, it takes place on Halloween for crying out loud.

This movie is a microcosm for the entire series, which is why I consider it to be the perfect companion piece, as it has all of the characters, themes and ideas of the main show, wrapped into one fun, nearly 2 hour long romp; and that's one of the best parts of this movie, it's just an incredibly fun watch. With the mysteries being unraveled throughout the story at an incredible pace and culminating in a climactic and melancholic finale. This movie cements Cowboy Bebop as one of my all time favourite series in anime, and I hope you found similar enjoyment in it too."

There's actually not a whole lot to say about this one, if I'm being honest. It's exactly what it is printed on the label of the tin. A male vampire saves a female human college student and then they forge a... a bond.

...To be honest, maybe I'm just kind of crazy, but I just kept on continuing questioning why Tsukasa didn't initially find Anzai creepy at all. 

 

Like he just keeps showing up at her window in the middle of the night and she's just... fine with that.

Also...

I couldn't help but feel bad for Tsukasa's original friend in episode one who

!the entire thing is I guess that her friend whom in all actuality is secretly a vampire that is killing (and raping) other female students but in actuality loves Tsukasa. He's just diverting his violent and sexual urges away from Tsukasa to others. But Anzai is like all ""no humans and vampires can't have romantic relationships"" but then he just almost immediately starts repeatedly visiting Tsukasa after the original vampire friend is out of the picture and he and Tsukasa of course end up in a relationship.

img440() img440()

...I can't believe I was tricked into watching vampire NTR.!

Almost predictably, to me, the romance between Anzai and Tsukasa was for sure the worst part of this show. Like I absolutely just cannot get behind using

!attempted rape as a way to bring two characters closer together. Like I get it. The professor that tries to rape Tsukasa is human.

img440()

And Anzai who is a vampire which are painted as bloodthirsty monsters is the one who ends up saving Tsukasa from being raped. So that only further drives her to be more comfortable around Anzai. But like... couldn't you have just tried to flesh out their relationship WITHOUT resorting to have her almost be raped? If it didn't feel entirely tacked on it'd be one thing but...

img440()! 

...Really if you remove that, more or less the only other thing that's driving them towards each other is... well, lust. Which I guess is fine if what you're here to see is trashy vampire human romance. 

img440()

Because rather weirdly, while the government is apparently perfectly aware of vampires existing, like almost the sole thing that's discussed about the government regulating vampires is...

Vampires and humans having sex? 

 

It's apparently perfectly fine as long as there's a doctor overseeing it? I guess to assumingly stop the vampire if it goes out of control and fucking murders their mate during the process...? Like there's a goddamned secret police purposely for vampires and like a human group that's dedicated to bringing about their extermination, but rather than focus on that yeah let's focus on Anzai trying to temper and control his vampireness and THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS FOR YOU AND TSUKASA TO GO INTO THIS BEDROOM WE'VE WIRED.

  

This show honestly felt like it didn’t know what it wanted to be. Trashy vampire/human romance or trashy over the top vampire action. Like my eyes would be glazing over as the show would be focusing on Tsukasa and Anzai, but then all of a sudden like some random slasher would just show up and brutally kill a reporter with a knife. Immediately, my attention would be dragged back to the show.

 

The idea of humans exposing vampires who are just trying to stay under the radar by like pelting them with or showing them bags of blood is neat. Some of the action scenes are actually kind of entertaining. Trashy, but entertaining! But when it comes down to it, that's not the main focus of the show...

This, is the main focus of the show. Unfortunately.

img440()

Devil's Line is bad, but beyond that, it's kind of fucking muddled. Could have been a full on trashy human vampire romance, or it could have been this trashy over the top vampire action. It tries to be both and it fails. And on top of that, because it's about vampires and has gore, it's another piece of garbage lobbed into the horror genre. Unfortunate.

img440()

A 3.5 out of 10 or 35 out of 100. I could probably see a situation to recommend this one in. If you want to watch some trashy romance with a side of over the top action then... fine. Going into this, it was already by default not my cup of tea. 

So I guess if you want to be technical, it was better than I expected! Though, I was expecting nothing...

To be fair though, I did technically enjoy this a bit more than the [other horror series](https://anilist.co/anime/100010/MAGICAL-GIRL-SITE/) that was also airing in Spring 2018..."

First of all, this is my first review. Pls not be too strict. I'll just say what's close to my heart about this anime

And of course there is a spoiler warning here, because you never know what I'm going to say here

For now, superficially speaking about the anime:

In my eyes, the anime is something new in every respect. Whether it is about the goal, what is the fight against the class system or London in the 19th century.

But what I liked the most was just plain and simple the character ""William James Moriarty"". Whether it's his past, his ideas and the embodiment of good and bad.

It was really fun that you can follow his plans and get to know his way of thinking. The whole thing decreased with the 2nd season because it was more about ""Irene Adler"" and ""Jack The Ripper"".

Just ""the bad"" side of the story was just something different than always Sherlock Holmes.

Now let's get a little deeper into the matter:

When you saw his past when he was younger in the first episodes, you saw the effort there made. At the latest when they dished up the story where William, when he was younger, dragged the aristocrat into court to give the money back to the orphanage.

The only thing that really made me sad was that you really didn't know anything about his parents or where they were in front of the orphanage. Has he been repelled? Has he always lived in London? or where exactly did the hatred of nobles come from, to hate them in such a way that one devotes one's whole life to nothing but that?

In the first season in general there was never really anything I had to complain about except for one point!

In the manga, after the incident in the Noathic, Albert was ordered to run the Mi6, which he then used in one case. In the anime, on the other hand, it was never mentioned. (in season one, in the second I'll talk about it later)

In the second season you could see that they didn't take that much time to take in everything from the manga. I'm not talking about the side stories of Fred or Moran, but the details in the main story.

For example, the conversation between Sherlock and Irene Adler in the park was completely omitted and the incident when Sherlock and Watson set off the smoke bomb in her house. A lot of dialogues were left out and I thought whether it would go on like this and became more skeptical.

In the case of ""Jack The Ripper"" everything went back to Manga and was then relieved again. In general, I didn't find the case that exciting, but it was still well done. I thought it was nice that they included the greatest murderer in Britain, who was also in the 19th century, in history.

From then on everything went really well and I was pretty happy with the next case of ""Charles Augustus Milverton"", the master of blackmail. I also found his character very interesting and would have liked to know his story about it too, but I think that otherwise they couldn't keep the episodes at 13 and that's why they left it (or it wasn't there, it could be).

I was also very surprised when Sherlock shot him, I was expecting everything but not that he would kill him. William didn't think that either and you saw his reaction to it when something in his plan doesn't go as he planned. As soon as you saw the desperation in Sherlock that he only did what William wanted before killing, even though he did not intend it himself.

And now to the end of the anime in episode 13 in the second season:

I was undecided ...... will William die ..... or will Sherlock save him ..... the developers really played with you. I thought the idea of ​​setting the whole city on fire was good, only because I don't know whether it will really be of any use to change the way the aritocrats think. Even if you have worked there once with the citizens, this does not mean that you are suddenly best friends. But I can be wrong about that too.

In the end, when William and Sherlock were standing on the bridge that had not yet been built ..... I actually thought Sherlock would save him, but when William attacked him, I thought to myself in the fight when he ran, ""Not that Sherlock now dies "". But that was also a nuisance, because in the end both of them fell into the water and in the end neither of them found them.

After the finale, there were short excerpts of what Moriarty's followers were doing in the future and how Albert was behind bars and Louis and James Bond work in Mi6 ...... yes, Mi6 was discussed in the last 3 minutes ..... but it didn't play a big role in the manga either, so it's not dramatic now.

I also found the ending clip of Sherlock sitting at the bar with William in Switzerland very successful and you could see that although they weren't in good contact, they became really good friends

On the whole, I found the anime really nice and found it so good in the first season that it became one of my favorites.

I will give the anime with the 2nd tier a 95-100 and then rounded up my list to a 10/10, because I don't know whether an anime in such a genre can top it"
103275,"Got around to finally watching and surprisingly completing it quickly, quite the bingeable show it was.
Now, anime-only might've been confused in the start with the whole ""Grand Order"", for that my best advice for you is to start the game - Fate/Grand Order, it's available on both Android and iOS

It was one big intense adventure from the start to finish, it was odd seeing it all animated but they did a good job with it though missing and somewhat changing some details but overall it remained true to the events in the game to my understanding.

It was fun seeing all the characters interact with actual voices accompanied by lovely OSTs. As for the battles, it was a treat to see all the fights not having to worry about team compositions, supports and whatnot. Just sat back and watched the mayhem ensue and speaking of which, this adaptation of Fate really showed how powerful Servants are. Plus the CGI for the show wasn't half bad. they did a well enough job considering how CGI usually rolls in anime.

About the story itself, going through it again made me realize why it isn't the best Singularity then it comes to that aspect. The stakes are higher and the battles are as flashy as ever but the first half of the Singularity - mostly the Goddess retrieval Arc you could say had a recurring element and somewhat luck or simply plot armour to it. However the final part was a thrill ride through and through with surprises every turn it took. 

Finally, let's not forget the best thing about the show - Gilgamesh or more accurately Caster Gil. I don't like Gil's character from the previous adaptations but FGO Gil? Now he was a breath of fresh air. Seeing him align with the good side (though he isn't exactly evil to begin with) was a new and enjoyable side of him. Well you can make the argument those are two different versions but whatever the case, the Wise King of Uruk definitely outdoes the Tyrannical King of Uruk for me. Still it was fun seeing him boss people around, well he was a King. Definitely Best Boy material right there. 

The journey doesn't end there, next up Fate/Grand Order - Endgame (Final Singularity)"

So finally after years of trying, I have finally found the time in my schedule to be able to re-watch all of Durarara (English Dubbed) to finally complete a story that I left unfinished for years, and that I started almost a decade ago, and honestly guys, I loved every minute of it. Durarara is one of those shows that you cannot just pick up halfway into the series after not watching it for years, because most likely you will be completely lost within the ocean of details this story drowns you in. This entire story is almost dependent on you understanding what the 50+ characters are doing concurrently in the story, which is needed for you to be able to fully understand what is going on. 

This is why I feel Durarara is one of the few anime that actually benefits from being watched dubbed in English, because there is so much detail in this show, down to what character is talking (while text from two or more different characters are shown on screen) will be an element that foreshadows a story beat within the many different story arcs that all happen at the same time. Making the voices of the characters themselves an important characteristic that you as the viewer need to memorize to understand what is happened, and English voices (for me) are easier to distinguish between. This leads into the biggest double-edged sword of this series, the characters.

img500()

Characters: 
The Characters in this series (to me) are the biggest asset this series has to really immerse viewers within the story it is telling, while at the same time, being the biggest barrier to entry for many new people who are interested in watching the series. Because the vast network of characters this serious develops over its 60+ episodes is honestly extremely daunting even too an experienced anime watcher like myself. It really is amazing to me how interconnected not only the different groups that are at play constantly throughout this story are, but also the interpersonal relations within each of these groups that drive’s the story forward throughout the series. 

Unlike many other anime, there is no singular or even small group of 2 or 3 protagonists within this show, almost every character you meet in this series has their own backstory, personality, character motivation’s, and goal that they try to further during this series. Making the real main character of this series the city this story takes place, Ikebukuro, really feels like an actual city because of how this story is told. While yes, there are some characters that feel more prevalent early on in the story than others, there are entire 10 to 12-episode arcs where these same characters aren’t even mentioned in the story, while the rest of the city comes to life around them. Just so you can have an idea of how many groups are at play in this series, at some points, there are as many as 13 to 15 different independent groups in this series who are fighting amongst themselves, not to mention while this is going on, there is also interpersonal relations within each of these groups that are affecting how they act within the story. This complicated web of connections is what makes this city feel alive like an actual city.

Conclusion: 
In the end, that is really all I wanted to talk about when it comes to this series, because while yes the setting, animation, and music were all great as well, what really sets this series apart from other anime is the vast network of characters that independently interact throughout the series, that really brings this story to life and set’s it apart from other anime, to me. 

Not to mention, the fact that there really is not a main character in this series, with each episode commonly being told from a different perspective than the last, showcasing how vast this city really is. And as this story continues to grow larger (expanding the web) it is honestly amazing to me that I could even keep all the different stories straight within the context of the wider narrative being told in this series. Leading me to quite a predicament, because I honestly don’t know what I should rate this series, because while yes there are some parts that I did not enjoy as much as others. I really did enjoy the unique way of telling a story that only Durarara was able to effectively showcase throughout my anime watching “career” as of right now. But since I have to rate it, I'll give the whole series a 90/100, I recommend you check it out because this is one of the most diverse cast I have ever seen in an anime brought to life, and with this, I am just going to leave it at that😊

20503,"(Very minor spoilers.)
Witch Craft Works is an incredibly visually appealing anime with great character designs and concepts that aren’t used all that well, and up us as a kind of boring, sloppy mess that masquerades as your average battle romcom. 

The premise is that of two people- a guy who is unknowingly the “Chosen One,” and a girl who is his knowing fated protector. They have a typical princess/knight dynamic, except the princess is the guy and the knight is the girl. This seems like it should be one of the more interesting concepts, but… it goes nowhere. The guy is just generally a useless softie who wants to be better, and the girl is your average kuudere school idol- perfect grades, trained in every martial art, perfect at everything except expressing her feelings… 

Everything is pretty. There’s a Senran Kagura-level of creative and memorable design on the characters, and while most of the scenery is typical high school/Japanese city, the few times (2 or 3 that I can remember) they go into magical “witch” areas, the landscapes are absolutely enthralling and magical, in a pastel, harmless way. (Fair warning: there IS CG in this anime. It’s used very little beyond the beginning arc, but it’s not terribly bad or distracting. I kind of like it.)

However, how everything is used… is not terribly creative. Most of the episodes jump between two conflicts- that of the main guy’s role as the Chosen One, and as a magic user (“magic plots”), and that of the main couple’s relationship, either in training or daily life (“romcom plots”). The magic plots are usually action-heavy and dramatic, while the romcom plots tend towards slice-of-life banter and very light ecchi. The comedy lands pretty often, for what it’s worth, and the slice of life parts that revolve around the main couple are lighthearted and entertaining. 

The action, though? The magical abilities are actually quite captivating, with each witch using a specific style of magic that suits their design. The problem is that they show their hand far too early. A villain (?) who assaults the protagonists displays a beautiful aquatic magic power (in the first 2-4 episodes) that pretty much blows any other effect in this anime out of the water. Also, the main girl’s abilities are also shown very quickly, with her having different “forms” that reflect how serious she is.

And that’s the main problem with this show’s pacing. It jumps between plots, tones, and intensity far too fast, but with consistency. You’ll be sitting through a slice of life segment, and be saying to yourself “ok where’s the conflict that will put this on pause?” Or during an action segment you’ll dread the imminent cutaway gag from the comic relief that breaks that dramatic tension so carefully created by great villains. (For what it’s worth, all the villains’ designs and fight sequences are excellent. Their motivations? Pretty much non-existent.)

It’s not… bad. I’ve seen a whole lot worse. It pretty much only switches between 2 tones, and the ending arc is serious all the way through. But I much prefer the slice-of-life segments. Framing this as more of a romance or slice of life (in the vein of Oh My Goddess, or hell, Maid Dragon) would’ve been a lot better, and a lot more conducive to the ensemble cast of villains and heroes. Seriously, having like 10 separate good witches and like 5 separate bad witches that are fleshed out nigh-equally is just horrible for a 12-episode anime! The focus is spread equally among every character who isn’t “main,” and every single one hurts for it. The sister is a bland brocon, the 5-person Team Rocket witch team literally never do anything productive (ignoring a tiny element near the end, that ended up being unnecessary), and the chairwoman… what, honestly did she do? Dang it, you have some good characters. USE THEM. Don’t use them as bait for flashbacks, don’t waste them in one-off fights or gags, don’t restrict their character to one trait. You did fine with the main couple, why limit yourself? There are great ensemble cast series that actually flesh out a wide array of personalities and ideas. Jitsu wa Watashi wa (manga) is a great example- varying amounts of time were spent on each character to help them fit into the environment and realistically involve themselves in future story arcs. If a character is overall useless, or going to be— let them be, look, and act one-bit. Don’t fool your viewers into liking or hoping for the spotlight on characters that are just going to be background butt monkeys.

5.5/10. Bonus points for that catchy ED. And don’t even get me started on the actual story."
148969,"2023 hasn't been short of slice of life and romance anime. But the unique flavor of sweetness that Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible brings to the table can't be beat. 

Img450()


The story is neither complex nor absolutely unique, but the simple story elements are executed really well. It is a wholesome slice of life, that tries its hardest to be as light hearted as possible while discussing about feeling socially invisible. The 12 episode series relies heavily on the dynamics between its two lead characters, Kubo and Shiraishi in order to tell the story. It is basically a story about these two characters and how they interact. To some this show might seem repetitive at times, but this repetitiveness works in favor of the show as it highlights the level of invisibility Shiraishi feels, which in turn helps build his relationship with Kubo, who is the only one able to find him anywhere and everywhere. 

Watching every single episode feels like tasting a candy, sweet and wholesome, which will make the viewer feel satisfied. There is no unnecessary drama that has become synonymous with high school romances, or too much force or teasing that we have come to associate with this particular sub-genre of romantic comedy. The comedy and romance are present in equal proportions, on one hand this show will continuously make you smile with occasional moments where you can't help but laugh; on the other hand the budding relationship between Kubo and Shiraishi is so adorable that you can't help but root for them to be a couple.  

Img450(v)

As for the characters, they are not the most complex of characters but they are written in a way that the viewer develops quick attachment to them. Our two main characters, Nagisa Kubo and Junta Shiraishi, though follow some of the troupes of romantic comedies, they are extremely likable. On one hand you have Shiraishi's quiet personality, which contrasts really well with Kubo's bright and outgoing attitude. The show finds a balance in showcasing both of their strengths and weaknesses. Some people may find Kubo to be pushy, but in all honesty her forward attitude is not overbearing, she treads the fine line of being assertive and pushy. Her thinly veiled flirtations with Shiraishi will be something to look forward to in every episode. 

As the title of the show suggest, Kubo helps Shiraishi escape the forest of invisibility. It is a delight to see him being open with her, as well as make more acquaintances along the way. And Shiraishi is no one dimensional character either, he has various facets to his personality that we discover as the show progresses. Aside from our leads, there are other characters who for most part are quite likable, though at times you start to question how can they miss spotting Shiraishi as much as they do. Here, the theory of Willing Suspension of Disbelief will be your friend so that you don't feel less immersed in the show. There's a character named Seita, a little boy, who is absolutely adorable and has the same charm as the kids from Gakuen Babysitters.

As for the visuals and audio, Pine Jam does a good job in animating this show. The colors are vibrant and the scenery is really pretty; that paired with the adorable art style and character designs make for a show which is really easy on the eyes. The music is also pretty decent, with an above average opening theme and a harmonious ending theme. It is the voice actors of Shiraishi and Kubo who steal the show, they have great chemistry together and deliver some entertaining performances here. 

Overall, Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible is a feel good show which will have you smiling in no time. It mixes romance with comedy pretty well and delivers a package which is entertaining and of a decent production value."
1292,"Throughout time, many legends have been told about the mighty samurai… Warriors of honor, loyally serving their masters, as well as lone Ronin, serving only to uphold the values they hold true, whether they be religious or personal. Around these parts, you’ll hear tales of one such Ronin, a bad ass motherfucker who’s as silent as the grave and twice as terrifying. This man knows no love, no empathy, and no tears. He invites no trouble, and will offer no mercy to those stupid enough to give it to him. He knows few pleasures, save for the warmth of a woman’s body, the refreshing tang of a cool glass of lemonade, and the sweet, sweet flavor of revenge. Rumor has it he doesn’t even need to eat… That the blood of his enemies, which constantly bathes the blade of his sword, provides him all the nourishment he could ever need. I myself have no idea which rumors are true and which ones are just the product of fear, but I’ve got no intention of finding out, but there is a bounty on his head…  Care to collect?

You’ll know this young Samurai when you see him, as he sports an afro… A rare hair style indeed, and one that will surely become his sigul long after he’s departed our world, if he ever does. But don’t worry, traveler, there’s no need to fear this man… Well, unless you have what he wants. Otherwise, he’ll be perfectly willing to live and let live. See, you’ve probably heard tell about the headbands… Trophies only the mightiest of samurai are able to carry, and the only way to obtain one is to spill the blood of it’s previous owner. Well, this Afro Samurai is carrying the #2 headband, which… If you can’t guess… Is the second most prestigious headband in the known world, and the only one that grants it’s user the right to challenge the greatest samurai currently living, the holder of the #1 headband. And you didn’t hear this from me, dear traveler, but the Afro Samurai’s drive to challenge this man isn’t based on mere ambition, but something much more personal. He fights not for glory, or for honor… But for revenge.

Unlike most anime, Afro Samurai was the product of an international collaboration. Studio Gonzo was interested in adapting the deeply personal work of Takashi Okazaki, a manga artist who had been influenced by his love of both samurai classics and African American culture, particularly in regard to rap and R&B. He was shy at first, and probably wouldn’t have signed over the rights if not for the encouragement and participation of American actor Samuel L Jackson, who had gotten his hands on a rare action figure based on Okazaki’s illustrations, and had become obsessed with seeing the project through. Jackson and Okazaki apparently connected instantly, language barriers be damned, and the project went ahead, albeit with what I’m told was a 1 million dollar budget.

For an American cartoon, that sort of budget for a five episode series is abysmal, but it’s not that generous for an anime, either, despite the fact that anime is universally cheaper than it’s western counterparts. For Afro Samurai, this meant that each episode could only cost less than twenty thousand dollars, and that meant they had to cut a lot of corners… Which they did, brilliantly I might add, by turning the cheapness they’d been cursed with into a highly appealing visual style that incorporates the absolute best out of all the budget saving tactics you’ve seen before. It never quite falls back on the time old talking heads, at least not to the point that you’d ever notice it, but when movement is limited, the beautifully detailed artwork is more than sufficient to keep your eyes glued to the screen.

To be completely honest, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an anime… Well, any animation, really… Get this much mileage out of such a limited color palette. There are occasional splashes of color throughout the series, especially when it comes to the buckets full of red blood and the golden glow of our hero’s precious lemonade, but for about 90 percent of the series, the colors on screen are almost monochromatic, playing with numerous shades of white, black and gray, as well as the occasional tan of the ground. At night, the cloudy, overcast sky is a captivating sight, and during the day, the lighting effects are beyond gorgeous. Other visual effects such as rain and fog filters are integrated smoothly with the cell-drawn animation.

The real triumph here are the action scenes, which are fast, fluid and dynamic, even when the animators have to break a character’s anatomical frame in order to keep the pace up. It only takes one real glance to see this kind of animation style in motion, as Afro’s namesake blows in the wind like the reflection of the moon in a puddle, and the animators are not shy about letting an occasional arm or leg move with exactly the same level of consistency. It winds up working out better than you’d think not only because of sharp, fast editing, but because the sound design of every single sword movement is completely on point. I love all of the action scenes in this series, but a few easy highlights are an early fight where Afro splits a bullet with his sword, a huge bloodbath of a brawl from when he was a teenager that almost feels like Saving Private Ryan in the way it’s brutality is show to effect him, and of course, there’s also a fight towards the end where he takes on a robot who’s been designed to look and fight like he does, but has no problem taking Afro to the sky with it when those tactics don’t pan out.

As you may have guessed from Okazaki and Jackson’s connection that I mentioned earlier, the music in Afro Samurai is made up mostly of hip-hop, full of vocal tracks whose head-banging beats fit the pace of the action in a way that’s easily similar to The Boondocks. The vocal work was performed by RZA, a former member of the Wu-Tang clan, a band that was, in it’s own right, influenced by Eastern culture. He also produced much of the music, as he did for his former band. The instrumental tracks feature slightly more traditional orchestration, but they fit more to the background, humbly doing their job without standing out too much. Besides, why bother making the instrumentals stand out when you have tracks featuring The Game, Too Short, Snoop Dogg and more, which are guaranteed to leave an impression all by themselves? The soundtrack, if you’re lucky enough to have it, features a small handful of tracks that weren’t from the show but inspired by it, and I don’t mean ‘inspired by’ like all the bullshit tracks on the Pokemon Movie soundtrack… These are songs that actually fit the series.

The English dub is a very unique entity, as it’s comprised almost entirely of actors who work in traditional animation. or “Pre-lay.” This is a term referring to the practice of recording a voice actor first and then animating a character around them afterwards, as opposed to ADR voice acting, which does the opposite. Thankfully, they translate very well over to the more prevalent Anime recording style, although there are minor lip-flapping hiccups from time to time. The only anime regular who appears in this dub is Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Afro’s childhood friend, Ginno, who was an idealistic young boy in Afro’s past, but is even more compelling in the present day scenes, due to certain spoiler reasons. He does an outstanding job, probably the best performance in the dub, but because of a certain other big name, he was never the one I was going to get excited over.

No matter how much hype went into the American airing of the series… And yes, the hype was palpable… The truth was, regardless of the show’s success, I was going to watch it either way because of one of the names attached to it. He’s one of the most underrated actors of our time, in my opinion, and as much as I enjoy his live action work, I practically chomp at the bit when I get a chance to hear him in a cartoon, or even in the rare video game, and I couldn’t resist the opportunity to hear him in an anime. He’s not only my favorite black actor, or my favorite voice actor, no, he’s my favorite ACTOR, period. I’ve been following him since BEFORE what many would consider his most memorable role in Pulp Fiction, and his inclusion made this dub for me. That’s right, I’m talking about Phil Lamarr, the original voice actor for Samurai Jack, who once again returned to the genre as the young version of Afro, as well as one of the Brothers, a league of elderly assassins including such prolific actors as Jeff Bennet and John Dimaggio!

Oh, you thought I was talking about Samuel L Jackson? He did a fine job. I wish I could say more, but as a main character, he had relatively little to do or say throughout the series. The titular character Afro is a very soft-spoken character, choosing only to speak when necessary, letting his actions do the speaking for him unless he has no other choice. It’s not really Jackson’s fault, as it’s not really an acting-heavy role, but he still does an admirable job with it. Thankfully he has dual roles, as he gets a lot more lines as the mysterious Ninja Ninja, a loud-mouthed tag-a-long who appears to Afro the minute he earns the #2 headband properly. The true identity of Ninja Ninja is never openly revealed, nor is it stated until the final episode whether or not he exists at all. While his endless jabbering is welcome most of the time, breaking up long periods of silence and questioning Afro’s motives, he can become annoying with his knack for stating the obvious. Think of him like… D’s hand from Vampire Hunter D.

The other two high-billed names are Kelly Hu and Ron Perlman, though neither one really appears enough to justify having featured names. Outside of flashbacks, Kelly Hu only appears in one episode as a shrine maiden who takes Afro in when he’s near death, and nurses him back to health… Using both medical AND sexual healing to see him through. Kelly exaggerates her accent with this character, which I guess is fitting, because she’s one of the only definitely-asian characters in the cast. Ron Perlman is unrecognizable as the main villain, Justice, who only appears in the first and last episodes, but that’s mostly because he hisses his lines like a snake, playing up how misanthropic and morally bankrupt this #1 samurai has allowed his time in the top to make him, as well as highlighting his delusional, god-like ambitions. If there’s a problem with this dub, it’s probably in the fact that some of the Brothers, played by veteran voice actors though they may be, are performed as though they were southern evangelical priests, a bafflingly poor fit for the tone of the series.

You wouldn’t be unjustified in saying that Afro Samurai had a very weak story. Despite all that happens in it’s five episode run, little to none of it seems to matter in the long run. Afro gets into fights that are resolved as easily as possible, and then moves on afterward, as if nothing had happened at all. This is because, at it’s core, Afro Samurai is the very simple story about a surprisingly simple man. While we do get generous doses of flashbacks to explain who he is and why he’s doing what he’s doing, you really wouldn’t lose anything important to the plot if you just told his backstory, and then cut directly to Afro standing at the gates of his final enemy. Even at five episodes, this anime could have been reduced to one, or two at the most, with nothing you would need to know lost in the process. The story does not see actual progress very often, and neither does Afro’s journey, as he himself sees little to no development, at least if you don’t count his childhood and teenage years in the flashbacks. This has become a major criticism of the series, and it’s one I feel I should address.

One of my favorite movies of 2013 was 2 Guns, a more-or-less by the numbers action film that featured both Denzel Washington and Mark Walberg as undercover agents from two separate factions pretending to be friends to investigate each other, constantly fighting together and backstabbing each other as the story progresses. I say that, but the story for the most part was an incoherent mess. There were so many betrayals and plot twists that I’m not sure even the writers knew what was going on, so why did I love it so much? The answer lies in the execution, and what the movie brought to the table that worked. The insane story was made palatable by the sharp, clever dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads, and it ended in such a way that it was able to embrace it’s insanity… Where else am I ever going to see a shoot-out between the Navy, the CIA and a drug cartel that takes place in the middle of an honest to God cattle stampede?

And that’s exactly why I like Afro Samurai so much. There are plenty of samurai stories with depth and complexity to them… Samurai Jack, Seven Samurai, Rurouni Kenshin… But in how many of them do we get to see the main character ride a robot version of themselves into the stratosphere, and then fight it all the way down? The only theme that Afro Samurai really tackles is the cost of revenge, as you do get to feel the bodies of Afro’s friends and enemies pile up over time, which forces you to wonder whether or not vengeance for his father’s death is really worth it in the first place, and his past does come back to haunt him at numerous occasions, as will often happen with the hunt for vengeance. Aside from this, there are a lot of things that just kind of happen, but the saving grace… And what makes the execution here so good… Is that it’s all done with so much sincerity that none of it ever feels forced or pointless. Every single fight is memorable, no matter how easily they’re resolved, and even no matter how forgettable or how generic the attackers themselves may be.

Does this excuse the obvious problems with the series? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, while this series does make for good popcorn material, it doesn’t offer much in the way of a rewatch, and much like your typical Superman story, it’s kind of difficult to get invested in the story of an unstoppable man. There’s also quite a bit that doesn’t make any sense… The rules behind the headbands in particular are a head scratcher, and I’m not just talking about how easy it would be to fake a #2 headband, but… What happens when #2 kills #1? Do they choose who gets the #2? Apparently they do, because Justice just hands it over to little Afro so that some bandits can pick it up. And why can’t someone just break the rules and kill the #1 with a sniper rifle? Guns exist! And while I had no problem with most of Afro’s enemies, the writers never portended that they were supposed to be important… Except for the Empty Seven, who prove to be completely wasted by the end.

And yet, the series keeps a consistent tone that makes it really easy to get lost in. Shallow as the story may be, one dimensional as adult Afro may be, underdeveloped as several concepts may be, it’s a dark, gritty story that’s taken completely seriously and steeped in the love of two very adult genres. It’s definitely style over substance, but with both a style and substance that feel more like a collaboration between Kanye West and Quentin Tarrantino than a collaboration between Sam Jackson and a Mangaka, it’s worth at least a second look. That’s not to say the series is as much as the sum of it’s parts, but there’s something to be said for how much fun it is to watch a passion project that’s creatively unhinged, and held back only by budgetary limits. It’s not trying to be art, it’s trying to be grindhouse, and to that end, it does a pretty solid job.

Afro Samurai is available from Funimation in an impressive fold-out DVD case, as well as your standard thin blu-ray release. A follow-up movie, Afro Samurai Resurrection, is also available from the same company, and while you can buy them separately, you can also get them as a bundle in a set called The Complete Murder Sessions. The original manga consists of only two volumes, and it IS available stateside from Seven Seas Entertainment. A video game for the Playstation 3 and X-Box 360 is unfortunately out of print, but it’s not that difficult to find a copy online.

Afro Samurai isn’t for everyone. I personally enjoy it, but there’s a good reason I can only watch this series about once a year, tops. It has a definite cool factor, but so did the first seasons of RWBY and Hellsing, and I hated both of those. Granted, Afro Samurai has quite a bit more to offer than those two did(as much as it fails compared to their future incarnations), mostly in regard to it’s great production values, addictive music and engrossing adult tone, but I have to admit that if it were even one episode longer, I’d probably hate it. I love Afro Samurai, but like so many other guilty pleasures out there, I have to be brutally honest about it… This series works really well, but only in small doses spaced out over time. Hell, even as far as Samurai shows with heavy hip-hop influences go, Samurai Champloo did it first and better. I give Afro Samurai a 5/10"
146625,"How many times have you been told that this anime was the summer 2022 biggest disappointment? Might have been a bunch of times between tier lists made by youtube content creators or even the community that watched the show. But, if you are someone that is doubting between watching or not watching this anime you found the right spot! Because I believe all those bad opinions are not true and they are only discouraging viewers that could appreciate the art and story this great anime is offering.

First of all, I don’t believe this anime was a masterpiece or something, as there are some lacks of information, plot problems and minor errors. Its just that I don’t know why it was so poorly received by the community when the execution was actually amazing. 

Ill rate from 0-10 the following subjects: story, animation quality, character design, soundtracks, direction and enjoyability.

STORY 10/10
I believe its not good to stereotype an anime by its portrait and description, as people are often misleaded into thinking its the typical romcom where it only knows how to take advantage of the cuteness of their waifus by making cliché scenes. However, the plot goes SO MUCH further than that. 

The story is set in a world and period like our earth, but the main difference is the presence of demons, these demons terrorize the cities around the world so there are demon hunters that kill them. The main character fights demons for the sake of revenge against the demon that killed his family. For that, he made a contract with a very powerful demon, but theres a catch, every time he desires the power of the demon he has to give up some of his memories. So you can see how chapter by chapter he gives up his most important memories, forgetting the time he spent with people he loved and even forgetting his own family he is fighting for. Its so sad but admirable at the same time, as he is able to give up everything of himself for the sake of revenge. 

Finally, I wanted to say that not only its plot, but the mix with comedy also boosts the anime upwards.

ANIMATION QUALITY 8/10
Really well made and polished animation, it doesn’t feel static at all, the camera angles are always in the perfect position.

In the other hand, theres a flaw, a very disgusting but typical one, and that is that even though melee and sword fighting battles are really well animated, background characters dealing ranged damage make no sense, what I mean is that rifles and guns in the anime are so useless as shurikens and projectiles in naruto. Bullets are so weak that the monsters don’t even bother to react to them, and it gives me the feeling of: “why the fuck are you here?” or “get out of the scene if you are so fucking useless”. 

CHARACTER DESIGN 9/10
The 3 main girls of the anime feel really unique, we have a yandere (the demon), a tsundere (the blue haired girl) and a kuudere (the monk), each of them has complete different personalities and their interactions with the main character never feel boring or disturbing. The only problem I see is the lack of background information, at most it only shows some little flashbacks and I believe a deeper focus on the 3 girl’s backstory would have made this anime even better than it is.

SOUNDTRACKS 7/10
I know its done on purpose, but there are too many sudden cuts of soundtracks 
that make you unable to fully enjoy the scene you are watching as it changes so fast. 

Even so, the selection of sounds are decent, but its specially in character development scenes where the soundtracks shines

DIRECTION 8/10
Its weird, because there are so parts where the direction is amazing, but there are some others where you question the ability of the director. Some particular scenes I want to complain about is the endings. He ruins the hype created by the scene with the ending theme, I believe he could had managed it better and be more creative so the ending could blend in with the scene (something like those rezero endings, where the ending plays but the scene is still running).

In the other hand, the director really does well with hiding information from the viewer and showing them little by little so the spectator can play detective and immerse himself into the anime. 

ENJOYABILITY 7/10
Its true that the action and romance scenes are really good, there is also really good fan service but there are plenty of boring scenes that are really useful for character development and to give meaning to the story, but it doesn’t take down the fact that its boring.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, its a really enjoyable anime with a good plot and really well designed characters so don’t let others opinions make you not watch this amazing anime."
18247,"There was once a time in the early 2000s when Harem shows were one of the more popular genres of anime, even in a few parts of the western world with titles such as Tenchi Muyo and Love Hina. Though many anime fans didn’t love the latter because of this specific trope, the former focused on the anime community with its quirky characters. Nowadays, the harem genre isn’t as it once was, not in terms of merit but popularity. Once in a while, we get trying to put different ideas on viewing the genre in terms of parody, comedy, and character development. But some don’t try to do anything unique to it as a whole and most likely felt like it could’ve been a lost harem idea back in 2002.

Now we have the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos. The continuation of a series that most people, even fans of Harem, show no restraint in voicing their hatred of it. Somehow, it has gone to sell like hotcakes despite being anything more than drab and generic. The one question that pops into my head is: Why is this show getting all of the attention from people buying up the OVAs and BDs when there are better harem shows out there and continue to this day?



Some that come to mind are Hentai Ouji, Sora no Otoshimono, To Love Ru Darkness, Kore wa Zombie, and Haganai. All of which have an infinite amount of personality and creativity to their comedic writing and overall creative charisma that the series could ever have in its little world. But, of course, I’d have to explain why I think of Infinite Stratos this way, but I only bring this whole comparison thing up because there isn’t that much to say about this next installment in the franchise. Other than the fact that it pales in comparison to shows like it.

There are indeed some awful characteristics to be made public about the 2nd season. It’s pretty apparent how poorly written the story is for Infinite Stratos. What makes it even more perplexing is just how there’s so little plot, to begin with, and what little serious drama that is present comes across as muddled and overly not well-paced at all. All it is is just the characters going through different kinds of problems that typically might involve Ichika to help them, which eventually leads to him in a suggestive situation. These situations involve him getting kicked or beaten to a bloody pulp for accidentally changing or saying something that made them blush. From what you could get out of this description I made, you might think that they’re sacrificing the plot to emphasize comedy that can succeed. Unfortunately, this sacrifice only provided a lukewarm reception in all aspects.

The way to describe the comedy in Infinite Stratos in one word is “haphazard.” There are hardly any clever gags to most of the jokes to the point where it’s as if the writers copy-and-pasted the jokes on the scene in question and prayed that the audience would get a laugh from it. A few do garner a little chuckle here and there, but the vast majority don’t even deserve a snicker. We’ve all seen the typical Onsen and the accidental peeking scene in every harem show, so why keep milking it to the people who are already tired of it? I’m sure many people don’t mind that kind of humor, but there comes a time when they need to inject new life into these kinds of jokes. If not, it will be the equivalent of getting your face passively slapped multiple times by the people who come up with this day after day.



The writers do not put any new effort into the jokes themselves, but even the ones they wrote are so messy and confused about their reason for existing in the first place. One prime example is when Charlotte forgot to wear her panties, and she’s too embarrassed to tell Ichika. For some reason, that is never explained. After noting Laura, she finds out later that they are back on and pulls up her skirt and tells Ichika to look at them even though he doesn’t want to. Despite this, she still feels embarrassed and calls him a pervert, despite the fact she had no problem telling him to look. It’s almost as if the writers forgot what the punchline was supposed to be and, in a desperate attempt to be smart, just with the generic route of letting Charlotte call him a pervert for no reason. Good job on that one.

With the writing automatically becoming a one-trick pony, the overall character cast doesn't provide better reception, but a few do get some laughs. The new character Sarashiki is quite humorous in her attempts to be sneaky and conniving in messing with Ichika and his romances, even with her muddled reasoning for liking Ichika in the first place. But the charms stop there in the 2nd half when her appearances are only brief. We have to sit through her sister, who doesn’t have anything going for her except that she’s there for the 2nd to the last arc for no reason. As for the rest don’t improve from the 1st season, nor do they decline in quality since they weren’t even that strong to be with other than cute girls. Lingyin hardly makes an impression this season, indicating that she might have been the least popular of the girls, even though Cecilla would’ve been the more reasonable choice.

Then we have Ichika, the main protagonist, just about the by-the-book harem protagonist that you could find in the entire catalog of dense male protagonists. It’s safe to say that Ichika represents what most otaku love to see, a poor guy who acts so brainless to the male hormones that he can’t even muster up the courage to express his genuine emotions to feel better about themselves. Here’s a unique idea: How about a strong male protagonist who acts like an actual male would in that typical scenario? Now I’m not saying that being a total pervert is a good thing, nor does this indicate that we need more protagonists to think of females as sex objects. But when you’re like me, and you constantly see someone like Ichika that does the same shtick where he always acts like he doesn’t have any interest in any of the girls yet somehow later on does. He can’t find the courage to admit it openly. You’d think that we would be tired of this kind of thing around 2005, but nope.



The technical prowess of the show isn’t of any exceptional value because of the generic designs of the mechs, the average attempts on CG, and the average character designs. The girl designs are colorful and pleasant to look at. The opening and ending animation is almost like they recycled previous ones from the first season. Then we have the ensemble cast, to which I must ask how, in the name of all that is good and decent, these talented voice actresses sign up again for this? Granted, Kana Hanazawa is in every show that comes out these days. Still, actresses like Yoko Hikasa, Chiwa Saito, and Inoue Marina deserve better in something else than this. They attempt to be charming as usual, but it doesn’t dull out the pain of going through mediocrity even with those in mind.

Infinite Stratos 2 could’ve been an attempt to pull out a full-blown rant into tearing this show apart like some of my colleagues are willing to do, but in all honesty, you could sit through way worse as far as harems go. You could probably dig deeper into the lost collection of thrown-out harem shows that the studios have dumped and see how much worse they can be. However, since Infinite Stratos is headed by a well-known studio, 8bit, it can be seen as a high-profile failure to reboot the series for a second season that was in dire straits of regaining some merit. Not something that I would ever watch fully again in my life, maybe only a few amusing clips of it, but as I said before, I’ve seen way worse.

Grade: D+"
9289,"Airing in April of 2011, Hanasaku Iroha is a show by PA works that serves as their magnum opus.This review will be a deeper dive into the themes this show explores as well as what I think of the anime that changed the way I have and will ever look at anime.





If anyone asked me why I think Hanasaku Iroha is one of the best in the business, a decent chunk of the credit lies in this part. Despite being released in 2011, it is still one of, if not, the best anime in the pure SoL genre. 

- With Majority of the script written by a name known to many, [Mari Okada](https://anilist.co/staff/100978/Mari-Okada), the story of Hanasaku Iroha is the first show that truly showcased the full extent of her talent - from the tight main plot filled riddled with strong introspective moments to having some of the best characters and coming-of-age. 
These points are now all part of Mari’s writing, having presence in other shows that she wrote following Hanasaku Iroha, such as [ Anohana](https://anilist.co/anime/9989/Ano-Hi-Mita-Hana-no-Namae-wo-Bokutachi-wa-Mada-Shiranai/), [O Maidens](https://anilist.co/anime/105932/Araburu-Kisetsu-no-Otomedomo-yo/) and [Sakurasou](https://anilist.co/anime/13759/Sakurasou-no-Pet-na-Kanojo/). 

Next up on the list we have [Jin Aketagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/103074/Jin-Aketagawa) and [Shiro Hamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/102689/Shiro-Hamaguchi), each responsible for sound and music respectively. 

- The former needs little introduction to the quality of the work he does as he is one of the biggest names in the industry, having worked on [Kaguya Sama](https://anilist.co/anime/101921/Kaguyasama-wa-Kokurasetai-Tensaitachi-no-Renai-Zunousen/),[ Rezero](https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/) and [Yorimoi](https://anilist.co/anime/99426/Sora-yori-mo-Tooi-Basho/) amongst countless other big shows. The lesser known latter, who has spent a large part of his career on [One Piece](https://anilist.co/anime/21/One-Piece/) is not to be slept on as well. Both do a wonderful job at bringing the whole concept of a ryokan, the inevitable advancement of the traditional town of Yunosagi  and a boringly bustling Tokyo to life through OSTs and atmosphere.

Rounding up the main staff is director [Masahiro Andou](https://anilist.co/staff/101518/Masahiro-Andou) ([Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/Wolfs-Rain/), [FMA](https://anilist.co/anime/121/Hagane-no-Renkinjutsushi/)). As is with his team, he plays a huge part in making sure Hanasaku Iroha succeeds. Andou’s style teeters on subtlety mixed with clarity. 

- An example of this would be in episode 1webm(https://files.catbox.moe/y7pu51.webm) 
where Jiromaru was cleanly set-up for his arc while the current one was running. 
Aside from that, his use of symbolism and general story structure - especially during multi-episode and character focused arcs are executed with finesse. Thanks to these amazing backstage talents, Hanasaku Iroha was able to shine even brighter.





Following the technical aspect of the show is the practical side. Starting off with characters; Main as well as the important sides. 


- A phenomenal MC that is one of the key pieces of character in the show. As the epitome of a Coming-Of-Age character - she goes through a ton of changes. From an optimistically forward-looking yet aimless MC to an adjusted, determined waitress to finally discovering her own meaning of life and how to make the most out of it. All of this while never faltering in her own values, a trait all characters of this show share and one of its strongest points.


- The other piece of the puzzle, Sui is tradition personified. Because she is written so damn well, she is the core of most of the good drama in this show. 

- She is confident and unwavering in her beliefs, values and absolute rules, always on the edge of right and wrong, something like following your heart vs doing the right thing, making her the perfect anti-hero/pseudo-villain as viewers are more often than not likely to find themselves agreeing with her views on certain events. Together with Ohana, these 2 are undoubtedly the core of Hanasaku Iroha.


- The parallel of Sui, representing an evolving future generation. The two play the part of the fools - a young, inexperienced but hard working couple, serving as the shepherd of a new age where times change and adaptability is key. 

- Throughout the show, Enishi is presented to us as a faithful son of Sui, always trying his best to learn and improve himself and the inn as the heir. Takako is introduced as his partner in crime, a manager he acquainted with during his college days. 

- Together, they constantly look for new, innovative ways away from the norm to try to better the Kissuiso, much to Sui’s dismay. As a result of their clash in views, the 2 parties frequently have run-ins, leading to good, tantalizing drama, as both sides never truly have the upper hand since no one is right or wrong. I will go into further detail about some of their conflicts in a later segment.


- We complete the list of “essential” characters with this trio. Even though Ohana, Nako and Minko are listed as the main circle of friends, I decided to relegate the latter 2 down to the level of Tomoe; that of a smaller side character. Make no mistake, I am by no means calling the 2 of them weaker characters but rather felt that they fulfill the same purpose. 

- All 3 of them fall under the umbrella of “Plot Material” for me - the in-betweens/content of most major arcs are filled up by them and their personal issues. As such, each of them fill a more generic character archetype i.e dere types and whatnot. 

- However, these 3 individuals outmatch their competitors of a similar character type as they display the potential to easily develop into wonderful characters with the help of great drama, should the need arise.





Moving on the last segment of content, Themes.


- A topic I’m still not fully confident in discussing as I don’t feel that I have the skill to explain, originally thought to have separated the two, are growth and tradition. Going hand in hand, these 2 themes make up 90% of Hanasaku Iroha, always appearing in one form or the other around every corner.

- Briefly touched on during Ohana’s character segment is growth, the ever prevalent. Present in all of the characters and in our own IRL, growth is beautifully showcased in Hanasaku Iroha. Every character maintains their personalities and qualities while unknowingly becoming the best versions of themselves. A surreal mix. Even as a standalone, this aspect of the show is easily one of the best in the game. But when coupled with the next big theme, tradition, perfection is somehow lifted even higher. 

- Tradition is no doubt the most unique thing of the show. It is presented in a way that I have only seen one other time outside of this show - Sakura Quest that comes out 7 years after that is nowhere close to this series. Tradition is constantly challenged in this show, through Sui, Kissuiso or the whole damn town of Yunosagi. Change is inevitable, we all know that. But when brought up in the face of tradition this brazenly, a miracle happens. We spend a decent chunk of runtime exploring the minds of the traditional, as they struggle to adapt to the ever-growing and advancing world around them, relentlessly finding ways to keep their treasured way of life alive. 

- The centerpiece, or rather, embodiment of this is Sui. As is the way of a marvelous character, Sui displays both sides of the conflict towards the end of the show, showing her adept adaptability, being able to stick to her tradition while also breaking the rules to allow what is needed when the time comes, exemplifying growth and tradition together as one. 
Enishi and Takako also fall in the same vein, except their part is of the new generation as mentioned in their own character study. Easily able to abandon tradition, they show growth by having the adaptability and innovation that the new generation leans towards. 

- As for the other characters (Ohana, Minko, Nako and Tomoe), they play their part in a slightly different way - all of them go through the same type of growth while sticking to their own unique beliefs, as a result of their drastically different backgrounds. 
- With such a vibrant cast going through the same process yet bursting with their own individuality, Hanasaku Iroha is the Coming-Of-Age anime that fans of the genre need to see.


- Finally, the elephant that is surely tired of being in the room for 1400 words is addressed. The last major theme is the Inn itself. 

- The silent deuteragonist of the show. Serving not only as a beautifully crafted backdrop inspired after the real life Inn in Kanazawa, the Yuwaku Onsen but also the source and heart of the story. In a sense, the story revolves around Kissuiso. It is the catalyst for the growth of all characters, the reason for tradition and the one thing that connects every single plotline. The importance of the Kissuiso cannot go unstated and credit really has to be given for this absolute marvel of a location. 

- Coupled with the other major theme above, a bustling-ly quiet story about one’s meaning of life is perfected.




- This is technically my 3rd review of Hanasaku Iroha(2nd if you’re counting anilist only) done after my 2nd rewatch and I was hoping that I have 1up’ed myself from my previous attempts. I tried my best to incorporate and detail as much about the drawing points of the story as possible without spoiling. 

- In my first 2 reviews, I state that Hanasaku Iroha is one of the best anime of all time and was my then-favorite anime. I have since found more shows that I personally enjoy more than it but what Hanasaku Iroha taught me will stick with me for a lifetime. 

- #Aside from my personal stuff, I wholeheartedly believe that anybody, no matter your taste, will be able to at least appreciate this anime for what it’s accomplished. 




Previous edition 
v

!From the studio that brought you Classics like Angel Beats (2010) and True Tears (2008), comes a SoL never before seen. Hanasaku Iroha, 2011, is without a shred of doubt my absolute favorite anime of all time.

Hansaku Iroha has everything - Visuals that far exceed its time, a Story that is unprecedented till this day, Characters that are intriguing and behave as realistically as actual humans, a Sub-Plot so good it could actually be a story of its own and last but not least, all of these achieved in 2011! (A lot of the objective criticism will trace back to this)

Brief rundown (my own rephrasing?)

The story follows a 16 year old Matsumae Ohana, forced to move from the bustling city of Tokyo to a Rural Town of Yunosagi, (based on the real life location of the Nishigishi Station in the city of Nanao) after her mother, Matsumae Satsuki, decides to elope with a man she recently met WITHOUT taking Ohana. In Yunosagi lies an Inn called the Kissuiso, run by Satsuki's mother or Ohana's grandmother. Sent there by her mother, Ohana must find a way to cope with her new life at the Kissuiso, following in her mother's footsteps of ""Rely only on yourself"".



In depth explanations (I suck at these bear with me, in fact I've never even tried it)

Visuals

Not much to say about this other than the fact that it's absolutely beautiful. For a 26 episode TV series anime it has some of the best animation. This was in 2011! See it and you'll believe it.

Story

This is the only part where I tend to have a hard time convincing people on how good it is. Without a doubt, this is the 1/2 of the anime's best features. As an Asian, this anime and everything about its' story hits too close to home. The drama is seldom overexaggerated and even when it is, it's usually for the purpose of comedy and not because of a mistake. It has a great flow of story for a SoL, nicely paced with equal parts funny, touching and downright depressing moments. While often bright and loud, it's during the sombre, quiet scenes backed by the beautifully animated background that truly shine the brightest.

Characters

The other half of what makes this show truly a masterpiece. As it should be with original stories where characters are tailor-made for its progression, no character felt out of place in any way, shape or form. Each character has their own unique set of priorities, personalities and the most important point - values. The show relies HEAVILY on the values of its characters. Every decision made by a character is shaped by their values, and this is the main reason of why I think this anime has the best characters. One more important point i forgot to mention is that the character dialogue and overall realism to real life is uncanny. I wouldn't, for even a second, doubt that any show can come close to what this anime has achieved in its time. If anyone were to disagree with me, let me preface it - any dialogue that is not made with the purpose of fulfilling comedy is ultra realistic. And once again, this was written in 2011!

Music

Someone fill me in on this I don't really pay attention to music in anime except for openings and endings. I simply don't think music is too big of an influence on a show.

Sub-Plot

I won't say too much about this because spoilers, but the back and forth of this shows' sub-plot is superb. There was only one small part which I didn't get, otherwise, MINT.

All in all, i rate this anime 10/10 personally. It is, like i said, without a doubt my absolute favorite anime of all time. If i had to rate this objectively, would ya guess it, it's still a 10/10. I firmly and absolutely believe that whether you come out liking or disliking this, you will not be able to deny this show of it's achievements.

So, if you've read this all the way, thank you and please check this anime out. This is my Anilist so you guys can come at me and tell me how shit my taste is and how I haven't watched the popular shows hence my hastiness on giving this 10.!"
108388,"Ok, I'll be honest here: I am an avid lover of all things isekai. My standards for isekai and isekai related things are extremely low. And I found this show to be abysmal. I've even read the manga, and idk if I just payed even less attention then, or if the anime is just worse, but man I could not get through this show.

Characters:
The characters are extremely 2 dimensional, even for an isekai. They are all extraordinarily overpowered, but without any reasons or explanations. A couple of them can just be explained by them being extremely smart about a specific subject, specifically the businessman and the politician, but for characters like the swordswoman who is just ludicrously strong somehow with no explanation it just feels lame. We see shots of her in the real world charging on the front lines in a war, deflecting bullets like Kirito from the ggo arc. The ninja/journalist girl is just a naruto character who never bothered to learn any attacks other than a tazer that she carries around. The engineer girl just is some super genius that would make Senku jealous, without any explanation how. They make a nuclear reactor in the new world almost immediately. There's also a magician kid who is supposedly just using magic tricks from irl, but does stuff like save an entire village from a fire, and then make them reappear from thin air a few full minutes later and they all go ""whoa, we're still alive!"" so did he chloroform them or something? How do they not all know what just happened? The characters all make the concept of Kirito being Jesus look like you're trying to call an inchworm God. They can just do whatever the show wants them to do. Oh, a big monster showed up? Sword girl can just cut it once and it's dead. You get the picture. 

Events:
To say that things get off to a bad start would be an understatement. One of the very first things to happen is that a Leafa knockoff without wings decides the best course of action is to chew up food and then feed it to the ""MC"" (politician) mouth to mouth style. (btw to reinforce the Leafa connection, in the dub they have the same VA even.) She also of course gets kidnapped to be raped within the next few episodes. In between those two events there's an arc where the businessman goes to the city to sell stuff, and that part is honestly legitimately somewhat interesting, but that's about the only good thing I can say. The whole kidnapping thing immediately afterwards involves a guy who looks like if pot of greed was a person. Seriously. Look at them.

This guy's castle promptly falls to the village armed with some magic super metal shields that are super light and strong so the villagers can storm the castle easily. Meanwhile the great wizard of the castle gets beaten by ninja girl cause he sucked, and MC scares the lord unconscious using a gun with rubber bullets. (cause actually killing him would be wrong of course) 

Verdict:
Just don't watch it, it's not worth your time, unless you're truly a degenerate isekai lover who's watched everything else out there."
141208,"Before anything, let me get one thing out of the way. I LOVE romance anime. It is my favorite genre, and it made me watch sooooo much bad anime just because of the ""Romance"" tag. 

So, with the hype Tonikaku Kawaii got over the past years, you'd guess a romance lover would say it is a must watch, right? Well, that is correct. But not because it is good. Rather, it is because the romance here is so tasteless it serves as the perfect example of how a ""marriage story"" would look like if written by a horny male teenager with zero experience with love. Now, you might say that is a mouthful, but hear me out: if you think this story is a good  representation of the ideal cute couple, you are maybe the target-public for this show.

One of the things that really annoyed me in season 1 was how Nasa was supposed to be this super smart and dependable boy, but a second later he is about to waste a fortune on a ring. But, I saw these scenes as merely educational. I mean, the whole season 1 feel like Japan propaganda to induce their youth to seek marriage, and ""teach"" them the rights and wrongs on it. So, in that aspect, it was kinda succesful. Season 1 managed to use a harem structure to build a story that wasnt a harem by any means. But there is a reason why most romances end right after the couple ends up together. Because it is very hard to keep a story going without conflict. And you don't expect conflict after the couple is finally together, right? So Tonikaku Kawaii Season 1 redirects their conflicts to other things, like them buying things, losing their house, have a whatever jealous sister being a pain in the ass...

But this is not a review of season 1. Lets talk about what season 2 did. Well... The very fact that I've been talking about season 1 so far indicates how season 2 was, right? It has so little going on that it might as well be an extended OVA.I just finished watching it, and all i remember is nasa being horny, tsukasa being horny too, them trying to do couple things and other random people suddenly appearing. By ""random people"" i mean the whatever characters that were introduced in this season. There are so many one-dimensional characters in this season that I can't even bother with their names. Season 2 as a whole can be separated between Nasa and Tsukasa moments, and filler random bullshit with the other characters. 

So, now that we know that most of it was filler, at least the cute and fluffy moments were good, right? No. Nasa is still as cringe as ever, and it feels like they didn't develop at all. Yes, they kiss and hug a few times, and even get to the point of sharing a bed (imagine being a married couple that still haven't shared a bed after so long) and taking a bath together. But honestly, these only seem like ecchi scenes to me. They are NOT romance material, because every single development between Nasa and Tsukasa is fake. By the end of the second season, they are still feeling embarassed because there is a bath on the room they are going. It is infuriating.

If season 1 had somewhat of a plot, season 2 didn't. Which would be okay for a slice of life that focus on its characters. But it only works if your characters are well design, and if their gags are funny enough. Tonikaku Kawaii's selling point is its couple, and yet, it amounts to Nasa goint ""she is so cute"", and Tsukasa going ""he is so cool"". The main characters of this show have two dimensions at most in their character design. Lets now talk about the supporting characters. We got little-sister-like girl that acts like an old lady. We got older-sister-like that is bad at school because she plays too much games. We got looks-like-a-delinquent middle schooler. We got airhed loli. We got unmarried teacher marrying her first love at 30, because she got jealous of her student getting married before her. You see where i'm getting, right? All of these characters can be summarized by those words through all of the season. Later in season 2 there is the attempt to develop the main plot of the series, which i've been spoiled at though manga readers. But it is done so poorly, trying to keep a misterious vibe to it, that it is lost between the random filler though the rest of the season.

Talking about adaptation itself, i don't have much to say. The VAs were okay. The music wasn't anything impressive, but managed to set the right mood when it mattered. The animation felt cheap, but hasn't dropped too much in quality when compared with the previous season. Overall, seems like it had a low budget, but didn't need much to begin with.

Overall, i think it is okay if you liked it. If it is your first romance anime, chances are you will like it. Tonikaku Kawaii's best feature is how it appeals to its public-target. Which most likely is those people who comment on every single romance manga ""why am i so alone? why can't i have this?"" But honestly, i doubt people like me who have been watching romance for a while thinks this show is anything above average. Personally, i think this show as a whole is an insult. You can find better romance material in Harem shows, i kid you not."
144553,"This is my first review, so I hope it comes out alright

Do you remember when each anime season wasn't dominated by isekai? A switch was turned on at some point, and we get 10 or so every 12 weeks. That being the case we get a lot anime that feel pretty similar. Heck, sometimes I feel like I can nail the whole plot of the show by the first episode. So when a show does something to flip some of the typical tropes on its head, I think it's worth at least checking out, and I think Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki does this.

Onmyouji doesn't completely reinvent the formula or anything. It's still your typical ""strong guy gets reincarnated into NotEurope, and amazes everyone with his abilities."" Personally I think a show like that is usually still fun, albeit generic and tired at this point. But I think Onmyouji does two things to freshen things up. 

One is involved with its namesake. The MC, Seika Lamprogue, was previously born as a powerful Onmyouji or Exorcist in some sort of fantasy version of Japan. After some conflict he casts a spell that would reincarnate himself into anther world with his memories intact. Upon arriving in fantasy Europe, he doesn't possess the normal JRPG abilities that isekai protagonists and regular denizens of this world enjoy, but instead he still has this arcane knowledge from his previous life, and is apparently just straight up OP, but more than that, it's FRESH. Instead of casting fireball, or leveling dex, or whatever it is we're used to, this guy is placing curses, making thousands of flying paper dolls of magic, has knowledge about the fundamental makeup of organisms/objects, keeps a den of summons(some nightmarish) from his previous life, and reciting poems that I'm in no way qualified to say what they are, but sounds like ancient Japanese poems? The cadence he says them in has an air of mysticism to it anyway. Point is, I thought the show kept things interesting just because I wanted to know more about this supernatural system.

Another thing I found pretty refreshing, is that of course as an isekai protagonist, Seika is going to collect a bunch of ladies to hang out with, and they're all gonna fall for him before too long, but this guy, being you know, 40 or 50 years old mentally, just doesn't care for them romantically at all! He rebuffs all of their attempts, and treats them as almost students or family members since they're all in the teenage range. Which is great since each of the girls are pretty sweet, and I'd hate to see them taken advantage of like most anime protags would(ahem jobless cough cough). But without being bogged down by will they or won't they's, it lets the characters shine more on their own instead of love interest 1, 2, and 3. 

You can make your own judgements on the story, music, setting and such, I just think a lot of people probably skipped this show, being one of the many generic looking isekai's out there, but I feel it has more going for it than meets the initial judgement."

>There are few wars between good and evil;most are between good and another good  Yang Wen-li.

whats so interesting about LotGH is how critical the narrator is especially with the ""honor"" of these characters. The series doesn't glorify war even a bit, it is extremely critical of those whose honor were earned with the lives of those they fought against:the millions of nameless corpses that made Yang and Reinhard Etc who they are in the series. The series isn't about them as much, as it's about both of them coming to terms with the hidden costs of their success through the ranks. Reinhard is the master of the universe whose center lies outside of himself in Kircheis.

img5000()


Yang narrativizes, Reinhard IS the narrative.

img5000()

Oberstein was vindicated within the end: the narrator is speaking from a neighborhood within the longer term that has finally recognized the appalling waste of human life that results from old-fashioned military honor married to futuristic fleet technology, the purpose being that commanders are so faraway from the realities of the chess pieces they're ordering around that it both makes it nearly impossible for those embedded within the military hierarchy to try to to anything about it, and provides someone like Yang the chance to explode the whole coordinates of the war.

img50000()

There's a reason Yang is more comfortable with computer simulations than the guns, war has become completely abstracted from its own reality. it needed,a dweeb like Yang to come in and destroy these overblown ""men"" at their own game. The scale of conflicted handicaps everyone BUT someone like Yang whose historical perspective lends itself to just the kind of cold, analytical manipulation that's needed,tho in Yang's case that coldness is balanced by wellread compassion, Oberstein really was right about almost everything.

21457,"Nothing to spoil here, its a half episodic club anime afterall...

This was an anime whose plot was so-so, but made up for the deficit through its great characters. No matter the character involved in the interaction, each scene was fun to watch. For people interested in these club-type slice of life anime, this one was definitely above average.
webm(https://i.imgur.com/Bxn77BC.mp4)

MUSIC - 7.5/10
The series' single OP, 『Starting Now!』 was pretty enjoyable, and served to set up an upbeat atmosphere near the beginning of the episode. Nonetheless, the OP is much overshadowed by the ED『Cubic Futurismo』that features some pretty weird techno sounds. For both the OP and ED, give the full versions a listen, as they are much different than the anime versions and quite enjoyable. The anime even had 2 Insert songs in the final two episodes that added a nice touch to the ending. The one problem I have with this anime's music would have to be the BGM which overall did an OK job, although was not as strong as other slice of life anime of its kind.

ANIMATION - 8/10
Not much to be said here, pretty well-done animation expected from a 2016 SoL anime. Pretty consistent throghout the series and pretty similar to other animation qualities from studio feel. No heavy action scenes, but it is obvious that the animators did not cut too many corners to get to their final result. The animation does not at all take away from the viewing experience. If anything could be improved, I would say the ending sequence could get a little touch up, to live up to the great experience that is listening to the ending song.

CHARACTERS - 8.5/10
As most other anime of this type, I have to preface that the characters undergo very little progression, so if that's what you want out of this anime, this ain't it. Ignoring the characters' progression, the character dynamics were very enjoyable overall. Whether it was just Uchimaki messing around drawing waifus, or the time the club president actually doing something serious for once, the interactions would do well to draw in the viewer. What I do enjoy most is that the main character has a strong, likable personality, which is rare for the most MCs. Out of all the characters, Usami is probably my favorite because of well-written personality.

PLOT - 8/10
Plot?? Yes, it has one. 

Conclusion
Overall Id recommend this anime who has a particular interest in club-oriented slice of life anime. With good animation, a likable cast, and a good length of 12 episodes, this one is definitely a series that deserves a try.

White Fox, wanting to show the world that Steins;Gate 0 would be adapted into anime, decided to go the extra mile and made this alternate version of Steins;Gate episode 23. While this special was carefully made to blend in with the original episode and give a subtle peak at what’s to come, it forgets one very important thing: to properly cement itself as an ending of Steins;Gate.


I've always seen episode 23 as one of Steins;Gate's best episodes. Re-visiting the events of episode 1 and revealing just how much was actually going on gave credence to the sudden turn of events at the end of episode 22, and Okabe mustering the strength to try one last time to set things right despite all that he had been through was one of his defining moments. Heck, what Okabe ended up having to do led to what was perhaps the most defining moment of the entire story. The reason I consider Steins;Gate to have a good ending, or even an acceptable ending, is because of how episode 23 played out.

Of course, the reason this alternate version of episode 23 exists is to show where the path splits to allow Steins;Gate 0 to happen. It certainly looks and feels like it came straight out of the original show despite being made four years later, and considering the original's quality it's impressive that way. Whether Steins;Gate 0 changes the artistic style from this point is to be seen, but what’s on display here cements it as being just as much a part of this Steins;Gate as it will be a part of the next installment.

For that same reason it's somewhat understandable for it to reuse 2/3rds of the original episode 23, but it doesn't leave itself much time to show the difference. Maintaining the old episode until the path splits gives it authenticity, but it should have allowed itself to be longer than a standard episode to fully explore its alternate direction because it leaves a few gaps in its wake. It ends up feeling like a partial showing, one that was meant to create confusion rather than provide resolution, and considering the time skip it contains there’s little chance that Steins;Gate 0 will clear things up.

Spoilers for both this special and the original Steins;Gate below.

!First of all, there's no particular reason given as to why Mayuri decides to comfort Okabe after his failed attempt to save Kurisu instead of snap him out of his depressive state like she did in the original. Every other time different events have occurred at the same point in time in this series (aside from Okabe meddling with them using time travel of course) it's been across two different world lines, whereas that isn't the case this time. Meanwhile Suzuha does nothing to change what's going on despite knowing that the failed first attempt was necessary and that future Okabe was going to send a message to the past with further details (details she seemed to have known herself even!)

img600()
The high audiovisual quality and attention to key details in this scene give a glance of just how powerful this alternate episode could have been if it was cohesive throughout.

Despite these unanswered plot-holes, this special nails the sense of failure Okabe initially finds himself drowning in. His loss and regret are strikingly portrayed, and it only took a couple scenes to convey this thanks to the ever-well coordinated and fitting visuals and sound work. Then, as depressed as Okabe is that night, we don't get to see how he brings himself to (partially) recover in the next month or two, which is a shame because Okabe simply doesn't receive the extra development he did in the original (and for that matter Mayuri didn't either since we already knew her nurturing side.)!

No more spoilers beyond this point.

We get to see what Okabe became as a result of this alternate experience, which is important in its own right and got the attention it needed, but without a smooth transition it ends up looking like Okabe suddenly wiped his memory to alter his habits instead of consciously changing himself as life continued around him.  With no indication that he intends to revert back to the way he was before, the episode as a whole comes off as incomplete or unintentionally cut. Of course fate might have other plans for him, especially with how this special ends (or rather teases the beginning of what’s to come) but the unnatural presentation of Okabe’s self-change still left a sour aftertaste.


I can appreciate this special for how it bridges Steins;Gate to the new story to come but I’m not pleased with the one-way nature of it.  By lacking the story detail needed to provide proper closure it fails to be the keystone that the original episode 23 was to Steins;Gate.  It works well as Steins;Gate 0 episode 0 but it’s not a proper ending to Steins;Gate despite containing the plot and production values to have managed it with the proper direction & length.  By both showing Okabe try to leave this special’s events and not showing what led him to that course of action, episode 23 β forgets some of the elements it needed to be cohesive and comprehensive, even if the rest is well-presented."
130591,"Sabikui Bisco is a prime example of “You had me in the first half”. What started out as a unique and gritty looking story in the first few episodes, became an extremely convoluted one full of plot holes and errors that made it a drag to watch. The build up to the climax of this show was great, but the climax itself was one of the most disappointing things I have seen in a while, and that’s truly a shame.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 8.5/25

At the outset, this seemed like an interesting concept. In a dystopian society called Imihama that was ravaged by rust, we see Milo, our character, live his life by investigating this “rust disease” and treating patients at a clinic. We see the seemingly scheming governor of this society, Kurokawa, who seemed like a very intriguing villain. I was thoroughly intrigued at this point.

After that, Bisco appears, with a bow and arrow in which the arrows make mushrooms grow on whatever they hit, which was an interesting concept. Following a reveal about the true nature of the rusting and its effect on humans, Bisco and Milo embark on a journey.

The rest of the build up you can watch yourself, but the underlying problems are the lack of a general direction of the plot.

SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH

The climax of the story is where it all fell apart. Kurokawa is the corrupt governor that has a hand in this entire rust issue, and Bisco and Milo confront him, but he proves tough to outsmart. My gripe with this entire sequence of events is that when there’s a clear opportunity to defeat him, Bisco spares him, and it led to more disasters down the road, including the demise of someone, which was another poorly executed “emotional” scene. Anything after that scene was just not good anymore, with the huge monster Tetsujin and all. It became generic and uninteresting.

ART: 7.7/10

The overall art style is good, but it looks very grimy, if you know what I mean.

MUSIC: 8.6/10

The soundtrack is pretty good, and both the opening and ending are one my favourites of the season.

CHARACTERS: 5.5/20

Much like the story, the characters felt very interesting to start, but either didn’t play enough of a role (characters like Tirol, and anyone from the children’s fortress come to mind), or didn’t get good development down the road. In the action scenes, they made questionable decisions, and much of the character quality dropped with the story quality, which was a shame. Wish we could also know more about Bisco’s backstory and some more details about mushroom keepers and more about rusting in general. For Milo, the developments he got felt out of place, as characters shouldn’t be turning their personality into something that seems like the polar opposite for their personality, it was just a bit much. As for the villain, Kurokawa, he was way too basic, and his demise was very anticlimactic.

ENJOYMENT: 7.8/15

Enjoyment declined with the overall narrative, but I enjoyed the first part.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 12/20

This show tries their hand at many themes, and I do think they build the atmosphere nicely, with that dark tone around Imihama, and overall in the story. The adventure element was alright, but the action themes weren’t all that great, especially the last part against the Tetsujin, because of the plot issues there. The emotional side to the story did not pan out due to the tragic situations being clearly avoidable.

OVERALL: 50.1/100

It’s really a shame that the climax wasn’t executed very well, and made the story fall off afterwards, but for what it’s worth, the world had a nice vibe to it, and it was definitely an attempt at an unique concept, but it wasn’t flushed out very well. Last bit seemed rushed, but pacing seemed to be an issue throughout. 8/10 for the first eight episodes, 2/10 for the last four episodes. For Studio Oz’s first anime, it was average, and we hope to see some better things from them in the future."
104052,"From what I've heard, Hoshiai no Sora was originally going to have 24 episodes, which was then halved at the last minute. The creator decided to keep its original structure and continue the story in the next season. In my opinion, despite the shock I felt from that cliffhanger, it's a good move - people who are interested are basically hooked in for good as we wait hungrily for the second season which will apparently come out in 2021, and the creator didn't need to sacrifice anything by forcing everything to fit in 12 episodes rather than 24.

Now, time to actually talk about this show. Hoshiai no Sora, or Stars Align, is another sports anime, this time dedicated to soft tennis. Unlike the other sports anime I've watched (which, to be fair, only includes Haikyuu!! and Free!), it consists of a group of boys who are originally slackers, only to be basically kicked into shape singlehandedly by Maki, a newbie whose natural talent at the game inspires the rest of them to work hard to improve. Their goal is to win at least one game in the upcoming tournament in order to avoid the disbandment of their club. With their improvement, not only do they save their club, they also discover their true passion for the sport.

This show is rather evenly split between the boys playing soft tennis and the boys' home lives and other things in their lives. We get to see the boys struggle against their terrible parents - Maki's abusive deadbeat father, Tsubasa's father who smacked him so hard he fell down the stairs and fractured his wrist, Nao's helicopter mother, Toma's mother who admits straight up that she can't stand him and prefers his older brother, and Itsuki whose mother thankfully doesn't live with his family anymore after scarring him with boiling water as a baby. We also get to see open acceptance and thoughtfulness towards the LGBT community. There's Shou, a family friend of Maki's who is FTM, and there's Yu, who has faced bullying for liking boys and is questioning their gender identity. There's also some slight hints towards a romantic relationship between Maki and Toma, though some may prefer to see him with someone else like, for example, Yu or Arashi.

I've seen some people say that the end of the show was a bit off-putting. As in, the last 5 or so minutes. I can see why - I mean, that was a strong change in tone as we watch Maki purchase a butcher knife and start talking about how as long as his father is alive, he'll keep causing problems for his family. Perhaps we should've seen this coming with the way he and Toma threatened that man, but wow, talk about bold! However, its strong contrast compared to the rest of the show makes it rather interesting. It shows that unfortunately, at the end of the day, soft tennis and their club isn't everything in their lives. Escapism isn't going to help them cope forever, not as long as the source of their stresses still exist.

As aforementioned, considering how the show was forcibly cut in half, it really isn't completely the creator's fault. It is an interesting cliffhanger to end on, and it makes invested viewers anticipate the next season with fervour. There are some things I would like the next season to focus on. Some of the boys of the club don't have as much spotlight and, as a result, aren't as memorable. Even other characters are more memorable than some of the club members, like the twins or Arashi. I had a harder time learning the club members' names, apart from Toma and Maki and eventually some others, than I usually do due to this. However, by giving the other boys more spotlight, this problem can be remedied. This includes a further development of the home situations of the boys. Other than that, I feel that this show has very little flaws. The art is very cute, the characters are realistic, their friendships and closeness are adorable, their struggles help the audience sympathise or empathise with them more, and overall, it's just very fun to watch. 

I strongly encourage people to watch this anime - hopefully if we show that there is a decent fandom behind this anime, we'll get a season 2 that fulfils our needs."

Considerations

● This is a spoiler-free review.
● 90+ in my rating means ""masterpiece.""
● I haven't read the manga, so my review only contain my perspective from the anime.

● I've added one of the anime soundtracks to the soundtrack section. If you wish, scroll down, start it, and use it as your background music while you read.

The Story
 ════ ⋆★⋆ ════
Ashito is a middle schooler who believes he is the greatest striker to ever live, and he aspires to become a professional. He aims to join a school with a good soccer program, yet because of his bad temper, his team ends up losing a major tournament. But, hopefully for Ashito, someone very important was watching his match.

The story of Aoashi is pretty good. I'm already very fond of sports in general. One of the things that stood out for me right in the beginning is that instead of having ""X club wants to win the national,"" Aoashi aims way higher. Ashito and everyone else are aiming at a professional career.

The story has an amazing mix of action and drama. I honestly think that Aoashi was one of the few animes for which I was able to feel myself deeply attached to its drama. The anime also dives deep into the tactics of soccer, formations, roles, body language, and much more. As a soccer fan, I felt like I was in heaven. No superpowers, no ""protagonist power wins."" Just raw soccer and its hardships.

════ ⋆★⋆ ════
The Art
════ ⋆★⋆ ════
That's honestly the only mixed point in my review. While I do like the animation, it wasn't the best. There are episodes that were just straight-up bad, but the anime overall didn't look bad to me. When it was needed (like an important game), Aoashi was able to provide a satisfactory level of animation. Neither too good nor too bad.

The Characters
════ ⋆★⋆ ════
There are a large number of characters in this work: Ashito, his family, his school friends, his team, and his adversaries. His family and a few of the characters on his team are really well developed; others act more as a support for the main drama without actually adding any relevance to the work as a whole.

As I always like to talk about the main character, Ashito is one of my favorite main characters in sports anime. The way that this kid starts off ramping up the hype is absurd. His simpleton style from the countryside is also pretty nice to see, especially for someone who wants to achieve not only a professional career, but also get in the world stage.

════ ⋆★⋆ ════
The Sound
════ ⋆★⋆ ════
The soundtrack in Aoashi is average. There are a few that really stand out, but mostly they're not sounds that really pumped me up or that made me look for certain tracks because of that. They're mostly made with a mix of bass, guitar, and electronics to pump up the BPM. If you want to get an idea of the OST, I also recommend Red and Blue and String of Hope.

(Highest plateau)

In terms of voice acting, I think Aoashi as a whole was pretty good. There weren't any characters that felt missing, and I feel like the tones met the personalities of the characters, especially when it came to an emotional moment.

════ ⋆★⋆ ════
Conclusion
════ ⋆★⋆ ════
If you're like me, you skip everything and read only the conclusion because you don't want to get spoiled with other themes. So I will try to be brief on this point:

Definitely watch it. Aoashi got a 9 for me because I couldn't remember an anime being so tactical and still being able to have entertainment. It's almost like Initial D, with so much information and yet delivering good action. The story and characters are definitely what stood out for me. I hope that with the success that the work has gained, we can get a second season with better production."
20606,"I had planned to watch Book of Circus for years but never really got around to it until I decided to rewatch season 1 and 2 a couple months ago, and god it completely exceeded my expectations. At first I didn't quite like the look of the new characters but came to love nearly all of them very quickly, especially Doll and Joker. However I was quite happy to see them die as well after finding out that their 'father' had been lying about the workhouse, they truly did deserve better but Ciel made a good point - there's no way they could have recovered from everything had they known the truth about the man they were helping. The end really resonated with me; humans are so foolish but it's in our nature and it's what makes us interesting. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that it's only 10 episodes long and those episodes go quick when you're really enjoying them. Also Ciel's laugh at the end was absolutely beautiful, music to my ears, free serotonin, 10/10 would hear a million more times. The opening is a banger as well, couldn't bring myself to skip it or any of the other openings, literally this whole series is so insanely cool and interesting to me. I'm pretty sure that Kuroshitsuji II isn't canon or whatever but the ending felt very...off, so it was nice watching such a well-written season after that. I said I didn't like the look of the characters at first but I have to admit, they were very well designed. Finding out that the freckled dude was actually Doll caught me so off guard and the interactions between her and Ciel were brilliant. As well as Joker's prosthetic hand that he loved, made by the doctor, only to find out it was made from the bones of those children he had helped to abduct. Seeing his reaction while he was on the floor helpless with his arm cut off, goddamn. They were all good guys fighting for the wrong cause, the cause being basically nothing because they blindly put their trust into a liar obsessed with a young boy. Although it kind of hurt seeing Ciel lie to Doll so much, it was completely necessary and says a lot about both of their characters - Ciel doing anything to get the information he needs and Doll believing people too easily. I feel like a lot of this season was based on trust and teaches a good lesson. No matter what someone does for you, you shouldn't support them or help them with highly immoral and illegal things and that's the mistake these kids made. I'm definitely going to rewatch this many times in the future. Finished 7 episodes in one day (which I rarely do anymore) because I couldn't stop watching. Can't wait to check out the other two seasons now :D Hopefully they are just as good"

SPOILERS FREE REVIEW

This anime has no particular deep plot like most comedy types, just a High School boy Kazunari Usa and his wish to live a normal independent high school life (like that ever goes well in a school genre) and there's a Senpai he wants to impress as well.

One thing that literally shines bright in this anime is the AMAZING ANIMATION, I haven't seen many anime with very distinct or special animation but I'd say that the animation style itself goes hand-in-hand with the flow of the anime, looks colorful, detailed, cheerful and overall GREAT. Keep in mind this is an anime from 2014.
The simplest of expressions have so much details in them. The character design are also well made.
The music played along with the romantic and comedy scenes are very much in sync and adds more impact to the scenes themselves.

Ok, word of advice this anime looks cute and all but damn does it throw some unexpected heavy mature comedy. Though the comedy itself is genuine with little to no generic same-old stuff that you'll burst out laughing unexpectedly. This is a very nicely done rom-com with hilarious romantic scenes to heart warming comedy (wait, I got that backwards, ah well...)

One of the things after the animation in this anime that I loved was the uniqueness of the characters and how well they were mixed together. And given a good amount of screen time to give each one enough time to shine so that the viewers get to know more about them.
We have the pervert masochist, the drunk office lady with literally no luck with men, the sadistic college girl... (yeah, I did mention unique didn't I?) The loving old manager lady and the shy book loving Senpai.

After getting to know his fellow tenants Usa decides to go find another place (I mean who wouldn't... They crazy) as he's leaving he runs into the Senpai and, lo and behold she's already living there (guess ya know what he decided next)

Anyways, IMO this is an anime where ""notice me Senpai"" is done right in a very cheerful and hilarious way.

I'd recommend this if you're looking for a GOOD HAPPY watch because from the animation to the dialogs it's one BIG HAPPY ride.

GENRE: Comedy, Romance, School, Seinen, Slice of Life.

RATINGS: I'd give it 8.6/10"
119675,"The summary should give it away. Shaman King (2021) tries to adapt the original, complete story of the Manga with the same name in even less episodes than the original anime adaptation from 2001, which had an already pretty rushed alternative ending (due to the fact the manga was still on-going). 

For roughly the first 20 episodes both anime adaptations are almost identical and it has really been nostalgic to me to re-watch a visually enhanced version of the same story I watched almost 20 years ago on kids-TV. While Shaman King (2021) looks quite good, staying true to the original adaptation while using newest technology, the fight scenes, the heart of any battle-shounen anime, are beyond bland. They barely even hold up to the 20 year old fight scenes in Shaman King (2001) and have a lot of stills and images with little movement. I never remembered Shaman King for awe-inspiring images or mind-blowing fights and neither expected any of this, but the new adaptation had fights so boring, I thought about skipping them. 

Once Shaman King (2021) splits from the original anime, to finish the story of the manga, it really declined quickly, throwing new characters at the viewer in every episode, jumping through several arcs of possible plot points in sometimes as little as one episodes, killing off side characters as fast as new ones are introduced. At the end the plot becomes such a mess I didn't bother enough to keep track any more and just wanted it to end. 

Aside from the abysmal and rushed story-telling Shaman King also suffers from the typical shounen anime problems. We have a MC, who mostly only beats down foes before letting them leave, despite them repeatedly trying to kill him or his friends. Normally this wouldn't be much of an issue, because important characters seem to never be in any mortal danger in shounen anime anyways - and I don't remember that I has been a big issue in the 2001 adaptation - but Shaman King (2021) is actually quite brutal in that regard, killing off characters left and right. In Shaman King (2021) characters get blinded, maimed or killed with most of the main characters still neither being serious nor apprehending the villains in any way. 

This is all topped by Conchi and Ponchi, probably the worst animated characters since Jar Jar Bings. They are lound, annoying and fight mostly with their testicles. That's right these 2 animal ghosts have extendable balls, which they use to violently shove them their opponents - and the viewer - in the face on every possible occasion. These 2 are so unpleasant, that I can understand anyone dropping the anime just because of them. 

Final Verdict: If you want to watch Shaman King, watch the 2001 version, which even though not featuring the original ending, still has a better plot than this hot pile of garbage."

Tejina Senpai

Written by [Razovy](https://anilist.co/user/Razovy/)

Magic, boobies and an average slapstick plot. To some the premise of a nice pair of 'assets' mixed in with the necessary comedy is enough to make a good show, others will utmost definitely argue that the mediocre story telling makes this show nothing more than a show for horny teens.

Where do I stand you ask? Well, let's explore my thoughts, shall we?


Tejina has a magical rack
Yes folk, it is true, our main female protagonist has a wonderful pair. Besides this wonderful 'plot' we seem some magic mixed in here and there, topped off with some slapstick comedy.
The premise of the story is about 'Senpai' (which is written as Sempai in this show for some reason), who is looking for newbies to join her magic club. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, there he is! Only known as 助手 (Assistant), the well needed cool-headed main protagonist of the show fills the role of n00b in SeMpai's club. 
I remember writing the premise for my review for [Komi Can't Communicate](https://anilist.co/review/4183) and I had a lot more to say about the plot... Well, don't expect that in this review folk. This truly is it.

The good
The comedy, which ain't top quality, is definitely enjoyable. I can see how a lot of anime lovers enjoy a show like this, as it has a lot of the tropes necessary to keep our attention, especially that of the male audience.

Besides the obvious, all of the characters are in fact quirky and funny. The only problem in my eyes is the main character, who lacks any kind of quirk. Is this odd? No, absolutely not. In many shows focused on tig old bitties we see that the protagonist is bland. This isn't a good thing, but since this show tries to fill as many of these tropes as possible I'd say it's forgivable.

The bad
If you hadn't noticed it yet, I am not too positive of this show in many aspects. The story is bland, the jokes aren't always funny and the focus on bitties might be fun to some but it sure as hell doesn't tickle my fancy.


Conclusion
Is it worth watching? Well, I watched it and I don't necessarily enjoy these tropes. The story is doable and especially the main female protagonist is funny and cute enough to make you return every episode.
Is this show ground-breaking in any way though? Nope, not even a little. Is it worth your time? Watch something else unless you truly have plenty of time. But, if you like dem tiddies then there isn't anyone stopping you!

Thank you very much for reading my review! I hope it was useful!"
116867,"https://anilist.co/anime/116867/BOFURI-I-Dont-Want-to-Get-Hurt-so-Ill-Max-Out-My-Defense-Season-2/

Here are a list of reasons why you might want to watch this Anime.
- It got gaming,
- It got girls... Wait let's make it better.
!""It got gamer girls"", much better.!


""BOFURI: I don't want to get hurt so I'll max out my defense"", is one of those ridiculous MMORPG light-novel adaptations that people forget as soon as the last episode airs. Why? Because it plays safe.
It throws moe elements (uWus, hahas... You know them) and mixes it with your favorite gaming and isekai elements (OP protagonist, stereotypical guild members, lots of gaming bullshit... You know them too) except the harem stuff. The Anime never goes to do anything big or better, it just plays around.

One of the best things about this Anime is that it never treats itself with simplicity. Everything is grander, colorful, and sometimes hilariously weirder, but never spiritless or generic. Maple, our OP cinnamon roll, is just that cute girl who found about the wonders of the gaming world, and fun exploring that world with found friends. But she doesn't want to get hurt soo... She wanders around and finds the most demonous & outright unfitting abilities. Like I would be pretty weirded out if I see an Anime girl getting a hand full of tentacles, and that's not even the weirdest moment of the Anime. Like once Sally said, we can never predict what Maple is about.

The hike in animation quality is worth some praise. I remember watching a few CGI moments from S1, thinking how better it would've been if it was 2D, and the animators did make most things 2D in S2. Not saying it's flawless though, there are many blink-&-u-miss shots and also a fair amount of CGI monsters, especially in final episode (probably a result of delay). But the direction during its action sequences keeps things engaging despite the flaws. The music is your generic isekai/fantasy OST. Nothing noteworthy there.

As stated before, this Anime is all about having fun with friends that have a common interest. And I agree that is a wonderful thing. But what left me a bit concerned is not showing the characters outside the game. A fun part about gaming comes not only from the game but talking about it outside, making jokes, seeing how that brought small changes in ourselves, whether it's healthy or not. This is something S1 did. Maple's so much in-game time made her say attack names while playing dodgeball, in real life. Despite being about gaming, S1 made sure that these are not just gamers with no life, but actual students who still have something of interest outside gaming. In S2, we never got to see what happened outside the game.
And also, wouldn't it be interesting to see these characters, who formed so much of the team, meeting in real life, having a chat in a cafe or something? That might not be the best part, it also might beat the premise, but it's definitely important, to show that these characters are true friends and not just online buddies. Atleast, I want to see that.

There's really not much of a story in this to remember. Call it a guilty pleasure, if you will.
It's just about having fun. And I'm in for it. That's all."
126791,"Comedy is subjective as they said, so just as any other comedy anime, it's all on preferences. I thoroughly enjoyed this a lot since I felt like the Winter 2021 lineup was lacking any real comedy anime. I mean there were shows that gave me a few laughs here and there, but none that were truly comedy.

Watching episode one of this I didn't really enjoyed it at first. The first half was slow, just your typical generic high school boy who meets a pretty girl and gets con into buying a crappy game. Well I don't blame him as I am too a sucker like him when it comes to a cute girl selling me something. As I myself have fallen for this trick by a cute girl before... so yes I can relate to him. 
The anime really picks up in the second half when he enters into the game world. The first moment he got punched in the face and was dying, oh boy that part got me bursting out in laughter and everything from there on out was just entertaining as ever. I will say this, if you didn't enjoy episode 1 in the game world, then this is probably not your type of anime you will enjoy. Since I don't think the comedy really drift far from it's initial comedy. As it is a parody like that takes everything you expect and throw it out the door. 

The moment I knew I love this anime is the moment Alicia went full Yandere.

Now to say I love everything about this anime would be a lie. Since I didn't love every single character. I didn't honestly care for Mizarisa at all. Though she does have some moments but most of the time I just didn't find her entertaining and without her, I would've still enjoy it. 

For the parody that this anime present itself as, it did a very good job. So it's not one to be taken seriously or you'll wonder why you're watching this. As it takes a lot of the tropes and throws it out the door and it was hilarious. Since I personally not too big of a fan of OP main characters, so this was a nice change of pace. 

Oh I gotta give a shoutout to the funniest character
Souichirou Kamui

This guy walkthrough is probably the funniest thing ever lol... as a person who relies on walkthrough because I suck at gaming lol... I was laughing so hard at the points he was making since it does make sense. He killed it in every scene he was in. 

Overall, this was a fun watch. It isn't for everyone and I understand that. If you enjoyed like the first couple episode, then you'll more then likely enjoy the rest. It does have some good message in there too. Like the whole point of improving yourself and not giving up. And if you want a more serious take on reality mixing with virtue reality, I point you to a complete opposite anime, Serial Experiment Lain, which is a masterpiece in my books. 

Oh and the game console getting destroyed was a nice touch.

I'll never understand why people would go on review just to thumb down a review because they didn't like the anime. If you don't like it, just ignore the review. It's not like I'm attacking the anime, if I was sure go for it. I'm just stating what I enjoyed about it."
20494,"Noragami as the name says (Stray god) is an action, comedy, seinen anime.
    This anime starts with a middle school girl Hiyori Iki while on her way from school jumped right infront of a bus to save a track suit, prada shoe wearing person named Yato. This incident caused Hiyori Iki to be stuck on the verge of the realm of the living and the after-life, soon after she learns that Yato is a god and ends up being dragged into the world of gods while struggling to stay in the realm of the living.img320(https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT2L35zuNZa5WUqs3zEDJjl83rcyWbNsm1DKdde2yPKemI5IPSM)
         As the plot says there are Gods in the realm of the living to get more followers as so they have regalia's(shinki) which are pure souls of the after-life  that are dead and yet to become phantoms(the souls lost in the after-life), this is where Yukine (雪 音) (His name as shinki is ""Sekki"" (雪器)  comes in when Yato is in search of a new regalia he comes across Yukine and makes him his new regalia.img320(https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ6bMEPuPWqGYmZyEKJYPMqyc7OqL5-gLiYogeosy6P7hsN3GpYcQ)
      Yukine turns juvenile and starts to steal cause he feels he did not have enough in his previuos life and then starts to sting(what happens to gods when their regalia's sin) Yato, but Yato does not do a thing think he will stop but he does and then the stinging becomes critical and Hiyori finds out and does something about it and finds a cure to the stings which is to gather three regalia to chant all the sins out of Yukine but will not be successful and Yukine's pure soul will turn corrupt and he will become a phantom until Yukine confesses.img320(https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRzdH4ErD6nC1uo0wdCMmmG7MKQbNtkX0-4XN6NDAxYTKbWLm6Q)
      Then fortunately he and Yato are saved.
     But then Nora appears a regalia with more than one master which is not right for a regaliaimg320(https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSsP0zGdFNFkL5BkWIjQFRQisltereL8L4XH6ftQMHLo1vfHWQ)
    Nora then takes Hiyori's memory and in the quest to get back Hiyori's memory Yato and Yukine encounter Rabo a god war same as Yato who as awakened after over Two hundred years to revive the previous Yato, a god of calamity to fight with him again to bring back the wars of 200 years ago but Yato refuses."
138882,"Family. It’s the essence of most of my emotion nowadays, and in modern media, any type of familial bonding just hits me in the feels, every time. We saw little tidbits of that in this show, and I only wish they executed the importance of family even better, but it’s alright, because Kirishima and Yaeka’s relationship is pure sweetness and wholesomeness to the extreme.

Babysitting shows always remind me of Hinamatsuri, a wonderful show that was wholesome, emotional, and extremely funny, and it’s hard not to compare the two shows. What this show lacked was a more creative approach to humour, and while it’s very wholesome, it felt unfocused and the story didn’t flow very smoothly, but I enjoyed what we got.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 14/25

It’s very sweet, and I can’t emphasize that enough. The relationships are sweet, the dialogue is sweet, the personalities of the characters are sweet. It didn’t have much else to tell though, and while it tried to go in a darker route at times with all the yakuza shenanigans, the tonal shifts felt awkward, because we’d have a set up for darker times ahead, and then proceed back to playing in a playground in the next episode instead of following the dark storyline. It just felt disorganized and unfocused. It felt like a lot of set up at times with no clear conclusion. The villains were kind of just all over the place, and they felt underwhelming as well.

Overall, there isn’t much to write home about the plot, there are just many cute moments and honestly, I’m ok with the simplicity, but I wish the darker moments were executed in a more clear fashion.

ART: 6.8/10

Not the biggest fan of the character designs, but they’re alright. Nothing special in terms of animation, it just works.

MUSIC: 7/10

The soundtrack is pretty simple, and fits the tone of the show well. While I didn’t enjoy the OP and ED very much, it still works for the show. Nothing too special.

CHARACTERS: 13/20

There was a lot of potential with the characters, but in my opinion, just not enough time to flesh them out. If we get a season 2, I’m sure that they’ll be better developed. The cast of characters are fun to watch, and wholesome to the max. Kirishima, the babysitter of Yaeka, probably had the biggest change within himself. He was a cold, and rather brutal yakuza member, and after being tasked with taking care of his boss’s daughter, he became nicer, and learned how to be more responsible. Sugihara existed for decent comedic relief, though his bits did get a bit repetitive as the show progressed.

There were some emotional moments too, and a few backstories that were engaging to watch. Each character had their own pasts and some of them had a rather dark one. With more time, I’m sure the characters will keep gaining depth to them and feel more interesting.

ENJOYMENT: 11.5/15

I loved the wholesome moments and the family moments, they always get me in the feels.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 14.5/20

They were going for wholesomeness, and they did that very nicely, the theme of babysitting was really hammered home. The darker moments felt a bit short at times, but some of the moments hit pretty hard, and it would have been better if the more dark moments were in consecutive episodes rather than sprinkled in every once in a while.

OVERALL: 66.8/100

If you like wholesome shows, I’d gladly recommend this. While it definitely wasn’t my favourite show of this nature, it achieved what it was trying to convey decently, it just lacked focus. That said, I enjoyed my time watching this, and I’d love to see more of Kirishima and Yaeka having the time of their lives together."
20021,"Whenever someone says that the 2012 juggernaut, Sword Art Online is one of, if not, the worst anime in existence, it's really easy to want to point at more broken, insipid, and pointless pieces of shit that have come out before or since. Personally, Hand Shakers, Arifureta, Darling in the FranXX, and Irregular at Magic High School are some of the first things that come to mind. However, those people are likely only talking about season 1, as unless they're completionists, they tend to not even care about watching anything else in the franchise in fear of wasting even more time. People don't tend to watch the continuation of a show they consider among the worst of all time. That makes our job so much easier as we can introduce them to this ill-conceived recap film that sucks by even those standards, and tell people that things can always get worse. It’s not much worse, mind you, but still.

What's worse than Sword Art Online: Extra Edition being tedious by even recap standards is the fact that the writers decided to justify its existence by taping an Alphein filler adventure to the back end of this monstrosity and cutting between recap footage and the girls from the main series getting to know each other over a pool party. If you thought the main series was boring, then this is like listening to an hour-long lecture for a class you couldn’t give half a billionth of a fuck about. The whole damn thing is so drawn out, and the added content brings a new dilemma you don't get with most recaps. If you want to marathon or otherwise consume all of the main SAO anime canon for some godforsaken reason like I did, you're gonna need to subtract 2 hours from your life with this bad boy to see like 30 minutes worth of mew material. If not for that, this would probably be an hour-long special no one but hardcore SAO fans and completionists watched instead of being something most people backtrack to when they remember this thing exists and is considered a sequel to SAO 1 and the prequel to SAO II.

There are strange decisions made all over the place. For example, they cut from one scene in episode 4 to a minute later in the exact same scene and conversation.Sure, it’s best to try to save some time and only really keep the bare essentials if they’re going to try this at all, but this is a head-scratching edit. On the opposite side of the spectrum, earlier in the recap, they keep the entire ending of episode 1 instead of cutting it when Kirito runs away after Klein left for the first time, which is strange since the recap is wasting time that could be spent recapping things faster and more neatly. The constant cutting between SAO 1 content and the new scenes also results in some heavy tonal whiplash with absolutely no time to brace yourself or be eased in by a scene as it starts changing tones.It doesn’t help that the events of SAO proper are, to put it lightly, really fucking dumb. However, it’s nonetheless jarring when we cut from, say, Kirito mourning the death of someone he really cared about, to Suguha’s feet splashing about as Asuna towes her across a pool.

Part of the problem is due to how the first arc was not really written in chronological order despite the anime adaptation assembling it that way, so the recap inherently feels more jumbled and like a lot of what’s in it means absolutely nothing. However, this recapm doesn’t even go through that order as almost everything in the first arc barring the beginning and end get shuffled depending on who’s telling the story or which part of a conversation introduces an event from the series. Inevitably, a recap won’t contain the pathos or a lot of the spectacle of what it’s summarizing, which is why recaps often feel like an absolute waste of time only meant to give production teams another week to finish the next episode of a TV show. This being a 101-minute special makes the bulk of it being a recap feel even more pointless, regardless of them attempting a framing device of Kirito being effectively coerced into an interview to tell the bulk of the story, or the other framing device of the girls telling Suguha how they met Kirito during the SAO 1 side-story episodes.

It’s not even worth delving into contradictions in the new scenes, like how Kirito says you can’t beat floor bosses on your own when he pretty much did just that at least once or how the first boss wiped out half a raid when we only see one man in the entire group die. Before anyone tries to argue that the clip doesn’t do it justice and that the show must have shown others die, there was only one casualty in the fight during the SAO proper. Suguha’s swimming lessons get resolved in an afternoon and are basically just the backdrop to the girls talking about how they met the legendary Kazuto of the Kirito is Always Right Foundation It means nothing in the last 20 minutes, anyway. The Alphein quest that makes up the last 20 minutes is an excuse to get the gang back together to do a thing while hijinks happen and we learn a little bit more about Suguha. She then gets sidelined because, remember, Kirito’s the main character, not Suguha. What, are you stupid?

These excursions are mildly cute at best but are otherwise drier than a desert. It honestly feels like they didn’t want to make 2 episode-length OVAs so these 20-ish minute pool and Alphein mini-stories get this shitty, awkward recap attached to turn this thing into a feature-length “movie” that’s treated like a special. There’s no other reason I can see for this when either way, this is a blatant attempt to tie fans over while they wait for SAO II to come out.

SAO was never good with its characters, and this is no different. Barring Kirito really not wanting to be interviewed by and being agitated by a guy in a suit who will be a mainstay in the series, Everyone’s about the same as always. Kirito’s a boring lead, Asuna is a lame tsundere in a relationship with Kirito, SIlica's a flat-chested bubbly girl who loves Kirito, etc. etc. Actually, Asuna drops the tsundere act altogether and becomes a milquetoast nice girl that’s somehow even more dull than before. Now that Suguha’s done with her arc from Alphein, she’s left to be a boring girl who hasn’t gotten over Kirito. Don’t worry, this won’t be relevant or be its own arc for her, moving forward. The special also damages the one character I actually liked, that being Lisbeth, or “Rika” as she’s known IRL. Sure, she retains some of her smug snark factor, but having her only be there to tease people and then squeeze Suguha’s tits and contrast hers with the nonexistent cups Silica --or Keiko because real life-- has, like the perv this recap reveals her to be, is eye-rolling. The finale of SAO 1 already reversed her only character arc, so I guess it’s no surprise that he one female character who didn’t just feel like a trope or a mess of awkwardly-handled drama ideas gets turned into the pervert with tits trope LNs are somewhat fond of. Klein’s been relegated to a similar role, that being another pervy comic relief character like he sometimes was in the show itself, At least that makes more sense, even if it’s similarly annoying. Oh, and all of the character arcs outside of Suguha's are cut out, too, which makes sense for a recap, I suppose, but nonetheless adds to how pointless this damn special was. Poor Agil wasn’t even mentioned in the recap before being thrust into the last 20 minutes…

The last thing to touch on is the audiovisuals. There are a couple of decent new tracks snuck into the recap as well as in the new scenes proper. The ED, ""Niji no Oto"" by Eir Aoi, is a solid song despite not being as good as OP 2, which is turned into an extended insert song for this special. Some tracks somehow still feel reused despite the recap sometimes taking liberties with the show’s music, but I need to at least try to list some positives, don’t I? Meanwhile, the visuals are as decidedly mediocre as in the TV show. There are a couple of decent action cuts, but the action is still somewhat stilted and the drawing quality is somewhat inconsistent. The environments are also less interesting than in many portions of the show. Perhaps this isn’t considered a movie because this would be pitiful by animated film standards when it’s already on the level of a middling, inconsistent, television production.

I guess the one advantage this film/special has outside of the fact that it doesn't have a new sexual assault scene is that it's about ⅙ the length of your average SAO season at almost 2 hours. However, it doesn't really matter when it's almost 6 times less entertaining than a frustrating mess of a series that's only good when you're looking for a gateway title and don't know any of the technical aspects behind animation, directing, or storytelling because you’re 14 years old! When the highlight of your special is the first OP of season 1, you might as well scrap the whole damn thing. At best, Sword Art Online: Extra Edition is background movie fodder. Still, there are way better options in terms of films you leave on as white noise. It would have seriously been better as a 2-episode filler OVA tackling side-stories. It would’ve been droll, regardless, but that’s still better than being shackled to a broken recap of a terrible series. Anyone could have told you that, though. The idea of SAO being bad has sadly been treated as somewhat of an axiom by the community at large, after all."

""Live in the moment""
""Make the most of your present""
We all hear these quotes, something about our precious time, something about the limit of life. But it just feels impossible, that no matter how much I laugh, cry or feel; there's always a regret that pains me, there's always something in the future that frightens me.

If there's one thing Kaoru Touno regrets the most, is his last words to his little sister, ""I hate you too"".  He suffers over the fact that his little sister died while trying to catch a beetle for her brother. If there's one thing Anzu Hanashiro fears the most, is being not talented. Not talented enough to become a manga artist, not able to fulfill her deceased grandpa's dream. But they find a tunnel that's rumoured to grant any wish, in exchange for their now, their present. So they decide to work together and enter the tunnel, but the tunnel is its own world, with its own rules of time and space. They waste their present together, chasing in the tunnel to make their wishes come true. Touno, to get over his past and Hanashiro, to get a future. Both of them sympathize with each other's struggles, in the time they wasted together, forming a bond together.

This is a story about these two characters; one who's coming to terms with his past and one who's finding a future to fulfill her grandpa's dream. The tunnel is a labyrinth where time runs slower than the outside world. Our characters go inside the tunnel for their past and/or future, but one thing they ignore is that, spending too much past or future makes you forgot about the present. While we are hung up on our dreams and mistakes, the world around us moves away. And it can never be bought back.

The cute romance takes the spotlight, but the movie is too short to give a fleshed out development for its characters. As for the visuals, studio CLAP really did well. Every scene including the tunnel is mesmerizing. The music and songs are alright. I only wish the movie was a bit longer and gave more screen time elaborating their struggles.
I think this is a good movie. Though I wish it did a bit better at a few elements, it is about a boy coming to terms with his regrets of past and a girl finding the courage to overcome her fear of future. And the present they found together.

I think it's hard to live in the present, when so much of our past & future, define and is defined by this moment. When the way we lived and the path we chose define us; but it's more important to realize that this moment will never come back. We can never live in the past, and we never know if we live in the future.

12477,"Patema Inverted is an interesting film to say the least. It had its ups and its downs, twists and turns,  though overall it was a good film. Mind-bending at times but that's what made it so great. I don’t do scoring for categories like stories, characters, and stuff but instead I just say what I enjoyed and what I didn’t. 

Spoilers throughout so if you haven’t seen the film I recommend watching it first or just scroll all the way down for a TL;DR with no spoilers.

Patema Inverted is a film about a young girl named Patema who one day travels to what is called the “danger zone” and drops her backpack getting caught on a fence. A boy named Eiji sees this backpack but something isn’t right. As Patema goes to grab her backpack we see that she in fact has her gravity inverted from Eiji.

I love this premise and the world building of Patema Inverted helps to heighten that. Immediately we see how different the world Patema has lived in and the surface world of Aiga is. When Patema goes to grab her backpack she slips having to rely on Eiji to help her. When they grab onto each other we see that Eiji is actually able to get airtime because Patema is counterbalancing his weight with her own gravity. Eiji, an Aigan, is taught in school that people like Patema, the Inverted people, are sinners who will be eaten by the sky. Because of this Patema thinks that Eiji is going to do harmful things to her since he’s inverted in her perspective. I just love this idea of literal opposite perspectives as the conflict of the film, it's much different from the stereotypical villain or natural disaster occuring as a conflict and it's a breath of fresh air to say the least.

I also loved the camera work for a lack of better words. The way the animators created certain scenes were amazing. One scene in particular I absolutely loved. After Patema and Eiji grab onto each other, our perspective rotates to see the bright sun in the background with Patema and Eiji inverted from each other. This and other rotating scenes in the film made it so confusing yet spectacular to watch at the same time. When we are on the surface world in our perspective Eiji is normal and is walking on the floor while Patema is walking on the ceiling, but when we go down to where the Inverted live the camera is flipped so that the Inverted seem normal and instead Eiji is the one walking on the ceiling. These touches to the film to make us see the world in the way that Eiji and Patema do are what I absolutely adore.

img3000()

Now as good as the world building and the animation is, there's something the film doesn’t build, the characters. The film shows a few scenes of backstory about our MCs throughout the movie but nothing too in-depth. The film mentions someone named Lagos who is apparently an important person to Patema. For the majority of the film we barely know anything about him besides his name and he has traveled to the surface world. The film also mentions Eiji’s dad tried to fly into the sky with what looks to be a mechanical air balloon but then was shot and fell out of it. In addition to these two supporting characters which basically provide us with nothing, the film doesn’t give us much information about Patema or Eiji so it is so hard to get attached to them. We don’t even get the main antagonists name throughout the whole movie.



TL;DR :
The idea, conflict, and animation of the film is great, however I found the characters extremely hollow and not flushed out whatsoever. Overall a good experience and a film I recommend watching if you want your mind boggled."
99693,"Persona is one of my favorite game series out there. It's stylish, musically incredible, and most importantly, it has fantastic characters and stories to tell. I've recently been on another Persona kick since I've been playing through Persona 4 Golden on Steam, which prompted me to do the unthinkable: pick up Persona 5 the Animation from my paused list. While I can safely say that Persona 5 is the superior Persona in my mind, the animation just failed to actually capture why it was that much better: its style. Persona 5 is a game that sits you down and slaps you back and forth with stylish menu after stylish menu, but don't get me wrong, that's not all the game does well. It's well animated, the characters are good (even if they don't have the same kind of group closeness as in Persona 4), the day to day life is engaging, the combat is incredibly engaging, the villains are detestable, but not entirely cartoon villains, and the music absolutely slaps. Personally, I'd say Persona 5 the Animation captures maybe one and a half of these points which I'll explain as we go.

By far the biggest detractor from Persona 5 the Animation is the visuals. I mean just look at this travesty:
img(
It's not like this kind of thing was rare, either. It would be terribly animated or drawn constantly. I mean, just compare it to the in-game cutscenes and you'll get an idea of just how much a step down this was from even that. (Game on the left and anime on the right)
img()
It's such an obvious step down that it's actually kind of embarrassing for A-1 to release something of this quality publicly. Even the easiest scene for them to recreate, the All-Out Attack, was butchered by their 'anime'd' version of the end card which looks cheap and uninspired compared to the brilliantly expressive All-Out Attack cards from the game. The animation did so little right in the style department that they would have been better off ditching the idea of trying to replicate the game's flamboyant style and going for something completely different and unique that would work for a medium that's far less interactive than a video game.

Sound design is fair in the animation. They reuse a lot of the same music and sound effects, so automatically that elevates the audio side of things, but otherwise there's nothing too remarkably new about Persona 5 the Animation's sound. The only good new song that came from this is Break in to Break Out, the first opening which is an a banger of the highest degree. Everything else, the endings and second opening, are kinda meh. P5A could have used a dub a lot earlier, in my opinion. I realize that one got announced for October of this year, but it would have done it a lot of good in the west if we could have heard these characters in the language that most of us played the game in, because, lets be honest, most people who are watching this came from the game.

Favorite Character: Ann Takamaki
img(

I'm going to come clean first and admit that I haven't played Royal yet, I'm kinda waiting until after I beat Persona 3 and 4, but I have to say, Kasumi might take this spot. Having said that, I love each and every character in this game, but you know me, I have to pick a best girl and it's most of the time the blonde girl. I'd like to take the time to say that I absolutely hate the Persona 5 fandom when it comes to the dating scene in the game/anime. It gets so elitist and nasty that if you say that anyone but Makoto is the best romance option you get absolutely toasted. Kinda makes me dislike Makoto just because of those people, even if I do like her as a character. Having said all of that, both in the game and anime, the most magical scene in the show always has to be when you meet Ann for the first time in the rain. That scene is beautiful and captivating in such a enamoring way that I fall in love with Ann and her character arc immediately after watching it.

Something that I wish P5A had done was actually give Joker a personality. No one is controlling him, why not let him actually talk and seem like a real person? P4A already does this better and I'm only 5 episodes in. Narukami vs. Joker is like comparing a real person to a cardboard cutout if we're comparing their anime personalities. It annoyed me in the game too, because I thought that they could have had Joker talk a lot more and not have it break the 'insert character' mold, but still give him some life of his own. Also Akira Kurusu > Ren Amamiya.

I'm having a hard time saying that I'd recommend P5A at all, because if you're not looking for a nostalgia trip, it's not really worth watching. It doesn't provide anything extra to the game experience, which is entirely disappointing and there's not a lot here to attract any non-game viewers because all I'd say to those people is to just play the game for a much fuller and fulfilling experience. There's a lot of watering down sections and not a lot that they improved upon, except for maybe giving Haru some more spotlight. I do have to say that the way they ended the main series was a banger of an ending, but having to slog through two hour long OVA's afterward wasn't entirely a great time, though the Valentine's Day special was absolutely phenomenal and a really creative way to give the viewers the romance ending of their 'choice'. Though, all it made me want is a romance option with Sae, who is low key a contender for best girl.
 
Honestly, I had fun watching P5A, even if objectively, it wasn't that good. It was really enjoyable to relive the game in an abridged version and re-watch some of my favorite moments and, once again, revisit the Phantom Thieves who I hold so dear. I hope to do it again in Royal sometime soon, but until then, this will have to do."

Story - 7

The Duke of Death and His Maid story revolve around Bocchan (the duke) and his maid Alice. Bocchan is infected with a curse where any living thing he touches withers and dies. Therefore his family kicked him away to live in another mansion with his butler and maid.

Bocchan slowly develops a romantic feeling for Alice but due to his curse, he cannot touch the one he loves. Therefore he makes up his mind to break the curse he got.



The story summary seems like a heavy topic theme but this is a light-hearted show. Things like the pain of not being able to touch a living thing or someone you love, the hatred of your own mum who abandoned you, being shunned and feared by friends, or the feeling of loneliness are present in the story but handle in a way that won't drag you down to the depth of despair.

Half of the story is about Alice teasing Bocchan much like ""Teasing Master Takagi-san"" but, the difference is Alice tease Bocchan in a flirty and sexual way to get a reaction out of him or to bring him to his limit.

The other half is a good mix of Bocchan dealing with his sibling, having fun with Alice and his new friends, or dealing with an event that happens around his mansion.

Of cause, the curse part is not forgotten (even if it doesn't progress much) in between all the fun, comedy and being tested. Bocchan still tries to find a way to break it. He even went to a witch gathering ground in hope of finding a solution and Alice also tries her best to find a clue on who might have put the curse on her young master.



There are also a lot of scenes where Bocchan and Alice should have held hand or kiss but they cannot due to the curse which most of the time end on a funny note but there is one scene that makes me sad where they only end up holding hand in a dream.

The teasing may be in a flirty and sexual way but the show also managed to pull off a lot of wholesome moments too. Some of the teasing methods do become overused in the show but there are still plenty of scenes that make me grin.

The Duke of Death is getting a season 2 and I am kind of looking forward to it, hopefully, the story moves forward more than it is in season 1 which doesn’t get anywhere significant on the curse front.

Character - 7

I really like the characters in this show even though the bulk of the development goes into Bocchan and Alice. The characters are also what make up most of the story for this anime.



Bocchan is the main guy for this anime. He has a kind and gentlemanly personality but is very prone to be teased by Alice. Bocchan also gets a proper backstory about his curse, how he was treated and how Alice bring him back out of the darkness.

Alice is Bocchan personal maid who often has fun teasing Bocchan in a flirty and sexual way but she is also sweet and wholesome when the time calls for it. Alice can be seen putting Bocchan feelings first and trust Bocchan immensely.



The character interacting between Bocchan and Alice is just priceless, it is funny and wholesome. Bocchan slowly opens up his feeling for Alice and it is obvious Alice loves him too but they are not officially labeled couples yet.

Another character I like is Rob. A supporting character in this show. He is very gentlemanly but when he is pissed off, he will chase you around with a smile while trying to correct you.

Zain and Caph are also interesting pairs. Both are them are wizards and witches who Bocchan befriended. Unlike Bocchan and Alice, both of them seem to have a feeling for each other but never let each other know.

Art & Animation - 6.5

The art is a mix of CG and 2D art. CG done right can look nice but The Duke of Death and His Maid’s CG is not exactly on that kind of CG level but it is alright.

The characters are done in CG and they look unique and have their own charm. The problem would be some of the awkward animations these characters do from time to time and sometimes the animation can look laggy. 



The background captures the vibe of victorian era style perfectly from the colour usage to the detail of the objects. The background also has a painted on canvas look and the quality is consistent throughout the show. 

The number of background objects is sparse but I think it is accurate of that era especially all those huge mansions back in those times.

Sound - 7.5

The opening song sounds fun and lively while the ending song also sounds catchy but more serious with a hint of somber. Both songs really suit the anime and I especially love the ending song.

Most of the background musics are done using piano since Bocchan himself play the piano in the anime. Other classical instruments like the violin are also used.

The background music captures the moment of the scene perfectly be it sounding classy, sad, clumsy, or lively. For example, one of the music Bocchan plays when he visits the town totally captures the festival vibe of the old victorian era.

As much as the background music sounds nice and fits the scene perfectly, they are not particularly memorable. I forgot about most of them when the show ended. It is more of the type of music that makes you feel immersed while you are watching the anime.



The voice acting is also very fitting for the characters. Alice especially has a flirty and charming voice but at the same time can sound sweet depending on the scene. Bocchan also has a fitting voice for his personality and sound believable especially when he panic from Alice teasing him.

TLDR:
Teasing Master Takagi-san but in victorian era time with a twist of MC being cursed. The art is good if you can grow on the CG character and the music match the theme perfectly."
467,"TL;DRs INCLUDED WHERE NEEDED.

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (which I'll just refer to as SAC) is an exemplary cyberpunk tale which reminds us of why we fell in love with the genre in the first place. With its beautiful aesthetics well ahead of its time coupled with the deep messages it offers that always resonate within us, not only has it stood its place as the high point for the GitS franchise, but also for the entire genre. Before I dive into what makes this show so special, I'll provide an FAQ.

>Do I need to watch the original movie to understand the plot?

No. Many say that you must watch the original 1995 movie to appreciate the series, but I'd argue the opposite. SAC is a great entry point for newcomers and is an entirely self-contained story. The original's pacing is quite slow and it emphasizes more on the philosophical aspects. While it is by no means bad (in fact, I rate it a solid 10/10), it tends to bore off some viewers. SAC serves to satisfy all your action and philosophical cravings, therefore it is more suited for a wider audience. If you thoroughly enjoy SAC, then I recommend you watch the original 1995 movie. Also, we don't talk about the live-action remake.

TL;DR: No.

>I've not seen many philosophy-heavy anime. Can I watch this?

Yes. Although this show does not hold your hand, it's very comprehensible given that you pay more attention to the plot than your average anime.

>Sub or dub?

Both are great. Although I prefer watching dub for serious shows so I'm biased towards it.

>Will my IQ increase after watching this?

Ehhhhhh... sure?

Quite a few people have already reviewed it so I'll keep it as brief as possible while providing information geared more towards newcomers to the franchise and those who haven't had much exposure to science-fiction as a genre, especially cyberpunk.

It's hard to describe. Some, including me, call it a genre but others call it a culture. This causes a lot of confusion so I'll give you a concrete answer. It is a style and a medium of themes. Cyberpunk stories are usually set in the near-future in large oppressive cities reminiscent of Hong Kong streets. But just because a story is set in a futuristic city doesn't necessarily make it cyberpunk. This is where it acts as a medium of themes. Cyberpunk delivers messages relating to the interactions and relationships between humans, technology, and society.

TL;DR: Stories which involve how humans adapt and react to technology and society.

The [opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxkMzn4et2U) is entirely in CGI so love it or hate it, but most agree that the song is absolutely beautiful. Read the comments if you don't believe me. Seriously, go watch it.

It's really hard to believe this show was made in 2002. It happens to look better than most anime today. It captures the cyberpunk aesthetic nicely with its huge sprawling city along with oppressive yet beautiful and vivid lights and skyscrapers. [Check out the opening scene for the first episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po7FsOATd0g)
While on the topic of visuals, let's talk about CGI. It's used quite often in this anime but trust me, it's done really well. Unfortunately, CGI has a bad reputation for sticking out like a tornado in a cornfield and just looking ugly in general. That is not the case here. I'll leave it up to you to decide what you think of the CGI, but I guarantee you it will not hinder your enjoyment.

TL;DR: Beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic with a frequent use of well-crafted CGI.

The GitS franchise is known for its unique music, which mixes traditional sounds with modern electronic beats. Take the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RsE8Q789o) of the clip provided in the previous section for example. The philosophy of the shrinking dichotomy between humans and machines is reflected in the soundtrack, with the traditional instruments and vocals representing human nature and the electronic beats representing, well, machines.
The soundtrack never failed to amaze and immerse me in the plot. It's always refreshing to hear music that's not a generic orchestral score.

TL;DR: [Music from the clip above.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RsE8Q789o) It succeeds in reflecting the central theme of the anime of the blurring lines between man and machine.

Word of advice, don't google the plot-points you don't understand or check the wiki as there are a lot of spoilers. The episodes of SAC are divided into Stand Alone (SA) and Complex (C). SA episodes are self-contained stories whereas C episodes contribute to the main arc following the mysterious Laughing Man. Without spoilers, it's really difficult to highlight the ingenuity of both, the SA stories and the main arc. Antagonists are unique and seldom bland. They have well-defined and developed motives.
My only real complaint with the plot is how repetitive the process watching Section 9 solve crimes becomes. It usually just boils down to hacking to find the criminals' coordinates, confronting them, fighting them, and taking them into custody. Although SAC tries to make the process interesting by making the crimes affect one of the members at a personal level due to their circumstances/past each time, it's always superficial and doesn't really change the characters in the long run, or beyond the episode for that matter. 
Where SAC really shines is in its C episodes, which center around the Laughing Man incident. It's an engaging mystery and the show invites the viewers to try and solve the case themselves too, as they know as little about it as Section 9 up until a certain point. But even then, the case isn't completely solved, allowing for further investigation. Of course, it is completely possible to just watch the show without trying to solve the case.
All in all, the main arc is one of the best stories I have experienced, not just in anime, but in storytelling as a whole.

TL;DR: Main story arc is amazing. Stand alone episodes are great but get repetitive near the end.

This is where the anime lacks, but that's okay. The superior second season, 2nd Gig, accomplishes that. SAC serves to convey its philosophical ideas and establish the setting, all while providing an entertaining story-line.

The ratings I give on my profile page are different from the scores I give in my public reviews. My ratings in the former are purely based on MY enjoyment whereas the scores in my public reviews are more critical in nature and a result of considering various factors.

95/100
The only thing stopping this anime from receiving a perfect 100 is its weak character development. Looking past that, this anime provides an entertaining main story arc with fun little stand alone episodes that give life to the cyberpunk world of GitS.

Note: This is my first review. Feel free to object and offer advice on improving."
104459,"I love watching anime. I have a deep passion for watching, discussing and critiquing anime. Nuancing my opinions, sharing love for shows and discovering new experiences is what keeps me continuing to watch anime. It is a passion that is hard to really express to people who don’t watch anime, but I sure try to share that deep-rooted passion with others who are willing to listen. I can see this sort of passion in Yuru Camp.

Yuru Camp is a show that means a lot to me. Back in 2018 Yuru Camp was one of the first anime that I watched and I loved every second of it. I listened to the soundtrack on repeat, I tried to let my friends watch it, you could almost say I was obsessed with it. But as the years went by and I watched more and more anime, I started to forget that love that I had for YuruCamp. Now that Yuru Camp season 2 is done, I did not only relive that feeling of love for the anime that I forgot for a time, but also have that love amplified by a thousand. I fucking love Yuru Camp, and there are so many reasons why.

Firstly, the anime is just genuinely great. It is Iyashikei at its best. With a simple premise as “Girls go camping”, the anime really gets a lot out of it. It not only shows multiple ways how to camp, but also shows the dangers that come with it and the extra work you have to do for certain trips. The creators of these anime definitely know what camping takes and you see that back in the anime.

The characters are great too. Rin and Nadeshiko are the definite highlights of the cast. Both have amazing designs and personalities that work well off each other. Rin, the cold but sweet camping fanatic, interacting with Nadeshiko, a bowl of marshmallows and hot chocolate, are some of the best moments of the show. The rest of the character cast is not as strong but still really enjoyable. Aoi is a nice onee-san type that loves to tease others. Ena might not have much as a personality but she compliments Rin well and her dog is adorable. Chiaki is probably the weakest character with how she is often a comedic relief and her comedy tends to have lots of hits & misses, but she still has some great moments. The rest of the characters are mostly made up of chill adults. What makes this character cast work so well is that these friendships feel real. They joke with each other, but also look out for each other and help each other when needed too. They don’t suddenly fall in love, they don’t have exaggerated manners, they don’t go through significant emotional arcs, they are all friends/family that bond over love for camping.

What really sells this anime for me and loads of other people are the production values. The art of this anime is gorgeous. The animation may not be impressive, but the character designs are great and the backgrounds are jaw dropping. Some of the composition also enhances the experience a ton. One of the best things about this anime is the OST. This OST makes me melt into my chair of comfort. It is quiet and meaningful when it needs to, jolly and upbeat when the scene is funny and during down times the relaxing sounds of string instruments make you feel at ease. Even if you decide to not watch the anime after reading this review, please just listen to the OST on Youtube. It is amazing.

Those aspects are already great, but after watching all 25 episodes of this anime, I finally realised why this anime means a lot to me: the way it conveys its passion for camping. I am not a camper and the times I have camped have all been a mixed experience, but I can still feel what joys camping can bring in this anime.

Without any lazy running gags, without any distracting drama, without any sort of moe yuri-bait, this anime shows that camping is about enjoying the quiet beautiful nature. Reading a book while eating self-made dinner in the cold is a healing experience that is hard to get anywhere else, but camping isn’t just solo. You can share this experience with multiple people. With that, even if you screw up, you screw up together and fix things together. Watching the sunset go down or staring at the night sky full of stars becomes an experience you can share with the ones you camp, an unique experience you then only have with those ones.

I mentioned that I have a deep-rooted passion for watching anime, but it is a hard passion to really share with others. While not really that equivalent, camping is also not a hobby that is easy for people to really get, but this anime knows how to let people get what camping is all about by combining all these amazing elements I mentioned previously in a passion-filled 24 minutes 25 episodes total. Watching people that I love doing things that they love in a fashion that doesn’t challenge me and just wants me to have a good time is an amazing healing experience. This experience especially hits hard after going through an exhausting 2020 which brought me enormous distress and loss of motivation, so the comfort of an anime about people doing what they love brought genuine tears to my eyes with the first episode of season 2.

Also, regarding how season 2 compares to season 1, from my perspective, I think it improves enough on things to make it a great second season. With how in season 1 introduced the characters and the setting, this second season now puts its focus on the girls going camping instead of learning and preparing for it. You also see some genuine progression in the series: In season 1 most of the girls were really amateur and had to discover a lot of things, and now in season 2 they already are more experienced and you see that by seeing them enjoy camping more instead of having to deal with the difficulties of it (but don’t worry, there is still a good amount of problem solving in season 2). It is also nice to see the relationships between characters thicken: They get more comfortable with each other and can comment more on each other's personalities. 

I fucking love Yuru Camp. It is an anime that I can recommend with all my soul, especially after how heavy 2020 was. 

So yeah, watch Yuru Camp you dingus."
145260,"I might struggle to get to the 2200 character minimum for this review. You can only say so much about these types of shows and almost everything you can say has been said already. I have seen way to many of this exact type of show. This is where I have to concede that these kinds of shows are my guilty pleasure. A common thing for this genre and this type of show in general is that its very easy to watch. 

Having seen dozens of them, let me start out by giving a basic layout of every single one goes.
- Average dude (ages vary from 16-20) gets isekai'd into a generic fantasy world. 
- Is given or gets a very special power (Usually says it in the title of the show). 
- Joins a guild in a pleasant town. Goes on adventures, gaining girls along the way.
- Faces moderate threats early on, but quickly becomes so OP that any stakes are gone. 

Almost all of these anime are adapted from Light Novels. They all also have one or two gimmicks. The first is always the power they have, in this case its summoning. If there is another gimmick its usually to do with the world. Whether it be a quirky magic system or extra mechanic and in the case of this show its the found family aspect of the cast. The main character is either an anti hero or paragon with very little deviation. Because of this, I lable isekai where the MC is a monster or the ""villain"" as different enough to not be included. That idea isn't as overused and still is being explored.




First off, this show isn't bad, but its closer to medicore than good which is probably the worst thing an anime can be. This show like the dozens before it will be forgetten about by the end of the season. This show is not worth being remembered. It will make a great one day binge watch for someone craving a power fantasy anime and not much else.

My score for this show is gonna be a 55. As I said in the previous paragraph, its very close to painfully mediocre. 50 is average on my scale.

I was talking to friends while watching this show and said to them, ""I hope this show isn't pro slavery, I hate when isekais do that."" A week passes and I am watching the new episode and halfway through I say to myself, ""Damn... another pro slavery isekai.""
Black Summoner has decent characters, a kinda interesting world, and the plot is engaging enough to not lose you. This show has potential as most of these kinds of shows do, but it moves on from world building or character moments way to fast for anything to truly matter. Yes, you've established the major kingdoms, but have not given us a reason to care about any of them. 12 episodes gives roughly 4 hours worth of time to tell a story, but I don't blame the production team or studio. Light Novels are written so that you get to the big action scene or harem scene as quickly as possible. Threats are established then the MC comes into conflict with them. 
Its so hard to talk about Black Summmoner alone as its own thing, because its not trying to be its own thing. One of the worst things about the show is that slavery, yes the buying, selling, and forced labor of humans/humanoids, is treated as fine. 
!This creates an insance conflict of themes and morals when the MC buys a slave and thanks the slave seller, but then stops a gang of bad guys who were doing the slave trade. The MC fights slavers with the help of his own slave.!
But even this isn't unique to the show, 1 out of every 5 of these trashy isekais will have this exact same attitude towards slavery. It makes the show worse, because this show is generally very light hearted so when the tone doesn't shift for slavery its a whiplash to the viewer. I don't care that in japan they aren't taught about slavery and so its much less of a cultural taboo, it doesn't change how universally wrong slavery is. You can have dark and taboo things in media and do it well, this show is does not do it well. 
Black Summoner is a trashy generic power fantasy isekai with some neat ideas and a generally likeable main cast. Its a great popcorn anime to binge when you are bored. It has almost no merit outside of this however and there are dozens of isekai with similar set ups and premises that do a lot more."

I haven’t cried so much within one hour for a long time. Look Back was, in many ways, a truly special experience.


Wanted to touch on that briefly - My theater experience was very good. They did show additional staff interviews at the end which were great and very insightful. That should be a staple for movies in my opinion, I love hearing the creators talk about why they decided to make a movie this way and what the intention behind various aspects of a work is. The whole theater also was relatively quiet which helped with the immersion. I also liked that we all clapped together at the end, I thought I would be the only one to do it but it was nice to see that there is widespread appreciation for a work like this.


When I watched Look Back, I couldn’t help but cry not only because it’s an emotional story, but also because it’s portrayed in a way that felt like it just oozed love for the art of animation itself. The characters are drawn in a loose fashion that allows a lot of expression and human nuances in their behavior, the animation is constantly on the move, not caring much about being polished but giving life to what we see on the screen. In the staff interview after the movie the director Kiyotaka Oshiyama also went into how they tried to not polish and clean up the drawings too much to show the human element in them, such as sketches, intention behind lines, and so on, and it shows. The visuals themselves seem to be very much “alive”, and I honestly don’t know if I can describe it better than that and it might only make sense when you see the movie for yourself. This sentiment of being “alive” also carried over in other departments, with the voice acting being not too shy to be more natural than what you normally see in anime and the soundtrack helped to enhance the immersion as well with a lot of bittersweet piano melodies that helped to take in the full picture. I also love the color design in the movie, it reminds me in a very good way of Western comics such as “On a Sunbeam”.

The movie also resonated with me personally due to me currently trying to get better at animating and having spent a good chunk of my life doing that and drawing in general. There are a lot of moments that are simply very relatable, such as Fujino getting too arrogant because of the praise of her classmates, or celebrating in the rain with weird body movements after giving Kyomoto an autograph. The movie also captures the framing of the original work by only showing Fujino’s back when she draws, and how she continuously springs forward with her ambitions without giving herself time to breathe and properly “look back”. It was only when Kyomoto died and she saw Kyomoto’s room, that she realized that she drew all the time because she loved seeing Kyomoto reading her manga. It’s a message especially powerful if you can resonate with the struggle of drawing or animating. It can be not very fun at times, and you constantly feel down because you can’t help but compare yourselves to others who do much better than you do. At times you feel like giving up, but at other times, you just keep drawing. But at the end of the day, there needs to be some reason to keep drawing, even if it’s trivial. The movie not only conveys this idea really well but it felt like it also asked me as a viewer to “look back”. While I am still in the process of doing so, I can say that I started seriously considering animation after someone here on Anilist told me to try - so yeah, as I said, it can be a trivial reason.

In the end of the day, “Look Back” truly was beyond what I ever could’ve hoped. The director also asked for his movie to be watched again in a few years with the technological breakthroughs happening at the moment, so we can once again “look back”. And I think it will be very interesting to do so because this movie truly celebrates the art made by humans. There is intention, emotion, and purpose behind what artists do which can’t be replicated by an AI that only can copy learned patterns. Thank you Tatsuki Fujimoto for creating this wonderful story and thank you Kiyotaka Oshiyama for a wonderful adaptation of a wonderful story. I can’t wait to watch it again.

Guess who's back.

Back again.

Pockey's back.

Tell a friend.

As you may have noticed, I've decided to be a bit more selective with the animanga I review. This poses the question: why this?

Well, dear reader, for good two months, I felt like an utter sack of shit. Neither watching nor reviewing anime were anywhere near the top of my priorities.  Now, I've recently started the next installment of [a beloved series](https://anilist.co/anime/3572/Macross-Frontier), I'm considering finally getting around to watching more Gundam, and I'm gearing up for a pretty packed summer. What connects these two moments was the show I'm reviewing now, Love After World Domination.

World After World Domination centers on Fudo, the leader of the sentai-esque group known as Gelato 5, and Desumi, a general of a supervillain group with aims of world domination — Gekko. As per their positions, Fudo and Desumi are sworn enemies, destined to do battle time and time again, gaining and losing ground in the eternal battle of good vs. evil. In short, it makes date night a bit awkward. Because unbeknownst to Gelato 5 nor Gekko, Desumi and Fudo are dating. The show is focused on the couple's attempts to keep their forbidden romance under wraps and the shenanigans that ensue. We watch as Desumi and Fudo sneak away from fights to hang out, don disguises during downtime to go on dates, and help one another deal with the pressures of their careers. 

While the premise is certainly interesting, it's not phenomenal. On paper, Love After World Domination is a cute romcom, nothing more, nothing less. But the magic is in the execution. None of the parts that make up Love After World Domination are exceptional, but they're each lovely enough to make a very pleasant whole. 



Take something as simple as Desumi and Fudo's relationship. Our two leads are established as a couple in the first episode, sparing us the agony of watching countless episodes of people we know will get together and make piecemeal progress towards a foregone conclusion. 

Like an infomercial, I'm here to tell you, ""but wait, there's more!"" Love After World Domination not only treats us to an established relationship, but it treats us with a well-written established relationship. Too often, romantic comedies derive their conflict from misunderstandings that are intended to be comedic but come across as anything but. These misunderstandings generally pit the two leads against one another [until they actually talk things out at the end of the episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills). Thanks to the show's premise, this frustrating trope isn't possible here. By and large, Fudo and Desumi must juggle their love lives on top of their duties to make sure their respective groups don't catch wind of their relationship. Ergo, the conflicts are largely external instead of internal, necessitating the need to work together to overcome their problems. While it might not sound like much, this really goes a long way in helping me believe that these two people can function as a couple. There are several instances where we look to be heading in tropey, cliche direction (such as an episode in which someone attempts to make it seem as though Fudo is cheating on Desumi), only for our leads to actually communicate with one another, diffusing the situation. It's not only a breathof fresh air, but it's executed in such a way that gives the show a subtle swagger — it knows it's a breath of fresh air.



The nature of the conflict and how it relates to Desumi and Fudo's relationship also goes a long way in creating jokes that are actually funny. I can't help but laugh when Desumi and Fudo are in some abandoned building having a loving chat, only for Desumi to begin beating him senseless for show as their comrades find them. Is it silly? For sure, but rom coms are supposed to be silly. It's all about creating comedy in a way that doesn't hurt the romance, and Love After World Domination succeeds. 

But don't go thinking it's all fluff. Believe it or not, amidst this lighthearted comedy, we do get some fairly poignant bits of internal struggle. Take episode six, for example. In it, Desumi is offered the chance to turn into a monster, which would make her stronger. Desumi not wanting to turn into a monster is obviously a metaphor for not wanting a promotion. The show handles this well, too. Yeah, you know a mile away that she isn't going to go for it, but the beauty is the reason why. Another show would frame her decision to not get the promotion exclusively as wanting to stay with her boyfriend, here the fact that she wouldn't be able to partake in her interests — such as painting her nails and knitting — is the core reason why she declines the transformation.



The final point of praise I'll heap on the relationship is how organic it feels in terms of development. They become more comfortable with one another in the course of a single-cour anime and this feels huge. Plus, they're actually affectionate toward one another instead of practically dying of embarrassment when they brush shoulders.

The characters themselves aren't terribly deep, but they work well enough for the show they're in. Speaking of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised by how much focus some of the secondary characters received. 

That said, the focus could definitely be lopsided, with Desumi's allies getting more focus than Fudo's. In fact, I'd say Desumi's side was given more spotlight as a whole. Her organization is more fleshed out than Fudo's and Fudo is often helping her more than vice-versa. It's nice seeing him help get her out of her shell, but if there's a second season, I'd hope we get to see more of a balance.

The most contentious element of this show is probably the fanservice. Desumi has a sexualized outfit, complete with a garterbelt and plenty of skin. It definitely errs towards NSFW but, I don't know, I found it tasteful, all things considered? The camera work itself is rarely leery, feeling less like she's made to be gazed upon by a salivating outfit and more she's just a woman who happens to have an appealing outfit. Your mileage will obviously vary. I've become desensitized to fanservice and I've been called a pervert for liking her outfit 
 ¯\\(ツ)/¯

All in all, this is a cute show that can back up its heart with wit. Love After World Domination probably won't blow you away, but it might just surprise you, and if you're anything like me, it'll be good enough to make you smile.

21626,"Handsome teenage calligrapher Sei Handa is worshiped by all his classmates as an aloof superstar–too bad Sei’s inherent negativity and neurotic personality make him believe that everyone actually hates him.

A comedy of errors! It’s so ridiculous, but it knows it’s being ridiculous, I cannot help but love it!

The entire series derives humor from:
1. everyone is impressed by Handa-kun! He’s a notable calligrapher! And handsome! And polite! No matter who you are, you have reasons to believe that Handa-kun is the best at whatever you do–whether you’re the class rep who enjoys class repping, or a thug who likes fighting, etc.

2. Handa, due to an old prank by a friend, believes that everyone hates his guts and interprets literally everything through that lens. He gets nominated to be class rep? Obviously because no one wants to do it so they’ll foist it on him. He gets pushed out of the classroom after school? Sure, they said it’s so he can go focus on his calligraphy, but clearly it’s because they hate being around him!



A note about connections to other things: This 12-episode series is the adaptation of a manga, which was the prequel to a series called Barakamon. Barakamon (which came first) is a comedic slice-of-life following young-adult city-boy Sei Handa who’s been exiled to the countryside to calm his nerves and find inspiration for his calligraphy. (And then there’s culture clashes, the city boy not knowing how to do anything, and found family.) It’s a sweet series with its own humor, but it’s very different from Handa-kun, so if you’re already familiar with Barakamon, this series is much more slapstick. And if you’re not already familiar with Barakamon, you’re probably fine. I read the Handa-kun manga first (before reading or watching anything else), and found it perfectly understandable.

School fan clubs are common in anime, but here we get the Handa Force, a group of 4 classmates who have been inspired by Handa and ¾ of whom believe he’s a genius of unmatched levels.

The fourth member is an average student, who, besides Handa’s one friend who was responsible for making him believe the they-hate-you thing in the first place, is the only student who actually figures out that Handa is just…shy, and nervous and stressed, and that his schoolmates are ascribing motivation that he doesn’t have and are just making Handa’s anxiety worse. And yet, he’s never able to convey this to Handa (or the others) in a way that doesn’t already fit with what they believe, and thus the cycle continues.



It’s a simple gag, but I laughed so much while watching. I loved how it addresses the “why doesn’t someone just explain what’s going on” problem, because if it could be solved that simply, it would just be frustrating to watch. (I hate those sort of communication issues.)

Instead, it’s made obvious: the only person who can really explain is old friend Kawafuji, who intended it as a prank in middle school, but Handa’s innocent spirit believed him so hard he couldn’t take it back. And also, he thinks the whole thing is frikkin hilarious. He’ll explain everything…someday, but for now he’s enjoying the show.

(Handa, for his part, think he’s so unpopular that he refuses to be publicly seen with Kawafuji so Kawafuji won’t suffer by association. This also conveniently means that no one will ask Kawafuji any questions, so nobody is telling lies directly to anyone else, it’s all just everyone going from 0-60 on assumptions.)



There are other characters, but no one has made gifs I can find of the guy whose face almost matches Handa’s and impersonates him for a while, or the athlete who thinks Handa is his nemesis, or the girl who dedicates herself to “erasing” any other girl who dares to get close, or the teacher who gets steadily scruffier as the year goes on…



Verdict

English dub? Yes! They’re all great! I didn’t consciously think about their voices for the entire time I watched, which is good–it means everyone sounded like they fit their character.

Visuals: Light and brightly colored, with good character designs that are distinct enough to make everyone easy to tell apart.

Worth watching? Yes, if you like wacky humor. This was just so ridiculous to me and I liked the predictability that everything would end with everyone having the same ideas (Handa is Great at Everything group vs. Handa’s self-isolation). There was no attempt to make this a deep drama: it set out to be silly, and it did it very well. Plus, at 12 episodes, it doesn’t have time to get stale."
13663,"THIS REVIEW COVERS BOTH DARKNESS AND DARKNESS 2ND

I hated To LOVE-Ru's first season. Hated it. You can read my 20/100 review of it for the complete details, but essentially my complaints boiled down to it having 1) bland characters, 2) a needlessly convoluted filler-filled plot, 3) surprisingly little fanservice.

I was completely shocked, then, to find that To LOVE-Ru Darkness was... actually good?

Yes, to get straight to the point, To LOVE-Ru Darkness is good. And this is not some kind of run-of-the-mill goodness, no, this is genuine article high-quality content.

But wait, before I get too far ahead of myself, let me first clarify exactly what To LOVE-Ru Darkness is and how it differs from the original series. Though its title implies that it is a spinoff, in reality, Darkness (as it shall henceforth be called) is nothing more than an ordinary sequel to the original To LOVE-Ru manga. We need not let this be discouraging, however, because while it may technically be a sequel, Darkness is an entirely different beast from its low-quality predecessor. Though it features a mostly unchanged cast of characters in fairly similar scenarios, it manages nonetheless to be very distinct thanks to its extremely unserious tone, revamped plot, and a small selection of new key characters.


Of these three distinctions, the first—that Darkness is less serious than the original series—may immediately seem the most suspect. After all, while To LOVE-Ru often failed spectacularly to be funny, it was at the very least intended to be a comedy-heavy harem ecchi show. In other words, to begin with, it never had any seriousness to speak of. Even so, Darkness somehow manages to top this. Not only does it not take its plot seriously, it doesn’t take anything about itself seriously. Whereas To LOVE-Ru often felt insecure—as though it kind of wanted to be a fanservice show, but also didn’t really want to offend anybody—Darkness feels like an older and worldlier sibling. It is content to throw all kinds of licentious filth in our faces and not feel the least bit ashamed about it. Though it may be strange to say this of a piece of television, Darkness could best be described as feeling like it has high self-esteem. It is self-aware of the kind of show it is, and rather than letting this get it down, it is completely forthright about it. This is what I mean when I say it feels less serious than its predecessor: it has the ability to not only laugh at its silly characters and plotlines but also to laugh it itself. Of course, if all it did was laugh at its problems rather than addressing them, Darkness would not be much better than the original. But Darkness doesn’t just laugh at its old flaws, to a certain extent, it also embraces them.

In order to really understand this point, it is important to first understand the three main ways a work can approach its problems. The first way—and this is mostly what the first season of To LOVE-Ru does—is to simply ignore them. The major advantage of this method is obviously that it is extremely easy for the creators since they don’t even have to make any meaningful changes to what they were already doing. On the other hand, it also has a major drawback in that, well, it doesn’t actually fix anything. The second, and perhaps most effective, action a creator can take is to buckle down and actively try to diminish the presence of the flaw in their work. Unfortunately, while it sounds very pleasant, going through with this method is rarely all that feasible considering problems usually exist precisely because they are difficult to eliminate. As a result of this difficulty, creators might try the third method of approaching a problem—addressing it without truly ridding their work of it. A common way to achieve this would be through acknowledgment, that is to say, calling attention to the existence of the problem without solving it. Effectively this is the author giving the audience a wink and a nod to show that they are as aware as anyone of the problems their work has. To LOVE-Ru did this from time to time when characters would mention something along the lines of, “Wow, Rito sure falls down on top of girls a lot…” showing us that the writers knew they were overusing that gag but were unwilling to go through the creative strain of coming up with a more inventive way of getting him into sexual situations.

Noticeably, Darkness does not do any of these things. Rather, it employs the rarely used fourth way to approach problems that I mentioned earlier: by embracing them. Utilizing this method requires both subtlety and creativity to prevent the problems from merely being exacerbated, but I firmly believe that Darkness manages to achieve spectacular success. Almost none of the problems from the first season of To LOVE-Ru (and there are many) are really absent in Darkness—instead, they have been retooled to work in the show’s favor. For instance, take a look at some examples below.


1. 

The problem - Out-of-whack romantic progression: Rito regularly gets into sexual situations with random girls, yet at the same time he can’t even muster up the courage to ask out the girl he has had a crush on for 46 episodes.

The expected solution - Have Rito make some kind of romantic progress with his dream girl or at the very least have him show some form of assertiveness.

Darkness's solution - Make the romantic progression so impressively out-of-whack that it no longer bears any comparison with reality. No one can levy any criticism against it when it’s so far removed from anything real that they can’t even properly apply normal logic and reason to it.


2.

The problem - Rito falls on top of girls too frequently: Nearly every episode seems to rely on the same gag where Rito falls on top of a girl and touches them in some vaguely sexual manner, to the point that the joke becomes tired and hackneyed.

The expected solution - Create new gags and new ways of forcing fanservice so that the show doesn’t have to rely on the same thing happening over and over again.

Darkness's solution - Turn Rito into the God of falling—a being whose ability to unintentionally sexually harass others is unparalleled among mere mortals. As Yami astutely observes at one point, “this man’s sexual harassment has reached the level of a superpower.” Rito is no longer a man, he is a fanservice deity.


3.

The problem - Over-reliance on panty shots: Too much of the show’s fanservice consists of little more than contrived situations that lead to the viewer being able to see a girl’s panties for one brief, joyous moment.

The expected solution - …Use fewer panty shots.

Darkness's solution - Bring out the avant-garde camera work. Turn even the most mundane of conversations into a fanservice-fest by angling the camera so that the audience can see up the nearest girl’s skirt. After all, why waste time on a shot that has no fanservice when you can just tilt the camera?


In this way, Darkness feels, more than anything, like a parody of itself. Of course, in order to joke about itself so effectively, it has to be completely self-aware. It knows exactly what it is and what it aspires to be and it announces this fact loudly and proudly at every passing opportunity: “I am a gross affront to taste and decency!” it says. “Behold, fanservice the likes of which you have never seen before!” it proclaims boldly. “I am the very distillation of debauchery in animated form!” it bellows assertively.


While its unserious and parody-like treatment of itself may be wonderful, though, I do think that it would be rather reductive to suggest that the entirety of Darkness’s success comes from these facets. Even on a more conventional level, it puts the original to shame with its more cohesive and engaging plot. Yes, believe it or not, Darkness actually has a plot. Granted, it’s no work of timeless art or anything, but it certainly gets closer to art than I, or indeed, anyone, could reasonably expect the sequel to To LOVE-Ru to get.

On the most basic level, Darkness continues to follow our hapless protagonist, Yuuki Rito. Beyond this, however, it carries few traces of the plot (or lack thereof) present in the original series. Instead, the focus has shifted significantly from Rito and Lala’s haphazard romance to what I can only describe as the greatest plot idea to ever grace harem anime. An idea of such endless quality that it must surely have been the result of divine intervention: the so-called “harem plan.” Devised by Lala’s younger sister Momo (who I will describe in greater detail shortly), the end goal of this plan is simply to have Rito enter into a polygamous marriage with every single one of the countless girls that are attracted to him. That’s it. By and large, gone are the convoluted and pointless alien politics that sometimes clouded To LOVE-Ru, and gone are the tiresome and hopeless struggles of Rito to confess to Haruna, his dream girl. All that remains is a perennial quest to get as many girls as conceivably possible to join Rito’s harem. One can immediately see why such a plan is so ingenious an idea for this anime. For one thing, the seemingly unavoidable problem that plagues all harem anime—choosing a single girl to date at the end—is easily resolved now that the goal has become for Rito to marry them all. But beyond that, this plot is a resounding success for exactly the reasons described in my earlier point: it allows Darkness to be utterly unabashed about its ecchi harem nature. No nonsense. No excuses. Just an increasingly large number of sexy girls.

This is not to say, however, that all sexy girls enter the harem with the same degree of ease. For some, a few minutes of screen time dedicated to Rito performing some minor act of kindness is all it takes for them to fall hopelessly in love with him, but for others, entire episodes or even story arcs may be necessary. In particular, Konjiki no Yami—The Golden Darkness—(the dispassionate assassin who was at one point sent to kill Rito but now lives peacefully on earth) proves to be an unusually stubborn candidate. In fact, so much of the plot of Darkness is dedicated to her very belated entrance into the harem that she ends up being the titular character. I suppose there are more honorable things to have named after oneself than an ecchi anime, but at least she was lucky enough to get a good ecchi anime. Indeed, as someone who previously noted that “if there is one character in [To LOVE-Ru] who deserves to be a part of a better anime then it is surely the ‘Golden Darkness,’” the fact that she receives the brunt of the attention in this good anime surely makes me very happy. What is most astonishing to me about all this, though, is that Darkness, the most lowbrow of television, actually manages to develop her in a reasonably well-written way. Over the course of its 26 episodes, comprising two seasons and two special episodes, we gain insight about her mysterious backstory, see her come to terms with her tumultuous past, and watch as she finds herself entering into more meaningful relationships with the people around her, especially Rito’s sister Mikan.

All of Yami’s development builds masterfully towards the series’ stunning conclusion in which her master, a (sexy) girl called Nemesis, releases the “darkness” within Yami, turning her into a world-destroying, godlike being. Following this, there is a lengthy and dramatic action sequence wherein many girls’ clothing is destroyed but no real damage is caused. Eventually, Lala’s sister Momo reveals to Rito that there is only one way for this situation to resolve itself: he must rebel against his sex-averse nature and engage in some “lewd acts” with Yami. Though he is initially skeptical, he is urged on by an underclassman named Mea who informs him that his “shamelessness will save the world.” In the end, he subdues the now nearly omnipotent Yami by casually walking up to her, taking off most of his clothes, and then groping her a bunch. If that is not the very apotheosis of ecchi anime, I don’t know what is.


As beautiful as that may be, though, Darkness’s plot would not be able to achieve any real success unless its characters were there to support it. The “harem plan,” for instance, would be pointless and insubstantial without girls of sufficient sexiness and quality of personality to join its eponymous harem. And so, it is here, with the characters, that Darkness elevates itself the most beyond the intense mediocrity of To LOVE-Ru. Yes, despite being made up of largely the same characters, Darkness’s cast is vastly superior to that of the original. The new characters are more fresh and inventive than those from the original series, and the old characters are either given more proper character development than before or appear less frequently. Of particular note are the new additions of Lala’s younger twin sisters Momo and Nana. Though these two were technically first seen in the To LOVE-Ru OVAs, their real importance becomes apparent during Darkness when they (along with Yami) replace Lala and Haruna as the show’s main heroines to great success. But who exactly are these two sisters and what makes them so successful? Let’s look a little deeper.

Momo Belia Deviluke: Momo is Lala’s younger sister who eventually decides to move in with, and attend the same school as, her sister (and Rito) on earth. Outwardly, she is a kind and gentle soul who immediately draws the admiration of her classmates, both male and female (but let’s be honest here, mostly male). Inwardly, however, she is an entirely different beast. Behind her cute façade, she is a dangerously creative schemer who harbors a deep-seated obsession with the erotic. Of course, regardless of how creative she may be, she still falls wildly in love with Rito before the viewers can say “fanservice.” Unlike her compatriots, however, she does not merely sit by and let that poor boy make a fool of himself with every girl in sight. Rather, she decides to take matters into her own hands and concoct the ingenious “harem plan” of which I have already written so highly.

The “harem plan” is really only one example of Momo’s escapades in action though. Throughout the show, she continuously makes her influence known, as she often goes out of her way to get Rito into lewd situations (much to his chagrin) in an attempt to expand the harem. These sorts of situations really go to show that Momo is exactly the kind of character this show needed. Her sexual-mindedness and conniving nature endow her with the ability to turn even the most mundane of situations into an entire fanservice-y pageantry. In fact, on the whole, Darkness owes a great deal of its success to Momo. Thanks to her salacious influence, it is able to bring about its fanservice far more gracefully than the contrived situations that were required in To LOVE-Ru. And it certainly seems that the writers were well aware of this fact because Momo appears with great frequency throughout Darkness—probably more than any single other character besides Rito himself.

Overall, then, I do not think it would not be an exaggeration to say that Momo is not only the best character in Darkness but one of my favorite anime characters of all time. Honestly, even having written this entire section of the essay praising Darkness, it still astonishes me that a character of such quality could have graced a show like this one. It astonishes me that the writers had it in them to make a character this good yet still wasted my time with the congregation of clichés that made up To LOVE-Ru’s cast. In a sense, Momo is so perfect a character, so precisely crafted to target and fix the first season’s fundamental issues, that she makes the rest of the cast look even more incompetent than they already were by comparison. Regardless, her addition to Darkness is one of the show’s greatest assets in allowing it to become more than the generic harem farce of Motto.


Nana Astar Deviluke: Nana is also Lala’s younger sister and also eventually decides to move in with, and attend the same school as, her sister. Unlike Momo, however, Nana makes no attempts at concealing her real personality. She is loud, easily angered, and takes great offense to Rito’s acts of unintentional sexual assault, regularly calling him a “beast.” Like most of the viewers, she finds it inconceivable that this man has amassed so substantial a harem, although in traditional To LOVE-Ru fashion, she does come around and eventually falls in love with him in a begrudged kind of way.

In comparison to her sister Momo, she is neither as plot significant nor, frankly, as interesting a character. Even so, Nana’s inclusion is by no means a misstep on the part of the writers. For one thing, her smaller-than-average boobs bring some much-needed balance to the average boob sizes among girls in this show. This may not sound very important, but the show feels the need to bring this fact up every few episodes just to make sure the viewers haven’t forgotten. Momo especially appears to believe that the matter of boobs is of such paramount importance that she acts as though Nana’s small ones constitute some sort of crippling disability. It’s really rather tragic.

Beyond the realm of boobs, Nana generally serves as a strong contrast to her sister Momo, particularly with regards to her attitude towards Rito. Whereas Momo is uncontrollably in love with Rito from the show’s beginning, Nana acts spitefully towards him for most of its run. Even when she does eventually develop some feelings for him, she still treats him quite harshly. The most important effect of this is that she serves to keep Momo and Rito in check. I think if Momo were the only new character added, the show might quickly devolve into total debauchery, but with Nana present in the Rito household, there is always someone there to yell at one or both of them when they begin to take things too far. In essence, she exists to stop the show from veering into hentai territory. Of course, being the preventer of lewdness is certainly a thankless role and one that can be easy to hate from a viewer’s perspective, but I believe it is an integral one. This way, Momo can stay in character (exhibiting her usual constant desire for eroticism) and the show can still air on television.

As I have hopefully demonstrated, Momo and Nana work together to great effect to form the backbone of Darkness. Add in the new and improved Yami, and we have a cast of central heroines that make To LOVE-Ru’s cast look like a ragtag band of clichés in comparison. Of course, Rito is still the same old sex-averse loser that he has always been, but surrounding him by such an excellent group of girls does undoubtedly serve to mitigate his problems—even if it cannot completely do away with them. Ultimately, as much as I have come to like this show and its characters, and as much as the changes that Darkness brings cause him to be less of a nuisance, I still do not really like Rito. Comparing Darkness’s Rito to the original’s Rito, though, is like comparing stubbing one’s toe to sticking one’s leg through a wood chipper. Neither are pleasant by any stretch of the imagination, but one is a mild inconvenience and the other is unbearably agonizing. By now, Rito’s greatest sin is really only that he is boring, and this is not a sin that bears much weight when he is able to play off of so many vastly more interesting characters around him.


Besides characters, there is one more topic that I think is worth discussing before I finally stop rambling on about Darkness. This is a central topic which I have been ignoring for quite some time—the most important topic of all: the fanservice. Though I have mentioned it at various points throughout this portion of the essay and hinted strongly as to what I think of it, I have not outright stated what I think of Darkness’s fanservice. To put it clearly, the fanservice present in To LOVE-Ru Darkness is of extremely high quality. There is a little bit of everything here: from gender-bending to a girl being suggestively force-fed a popsicle while wearing a school swimsuit and yelling “master” repeatedly. I won’t deny that it is an acquired taste, but I firmly believe that this quality selection of ecchi moments pairs well with the excellent character designs and art-style in Darkness to make its fanservice a resounding success.

It’s also worth noting that Darkness blows its competition out of the water not only in quality but quantity of fanservice. I don’t think I have ever seen an anime with more fanservice than this one. Granted, I don’t pretend to be an infallible authority on all anime, but I have seen more than enough to know that Darkness has, to put it crassly, a fuckton of fanservice. The show might as well be titled Fanservice: The Animation. Every episode of this show is a non-stop barrage of lewdness—23 minutes of Rito and his endless erotic escapades. And I for one love it. I relish the feeling that every moment spent watching this show is one spent, as the weebs say, “straying further from the light of God.” I relish the feeling that every person I know, have ever known, or will ever know would be profoundly disappointed in me if they knew that I watched this show. But above all, I relish the feeling of catharsis from having suffered through so many hours of To LOVE-Ru’s pathetic excuses for ecchi moments and now—finally—seeing some of the fanservice I felt so robbed of. Nothing can truly make up for the time I squandered on the early parts of this series, but at the very least I received some vindication in the end. It is a sad, hollow sort of vindication—no doubt I would rather have avoided the first season of To LOVE-Ru entirely—but it’s something to show for this time that I once considered totally lost.

In the end, I have probably vastly overstated just how good To LOVE-Ru Darkness really is. Certainly, as much as I can praise it, this salacious celebration of sexy anime girls will never go down in history as one of the all-time greats. Even so, I will not soon forget this show. Something about this particular selection of sexy anime girls, I think, will stick with me for a long time..."
5042,"Welcome to my review of Kiss x Sis(OVA) and probably the only review this show is going to get on this website as there has not been enough cultured individuals who have seen this show. After finishing the entire series I knew that I had to immediately share my thoughts on this wonderful series that Studio Feel. has graciously shared with the world. Which has now brought me here where I am now writing this review. 

Story: 10/10
So basically long story short the anime follows the mega CHAD Keita Suminoe as he gets into some interesting situations with the female cast of the series. With the two main girls of this almost entirely female cast being his sisters Riko and Ako. Now as you watch the show you're going to have to remember that they're not related by blood as the show reminds the audience multiple times throughout every episode.

Characters: 9/10
Now with the main cast of the Suminoe siblings, I thought they were really fleshed out and likable characters. However, the one problem I did have with series's characters were with the other love interests (aka Keita's side chicks). For example, the loli and teacher characters were pretty annoying whenever they showed up and I couldn't find that much enjoyment in any of the scenes they were in compared to the scenes that Riko or Ako were in. If you like these types of character archetypes you'll find satisfaction in these scenes nevertheless I couldn't, but whatever floats your boat I guess.

Art: 10/10
The animations and art were all very well made especially for something that started airing in 2008. All of the art and animations have aged well and the amount of effort put into them by the animators can easily be seen in any of the more sensual scenes. Another plus I have to add is that having seen the TV version of this series which adapts mostly the same things as this OVA version, I can safely say that the OVA version has less censored material. Who can say no to more ecchi action? Heck, that's probably why you're even watching this in the first place.

Sound: 10/10
They really did a good job on the sound design for this series. You could hear each of the voice actors having fun with their lines while also putting 100% effort into the voice acting during the voluptuous scenes. The soundtrack was good and so was the sound quality. The openings and endings were spot on with their music, singing, and visuals and really got you hyped for all the ecchi action the episode was going to present to you.

Final thoughts
Thank you for reading this review of Kiss x Sis, my first and probably only anime review I am ever going to do. I don't really know how to end these so last but not least remember INCEST IS WINCEST, also Riko best girl"
57,"Beck anime feels so real. It's so human and just feels so natural. 

There are some popular musical anime out there such as K-ON or Your Lie in April, but it really feels like the musical genre itself in anime is really underrated. 

The plot is very well constructed and shows realism, and the series portrays it perfectly and naturally. The plot is perfectly mixed with the drama, romance, friendship, and struggles that revolve around the band. The characters' school life, their part-time job, their casual band practice, their path to success, and the drama that revolves inside and outside of the band, all tie up together perfectly and feel so honest to goodness. The pacing of the show has been perfect as it is. It's perfectly paced like a slice-of-life series with corresponding dramas between the characters.

img500()

 The series deals with a lot of issues in the music industry. It's a perfect demonstration of how many bands struggle for success. They portray the 'Beck' band as an actual indie band because it shows the struggles of an indie band to achieve fame. The band is portrayed as just 'nothing special' because there are also tons of bands out there that also have immense potential. Their portrayal as being that feels realistic because, in this vast world, an indie band achieving fame is a lot harder than it sounds, knowing indie, in general, is not as known compared to other sub-genres.  Their struggles and adventures make this series a lot more exciting to watch. The way the characters need to sacrifice or let go of something for the sake of the band, just feels so realistic. The series also shows how dirty people can get just to achieve fame in music industry. The way the plot isn't rushed and that the band is actually doing things slowly, step by step to achieve success feels surreal. It feels satisfying to see the growth of each character and the band; they really went from 0 to 100 and it's so much satisfying to watch.

img500()

The main character, Koyuki,is one of the most human fictional character, which in itself is amazing. He's a normal highschool guy with no passion for anything, but his life turned its tables the day he met their lead guitarist. Koyuki and Maho's development has been top-notch over the course of the seies, considering that this is not even romance-centered to begin with. The series unironically also portrays romance quite a lot better than other romance-centered anime.

youtube(https://youtu.be/bNM7mU7nUao)

The rest of the cast are also cool and feels natural; just a random bunch of guys with personal issues whilst performing with the band. Insecurities, past issues, relationship problems, they really felt like real people. It's so much fun to watch them being portrayed as if they were real. I simply love its realism.


The art and animation were pretty on point . I don't have anything more to say from it because Madhouse did a great job in animating it. The color palette they used also fits the mood and theme of the series. 

The music and OSTs probably the BEST thing in this series. It feels so alive. It's very rock-like. Man, everytime they perform it always gives me goosebumps and sends shivers down to my spine. It feels so real. It makes me want to hear their performance on live. The bass, the lead guitar, the drums, the vocalist, all are perfect for the series. 

youtube(https://youtu.be/MwEplEqqMkM)

I really love every song in this anime, all hits and no misses.  The way how the studio perfectly fits the music to the corresponding mood of the scene is awesome. I especially love the 'Moon on the Water' soundtrack on the pool scene when Maho and Koyuki went to the pool together. 

youtube(https://youtu.be/cXpLJbxFYLs)

Overall, it's an amazing series. It's so relaxing while also portraying realism in life.   The best coming of age I have ever seen. Very highly recommended. And also, take time to read the manga too since the anime didn't adapt it entirely. The anime only adapted 30% of the manga so it's worth checking out especially if you want to see things getting serious with the band."
153629,"During a festive gathering to celebrate the new graduations from the magical academy, Algard, the crown prince of Atland and betrothed to noblewoman Euphyllia, announces that their engagement is effectively annulled. Having been taken by the charms of a commoner girl named Lainie, he levies accusations at Euphyllia, leaving her horrifically disgraced and her social status effectively ruined. As everything is about to come to a catastrophic head (even moreso than it already had), the rebellious princess Anisphia crashes through the window on her magical tool broomstick and, reading the situation quickly, takes Euphyllia away and promises to set her free from her circumstances.

The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady, or MagiRevo for short, starts with these series of violent metaphorical (and in Anisphia’s case, literal) collisions. As the series unfolds over its twelve episodes, the picture as to how all the collisions were born, nurtured, and achieved their realization begin to take their shape. All of the show’s major players, from aristocrats like Anisphia, Euphyllia to Algard, to even the lower-class Lainie, are thrust into a conflict propelled by forces that they are unable to reconcile, left to the mercy of where their seemingly pre-ordained fate will lead them. In effect, the show “imprisons” its characters by robbing them of their sense of agency. And thus, the form of revolution is born – each will take their destiny by their own hands.

“Revolution” – what a word! It tends to be the stuff of textbooks in history class, of looking at history through a mirror darkly and unable to fully grasp the larger picture since we were not there ourselves. But we would be wise to remember that revolutions are not made up purely some grand-sweeping events that happened in a vacuum; they are the stuff of people. More specifically, they are the stuff of a people who have embodied or had to live with an angst laid by problems or situations that were perhaps far beyond their control. A confluence of anger, sadness, and standing at the precipice of uncertain tomorrows all intermingle in intense and perhaps violent ways, both individually and societally. MagiRevo is a series that spearheads both approaches, with each of the characters’ own stories and personal arcs serving both their personalized journeys and complementing the political story hanging over their kingdom.

These are characters that actually talk to one another as human beings rather than as placeholders, people with their own apprehensions, fears, ways of interpreting the situation, and actively communicating to try and parse out the best option available. Especially as Euphyllia now must come to terms with her own lack of station and becoming Anisphia’s assistant, she’s a girl who has effectively lost her compass. When placed against the highly-independent Anisphia, Euphyllia’s waif-like way of being seems like a dismal balance in which she threatens to be overshadowed. But it is through her own contemplation (and gentle guidance, not force) that ultimately allows her to steer her own ship. She charts a course at Anisphia’s side, and through her own acumen and guile, demonstrates her own sensitivities and prowesses, both mental and magical, that Anisphia simply doesn’t possess. 






And then there’s Anisphia herself. I should stress that MagiRevo is an isekai (which, depending on who you ask, is just as much of a four-letter word in the anime landscape as the term “CGI”), but it doesn’t play itself like one, opting instead to approach itself as a straight fantasy. When the series begins, Anisphia is already reborn into the new world and its city of Atland, so we get very little overt information as to what her life back in the “real world” (for lack of a better term) was like. The impact is crucial – because the entirety of the story takes place within this new world, it makes Anisphia feel less like an interloper and more like a natural person who was born here. We do not “know” any other version of Anisphia aside from the one who resides in Atland, cutting out needless fat or pathos that doesn’t provide substantial sustenance. She is not “some girl from the real world” – she is Princess Anisphia of Atland. Her personality and her other magicological idiosyncrasies are enough to present her as an outcast without the added baggage of wondering about the life or people that she left behind. 

And because she is framed as being entirely within this world, it means that the political situation more-actively pertains to her in a fashion that reads as believable. Though I referred to her as an outcast before, it would perhaps be more accurate to call her an “aberration.” In a kingdom where magic determines one’s status and class, it is a cruel, cosmic joke that the crown princess was born with no magical ability. To make the most of her curious mind and the royal family’s resources, she takes part in the forbidden art of magicology (or thaumatology, depending on which translation you’re watching), fashioning “tools” that allow her to make magic her own way. In her study of magicite, and with assistance from her maid Ilia and friend Tilty, she discovers that magic can be harnessed and honed into many new forms, some practical and others fantastical. Just as Euphyllia’s fate was burdened with the death of her engagement and social status at Algard’s hands, Anisphia’s existence, magicological pursuits, and impulsive charges into danger—for research or otherwise—are themselves a revolutionary stance against the kingdom’s entire ideology. It earns her the facepalm-induced frustrations of her family and the complete ire of the traditional nobility.

I mentioned before that the characters’ personal revolutions act as partnered complements to the grander overarching kingdom story, and that’s because these are characters whose decisions actively change the lives of both themselves, their loved ones, and by extension, the kingdom that they all call their home. As the story progresses onward and Atland’s political state is gradually unearthed, there’s the genuine question both of what is happening and whether what is present is salvageable. MagiRevo is not content to just let its political squabbles be solved so quickly; as the future reveals itself, Algard’s actions are, much like Euphyllia’s coming to terms with her circumstances and Anisphia revolting against her very existence, his own proposed revolution to what he himself sees as a problem. He, for reasons veiled in mystery until the moment of reckoning, charges into his own metaphorical fray.

MagiRevo makes a rather daring statement by doing so – the characters themselves are not at fault for why things happened to them the way they did for so long. Their apprehensions are genuine, and their worried hearts are a byproduct of all that was structurally in place. Yet by making this claim, the series is taking a massive gamble; political stories do not get credit for simply revealing a problem and then disregarding it one minute later. Such a thing does a disservice to the Pandora’s Box that it opened. This series even within its first season, however, seems willing to charge headfirst into that dark vortex and pick apart the nuances that make its world revolve. But whatever fate awaits them (and I sincerely hope it follows through with a season two), Anisphia, Euphyllia, and all those they care about will tackle the impossible tomorrow and make their own way. Working against all the impossible odds is what Anisphia has always done, and what Euphyllia learned she must do.

“The impossible is something you make possible!” Anisphia

26,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

Texhnolyze is a cyberpunk series that showcases humanity, both at its best, as well as at its worst, oftentimes seamlessly blending the two together in the same moment. Taking place in the dreary underground city of Lux, saturated with a suffocating and oppressive atmosphere, the viewer is soon introduced to several major characters. Among them are a stoic young man who survives as an entertainment fighter, the resolute leader of a mafia-like organization known as The Organo, a girl with increasingly accurate precognitive abilities that allow her to catch glimpses of the future, an iron-willed group that holds idealistic beliefs, a twisted doctor, a gang of rash hedonists, and, perhaps most importantly, a stranger not from the underground city but rather from the surface above who begins a slow descent into this dark, dystopian society soon igniting a series of events that will determine the course of the future of humanity forever.

Among those who worked on Texhnolyze were Chiaki J. Konaka, Yoshitoshi ABe, and Yasuyuki Ueda who had previously collaborated on the strange and bizarre Serial Experiments Lain. Chiaki J. Konaka has, over the course of his career, acquired a reputation for writing some of the most peculiar works within the medium, with Texhnolyze being among the series that demonstrate his talents strikingly well. ABe's art tends to favor a more realistic design than what is found in most other series and frequently has a gloomy sense of melancholy to it. 

Within Texhnolyze the creators manage to work a lot into the twenty-two episode run. So, what is the point of this series? In essence what the creators want to express is something from within, something beautifully human. Texhnolyze is frequently treated as a series that is all about nihilism. This is not the case though, it is not about pure nihilism. Rather, to me, it seems to acknowledge and explore it, but ultimately it clearly and wholly rejects it. Texhnolyze is dark and remorseless in the pursuit of its message, but fundamentally inspiring and rife with an optimistic outlook.

A series from Studio Madhouse made in the early 2000s, Texhnolyze begins with an episode that has (almost) no dialogue. Following after that are even more episodes that may, at least at times, feel very slow-paced, for this is a deliberate attempt to demonstrate the nature of the slowly crumbling, monotonous lives led by the people within this series. To have the viewer feel this, it is structured such that it will feel like a brutal and suffocating trek across a wasteland. Being slow does not mean it is bad by any means, as slow-pacing is not an inherently bad thing. As slow as Texhnolyze can be there is almost always something of import occurring during that time. Texhnolyze is a series that relishes in letting its audience draw conclusions for themselves, leaving open many avenues of interpretation, oftentimes focusing more on showing rather than telling as a result—and indeed it loves to show and will rarely if ever tell the viewer what it is actually saying. Moreover, the slow pacing early in the series is utilized to convey the pain the characters experience as clearly as possible—and so, when characters are injured or events transpire we are readily able to glimpse into their feelings via their facial expressions, their displayed behaviors, and the actions they take.

I suppose it may be worth mentioning that this series lacks ""likable"" characters, which is probably bound to turn some away. The ""main"" character will also not be the primary focus of the story in its entirety. It is more like everyone in the story is equally important and feels more like an ensemble cast. ""Likable"" and/or ""relatable"" characters are not a necessity for a series to be ""good"" and so the value of the characters will not be evaluated upon such a belief in this review. What matters is whether or not the characters are handled well. This is the case as none of them are neglected and each one serves a purpose within the story. There are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys,"" which is quite gratifying. Instead, characters are treated as though they were an actual human and behave as one might in such a society as the one depicted.

The characters in Texhnolyze seem almost like a symbolic representation for a characteristic of humanity (at times). Even so they will still maintain their own identity. From here, I will begin to discuss spoilers which will continue until the end of this review. Read at your own risk.

BEWARE:
SPOILERS AHEAD

Ichise is an individual that I can see as being a representation of the human will to survive. This is demonstrated by the way he is seen crawling around and struggling, yet never giving up, as he tries desperately to cling to life. He loses an arm and a leg, yet continues to grapple and fight to survive. Once we consider him to be the human will to live, his days as an underground prize fighter take on a new meaning. He has always been placed in a situation where he must forcefully struggle just to scrape by in life. He is constantly wrestling with and making efforts to push onward, to the point that he seems like a wild animal—a stray dog as the series puts it—but at the same time much like a human. Ichise frequently makes grunting noises...a lot, but the grunting sounds he makes often do an impeccable job of separating him from other characters and demonstrating that he is an individual who wants to live and will fight to do so. He has ""an obsession to live."" He may have nothing in the world, but he still refuses to passively die, becoming a perfect representation of human perseverance. 

He is often shown being at the mercy of another, controlled by factors he cannot repel, whether as a prize fighter, as one of Doc's subjects, as a member of the Organo, as one who suffers his own fate; he seems to have very little control over his own life and seeks only his own survival. However, I would say that it is possible to consider that he does have control over his life and his fate. His desire to survive is his choice, thus it is by his own will that he survives. As the will to live should he not have had control over his survival he would not have allowed himself to be subjected to such control to begin with as it would not be in his nature to do so. It must be his choice and no one else's. I would not call him a tragic existence in a pessimistic sense since he has truly lived, and this is expressed most convincingly when he smiles and then subsequently dies at the end. Perhaps it is necessary to consider him as tragic in an optimistic sense—an individual who affirms his life, even the aspects that involve suffering and his death. But did Ichise truly possess a free will, was the genesis of his desire to survive founded by his own freedom, and was there even a choice involved? A question to possibly ponder as well, and moreover one that will receive no concrete answer. If Ran's precognitive abilities and the beliefs and ultimate fate of the citizens of Gabe are considered perhaps it is necessary to take an optimistically fatalistic outlook on Ichise. As Ran states, despite her attempts to interfere with destiny, ""Nothing changes."" But consider as well that the people of Gabe believed Ran's vistas of the future to be only one possibility, so is there really a choice after all? Their actions are at times in contrast to this as at the end they are resigned to Lux's doom. In any case, it need only be stated that Ichise ""loved and hated the monster inside him more than anyone else,"" for he loved his fate.

Ran can be seen as a prophet, a guide, an oracle; in a metaphorical manner, Ran is a character that I can see as representing the future of humanity itself, in a sense at least. She has the ability to see the future because she is the manifestation of humanity's future. She wants to protect the future of humanity and prevent its extinction, a future she has prophesied will occur. It is shown that her visions are not necessarily always going to be correct and they can be changed, something that can potentially have to do with fate—fate as written by the individual. Under such an interpretation fate can be loved, as fate is controlled by whomsoever it refers to, not the other way around. It is one's own life, and one's life, every aspect of it—the happiness, the pain and the suffering—all of it is their own, and it is by their own choices that their fate exists. ""Fate"" in Texhnolyze would then not be the result of something beyond one's control, but rather as something that is dictated by one's choices, and by extension one's choices cannot be dictated by fate. But is this actually the case? Even if it is fate as in one's destiny being beyond one's control it is still possible to love that fate and the happiness and suffering that comes with it. No definitive answer will be given by the series. 

Why does Ran's prophecy about the extinction of humanity come true, or, why is Ran even able to predict the future? It may be due to the concept of the eternal recurrence of the same (note that philosophical concepts are at times integrated into the series, but it is important to acknowledge that they do not define it) which is alluded to a few times in the series. Everything will play out the same way every time, no matter how times, and it cannot be fought. Ran may not be seeing the future, she may be seeing something that has already occurred many times before. When the future of humanity is effectively gone she asks Onishi to destroy her (she is The Voice of the City and during the course of the series Onishi can listen to her without losing his sanity) as she is the cause of the madness in Lux after having shown the residents her visions. The last remaining humans in the city have been consumed by insanity due to these visions. 

If she represents the future it would be a good reason as to why she wanted to protect and help Ichise who represents the will to survive. With no future (Ran) there can be no will to live (Ichise), and with no will to live there can be no future. The actions and lines spoken between these two throughout the series seemed to indicate such an idea to me at least. These two characters have a very sibling-like relationship within the series, and perhaps the best way to describe the relationship between ""the human will to survive"" and the ""future of humanity"" is sibling-like as well. In a way, they would both be like the ""children of humanity."" Within the series Ichise, or humanity's will to live, wants to know his future and the answer he ends up getting from Ran is one he rejects, saying he would not let it come to pass. (Perhaps you can look at this as a rejection of fate when it is not written by the individual on Ichise's part.) Once Ichise returns to Lux after seeing the surface world of the Theonormals he said something along the lines of ""What choice have I got? I have to protect you,"" to a vision of Ran that he spoke to upon his arrival back in the city. This would also seem like a good indication to me that the ""will to survive"" and the ""future"" need to protect each other if humanity is to truly survive. Ichise has come to that realization that he must protect Ran, the same way she has been protecting him throughout the series.

The flowers that Ran is frequently shown carrying, selling, and dropping at points in the series are in one matter of interpretation meant to represent the hope for the future—hope as in the affirmation of life. In episode five she drops them into the maze of a sewer that Ichise aimlessly wanders and uses them to guide him (the human will to survive) to her. After he manages to escape his unwilling predicament in this labyrinth he falls unconscious and she leaves a white flower by him. The idea of this flower becomes central to Ichise's character for the remainder of the series. Additionally, note the way this scene where Ichise wanders the sewers mirrors the final scenes of the series as well. As Ichise wanders the sewers his confusion and anger at his inability to find the exit is reflective of his internal state at the time. When Ichise returns to Lux at the end of the series whereupon he begins his trek to find Ran and confront Kano he is calm and understands who he is at this point. He understands that he was capable of change, though he also remained much the same person; for even if, and when, a person changes they are still the same person. Ran leads Ichise out of the sewer; Ichise talks with a vision of Ran as he goes to find her in the final scenes. After Ichise escapes the sewer it is Ran who strokes his head; in the end it is Ichise who carries Ran and returns her to the Raffia. Ran leaves the flower by Ichise's head; Ichise's texhnolyze arm projects a flower. Within the sewers Ichise lies against a wall seemingly resigning himself and giving up; at the end Ichise rests against a pillar and bleeds out as he accepts, with satisfaction this time, that he has lived and can die taking comfort in that fact. As the ""will to live"" it is significant that at the point in the sewers when he has resigned himself, it was almost immediately after that that Ran, ""the future of humanity,"" reignited his desire to survive by dropping the flowers into the sewer to lead him out.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohhx7KGNnmM)
>If you wish to compare.

Additionally, Ichise lies against a wall/pillar many times (besides the two notable times I mentioned above) over the course of the series, and each time he does this something of importance about him is being conveyed in that instant. This recurrent visual cue is meant to stimulate within the viewer an association between Ichise and what he is going through at this point in time. When he lies near a wall, the series is asking the viewer to contemplate what is happening because it is often establishing something significant about him as a character.

There was a time when I thought that the crude projection of the flower Ichise's texhnolyze arm shows in the last scene was something that the doctor, Eriko, was responsible for because one would assume she is the one who would be responsible for it due to her being the person who gave him the texhnolyze limbs in the first place and repairs them when they are damaged. She knew he liked the flowers. There is a scene where they were walking on the surface and she took notice of him looking at them. Also, of note about this scene is that when Ichise looks at the flower on the surface it immediately wilts and dies. He then looks back the way they came, towards Lux, and stares in that direction for a few seconds. The wilting flower is a sign that ""hope"" for the affirmation of life is dying in Lux, that the future of humanity is soon to be no more. It also doubles as a representation that it is not possible for life to be affirmed on the Surface World.

>Skip to 1:36

Eriko witnessed this and while she certainly had come to care about Ichise over the course of the series I have since wondered if Eriko being entirely responsible for the projection within his texhnolyze arm is not actually the case; actually, I think it is more of dual effort, at least in a way. Eriko put it there, but perhaps it is actually Ran who made the projection appear in the last scene (in this way the future and the will to live would die together then). She is the one who controls the texhnolyze limbs through the Obelisk and at this point she has been returned to the Raffia by Ichise—where all the citizens of Gabe go when they die—to be reincarnated in another form of life. This would also parallel the scene where Ichise wanders the sewers in episode five with the final scenes of the last episode rather well, too. Ichise does end up fulfilling the prophecy of Ran and dying ""alone,"" but at the same time he wasn't truly alone because in a way Ran and the others who he met in his life are there with him, and they also die with him. The thoughts that he truly lived his life and is grateful for this and for those he met along the way lets him die satisfied. The flower projection is a reminder of what he found in living. He smiles, one of the only times he does so in the entire series, and slowly fades away.

Keigo Onishi represents the order of humanity. He works to ensure that the order in the society of the city will be upheld since he believes that is to the benefit of Lux. So, when the order dies—as the people of Lux have gone mad—Onishi being the incarnation of that order soon dies as well by the very people he strove to help. In the series Onishi serves as a mentor to Ichise and is almost like a father for him. He can be considered the Apollinian juxtaposed with Yoshii's Dionysian.

Kazuho Yoshii exists at the intersection and overlap of the irrationality and rationality of humanity. The actions he takes seem extremely irrational to the other characters, but he also believes he is helping to prevent Lux from becoming like the terrifyingly bleak surface world. He believes Lux is a ""living"" world unlike the dead one on the surface and does what he deems necessary to prevent it from reaching a similar outcome as that one has. He believes in the ""living"" human and he believes in the power of humanity. He denies wanting to know his future when Ran asks him if he would like to know it. For him, he doesn't need to know his future because he already knows his life and its meaning. More clearly though, he is widely acknowledged to represent the Übermensch. He is Dionysian, especially in the sense of the concept as it was developed by Nietzsche after The Birth of Tragedy, rather than fitting the term as described within that work. So being the irrationality and rationality representation is somewhat related. Yoshii is the antithesis of the decadence of the surface world. Yoshii embraces his ""fate"" and loves his life, and when he dies, he does so with a smile. He comes from clear skies and has known solitude like no other. He does not preach. He is no prophet. He comes to Lux to awaken people to themselves—for themselves. 

The doctor, Eriko can represent the advancement of the human species or the desire for more knowledge. She believes the texhnolyze limbs are what can help to achieve this. When she returns to the surface she discovers that they have given up on the texhnolyze limbs, she sees they are now ""ghosts,"" apparently the perfection of the human species. She has lost her purpose, and without that purpose she cannot live, soon dying thereafter. Within the series Eriko is like a second mother to Ichise as well. And this leads to further clarification of her character—is she really pursuing knowledge because she wants to advance the human species? She seems more interested in using it as means of allowing herself to have children. Texhnolyzation is for her the only way she can pass on her genes. To hammer in the fact that the surface world denizens are like ghosts the series goes out of its way to literally have some of them possess the translucent appearance commonly thought to be characteristic of a ghost. Doc deems her entire purpose and everything she has been working for meaningless upon witnessing the state of the Surface.

Shinji, leader of the Racan, is the naïvety of humanity. He dreams of being one of The Class. When he eventually discovers their true form he proceeds to kill them. He is killing his dream in a literal sense, and seeing as he is no longer that naïve and trusting individual he is meant to represent, he can no longer exist, and is literally killed by his dreams blasting a whole through his chest. He is empty inside, both literally and metaphorically. 

Kano is a representation of solipsism, believing that he is the only thing that he is certain exists. Perhaps he can also even be insanity itself. Though his goals seem to be sane—he wants to improve mankind, or so he claims—his methods to do so are, what many would agree, insane. He ""improves"" humanity by destroying the very things that make them human. Humans are human because they can die and because they maintain their spirit for the affirmation of their life. By disregarding this and turning them into the immortal Shapes he has failed to help mankind, ironically damning them instead. Eventually it is learned that he doesn't care about humanity or helping them at all, they are just ""homunculus in his brain"". 

Tatsuya Sakimura is a fantasist. Although I prefer to think of him more as the passive ""Conductor"". He is ""dead"" and resigned to his own end like the surface dwellers, but he is captivated by Yoshii; Yoshii's desires are enthralling to him. He dreams of the world Yoshii envisions. He too, much like Shinji, also kills his dreams (Yoshii) when he sees he has been mortally wounded (episode 10) and with it he returns to the already ""dead"" and seemingly nihilistic surface dweller.

Motoharu Kimata is the contradiction and hypocrisy of humanity. He is a leader of a group known as the Salvation Union that rejects the texhnolyze despite being a texhnolyze himself. He embodies the contradictory, and in a way the natural contradictions found in humanity. 

Haruhiko Toyama is the oversight of humanity. He will do anything to survive and serves to provide a contrast with Ichise. When he becomes one of the Shapes he ends up thanking Ichise when he kills him having come to realize that he has made a mistake. Being one of the Shapes isn't surviving. By becoming one of them he has forsaken his humanity. At the point when Ichise kills Toyama Ichise has decided to return to Lux in order to protect Ran. Ichise's oversight in this case was that he did not realize that he must protect Ran (the future) before and it has now been ""killed"" by his decision to return. Ichise's other oversight was wrongfully blaming his father for the death of his mother and that is ""killed"" as well when he meets the ghost of his father and apologizes to him. Toyama had earlier said ""They say acts of self-injury or getting tattoos are ways to deny one's blood relations."" and it is no accident that soon after Ichise kills Toyama he meets the ghost of his father. 

Kohakura is a representation of the treachery of humanity. He does betray the leader of the Organo, Onishi, but this is not his biggest act of treachery. His greatest act of disloyalty is to himself. He betrays his own humanity when he becomes one of the Shapes. He is permanently rooted to the ground facing downwards for an eternity with the rest of the Shapes who betrayed their humanity. Lux is meant to represent the Ninth Circle of Hell at this point. These Shapes, who have altered themselves to an unrecognizable existence, ""shaped"" humanity's end. They have inherited the Earth, though it is ultimately meaningless now.

The different factions within the series can also be seen as representative of certain things.

The Organo (means ""organs of the body"") and perhaps the best term for them is a meritocracy or to a lesser extent an aristocracy. (Or maybe feudalistic is more appropriate.) Their leader is chosen by the group on the basis of ability, there are opportunistic individuals within the organization, the citizens accept them as their form of rule, etc. It is stated at one point that the residents of Lux pay a fee for protection, which can be likened to a tax in a twisted sense. The Salvation Union is fanaticism/idealism and they are Social Revolutionaries. Notice the clenched fist, raised to the sky, that they often show. Some members are quite fanatical. The Racan are Anarchism. They are a group of hedonists who gather around a ""leader"" but are still free to do as they please and leave if they so choose. The Class are a Caste System. To reflect how such a system can decline with time it has the members inbreed and gives rise to an egoist like Kano. Kano's beliefs are, again, solipsism with maybe some Social Darwinism in there as well. Those of Gabe are deterministic Religion. The Theonormals (surface world citizens) are nihilism (They are meant to represent the ""Last Man"").

The name of the city, Lux, appears to be a rather deceitful title for the underground society—initially, at least. This name which means light is seemingly ironic. You may think it sounds strange calling the dark, dismal city of Lux the city of light and hope, however by the end of the series it is realized that it was. We are left with the understanding that the denizens of Lux were indeed the lucky ones when compared to the lives led by those on the surface. Having noticeably been able to maintain their human nature unlike those upon the surface, they never sank into an outright nihilistic or fruitless existence. They had their humanity, though life was tough, brutal, and cruel, they remained alive although appearing lifeless. They never devolved into the lifestyle of those on the surface who merely live as ghosts awaiting their inevitable end, unable to reproduce, too tired to even do anything, let alone die willingly, which the series seems imply they would do if it was not for the effort involved. The Theonormals are the apparent perfection of humans; they do not suffer from disease, there is no war, there is no struggle, everything they could ever want has been obtained, but they are not ""alive."" They live a decadent life where their only desires are comfort and security, until death finally arrives.

The art/artstyle of Texhnolyze is bleak, dull, somber, and gloomy. It is coupled with an emotionally evocative soundtrack that does an exceptional job of setting an appropriate tone for the series. Some of the tracks convey a deep sense of desolation, others a great degree of urgency, at other times a track produces a poignant melancholy, and still at other times it provides a gentle tune exuding an air of fragile grace.

Oftentimes, rather than a soundtrack there are some ambient noises that are occurring instead—an effect that is often very prominent in the series directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki. There is a meticulous attention to detail in the series: from the outfits the characters wear saying something specific about them, to the backgrounds which are often hidden with a subtle meaning themselves—it effectively manages to capture the tone the series is aiming for. Characters' designs had little room for symbolic elements to be implemented due to a desire to make the characters look as realistic as possible, however, there are certain little things there. For example, Ichise's eyes are bright blue, brimming with life; Ran wears a kitsune mask. There is an interaction between light and dark all throughout the course of the series—another trait shared in Hamasaki's works. There is recurrent usage of a train and train tracks meant to symbolize the progression of humanity (within Lux specifically) and, indeed, when we reach the end of those tracks we have also soon reached the end of the series and the end of Lux. They can also be seen as representative of determinism and of fate. Also, recurring in the series are spinning fans which, too, served a purpose. Often simultaneously setting a tone or being used for atmospheric purposes (also common in other Hamasaki series), I believe they also served another purpose. There is an idea of cycles in the series. Humanity has run its course from beginning to end, the characters have completed the cycle from life to death—everything eventually completes its cycle (and the cycle will repeat eternally, if you wanted to apply a literal interpretation of the eternal recurrence which is occasionally referenced).

Another thing I would like to note is the titles of each episode. From Episode 1's title Stranger where Yoshii, the stranger to the city of Lux in this case, descends into that underground setting, to the tragic irony of Episode 19's Heavenward, to the realization of Episode 20's title Hades referring to the surface once considered by the characters within the series to be a utopian paradise, to the fact that humanity has indeed become a Myth by the end of Episode 22, each title was chosen with calculated contemplation. The next section is entirely dedicated to discussing Texhnolyze's episode titles, their meanings, and other significant elements of the episode. It is written in a more note-like manner for the sake of brevity.

Rogue 01: Stranger

- Yoshii; the stranger to Lux, and, like Ichise, a stranger to the world he had lived in on the surface. ""Is your arrival good for the city and good for yourself? Or is it bad for the city and bad for yourself?""
- Ichise; a stranger to the city he lives in. A stranger to his fellow citizens. Struggles to live; ""like a dog"". You could say he starts as an absurd hero.

Ichise's situation in the world is irrational. There is a big emphasis on sensory experiences, accentuating that one exists within it. The episode title is potentially a reference to Albert Camus's absurdist novel, The Stranger. I will note when some philosophical concepts appear, but I want to reiterate that they are merely integrated into the series and do not define it as a whole—they are parts. They are merely interesting to note when they appear. I will try to identify where some absurdist/existential elements exist when they are overt. I've already attempted to examine the series without a big emphasis on these things above, so now I may end up mentioning them more frequently.

Rogue 02: Forfeiture

- The forfeiture of Ichise's limbs, but also foreshadowing his forfeiture of a part of what makes him ""human"" (in his eyes) when he is to gain the artificial Texhnolyze limbs to replace those he has lost. These Texhnolyze limbs are separate from him, and are considered to be ""living entities of their own"". Ichise carried his severed limbs through the streets, even though it meaningless.

Note that Ichise lies on the ground and looks at the vial containing his mother in this episode, paralleling the final scene of the series. He struggles to climb stairs (forfeiture of the ability to complete simple human tasks).

Rogue 03: Texhnophile/Rogue 04: Synapse

- The Texhnophile is Doc, obsessed with the technological advancement of the human species. Ichise essentially rejects her entire being when he thrashes his newly acquired limb against her equipment in a rage.
- Synapse emphasizes the connection of a foreign limb to Ichise's body. Title Synapse is also hinting at the ""spectacle"" to come in Lux.

The first word Ichise says in the series is, ""Water.""; one of the essential things humans need to survive, once again emphasizing his desire to live.

Rogue 05: Loiter

- Ichise (seemingly) loiters about throughout the episode, struggling with his new texhnolyze limbs and being dropped in a labyrinthine sewer. This maze that he wanders is reflective of what he is going through internally and the realizations he has begun to draw. Earlier in the episode he broke into a house and stole food; when found and thrown out he lies by trash and begins to laugh. This is where he begins to attain an awareness of how unreasonable his situation in the world really is. First he struggled with limbs he detests, then he struggles to get food to survive, and then he struggles just to find a way out of the hopeless wasteland he is stuck in. Within the sewers he is lost and angry, at one point he begins to give up, potentially just waiting for death (essentially committing suicide), however within the barren sewers he sees a flower dropped, and therefore two things are derived from his consciousness of the absurd: his revolt against it and his freedom within it. Because the episode ends right after he escapes the third consequence is not fully realized yet (from the viewer's perspective), but will be in the next episode. Above I claim the flower to be representative of hope for the affirmation of life, but with this interpretation here, I would rather just call it ""beauty in the indifferent world."" (This idea will be the only time I apply a philosophical concept when it is not as explicit with its association within the series. Following the line of thought introduced here, I will continue to add to this idea later though. This scene can be taken in a variety of ways, this is merely one of them.)

This episode is the first one to actually discuss an individual's freedom instead of just showing us what the characters value via their actions. We witness a discussion between Yoshii and Shinji on the topic. Yoshii says, ""True freedom can't lean on anything. It's transient, lonely, and arduous. You can't hope for security or reward beyond it."" Shinji claimed he does not belong to anything and is thus free, but because Shinji sees the lights of the City and dreams of reaching that place Yoshii contends that he actually does belong to something—the City itself, and ""without a doubt so does his freedom."" This is the episode where Ichise finds his freedom.

This is a pretty important episode in my opinion.

Rogue 06: Repetition

- This episode repeats certain things that have already occurred under a new light, hence repetition. It also seems to imply the eternal recurrence of Nietzsche (more of an abstract mental exercise rather than something literal) with the opening and ending narrations. Ichise once more encounters those who severed his limbs and dropped him into the sewer and brutally attacks them.

>""There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn."" —Albert Camus

Continuing the line of thought from the last episode in the sewer, Ichise scorns the indifferent world and the absurd, revolting against it and finding freedom within it.

In this episode, from the absurd Ichise derives the third result: his passion. Camus claimed that revolt, freedom, and passion are the three consequences of the absurd. Ichise begins to work towards getting used to his new limbs, managing to climb the stairs once more as he did with his original organic limbs.

Rogue 07: Plot

- Yoshi's plot and the overall plot of the series is finally starting to become clear.

Onishi begins to gain an admiration of Ichise's will to live. Shinji also recognizes Ichise's desire to live upon seeing his eyes. Ran follows Ichise.

""I wonder by whose will he is being kept alive. Yours? Mine? Or the City of Lux?"" —Doc Eriko

Rogue 08: Crucible

- Lux itself is the crucible where the different elements within the city (Organo, Racan, Salvation Union, Yoshii, Ichise, Ran) have begun to interact, the implication being that something new will result from it.
- Indicative of the severe trials the characters face.

For more on what the different factions represent see earlier in this review. Note that when the conflict finally erupts between the three big factions of Lux Ichise falls right into the middle of the chaos.

Ichise's newfound values are tested when he meets Yoshii (Ichise immediately attacks him). Yoshii sees promise in Ichise (probably sees part of himself in Ichise).

Rogue 09: Wiggle

- The City of Lux and the factions within ""wiggle"" in the crucible of Lux with the war now ignited. Onishi feels his values ""wiggling"" as Yoshii makes the conflict personal for him (having destroyed the order Onishi values and targeted his wife). Yoshii is the Übermensch and he desires that others believe more in their own power.

""I want to enlighten them. So they can believe more in their own power. Now I'm beginning to see, that is my mission."" —Yoshii

Rogue 10: Conclusion

- The Übermensch dies. A conclusion is reached.

Yoshii sees promise in Shinji, but Shinji cannot reject his dream of the Class.

""This is absurd. I'm your friend, you know."" —Yoshii

Yoshii is killed by Ichise, he dies satisfied, and with a smile. Yoshii lived what he believed to be his purpose.

""After all, nothing changes."" —Ran

Rogue 11: Vagrant

- Ichise; no longer a ""stranger"", now a ""vagrant"". Ichise has recognized the absurdity of life and is now a wanderer. This episode lays the foundation and begins to set up his discovery of what he wants from life, and what (personal) meaning he can potentially find in it. For all characters in the series any meaning found will be personal and created by them.

Texhnolyze is not a nihilistic series. It possesses both existential and absurdist elements to it. Whether or not you want to call Ichise's journey on the most basic level an existential or absurd one will depend on whether or not he sees any hope, which he currently is not aware of, as right now he is living the three consequences of the recognition of the absurdity of life (to continue the line of thought introduced in Episode 5).

Ichise is able to empathize with Toyama's hatred of his father and their shared upbringing in the same part of Lux. Ichise learns Toyama became a texhnolyze as a way to deny his blood relations to with his father.

""But sometimes, I can't help wondering if the decisions I made were right. I feel that way, especially watching you."" —Toyama

Later in the episode Ichise goes to visit Onishi in the hospital (Eriko is already there) where he informs him that Kohakura has given him to Onishi as a ""gift"". Onishi asks, ""And that's fine with you?"" to which Ichise replies, ""I wouldn't have come here if I didn't want to. To tell the truth, I really don't know. What I want to do, or what I should do. But I'm not going back to where I was before and I have no place to go now. I know that much."" This demonstrates that he has begun to attempt to find a meaning to his life. He later runs to locate Ran when he notices one of her flowers floating along the waterway.

Ichise will eventually find the meaning in his life through his relationship with others, specifically, Onishi, Ran, Eriko, and Toyama.

Rogue 12: Precognition

- Ichise once more sees Ran walking through the streets, and wonders why she is ignoring him. Ran sees Ichise's future at this point and begins screaming before losing consciousness (These visions that she sees drive the residents of Lux mad when they see them towards the end of the series. She is subjected to them regularly and maintains her sanity.) Ichise will later learn that it is his destiny to ""destroy everything"", ""hurt a lot of people"", and ""be all alone in the end,"" according to Ran's precognitive ability.

Ichise once more looks at flowers in this episode. These represent his continued awareness of the beauty in the world and allow him to recall those who have helped him along the way. The world may be indifferent to him but at least four of the people around him are not.

Ichise learns the truth of his father's death when the ""Voice of the City"" (Ran) shares it with him.

Rogue 13: Vista

- ""You enjoy the beauty of the flowers, do you?"" Ichise looks at a view of flowers in this episode. Ran also sees vistas of the future and tells Onishi about what she sees. This is also the episode where Ichise learns his future from Ran.

Onishi and Ichise's relationship grows closer as the two have a conversation. Onishi shares how he lost his legs with Ichise.

Rogue 14: Rejection

- Ichise has rejected the future Ran has seen—he scorns it.
- Doc Eriko's texhnloyzation is rejected by the Class (essentially her reason for being is rejected as well).
- This foreshadows those who reject their human soul and become the Shapes.

Rogue 15: Shapes

- The introduction of the Shapes and the one who shapes the end of humanity, the egoist, Kano. Numerous members of the different factions begin to desert and become the Shapes, meant to emulate the ""hungry ghosts,"" the Preta.

Rogue 16: Strain

- A strained situation is faced by everyone with the Shapes now running rampant. These Shapes are meant to be seen as a different ""strain"" of humans, those who have forsaken what makes them human in the first place. They have been changed to such a degree that it is damaging and they cannot be considered to be the same ""human"" anymore. Transhumanism to such a degree is rejected by the series. Defeating the Shapes demands significant effort. Even the weapons the Shapes use are different from those used by humans.

Rogue 17: Dependence

- Members of the Salvation Union's dependence on their ideals leads them to rush headlong to their doom.
- The citizens of Gabe are dependent on the Seer, Ran, and can do little without her guidance.
- Doc Eriko is dependent on her reason for existing, the technological advancement of the human species, without which she struggles for meaning.
- The Shapes are dependent on Kano's ideals.
- Onishi and Ichise are dependent on themselves and the belief systems they have made for themselves.

""As it is, you will also cease to be, sooner or later. But I want you to stay alive."" and ""To me, the Organo was nothing more than a means to keep surviving"", are lines spoken by Toyama. Ichise says, ""I would've been dead now if it weren't for the Organo."" This shows his gratitude towards the organization. ""You want to live so badly that you'll pay any price?"" Ichise asks of Toyama, to which he replies, ""You can't live at all unless you pay the full price."" Ichise has been doing this the whole time; Toyama has an oversight in judgment and ends up eventually becoming one of the Shapes. 

Ichise learns that Doc lied about his mother, and that she actually dumped the contents of the vial. When Ichise attacks her, she asks for his forgiveness, and he actually gives it. He soon accepts his limbs once more, without a dependence on them containing his mother this time.

Rogue 18: Throne

- Kano sits upon his worthless throne. Humanity's reign has ended.

Sakimura, who idolized Yoshii, sees a hallucination of him in one of the Shapes, eagerly running up to it and asking, ""Yoshii. Is this what you wanted to do?"" in an attempt to determine if there was meaning in Yoshii's actions and his death. Recall, Yoshii's claim, ""True freedom can't lean on anything."" Sakimura is still leaning on Yoshii rather than his own power. The Shapes were not what Yoshii wanted to do and are in opposition to it.

Doc Eriko asks Ichise to hold her as she's ""feeling afraid."" Ichise does so and she says, ""This is how my texhnolyzation should be used."" This also emphasizes the divide between her views on transhumanism and that of the Shapes.

Rogue 19: Heavenward

- Ichise heads to the surface world with Doc and Sakimura, hence Heavenward. It's tragic irony though, as the surface is actually likened to Hades once they arrive—it is no utopia.

We learn that Doc's cells are in the bio-circuit of Ichise's texhnolyzed arm. The reason she lied about it containing his mother was to make sure he didn't treat the arm carelessly. ""I just had to make sure you would take good care of it. If not anything else, then at least this arm."" In the last episode it becomes clear why the arm is so important as it projects an image of one of Ran's flowers as Ichise dies.

Throughout Lux there was recurrent usage of trains and train tracks; once they reach the surface world the train tracks end, immediately showing the viewer that it is a dead end. A statue of an Angel without a head and arms is shown.

Ichise notices a flower once again and once he touches it it wilts and dies. He then looks back towards Lux.

The surface world citizens are likened to ghosts.

""Where are the people?"" asks Doc to which Sakimura replies, ""I don't know where they are. Maybe there aren't any human beings left in this place anymore.""

The people of the surface world represent Nietzsche's ""Last Man.""

Rogue 20: Hades

- The surface world is Hades, a hell—Lux is where people were truly ""alive.""

Doc's entire purpose has been destroyed upon seeing the surface world, she claims that she has become one of the ""ghosts,"" and cannot leave, soon committing suicide. She views herself as an anachronism.

""This is a place for dead people. No one is alive here."" —Ichise

Ichise encounters several of the ""theonormals"" on the surface, one of whom says it would have been nice if he stayed there forever (because Ichise is actually living). 

Toyama assaults the surface with other Shapes, Ichise kills him, at which point Toyama says, ""Thank you, brother."" While this is able to interpreted as him merely giving thanks to Ichise as a ""brother"" from the Organo, it is clear that Toyama's relationship with Ichise has often been akin to that of an actual brother as well.

Ichise apologizes to the ghost of his father—a very important moment for him.

Rogue 21: Encephalopathy

- Ran shows the citizens of Lux her visions and they go mad.

Kano (an egoist) refers to Ran as Theoria. One of the residents of Gabe delivers a monologue about returning to the Raffia. Shinji goes to kill the Class (see earlier in the review for more on him). Ichise returns to Lux and sees a vision of Ran. He wishes to take Ran to the surface world because no one kills one another there.

""Why did you look after me? Whenever I was in trouble I found flowers that I'd never been able to have before. So what choice have I got? I have to protect you."" —Ichise

Onishi ""kills"" Ran, the Voice of the City, by stabbing the Obelisk. Ichise watches as the citizens, driven mad, kill Onishi.

""If the only way to be granted life in this world is to surrender my body and soul to insanity then I shall choose to meet my doom!"" —Onishi

Rogue 22: Myth

- Humanity goes extinct, becoming myth.
- The title may also double as another reference to one of Camus's works, his philosophical text, The Myth of Sisyphus, wherein he describes his absurdist philosophy and later relates it to Sisyphus, who was condemned to forever roll a boulder to the top of a mountain only to see it roll back down, at which point he would have to begin anew. Camus claims that Sisyphus recognizes how futile it is but continues anyway, thereby conquering it and being content with it. He imagines Sisyphus is happy.

Ichise, upon witnessing the death of Onishi, flies into rage and kills the last humans in Lux after being shot multiple times. Ichise's texhnolyze limbs begin to fail to function, but Doc had adapted them prior, and are thus able to work once more. In other words, she helps him to get back on his feet, again. 

Ichise sees the Shapes rooted to the ground. He encounters Kohakura who says, ""Someone told me long ago what this place is. He said this is the Ninth Annex of the Reviving Hell.""

Ichise asks a vision of Ran if he's changed. He realizes he has remained the same person in some ways and relates that what he's been doing has been the same thing—just trying to survive.

""Does that mean that whatever I do doesn't change no matter what? That isn't so, is it?"" —Ichise

Ichise punches the solipsist Kano, killing him. He returns Ran to the Raffia. He then lies against a pillar and slumps over, where Ran's prophecy finally comes true in its entirety. A projection of a flower appears from his texhnolyze arm. Realizing it was Doc who placed it there and likely Ran who has returned to the Raffia projecting it, he feels satisfied with his life and the meaning he found through his relationships with others. He smiles, and dies a happy death.

With a discussion of each of the episodes complete here are some other ideas and topics that are worth considering and thinking about.

Section I: Is Yoshii a villain?

No, I don't think he can be considered a flat-out villain. Some actually consider him to be the protagonist of the series (or at the very least the protagonist of the first part) since Episode 10 ends with his death and is titled Conclusion. In this case I might call him an antihero. The series lacks anything that could be called a hero in the modern conception of the word though, and I think labelling the characters with any of these terms is something of a futile endeavor (see below), although I do believe that Ichise has the most heroic qualities. 

I don't think we are meant to apply morals as we understand them to Yoshii, since Yoshii himself has revaluated the values of his society to reach his views. He was ""active"" in a ""passive"" nihilistic society. He wants to force the people of Lux wake up, thereby allowing for the affirmation of their lives. As he sees it the people of Lux aren't nihilistic like those on the surface, but merely afflicted by a ""plague,"" of which they are aware, but which they have not yet found a way to accept. This can lead to nihilism unless they are active against it. Yoshii believes that in inciting them to become active and affirm life he can prevent them from eventually becoming ""passive,"" resigned, and nihilistic like those on the surface are. Whether his intentions are noble enough to justify the means is left ambiguous; they are neither framed as right nor wrong but left up to interpretation, as is nearly everything in the series. What the series does frame as important though is what the views of the characters led to and what it means for them. The series does seem to frame the idea that beliefs of theirs or their created meanings for life can lead to a life where one truly ""lived"" and a happy death, and this is therefore more of a ""good"" ending for them. On the other hand, nihilism and the choices of the Shapes are condemned. For the most part, it seems to bounce back and forth between absurdist and existentialist ways of living life for the characters as ways to find satisfaction with it.

From Yoshii's point of view nihilism is the ultimate ""evil,"" worse than even death. The surface world is a society where morality does not exist and death is meaningless. Up there killing is viewed as neither right nor wrong, good nor evil. He gave up on this society because in the absence of morality there is no chance of anything he does changing the people—when there is nothing to judge him upon, nothing can be condemned. (In his society, that is. As comparison, consider when you go to another country you are subject to the laws of that country. On the Surface world no such laws exist and he therefore cannot be subject to these nonexistent decrees. An interpretation with regards to perspectivism might be considered.) Lux is a dying world to him, slipping towards a similar end as the surface. Yoshii created his own new values on the surface, a place devoid of any such values. His acts are in his view creative, where nothing is unjustified since they are undertaken in his pursuit of the prevention of the complete degradation of humanity. Even deplorable and inhuman means are not, in his outlook, evil. This interpretation tries to probe more into the nature of ""good and evil"" as it exists (or does not exist) within the world of Texhnolyze and the views of the characters within the series and without regards to our own views on the topic. In calling Yoshii ""evil"" this applies a personal or more modern view to the interpretation of his character, which I think is fine, but I also think it is worth considering him in his own society with how things are there. His desire to ""see humanity beautiful once more"" is not detached from his ""moral"" values since the desire directly stems from the principles. For him, whether or not to choose violent means is irrelevant since he views nothing as unjustified to achieve his objectives. He is more ambiguous and difficult to understand for these reasons.

Yoshii has moments to demonstrate that his values are the driving force behind his actions and that they are not undertaken merely because he wants to engage in violence: ""True freedom can't lean on anything. It's transient, lonely, and arduous. You can't hope for security or reward beyond it.""; ""I want to enlighten them. So they can believe more in their own power. Now I'm beginning to see, that is my mission.""; ""This is absurd. I'm your friend, you know.""; When Ichise meets him for the first time Yoshii sees Ichise as someone similar to himself. To say he prefers to engage in violence merely out of preference would require ignoring much that he said or did that defines him as a character. The violence is a result of it. Nothing he says or does implies that he is using his words or other actions simply in an attempt to justify the use of violence, because he would not see this as necessary to do so in the first place. He comes from a place (the Surface) that lacks morality; what need would he have to create a value system merely to justify violence when there is no need to justify anything in the society he was from? It's the values that he has created for himself that truly matter to him. 

Section II: Morality in Texhnolyze

The Surface World condemned all of its undesired (violent and/or criminal) elements to Lux 100 years prior. On the Surface morality stagnated. Good and Evil lost meaning because there was only ""good"" from a moral point of view. With the moral good being all that existed morality lost meaning altogether. Where there was no moral evil there was only moral good, and the knowledge of the moral evil was lost. Only the ideals associated with moral good were existent and deemed relevant. The Surface drove Yoshii to despair because natural elements belonging to humanity were lacking. The Surface world denied impulses natural to humanity. Yoshii was an immoralist, but he embraced life, including the good and the evil (as morality describes it) sides of it. He revaluated what good and evil meant. He had a passion for this life—a Dionysian passion(^). In embracing his Dionysian side he embraced humanity as a whole. It raises the question: Did anyone love humanity more? 

Lux lacked the moral good and developed by means of its own chaotic interactions. In Lux power ultimately prevailed above all else. Much of humanity appears to be in decline. Yoshii wants them to believe more in their own power and less in an ideal. Ideals can lead to stagnation in his view. He wants to have the people of Lux acknowledge the suffering of existence and embrace it.

^Note that I use Dionysian here more in the way the term was developed after The Birth of Tragedy rather than the way it was described there.

Section III: Philosophy in Texhnolyze

Seeing as Nietzsche has just been brought up: all philosophy is a mere part of the whole in Texhnolyze. Anyone who tells you that Texhnolyze is all about Nietzsche or anyone else is being dishonest. 

Section IV: Free Will and Destiny

Fate plays a role in Texhnolyze, but how is this fate really depicted? It appears rather ambiguously portrayed and resolved by the series itself. Is free will existent in the series or is it fatalistic? Does it even really matter whether it is fatalistic or not?

Section V: Truth

There is no truth. 

Texhnolyze managed to capitalize on all the potential it had in the greatest way possible making it a work that I can wholeheartedly describe as a glorious triumph within the animated medium. Riveting and thematically rich, psychologically intriguing, and dramatic in remarkable ways, Texhnolyze was a very rewarding experience. Yes, Texhnolyze may seem like an absurdist series in ways, but I also believe that it can be seen as a series about seeking meaning in that meaningless world, with hope—it can be viewed as an existential series. While the series may integrate the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche or Albert Camus or whoever else at times, it never frames any of what they believe as the ""truth""; it's just using some ideas, not being defined by them. And it isn't even necessary to know what Nietzsche (or Camus, etc.) is all about to enjoy the series anyway. It's merely interesting to note when some of their ideas come up. Texhnolyze ends with the extinction of humanity—an empty age. The final scene is the slow fading away of the city, and finally the slow fading away of Ichise, the endling of the human species—the last living human. Perhaps this ending seems like a completely depressing, soul-crushing conclusion to some—but I disagree. When the ending is examined a little closer one will find perhaps the most inspiring and optimistic message within it in all of anime. An ending that is nothing short of perfection. An ending that exemplifies what the series wants to express flawlessly. A necessary end. Despite the fact that all who live will inevitably someday meet their end there are still those who can find meaning in their lives—as humans."

The Dangers in My Heart Season 2 was an incredible run from start to finish, and I cannot believe how far we have come since the “cringe” start at the beginning of this series. This season has provided a ton of fun, quite a few laughs, quite a few pay-offs, and some emotional moments as well. Apart from the sheer sweetness of this series, Kyoutarou’s growth has been incredible to watch, and as someone who shares some of the same traits as him, like being an introvert, some of his character growth really resonated with me, and he continues to be easily my favourite character in this series. It is so early in the year, but it is already an anime of the year contender for me.

I tend to like most romance anime that I have watched, but the one wall that they almost always hit is never really escaping the “Will they, won’t they?” phase of the show. Characters meander and the story progression goes at a snail’s pace, which in due time, makes the story lose its charm. A big reason for that is the caricatures and tropes of the characters that are in love. For example, whenever the main female character is a tsundere, all we see is her punching the dude or denying her feelings. In this show, there is no such annoying trope, and the dynamic between the two leads is a breath of fresh air. It’s just two somewhat socially awkward teens just getting to understand one another, without the progression being too dragged out. Of course, I also love seeing the female lead be taller than the male lead, as it is just a unique touch to the whole dynamic.

Another aspect of the series I really enjoy are some of the subtleties to the character growth. The characters feel somewhat realistic, in that they physically grow, something normal for their age of course. Kyoutarou grows a little taller, his voice deepens a bit, and Anna might be a bit excited, but it was never a huge deal. The characters understand more about one another at a nice pace. What was unknown at one point gets learned later on, such as when Anna understands how Kyoutarou would retract back into his shell when he was in certain situations, or Kyoutarou would understand how Anna would feel at a particular time. When they talk to each other, they might stumble on their words sometimes, but when it matters, they know exactly what to say. Overall, I really enjoyed how the show never got “in your face” about the character growth.

Kyoutarou has been a pretty relatable character to me to some extent, especially with his introversion. Kyoutarou's challenges with socializing and public speaking kind of resemble how parts of my life have went. I was a pretty chatty kid, but as I grew into my teenage years, for some reason I got more reserved, and I had stage fright and a fear of public speaking. Yeah, I took drama classes, and classes that required me to talk with others, but I was not, and still am not the most talkative person around in the slightest. Whenever I saw Kyoutarou talk to his inner self, while it might feel somewhat cliché, it always was executed perfectly because it acknowledges that a lot of the time, the biggest thing holding someone back is themselves. Deep down, they know they can do whatever they set their mind to, but they sell themselves short. Like people say, sometimes a person's worst enemy is themselves, so whenever Kyoutarou achieved something substantial, I was so proud of him. 

As for the other characters, there aren’t any real weaknesses to the cast. Anna of course is a very cute, somewhat awkward character that put a lot of proactive care into developing the relationship further. Most of the other characters were really fun to watch, and support the main duo very well. They all know about Kyoutarou and Anna’s blossoming relationship, but they always let the two grow by themselves (save for that flash mob group), even if they would sometimes create situations where that was possible. The parents, relatives, friends, everyone in their social circle were so supportive, and happy whenever both Kyoutarou or Anna were successful, to the point where it would always warm my heart. No unnecessary family drama, no unnecessary love triangles, just friends and family being wholesome and supportive. Moeko and Kana probably had the best moments as side characters, but there is not one bad character in this series. No, not even the perverted guys. Sure, it might be a bit exaggerated, but people at that age always have something dirty to talk about.

The visuals and directing were for the most part, very solid. The blurriness does get a little much at times, but it never hindered my enjoyment. The staff did a fantastic job of really having the emotional moments hit hard. Kensuke Ushio, who worked on the music, continues to show that he is one of the best in the business right now, right there with Kevin Penkin and Evan Call, possibly Hiroyuki Sawano as well, at really elevating the show to new heights.

It has been nothing but joy watching this show every week. I never thought a romcom could surpass Kaguya-sama: Love is War for me, but this has been something truly special. The sheer state of giddiness I would be in before starting each episode was a testament to how much of an impact this show has had on me. Whether or not we see this series return anytime soon, it’ll still hold a place near and dear to my heart, which was in danger almost every week of watching this.

'There's no guarantee we have a tomorrow together, and if there isn't, then maybe I should try for what I want a little.""

151040,"I state that I have not seen the original series and I have not read the manga so this will be a review made by a person who approaches the Trigun universe for the first time. On the bright side, here you can read the impression this series has made on someone completely immune to any unnecessary comparisons. Since the show's worldbuilding is one of its strengths, I'll try to avoid heavy spoilers so as not to affect anyone's viewing.


PLOT

The vital center of the narrative of Trigun Stampede is the relationship that alternates fraternity and enmity between the protagonist Vash and his brother Millions Knives. The series is set on No Man's Land, a barren planet where humanity has landed after an expedition from planet Earth. The only way for men to survive in this desolate land is by relying on plants, ""tubs of liquid"" with an entity inside them that allows the production not only of energy but also of food and water.
The story begins in medias res and precisely follows the story of Vash the Stampede after his meeting with 2 journalists who arrived in the area in search of news. The plot is one of the strong points of the show, thanks above all to the incredible worldbuilding that the series demonstrates in just 12 episodes. The species that populate the planet, the functioning and nature of the plants, the information on the Seeds Project (the expedition I mentioned earlier): all these elements contribute to making the discovery of all the aspects that characterize the world very interesting.

The main plot instead deals with the relationship between Vash and Knives, which culminates in the final 2 episodes, the absolute peak of this season. Their bond is explored in their personalities, their past before the narrative begins, and especially their goals. The insights we have available allow us to fully immerse ourselves in their situation and to understand their reasons and their hatred.
The pacing of the narrative immediately proves to be very quick and direct, leaving little room for comedy and giving much more weight to the action and dramatic aspects. This has pros and cons. The very direct pace and focused solely on the plot slightly lacks in the characterization of secondary characters such as the 2 journalists, even if it still manages to give excellent space to the main ones. As an advantage, being aware of the presence of many filler episodes in the original series, it has that of having a more entertaining story, which does not get too lost in minor passages or superfluous elements.


CHARACTERS

Trigun Stampede has proven to be a very careful series in the characterization of the main characters, even if its fast narration logically prevents us from dwelling on all the members of the cast.

-[Vash the Stampede](https://anilist.co/character/162/Vash-the-Stampede): He is the protagonist of the series, a kind-hearted boy who has embraced the philosophy of not-killing anyone by virtue of his traumatic past. From the start he proves to be a nice and funny person but who knows when to take the situation seriously. His guilt about the triggering fact of the series will accompany him throughout the narrative and will characterize his choices.

-[Millions Knives](https://anilist.co/character/1599/Knives-Millions): He is the antagonist of the series and my favorite character. Of a much more malignant nature than his brother Vash, he has the goal of taking over the plants present on No Man's Land for reasons that obviously I will not say to avoid spoilers. His characterization and the way his motivations are presented make him an incredibly defined and well fleshed-out character. The moment in which a spectator manages to see himself in the will of the villain, to the point of even giving him reason for what he does, is the moment in which he realizes that we are in the presence of an excellent villain. One thing that is truly indicative of his and Vash's couple dynamic is that of the two, it is Vash who seems self-righteous in his will and his choices while Knives proves to be the more thoughtful and clear-headed. This reversal of the classic protagonist-antagonist relationship is an element that I particularly loved in Trigun Stampede.


-[Meryl Stryfe](https://anilist.co/character/713/Meryl-Stryfe): She is one of the 2 journalists Vash meets in the first episode. Meryl is a petite girl and absolutely helpless in the face of the enemies that populate No Man's Land but she is still a strong and very determined person from the anime. Her impotence, unfortunately, prevents her from having a decisive role in the story (except for the ending) so she, due to the characteristics of the pacing mentioned above, gives the impression of being the most out of place in this context. However, you have all the space and time to make up for it in a sequel which, from the season finale, would seem almost more focused on the characters than on a crackling story like this ""prologue"".

-[Roberto De Niro](https://anilist.co/character/289467/Roberto-De-Niro): It is the 2nd journalist and Meryl's senpai. A man no longer young who has seen a lot in his years of work and for this reason he always proves to be very aware of his surroundings, making him a character capable of taking care of Meryl.

-[Nicholas D. Wolfwood](https://anilist.co/character/722/Nicholas-D-Wolfwood): It's a character that Vash meets after leaving Jeneora Rock. He immediately proves to be the very badass character and immediately creates an excellent dynamic with Vash who has their difference in personalities at the center, especially as regards Vash's good-naturedness, which he considers inadequate and dangerous for the protagonist himself.


ANIMATIONS AND MUSIC

In the unlikely event that anyone does not know, Trigun Stampede is animated entirely using CGI (Computer-generated imagery), which is a method of computer animation in 3D. This animation technique has always been at the center of numerous controversies in many anime released in recent years. Personally, I've never had absolutely anything against its use, obviously in case it's used properly (but this could be said of anything). 
The quality of Studio Orange's CGI (Houseki no Kuni, Beastars) is absolutely at the top of the entire Japanese animation industry and this anime is yet another, if not the most decisive, confirmation of it. The fluidity of the scenes is incredible and the models are very clean but in this show the directorial creativity is the master which raises the spectacularity of the action scenes to the highest possible level. Every fight, every shot, and every camera play is in fact much easier to achieve in a Full CGI anime and in Trigun Stampede it finds its maximum expression in artistically breathtaking scenes and with a quality that in 2D anime is as difficult to find as a needle in a haystack. A note of merit must also be given to the excellent character acting which is one of the most difficult elements to master in 3D: the expressions and the way the characters express themselves are incredibly effective and greatly elevate the very personality of the speaker.
The show is also characterized by some tertiary characters made in 2D but above all by one of the choices I most appreciated: Wolfwood's past drawn in this style in full contrast to everything the series had shown so far.

Also from a musical point of view the show has really good ideas. The inserts used during the fights greatly increase the level of hype and so do those for more dramatic contexts. Here too the peak of this element and of the technical side in general is found in the extraordinary presentation of the last 2 episodes.
But the thing that most attracted me to this anime from the first episode is the wonderful western sci-fi atmosphere that it presents thanks to magnificent settings that play on the desert-futuristic contrast and obviously also thanks to the musical sector (I recommend seeing the animated scene below with audio to get an idea of what I'm talking about).

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, Trigun Stampede was certainly one of the most surprising and impactful anime in this winter 2023 season. Its story, its worldbuilding, the relationship between its characters, its technical rendering and much more have contributed to creating a season of great emotional value and of great interest for future developments. I'm sorry that the series was badly received only for the absence of a character from the original series, a changed haircut and an animation method different from the classic 2D. I certainly recommend it to all those who do not have problems with these elements, whether they are new to the world of Trigun and to readers or viewers who are already somewhat familiar with its content.

15379,"Haruka Kotoura was an ordinary little girl.  She was born into a wealthy family to a pair of loving and doting parents, but she wasn’t at all spoiled.  She was well liked by her peers, and had an easy time making friends, right up until something peculiar happened...  She began reading minds.  At first, she didn’t even notice this.  She could hear peoples’ thoughts as naturally as their voices, so she assumed this was normal, and people were telling her things they wanted her to hear.  It started small, winning every round of rock-paper-scissors, but it quickly snowballed into who had a crush on who, secrets her parents were keeping, small resentments that should have stayed hidden, and ultimately the fact that her parents were cheating on each other. 

This new power, the consequences of which she couldn’t possibly understand, tore her life to shreds.  Her friends deserted her, doctors refused to treat her, her parents abandoned her, and everywhere she looked for support or affection, a few select words echoed in everyone’s thoughts...  Monster.  Creepy.  Freak.  Liar.  These words would follow her for the next decade until a broken, hopeless young woman finally decided to change schools...  And that’s where she met Manabe, a dimwitted class clown who didn’t find her abilities weird or creepy...  He thought they were cool!  This new encounter would only be the start of Haruka’s journey to undo the trauma that she’d endured throughout her life, but will it all be too-little-too-late?  Or is she truly worthy of the life she’s been given?

Kotoura-san was produced by AIC, a Japanese studio whose pedigree stretches back to the late 1980s, and whose output is every bit as eclectic as my personal taste in music.  They’ve dipped their fingers in basically everything, from soft-core porn to heartwarming wholesome sports drama, pumping out mostly weird and quirky titles that either pique the interest of the anime fandom and then die out in a couple years, or remain in the public consciousness entirely because of how bizarre they are.  Their most famous titles seem to come from franchises like Tenchi Muyo that were already famous BEFORE AIC got to take a crack at them, if that tells you anything. 

What’s more interesting about AIC is that from the early 2000s up to the end of it’s life in 2014, it started branching off into smaller studios.  AIC Plus, AIC Build, AIC Spirits, AIC ASTA, and in this case, AIC Classic, a subsection that only produced three titles(and their respective OVAs).  One of them was Ebiten, a show so weird that I had wildly different experiences both times I watched it, and another one was today’s subject, Kotoura-san.  Like most of their work, The animation feels like it had a somewhat modest budget...  Not dripping with cash, but not forced to cut corners to make ends meet either...  That it had just as much money as it needed, and it made every penny count.

It’s hard to look for trends in AIC’s catalogue, but Kotoura-san has the style of it’s director all over it.  You probably know Masahiko Ohta from titles like Yuru Yuri and Himouto Umaru-chan, and that’s basically the aesthetic you’ll see here.  Bright colors from a soft water color palette, somewhat cartoony character design combined with more-or-less realistic proportions below the neck, just exaggerated enough to create a design style that’s very easy on the eyes, cute and moe for the most part but more than capable of providing fanservice when needed.  Kotoura-san isn’t really a fanservice show...  It has it’s moments, mostly for comedic purposes...  Rather, it takes the versatility of Ohta’s character designs in a different direction.

The cast of Kotoura-san looks soft and cartoony at first glance, but they are extremely expressive.  They support a wide array of facial expressions, a lot of which do serve the comedic side of the story perfectly, but their dramatic expressions?  THAT is on another level.  I can’t begin to count the number of moments when a sudden shift in someone’s expression, particular with the title character, gave me goosebumps, or straight up hurt my heart.  I felt what these characters felt, way more often than I would normally expect from a 12 episode anime, although the music did play a part in that.  Yasuhiro Misawa has composed a lot of OSTs for Ohta, and while he does your standard plinky-plink anime sitcom music perfectly fine...  A show like Kotoura-san wouldn’t exist without some BGM like that...  His music is far more remarkable during the emotional moments, when he switches to full orchestra, letting violins and other string-based instruments dominate the tracks that play softly in the background of sad scenes, and get cranked up to eleven whenever it needs to overwhelm you in a tense or suspenseful moment.

There’s no English dub as of this writing, and there will probably never be one, but the sub track is still pretty appealing, even to my ignorant monolingual ears.  I don’t have anything specific to say about most of the cast, who play their roles perfectly, but the one standout in particular to me is Hisako Kanemoto, the original voice actor of Squid Girl if you can believe it, playing Haruka as the most precious gorram thing ever, simultaneously adorable and fragile, but still with tight comedic delivery whenever she’s dealing with Jun Fukushima’s rowdy Manabe.  The lack of a dub is disappointing or me, but I like the Japanese version just fine, and you should too.

Is it just me, or was 2013 a really big year for anime?  I guess it’s possible that I’m biased, as that was the one year I really got into seasonal releases, but there were a lot of high profile titles debuting that year.  There was Attack on Titan, Kill La Kill, Love Live, Watamote, Log Horizon, Nagi Asu, The Devil is a Part Timer...  Those titles alone are massive, but when you add in continuations of popular shows like Haganai, Oreimo, Fate, Ghost in the Shell and my personal favorite season of Rozen Maiden, you create a field where there’s just a ton of competition lurking around every corner.  I’ve reviewed a dozen anime from this year, more than any other individual year so far.  Not only were there a ton of major game changers, but even the dregs were at least interestingly bad.  Anime as uniquely terrible as Amnesia, Diabolik Lovers, Dog X Scissors and Sasami-san@Ganbaranai couldn’t have come out any other year.

The reason I bring this up is because it’s the best explanation I can come up with for just how obscure Kotoura-san is.  If there was a year for a good show to get thoroughly lost in the shuffle, especially in the winter season, 2013 was it, and yet that still doesn’t explain how it fell flat compared to crap like Senran Kagura and Cuticle Detective Inaba.  I guess it’s possible that it just didn’t have a catchy sounding title...  A name like Kotoura-san doesn’t exactly grab you, but then again, the name the western market came up with...  The Troubled Life of Miss Kotoura...  Doesn’t sound that much better.  I’m being intentionally coy, of course.  I am aware of the major backlash this series faced, I just don’t like talking about it because it’s complete horse shit.  When this show first aired, it caught a lot of criticism for being emotionally manipulative, which I absolutely do not see. 

I mean sure, the first episode starts off by showing you an extended flashback to the main character’s childhood, and how her ESP ability ruined her life, and yeah, you’re supposed to feel really bad for her after seeing it, but that’s not manipulation.  When I hear the phrase ‘emotional manipulation’ used to describe an anime, I think of shows from the critically lauded Key trilogy, as popular as they are.  Melodrama framed as actual drama, hyper-idealized waifus dying from moe mystery disease, all to inspire a couple of manly tears from some bland dude at the center whose entire harem would rather die alone than pork anyone else.  Blatantly using wish fulfillment tropes to get you invested before the tragic shit drops out of nowhere is true emotional manipulation.

Harems are not realistic.  Five year olds who immediately accept their father who they’ve never seen before, behave perfectly when left alone all day and then just die for the feels are not realistic, they’re manufactured, which makes them manipulative.  When it comes to Haruka’s backstory, however, the only part of it that feels unrealistic is the fact that she can read minds.  Everything else feels real.  The way people react to her feels real.  The fact that Haruka didn’t know she was doing anything wrong until it was too late to change it feels real.  The fact that she finds one final source of solace, a stray kitten she bonds with, only for her psyche to absolutely shatter when it’s abruptly taken away from her, feels painfully real, but most of all is the experience of rejection by society, the loneliness and isolation that results from being a variety of ‘different’ that your peers aren’t ready to accept in a world that’s constantly bombarding you with the advice to ‘just be yourself.’

I’ll admit that with a scenario like this...  Or the one from Watamote, if you will...  In order to appreciate just what Kotoura’s going through, you kind of have to have had a taste of it yourself.  Personally, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome as a toddler, and I have honestly never known what it’s like to be a normal person with normal thoughts and behaviors, and even now that I’m older and happier with my lot in life, there’s always going to be a massive disconnect between me and normal people.  Luckily, though, the first episode doesn’t dwell on any of this.  Kotoura-san lets you know very early on, and very efficiently, what the main character went through, why she is how she is, and just how many layers of trauma she’s carrying on her at all times before introducing Manabe in one of the most well timed and deliriously funny ways possible, letting you know that okay, from here on, it’s time to start healing.

Haruka has a ton of issues.  Some are on the surface, like her fear of hurting those close to her with her abilities, others are deeper, like her guilt and general lack of self-worth.  Her issues are handled with a shocking level of respect and maturity, given that this is a comedy anime, and at no point does any of it feel disingenuous.  One thing I noticed is that Kotoura-san does not fuck around with it’s story, or Haruka’s arc.  Nothing is ever milked, nothing is ever dwelled on, and despite everything that’s happened to her, Haruka never goes all emo on us.  This is pulled off through a genius trick of pacing where Haruka is constantly working on her smaller issues, overcoming them and moving on, but her larger issues are always lurking in the background, making their presence known through brief references and subtle visual cues.

Another criticism I see this show get is over the inconsistent tone, which, yeah, okay, fair, but I actually kind of like that.  Sure, the drama and comedy might not blend as fluidly as they do in Ouran Highschool Host Club, but they’re both made out of really strong material, and if anything, the fact that they clash just makes them each feel stronger.  If I hadn’t been laughing my ass off five minutes prior, I might not feel as disturbed when I see Haruka have a visceral reaction to someone using a trigger word like ‘Monster’ on her.  Haruka’s journey throughout the story is a powerful one, and there is potential in tonal dissonance to amplify power when used right.  This is one of the few series that make me cry every time I see it, with both happy tears and sad tears in equal portions.

And the comedy, likewise, is outstanding.  In my opinion, casting the girl crazy comic relief loser(who would normally be a supporting role at best) as the male lead in a romantic comedy was a galaxy brain move.  Most characters in his position would either be a cool, stoic dreamboat or a firey, hotheaded tough guy, your simple fire vs. ice dynamic, your Edward vs. Jacob if you will, Manabe is neither.  He’s an idiot.  He’s earnest, loyal and outgoing, a complete airhead, and yet the way he supports Haruka...  The way he broke through her shell when nobody else would...  I never for once doubt her feelings for him.  They have this really unique dynamic where he’ll fantasize about her in these over-the-top, completely self aware ecchi scenarios just to tease her so she’ll become flustered and interrupt his fantasy, an idea that COULD sound creepy and lecherous on paper, but winds up feeling adorable and downright hilarious in practice.

The comedy in general is really quirky and unpredictable, with very few running gags, and the ones we do get are constantly evolving.  There are moments when one interaction will be happening, but if you pay attention to the background of the shot, or even to the body language of characters who aren’t even talking, there’ll be a whole other layer to the joke just waiting to be noticed.  The story goes to some weird places for comedy’s sake, and while I can’t say they all pay off, they can be amazing when they do.  Seeing Haruka’s rich grandfather build a theme park for Haruka featuring her likeness is just weird, and not in a fun way so much as in a ‘what the fuck am I supposed to do with this’ kind of way.  On the other hand, seeing him and Manabe try to dig their own hot spring out of disappointment for the real one being closed, only to strike oil by accident, and the rest of the scene plays out with construction vehicles working in the background as he adds that oil to his already considerable wealth, that’s fucking great.

There are moments that honestly feel like the pacing may have been a bit too efficient, like they had extra space they didn’t know what to do with, but luckily, Haruka and Manabe have costars who are more than strong enough to offer their own contributions to the series in order to pick up some of that slack.  In episode two, Haruka and Manabe get recruited to a club called the ESP Research society through some SOS Brigade-like hijinks(yes, there’s an element of Haruhi Suzumiya in this show, we’re talking about the early 2010s, hell there were like half a dozen titles in the 2013 winter season alone that ripped Haruhi off to some degree) and it’s through this encounter that we not only get the school club setting to serve as a foundation for the story, but the character of Mifune, who has a fair share of ESP related trauma of her own to deal with. 

The humor can be mean sometimes, and it can be off-balance with the more serious aspects of the show which I would argue make up more of it’s identity, especially around the middle, but the pay off at the end is definitely worth it.  There’s a story arc toward the end that’s kind of dumb...  It revolves around the police and a serial attacker, and it’s not bad or anything, which is a relief considering how unskippable it is, but it’s still kind of dumb, especially once the mystery is actually solved.  It does, however, lead me to one of my favorite aspects of this series...  The fact that no idea is ever left on the table.  I’m sure there are some possibilities involving mind-reading in a fictional setting that were never addressed, but it never feels like they actually missed an opportunity, and it never feels like there was some obvious answer to a story line problem that got ignored for plot reasons. 

By the end, it feels like it did exactly what it set out to do, and then some, and I’m not going to pretend that it’s not a mess, but it’s a powerful mess, and it’s one that I definitely recommend checking out...  If you have access to it.  As of this writing, the only legitimate way to watch this series is by streaming it on Crunchyroll.  There was a blu ray set available stateside from Aniplex, but it was an extremely limited release that’s no longer available for purchase, you can’t find it on Ebay outside of Malaysian bootlegs, and the manga never received an English release either.

So what exactly happened here?  How did this series, which managed to be equal parts adorable, hilarious and heart-breaking, manage to fall so far out of public consciousness?  Is it simply due to it’s presence in the winter season, where in any given year only one non-ecchi title will usually be enough of a cultural phenomenon to break through, and it just couldn’t compete with Love Live?  Is it the fact that a series that intentionally uses tonal dissonance to amplify its own emotional beats was just ahead of it’s time?  Or was it just such a weird, quirky, unpredictable ride that most viewers just weren’t willing to jump on board?  I don’t know, but for what it’s worth, I love it.  If you were to ask me for an under-rated hidden gem, it would be my first answer.  All I can really say is check it out and see what experience you have with it.

I give Kotoura-san an 8/10."
139648,"Difcilmente eu digo isso. Esse anime é uma obra de arte dos animes. Está entre os 100 melhores animes de todos os tempos. O início dele é péssimo do ponto de vista de apresentação. Mas a situação e o enredo mostrado ao telespectador é explicado no final de forma inteligente. Não é um anime para pessoas com intelecto baixo que só quer ver os isekais normais de protagonista overpower metendo a porrada em tudo e todos enquanto eles aparecem no caminho. É um anime político com camadas, muita conspirações e tramas estratégicas e baseado e fillosfia maquiavélica (principalmente sobre o livro de Maquiavel O Principe). E se você não gravar todos os nomes de pessoas e lugares, geografias e história dentro da história apresentados, e/ou perder um diálogo, só por alguém falar com você ou você se distrair, certamente terá a sua experiência muito prejudicada! Do primeiro minuto em que ele está no reino ao último, tudo tem uma ligação direta com outros momentos e cenas. Tudo é relativamente ou, até, extremamente importante. Não é um anime para qualquer um assistir. É bem nichado e requer um mínimo de QI considerável e intelecto detahlista se não a experiência sobre ele é muito perdido e um resumo como esse deixa de lado várias cenas e momentos importantes e extremamente importantes para o plot e o enredo do anime. Enfim. Esse anime merecia um estúdio e uma direção melhor. Digo isso pois há algumas conveniências e barrigas de roteiro que me incomodaram m pouco. Por exemplo, as conveniências de uso de magia (como todo anime tem) em relação ao protagonista de conseguir, rapidamente, usar magias especiais que poucos tinham sabedoria e nível para uso, como a de tradução e uso de magia das sombras e mas das barrigas, como a da menina Lobo que foi apresentada como super importante mas é escanteada e suas citações, ao invés de aparições, foram sempre muito brandas. O seu esquecimento foi realmente muito mal desenvolvido. Uma escolha clara da direção do anime pois, fui dar uma pesquisada no mangá e o desevilvimento da personagem e aparecições da mesma é feita de forma correta. Talvez diminuiram a participação de personagens não fundamentais para a narrativa da trama acontecer de forma mais direta e menos maçante, ainda mais por se tratar de uma série política e, se a história se ficar perdendo e se ficar focando em personagens e subtramas sem importnância acaba ficando realmente chato de assistir. Fora o trabalho de ter que saber usar o tempo que tem de apenas 12 episódios em 21 minutos para fazer toda a trama da história. Enfim. Espero muito que venha a segunda temporada desse anime pois a trama dele é incrível! Cheia de ensinamentos em várias áreas da vida, plots e plotwists"

Adorei como os cara botaro mais personagem ...
img220()
-Enredo-
Nessa história o nosso grande protagonista tem de lutar contra um vilão desconhecido mas que já havia feito ações de ódio como comandar certa parte da guerra..., realmente essa foi a melhor até agora, mais personagens, mais pessoas se revelando pro protagonista e o melhor de tudo uma aventura nova que me deixou feliz. A história realmente me surpreendeu tanto em quesitos das aparições dos personagens como as suas ações, ele realmente acompanha os fatos da temporada passada como dar um motivo ao fim da ''infinita'' guerra e sobre a pessoa que salvou o nosso protagonista no finalzinho da última temporada.  Harém ta ficando difícil de contar...
img220()
-Animação-
ESTOU FELIZ PARA KARAI, a obra conseguiu melhorar a arte e fazer um design melhor dos personagens, eles realmente mudaram muito a animação nessa nova temporada e mesmo assim ela não perde seu estilo. O hd ficou melhor depois de alguns anos, acho que isso sim foi uma bela evolução, realmente posso dormir feliz sabendo que a obra conseguiu achar seus defeitos na animação.
- Personagens-
MEU DEUS, primeiro vou falar dos personagens que já estavam na obra, o protagonista mudou muito seu jeito de ser e mesmo assim ele continua apaixonado por sua heroína, mais uma de suas colegas desenvolve uma paixão pelo protagonista, ou seja, bota +1 no harém, mas uma delas achou alguém com quem se apaixonou então acho que a contagem esta só com +2 invés de +3, F..., é realmente revolucionário como os autores conseguira botar mais 2 personagens incríveis na história, a cada vez me pergunto como eles conseguem ? Não faz sentido eles desenvolvem esses personagens junto com a história e pronto elas estão na história de uma forma intrigante e nem um pouco ruim. Isso até contribuiu pro anime não ficar o mesmo de sempre.

-Trilha Sonora-
A trilha foi algo bom, eu diria que não foi o forte dessa temporada mas ela carrega bem o peso de ter que ser uma boa trilha depois de 2 temporadas feitas..., a obra não erra o timing e eu fico muito feliz.
-Opening-
Posso chorar? Essa opening é boa demais pra ser apenas uma opening, irei escutá-la várias vezes, é realmente gratificante ver o trabalho nessas opening, espero ver uma opening boa na quarta temporada também...

11319,"Not advisable to watch if you don't want to waste time, can't tolerate annoying voice and looking for a good story.

If you like Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, I suggest you also try watching this.
This kind of anime is good after watching the whole series, but I didn't expect that I would love this because the main girl is Louise and I find her annoying in season 1. 

Story: 5/10
Louise and her familiar Saito will go to Romilia to meet the Pope because all the void mage should work together to prevent the Ancient Dragon from destroying everything. 
It's sucks how things end for Joseph, his presence makes the series interesting.
It's very cliche but at the end the power of love and friendship saves the day. It got some filler episodes and some fan service.

Characters: 10/10
The characters are likable, some characters have a great development like Agnes and Colbert-Sensei
Louise: She was annoying at first, but she becomes a bit likable after casting spell like EXPLOSION!!!. 
Saito: Your typical perverted MC but unlike harem MC he chooses a girl. 
Guiche: His character is just funny the Mr. handsome guy.
Tiffania: Saito's second master, she got a lot screen time in this season.
Siesta: The lewd maid, without her I can't tolerate watching it because of Louise.
Henrietta: Making Louise and her rival Siesta works together (a bigger threat for Saito)
Charlotte: Another princess in Saito's harem :v
Derflinger: best bro and a sword.

Art: 8/10
The art is good, I didn't see any mutant face and they didn't use CGI on the small dragons. The CGI Ancient dragon looks good also. 

Sound: 8/10
The opening and ending song are good , although I might not remember any of it after watching it because the only sound that I will remember in this anime was Louise's voice. 

Enjoyment: 9/10
I'm just biased because I watch this late and it reminds me of a lot of anime like Goblin Slayer because of the Double Moon, GATE for the Jet and modern equipment and Konosuba for EXPLOSION!!!!
Once you get used to Louise, everything becomes fine. It's very tiring to watch Saito and Louise fighting every time, but their relationship was so strong that no event or hot girl can destroy it. I actually enjoy the filler episodes more than the actual story.



I love to watch the progress of every girl in the show with Saito.

21460,"SPOILERS AHEAD

“Hibike! Euphonium. I’ll never forget how warm it sounds.”
-- Kumiko Oumae

If I was to sum up my experience with Hibike! Euphonium in just one phrase, this would be it. The final quote from our ""protagonist"" of this story, if that's what you want to call her.

 I wouldn't though. 

Kumiko Oumae wasn't the protagonist of this story. Reina Kousaka, Asuka Tanaka, Mizore Yoroizuka. None of these characters were the protagonist of Hibike! Euphonium, but instead protagonists of their own story within the compilation that is Hibike! Euphonium. 

I'll get into my scores soon, but before I comment on anything else, I want to make this clear. I cried watching this series. It wasn't during Yoroizuka's story that had felt like a punch to my gut. It wasn't during the competition finale where our favorite team earned bronze. It wasn't when Reina realized that her love was lost... for now. No, I cried at the same place where KyoAni made me cry before. The same place where I cried during the beautiful ending of K-On!. The Graduation Ceremony. 

High School anime is a popular genre, and we all know it, but nothing is worse than when a high school anime is so good that you care about every character so deeply, that you end up balling your eyes out just knowing they're leaving. As someone who graduated this previous Spring, and watched as the underclassmen waved us off, I feel like it hurt just a little more this time. Enough about me being a crybaby over fictional goodbyes though (or lack of goodbyes), I'll get into my final thoughts.

From the beginning, I loved the story and idea of Hibike! Euphonium. It was a simple one just following a concert band in their goal to win the national championship, topped nicely with drama, worldbuilding, and characters that made me want to love each and every one of them dearly. Just this second season, especially after the first 3 episodes which were a bit slow, was some of the best anime I have watched. I love idol anime, as you can easily figure out just by looking over my list, and I have a passion for music like I think we all do. Music is something that can move the world, and connect with someone no matter where they are, proven solely by the fact that all across the world, we listen to these songs that traverse barriers and ignore warfare, from Korean Music being celebrated in the US to J-Pop making its way around the globe because of this medium that we adore so much. Though, no music traverses the globe as well as an orchestra. No music can move people the way simple instruments can. That's why Hibike managed to melt its way into my heart so easily, and why the music in this series is what really tops it all off.

From the animation to characters to story, this show was another masterpiece from Kyoto Animation. It was beautiful and smooth, every character felt important and led a role that no one else could fill, with Kumiko acting as our way into this world, Asuka keeping us more attached to an empty character than seemingly possible, and Reina showing us that love doesn't just mean romance, and that sometimes the strongest love we can show is through the things, not the people, that we love. Through all of this though, the sound is what brought this series to greatness. From the roles each VA played, perfectly capturing us in scenes when they demanded the attention, from the melancholy tracks that played throughout the underlying sadness  that continued to be built off of in this high school series, all the way to the music that we listened to the band play, the music that carried the characters into our hearts, the music that made our emotions sway like a pendulum, the music that connected the world to this simple series, and most importantly, the music that even the cast held close to their hearts:

Hibike! Euphonium."
20527,"Although the premise and genre and even the events of the story lend itself to be a romance, One Week Friends has a different angle in its presentation and tells a story much more pure and wholesome. 

img750()

 Monday (Plot Concept)
The concept of One Week Friends starts as innocently as any romance story. The main character, Yuki Hase, has a passing interest in the secluded yet eye-catching, Kaori Fujimiya. With the support of his best friend, Shogo Kiryu, Hase starts to approach Fujimiya, and slowly but surely, breeches into her social circle, which, at the start of the show, is non-existent. 
	
Everything so far checks out. We have an innocent, emotional, and naïve lead, who’s holding as much good intentions as he can approaching Fujimiya. Of course, being the heroine, she has a cold exterior in class, but a soft interior when approached outside of class, and this is all too familiar. In fact, it’s this familiarity that the first episode plays on, where we’re led a false sense of security as the ever looming threat of the show’s twist follows behind these two characters. This isn’t as potent to those who may have surmised the premise from the title of the show or have read the synopsis on a streaming site, but, this dramatic irony is what makes this first encounter and twist interesting and engaging. This show isn’t just your ordinary romance. 

img750()
Tuesday (The Twist of Memory)
By the end of the first week and the onset of the next, Hase realizes his task of becoming friends and engaging with Fujimiya is one that would be filled with struggle, heartache, and reward. For reasons related to her childhood, Fujimiya’s memories reset every week, with a specific caveat of being unable to remember friends. This hook helps frame the rest of the show, with every interaction, every moment, and every development having that much more impact on the characters, and story. Although the atmosphere and tone of this show is light hearted and takes elements from slice of life, the fact that the concept of the heroine having memory loss is always relevant makes the stakes so much more potent. It feels strange to say stakes in a story that’s as calming and wholesome as One Week Friends, but the show really does lend itself to be high tension due to the fear and realization of Hase essentially meeting a new Fujimiya every episode and needing to reestablish a relationship that’s built solely on the diary she keeps. Amidst the fluff, amidst the feel good moments of the show, where Hase invites Fujimiya to do things that friends would do, like going out to eat, doing karaoke, creating memories and joy, there’s always going to be this insurmountable distance. 

img750()
Wednesday (Complexity)
It’s this complexity underlying One Week Friends that makes its tropes and characters, that much more interesting and really did invite me to consider the overlying themes it had. Memory is a huge part of the show, and the way it deals with memory through the relationships of others was an interesting angle, especially since many episodes actively used memory as a point of conflict. Either Fujimiya has a mishap one way or another and loses her diary and memory is lost, or Fujimiya’s memories seem to get better and she’s forming more connections, and memory is gained. No matter what, the theme of memory is always in the show, either in the background or in the foreground and it keeps things fresh. For me, there was hardly a dull moment in the show, as it moved at a nice forward pace, constantly giving us moments of development and characterization while dangling this complex notion of memory. Whenever things seemed to move in the right direction, the show found a way to add a new element, a new member of the cast, or a new situation, and despite the solemn nature the show had, the possibility of the relationships we’ve watched bloom fall apart was always there. Again, it’s a sense of tension we don’t usually get in this kind of show, and it didn’t feel dramatic or unearned whenever it did happen. Earning the development of the characters, earning the emotions that it wanted to display, was I think one of the stronger points of the show with some exceptions, and its unique concept definitely helped in supporting it.

img750()

Thursday (Critiques)
Of course, with the time frame of the show, there inevitably had to be cuts to tell a cohesive story from front to end which means that characterization and development with the entire cast had to be truncated. Some of the side cast that are introduced as the story moved forward was less potent. For me, the weakest part was in the information we didn’t have time to explore, in the side characters that seemed like they could go a myriad of directions and have a strong supporting role. After all, one of the lessons learned by the end of the show is how important making memories are, and we just didn’t have time to explore making memories with the other cast. Other issues I found were in motivations, especially with the main character, Hase, not having the clearest motivations, or at least, not explicit to the audience.  

There’s also the obvious, romance show that doesn’t focus on the romance but instead focuses on friendships and this idea of creating memories shouldn’t be called a romance but more of a slice of life or drama, and as such that was also something that felt lacking. To me this show isn’t a romance, despite it wanting to be one. It’s an interesting exploration of the depths of friendships, what we do to create connections, and how important memories are for our lives, and for others. There were honestly some thought provoking moments bundled in this show of warmth but that’s all ignoring what this show presented to us, which was the promise of romance. 

img750()
Friday (Conclusion) 
At the end of the week, I really enjoyed the show. Its concept is really engaging, adds an interesting twist to a formula we’re familiar with, and contributes to the complexity that the show can offer.  The characters were fun, enjoyable, and when they grew and progressed in their world, it felt rewarding to watch. Despite being so wholesome and heartwarming, the show spared no punches and when it hit it was effective. It may not be the most satisfying show if you go in with certain expectations for the characters, but, certainly, the emotions and journey that One Week Friends offer will surely last longer than its name sake."
7647,"“When the ebbing tide retreats along the rocky shoreline
it leaves a trail of tidal pools in a short-lived galaxy,
each microcosmic planet a complete society.

A simple kind mirror to reflect upon our own.
All the busy little creatures chasing out their destinies.
Living in their pools, they soon forget about the sea...”

Neil Peart, [Natural Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7W0Nm8iHwk)

Story

The story is simple. Each episode consists of a number of small chapters, which are either stand-alone or part of a short multi-chapter story. Each chapter serves as a vehicle for exploring the social order under the bridge. There is no important narrative arc with build up, climax, and resolution, and I will not rate it as if there ought to be; each chapter of Arakawa is more koan than fragment of an epic poem.

Animation

This viewing was on a 55"" OLED screen in 1080p BD.

The animation is abstract, yet artistic. I do not typically enjoy abstract art, but SHAFT manages to tie it together with beauitifully realistic backgrounds and scenery. The action is fluid and easily followed, even during surreal moments. The opening and ending videos flow nicely with the music and lyrics.

Sound

This viewing was with Japanese audio.

The voice acting was average to good.

The soundtrack was good, with a variety of styles. The opening theme is directly related to the series and was a nice way to start each episode. The second opening, which only plays for one episode, is directly about, and sung by the voice actress of, one of the characters. I do not know if the ending theme was created specifically for the series, but the lyrics and sound are fitting. Hoshi's singing was not good, nor were his songs pleasant. (But this is explained in-universe.)

Characters

The characters are each small puzzles. There is little character growth outside of Kou, himself, but each character develops a distinct personality as the chapters progress. Some characters have chapters dedicated to their reasons for being as they are, but most characters are not explained even if there are enough small hints along the way to make some reasonable guesses.

The real ""character"" is the community under the bridge. Each character is an outcast from society for different reasons, but they have found a home in the social bonds they have created with their neighbors. This is the focus of the anime, and is conveyed through a series of loosely interconnected events that flesh out the society under the bridge.

Overall

Strongly recommended for people who enjoy absurdity, philosophy and politics in their comedy.

Not recommended if you are looking for a romantic comedy. Though the tastes of romance, when present, are sweet."
12467,"What a peculiar show this was. I honestly don't even know where to start so let's just get into it. ""Nazo no Kanojo X"" or ""Mysterious Girlfriend X"" isn't a show for everyone. Aside from the admittedly somewhat weird premise it certainly has its fetishy moments though they rarely seem out of place or included without reason. In general if the idea of exchanging bodily fluids disgusts you, you should probably stay away (or at least form some scenes). Nevertheless who would I be if I let unconventional territory stop me? And so even though I accidentally stumbled upon this piece of media art I can safely say it's become one of my favorites. 

But let's start with the basics. What is this show even about? In short terms you could say it's about the developing relationship between our normal high school protagonist named Akira Tsubaki and a mysterious transfer student.... which started with him deciding to lick up her drool and in turn becoming helplessly addicted to it. Not the most normal of ways to get into a relationship. But you know a bit of supernatural flair can't hurt. This and the various other more magical properties of our heroine Mikoto Urabe's saliva which include the transfer of mental images and emotional states as well as a few others certainly make for some intersting plot setups and give a relatively grounded story a constant source for surprises. Now with all these magical properties (magical because even though the show tries to write off any explanation for the sake of mystery and metaphor it's obvious that the normal rules of our world apply to all characters without a connection to Urabe) creating a lense for us to view this stroy through what is the actual meat of the story? For me personally it's, like many shows with similar subject matters, a show about connection, empathy and understanding. As well as a boatload of confusion. 

Let me ask you a question. How many times have you heard men say that you can't understand women? Well the show uses this very sentiment along with the general theme of confusion, change and bewilderment that arises from puberty to express the wonder and ""mystery"" our protagonist feels in reponse to his partner. And while we can certainly argue about changing perspectives of young people throughout the gerneations as well as the impact of the internet on the relations between different genders I think many of us still feel/felt a certainl level of anxiety, nervous excitement, etc. when dealing with the first more serious feelings of infatuation, attraction and love. And the show does a wonderful job of transporting one back in time to this special place of restless nights. 

One also shouldn't underestimate the impact the artstyle can have on the vibe or atmosphere a certain piece of media can give off. In this case it seems very reminiscent of pre 2010s or even pre 2000s anime which is certainly unusual for a show released in 2012. A design choice that really helps to evoke this deep sense of nostalgia. In addition it's important to note that the timeless aspect of the show's setting also helps to carry this feeling. Many plotthreads don't make much sense with the advent of our modern communication technology. But take most of that away and you are left with a show that even subconsciously emphasizes the point of real connection in a very literal sense.  

The soundtrack also manages to be consistently fitting with the themes the show tackles and the reactions it wants to portray. One moment it seems cheeky in another it helps to create a more mysterious atmosphere and in a third it can play its part in conveying drama. Especially the eery dream theme seems almost as addicting as Urabe's drool.

I purposefully left out the character section in this review. Most of all because I want you to explore them yourself. Though, and that probably doesn't come as a surprise to many, the female characters are more fleshed out than their male counterparts. And while on one hand this focused perspective on the girls and of course especially Urabe truly helps in doing the title justice the show probably could have benefitted from a bit more exploration of our protagnoist. However I don't think it should or will be a dealbreaker for many especially if you are somewhat used to the genre and its machinations. Also contrary to many I don't have too much of a problem with the perceived lack of progress in the relationship (I still feel there is definitely an adequate amount of character development going on) between our two leads. I understand however that your mileage in this regard might vary. 

All in all I truly recommend this anime. I think this show manages to incorporate lessons and parts for almost everyone that can look beyond the scope of the inital premise. Whether you are currently in a slowly developing relationship yourself, feel lovesick, heartbroken or even incredibly frustrated at your lack of success in all these matters. 
Or maybe you just want to be transported back in time to a more uncertain, dreamlike but ultimately, in a different way, exciting point in time."
97768,"Caution: This review contains spoilers (the specific spoiler discussions will be clearly marked for you to see) so if you can't predict a cliched anime’s cliches, skip the spoiler sections I've marked. Also, do not read this review if you are a Grancrest diehard because it'll probably trigger you, unless if you're objective. If you're neither of these parties, read on with a free mind! Review Published June 22, 2018 on AniList

Grancrest was the first seasonal I picked up in 2018 (not saying much since it released in Jan 6 anyway) and unfortunately my 2018 mean fell right off the bat. Grancrest stumbled out of the gate and fell flat on its face for the first few episodes and took a long time to get it's footing right. There are different places where I found the show good or bad, which is why I don't consider this show absolutely trash (surprise surprise, not FranXX anyway). So it's first episode started off very conveniently in such that Theo appears out of nowhere, beats the Lord after coming out of nowhere, and picks a somewhat scantily clad girl after as mentioned (not unlike most other isekai or fantasy anime, but I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with fanservice I say :P), coming out of nowhere. Sounds like a rant so I'll tone down for the next bit. 



The show tried introducing it's characters little by little, introducing us to examples like Lassic, Milza among others for the early episodes and introduced others later down the line too. It's always good to see that not all the cast is revealed in its first episode, but unfortunately that didn't help much because we had to make room for our Oh-so-great green haired MC, Theo. Many praised his “badassery” and his “forward-thinking” and him “not being dense and weak” and I was terribly confused since none felt true except for his dense part which was randomly and conveniently revealed in a later episode. That is the problem with the show, it's that it's too convenient. “Oh Theo is gonna die” but something convenient happens and he's saved. “Oh this is gonna happen” but then to benefit Theo’s side it doesn't and the opposite direction is taken. I mean, the show makes Theo out to be like he's the coming of the Messiah or something. He comes, conquers VERY easily, is kind to people (more on that in a bit) and has people serve him in droves. I know it sounds like a rant but to be objective there's nothing wrong with having a righteous MC. It's just that in its current premise I doubt that's what's needed or what makes the most sense. What do I mean? The show is trying to prove that war is dark and to win a war there are sacrifices to be made but Theo goes Yang Wen-Li and wins the war without any well thought out tactics? No thank you. This isn't how you do a war show and definitely not how you make a badass MC. I mean, speaking of Yang, that show excellently shows why war is dark.

Where there is war there is loss on both sides and this MC is the complete opposite of that. Is there anything wrong with never losing? I don't think so, I mean, a guy like Yang Wen-Li has lost at least once and Theo never did? Don't joke with me A-1. If you're making your MC win as well, MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Speaking of believable we've got the laughable “battle tactics”. Once again, it's a show about war so it should have a proper description of what battle tactics are right? WRONG. There is absolutely no mention or any sense in the “battle tactics” involved and it's just “Charge and win” which I doubt is something that works even 10% of the time, especially when you're constantly outnumbered. A simple “We'll attack from here and there to trap them” isn't how a battle tactic works. Sense? No, definitely not. Oh and speaking of no sense, we go back to our MC, Theo. To be fair, he did have a decent backstory, I definitely have to give credit where it's due and Theo’s backstory is one that deserves a clap. Just a clap. Why? It's because it was seldom explored after that one episode and they just threw in a pre-show romantic interest and let's just say “tried to be edgy” by giving her one heck of a bombed send-off. And bombs is not the word here. The battle tactics used there as well were close to zilch I'm sad to say. How can inexperienced commoners beat an advanced army? I sincerely apologise because I do not know. Neither did the show. 

Then we move to the so called “romance subplot”. It was pretty obvious that Theo would be paired up with Blondie and unfortunately as I expected it wasn't done well. Why does Japan have a hard on for ruining blonde love interests in subplots? (Once again, there are exceptions, we have seen some good blonde love interests in other anime romance subplots before but not as often as one might expect). And this isn't about hair colour here. She was underused and overblown at the same time. She had around 2-3 important lines to say in each episode that were of value, no scratch that, 2-3 important lines every 2 episodes (severely averaged for ease of comprehensive analysis). Her only use was to satisfy the fanboys who already love Theo the “Hero"" and want a romance subplot with all the kisses and vows. What if you like me don't like Theo? Zannen-deshoka, you won't be satisfied at all. 



You might say Siluca herself might be able to stand on her own as a character but unfortunately that's not the case with most of the people in the cast. Why? It's because all the characters are cast as stepping stones for Theo-sama to step on and take this place as the best character and biggest badass in this anime. Result? Let's tone down before I turn this into a rant (“wait, it isn't?” I hear you say :P), disappointing. Convenience and stepping stones was the word here unfortunately. Now that I've spewed enough poison over poison, let's calm our nerves down with the plus points of the anime apart from the sadly less explored Theo backstory, the soundtrack. I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I jammed to the second OP each time it played, oh it was so epic. The music selection was needless to say, fantastic, and that's NOTHING to say of the BGM (that's BackGround Music to those who don't know), it was Grancrest's signature achievement. It sent chills down your spine and made you smile in anticipation of what's to come (spoilers: disappointment) and it pumped you up. The visuals thankfully weren't so bad in the OPs and EDs and on a personal note I loved both the EDs. You obviously may not see eye to eye with me but I loved both of them equally and served as an antidepressant for the earlier events of the episode. 

Now back to the negatives because I'm out of positives to give, that one scene with Milza and Theo. Since this is a major spoiler so skip approximately 3 lines if you don't want to know about this predictable fight. 

Spoiler begin: The thing is that Milza had given mercy to Theo when Theo didn't ask for it and was about to be killed in the first duel, but in the second and apparently more important one, Theo kills Milza. Nani? Why? What? How? Exactly. I thought they wanted to make Theo look like the next Messiah, what happened here? Well, one could say they wanted to make Theo look badass? I don't even know anymore, needless to say, it was in all literal and figurative sense, a bloody mess. Spoiler end 



Moving back to the stepping stones, the characters. We go with another spoiler section (will not start immediately so hold on), Alexis and Marrine’s “Romeo and Juliet romance”. Pardon me while I vomit. Okay, let's continue, in terms of anime if you've seen my dropped list I've had the Romeo x Juliet anime at a 2/10 so if you like the story of it in anime form, I don't think you'll hate it so much, unless, if you treat Grancrest like it's equivalent. Romeo and Juliet, the Shakespeare play didn't focus on war as much as the romance, because surprise surprise, it's a romance first and foremost, and another important part is that there's tragedy involved. Does Grancrest follow any of these? No. Why is Marrine and Alexis’ romance related to Romeo and Juliet? Blame the fans, but that's not the issue here. It's that this type of romance won't work in a war show. 

I've said this many times in different situations above, Grancrest does a lot of non-war things in a war show and it ruins many of the existing things relative to war shows as well. Going back to the Romeo and Juliet part, some say the Great Hall Tragedy shown in the first scene of the anime counts as tragedy but to that I say “read the original play”. In a later episode, in the final arc, the “final battle” which was hyped since the first few episodes that too, went with a POOF. And by POOF I don't mean a bomb. I mean “The anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction."" As described by Henry Gibbons. In other words, a kiss. Nani? What? Why? When? What happened to the deaths and sacrifices of all those who fought leading up to this event? Why did they hype this battle if this was how it would end? What sort of timing is this??? Marriage? Kiss? Love? Unity? Nothing wrong with all these, but the question remains. If you HAD to follow it this way, then what was the meaning of those previous 20 episodes? Were they to waste? Did they serve as bait? Couldn't this series start off at like episode 16 or 18 and be an OVA? So many questions, and little to no answers. 

And so, jumping back to the “It's a war” excuse, in a war you have major character deaths right? Where did the major characters die? Apart from a few minor characters who were obviously forgotten after the next 2 episodes when did we see the death of a main character? Once again, to be fair and objective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not having major deaths in an anime, I agree, but if you are indeed trying to show that Theo’s side was weak, then why didn't you have important deaths? Yes, the deaths in the first half did exist and they definitely served their purpose, so that's a plus point, but we didn't see anything after that… Now, a rebuttal to what people might point fingers at my review at, I'll definitely hear the likes of “Almost all your points against the show are targeting the war aspect of it. You don't know how war shows go. This show isn't about war, it's about blablabla”. Except for that last one which will definitely be used by those who don't even know what the anime is about (please, do not misunderstand, most of you aren't a part of this trope so do not worry), This show is all about war, it's called Grancrest Senki. So it's about war. 



Another example of a “war show” would be Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, which according to MAL in English is “The Asterisk War”. My point? Even though their names include the word war (or at least their English counterparts) none of them actually do follow the principles of a war show, less so in Grancrest, since it's whole premise was based on it and that immediately puts it just above Asterisk. So even though Grancrest is about war it rarely sticks to the proper formula of it and no, don't tell me it's a deconstruction, I'll kill you. 

Finally, we move on to the last issue of the show which I'll cover, the show’s artstyle. Made by A-1, I expected the show to do okay but it couldn't do that either. Character models looked weak, CGI was used in many scenes (not all), the choreography of the fight scenes themselves were so bad I cringed under my bones and to top it all off, I couldn't find it good at all even at 1080p (yes, I upscaled to 1080p episodes mid-season and still suffered with the artstyle). To go into a little more detail, the character models weren't that eye catchy and to cover for this factor they tried deploying fanservice into the war show to try and make things look attractive (oh fun fact: ever heard of showing your nude body to your army to bolster their morale? Me neither) and I'm not complaining about fanservice (since I love it when used properly) but that it's used in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Perhaps the only “fanservice” that was used at the right time was Siluca’s outfit, which was… attractive :P

Apart from that the fanservice used in the show wasn't done well and A-1 after that episode stopped deploying it and went back to CGI war sequences. Once again to make it clear. I don't have any problem with fanservice, I enjoy Ecchi, it's just that they should be done at the right time, many would say that there's no such specific time for fanservice but I’d say otherwise. If it's not an Ecchi show, don't do random fanservice please thank you. Moving back to the main artstyle, it in simple words wasn't done well for the reasons explained above. 



Spoiler begin: One of the most pathetic and biggest cop outs in the anime was how quickly they changed the villain from Marrine to the Mage Academy. It felt like a ridiculous cop out since the previous episode already ended the whole conflict of the past 20 episodes with a single “I still love you” (oh if only life and war was this easy) and as such this obviously leaves a hugely negative taste in the viewer’s mouth. But wait! There were still 4 more episodes! How ever could they fill them? By adding another villain and acting like “they were the villain all along” sort of crap. So, the whole 20 episodes of what you watched was for nothing bc Marrine suddenly became good and the last 4 episodes are important because the Mage Academy were the villains all along? They never showed up in the show before though? No mention of them was made and nothing was talked about. Yet they suddenly and extremely conveniently make their appearance to quickly put an end to the cries of “What was the point of the past 20 eps???” and from what I can see, that failed spectacularly. They continued with this bullish nature till the end… Spoiler end

For anyone wondering about it's ending, Grancrest’s ending does bring closure. Although on the cliched Shoujo side. It had it's purpose to play. The first half of the episode was as disappointing as you'd expect from the show. But the second half tried to mend those to little avail. Yeah it was cute I could say but such an ending is the same as what happened with the Marrine vs Alexis war… Not something I'd call amazing but eh, it served it's purpose I guess… I guess they wanted to follow the fairytale? Either way, Grancrest left me unimpressed.

And so with a heavy heart I must conclude that Grancrest isn't at all what I'd like to call a “good” show this year. It's plot was excrutiatingly convenient, the characters were made such that they were stepping stones for Theo, Marrine and Alexis’ romance was horribly handled and had a ridiculously lame “resolution” later on, the Artstyle wasn't what I expected, the battle tactics weren't at all present, the “final battle” was a laughable cop out, etc. the show had one or two positive points to it namely the soundtrack that was brilliantly done and Theo’s backstory was somewhat decent (although that fell apart soon after). This is all I can say to end on a positive note on this semi-rant and semi-review hybrid, not unlike my Dakara boku wa H ga dekinai review which was done in my old format back when the year started. If you made it till here, thank you for taking the time to read this review and if you do decide to watch Grancrest, please don't expect too much of it because the end result is far lower than that. Most of what you expect from Grancrest can be found elsewhere in shows that are actually good anyway right?

Finding something special is an amazing feeling, made all the more wonderful when you make that discovery in an unlikely place. Perhaps you've chuckled at a funny memory for no reason in particular, or found a cherished item you could have sworn you lost years ago. That feeling describes how I feel about Adachi to Shimamura, or Adachimura for short. I aimlessly stumbled across the show while looking for a quick seasonal to watch, and left having seen one of my favorites all-year. Why is that? Because Adachimura is enamored with that same special feeling - of meeting someone you never knew you needed, and seeing your life change forever. This review is meant to be spoiler-free, but feel free to skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you'd like to go in blind.


 img100%() 

who in skipping class find themselves hanging out on the second floor of the school gym. Our partners-in-crime form a fast friendship, which grows into something more meaningful. The show explores the uncertainty that comes with having a first crush, the nuance in navigating social dynamics, and what it means to find someone special in your life. Adachimura achieves this by frequently fleshing out the individual perspectives of our leads. At times it goes as far as to retrace its own steps, switching places to the other main character prior to a shared event. It's all about perspective. Getting into the headspaces of our girls is what Adachimura does best, with thoughtful observations providing the audience with plenty to relate to and think about. However, such perspective would be pointless if both girls were too similar, and thankfully Adachi and Shimamura are about as distinct as night and day.


 img100%() 

the only difference between her and yours truly is that I don't happen to be a kawaii high-school girl who's good at ping-pong. A habitual introvert closed off to the world around her, Adachi's walls come crashing down as Shimamura barges in. The hopeless romantic I am connects with Adachi effortlessly; I know all too well what it's like to fall for someone way out of your league. Lazy afternoons in the gym hall take on new meaning, as Adachi discovers a need in Shimamura. The smitten ""delinquent"" and her tumultuous feelings closely represent thoughts I've had for special people that changed my life. And no, I'm not just referring to the rampant hormone-induced horniness Adachi indulges in. Rather, the element that makes her arc so endearing are the changes she undergoes during this relationship. Watching Adachi's journey through her own eyes lets me know just how much her feelings for Shimamura influence her decisions. She second-guesses every tiny interaction, because Shima matters and is worth the extra thought. She trepidly tests the waters with moving the relationship forwards, because she wants to draw closer to Shima. She celebrates every small victory with excitement and relief, because knowing you need someone and are needed in return is the greatest news in the world. The way Adachi relays my past experiences back to me is just shy of a personal attack; at times her goofy naivety and awkward mannerisms leave me laughing as I hold my head in embarrassment. Having been in her shoes not too long ago, I empathize with her and root for every W she can find. Adachi discovers herself in someone else, and seeing her grow alongside her precious bond felt wholesome and rewarding.


 img100%() 

She's charming on the outside, and caring on the inside. Shimamura has her own reasons for killing time at the school gym. While her close friend is only just looking at life through rose-tinted glasses, Shima is one who's seen it all. She's never had problems clicking with peers around her, in fact she's almost spoilt for choice when it comes to picking cliques. But despite her ability to find her place amongst a sea of people, she feels lost, having yet to experience a bond that goes beyond the superficial. And it's not for lack of trying, as evidenced by her attempts at investing in relationships that didn't pay off. Her once excited, optimistic approach to life now carries a tinge of tiredness and world-weariness. Giving her all to others and putting on a likeable image has taken its toll on Shima. Her thoughtful introspection throughout the series shed some insight into interpersonal relationships from the perspective of my loved ones. In the past, my happiness over the notion that I'm liked by my friends sent my expectations of them sky-high and clouded the truth - that these people are just… people. Individuals, with wants and needs, just as I am. Shimamura showed me what it's like to be on the receiving end of those expectations. The show goes at length to depict how tiring it can be to keep up with changing dynamics, when the status quo works so well. Her caring nature is at odds with the idea that getting too attached to people is an exercise in futility. That is, until Adachi proves her wrong. Once again, Adachimura celebrates what it means to meet someone special, gradually bringing color back to Shima's world. It's a joy to watch her slowly open her heart to Adachi and welcome those innocent feelings of youth once more.


 img100%( 

Don't worry about the character introspection being nearly as dry as the essay I've put together, as the show strings together its melancholic musings with some great, witty dialogue. The show is brimming with thoughtful quotables about the human condition, as well as characterization through dialogue that gives attentive viewers plenty to chew on. Adachimura also shares the various ways people share their love through its side characters, with pals Nagafuji and Hino taking the show to new, adorable heights of gay. Speaking of side characters, we are introduced to a literal ALIEN who holds no significance to the plot other than comic relief and playing the occasional deuteragonist. IDK about you, but I find that concept incredibly funny. The Alien joins a looney astrologist and a hack fortune teller as a group of oddballs that occasionally make appearances in an otherwise grounded show, perhaps suggesting that relationships between people are as mystic and mysterious as the zany stuff I just mentioned. In any case, a playful, fantastical charm permeates every aspect of the show, depicting the mundane through cute visual motifs and a vibrant sheen. The art style is quite literally shiny, but not all there for flashy effect; strong direction and versatile stylistic choices amplify the message being shared. All-in-all, the show is just gosh-darn beautiful.


 img100%() 

One issue is how the show disobeys the adage ""Show, Don't Tell."" It spells out most of its metaphors out for the viewer with lengthy exposition. While some who struggle with reading subtext would appreciate the clarity, others might find that this adds to the series' struggle with repetition. Adding to that weakness is the constant use of anti-climax. Sure, using that device a story isn't always a bad thing, but the very nature of it inherently robs the audience from catharsis. Adachimura often succumbs to repetition and a lack of ""real"" progression. Adachi's frequent compromises are seen as the same rinse-and-repeat plot structure we've grown to dislike. Given my biases and personal experiences, all I can say is that such anti-climax is as real as it gets. 'Cause even if things stay mostly the same, there's always joy to be had in sharing that special bond. And who knows? Perhaps life has more miracles in store, and more ways to open us up to new experiences. Whether you're coming into the world with fresh eyes or have seen all there is to see, life will find a way to surprise us through the people we love.


 img100%() 

Adachi to Shimamura is enamored with the concept of love. About what it means to find yourself in someone else, about seeing the world around you in a changed light. It explores how two girls from different places in life stumble upon love, and how that love changes them. Thoughtful use of perspective creates a deep sense of empathy, as a couple of young delinquents open up to each other. Filled with charming interactions and melancholic introspection, Adachimura offered me a connection that's truly special. 8/10




- Unpopular opinion: I kinda think that Adachi getting rejected would make for a strong story decision. Sure, it'd tear my wee little heart to shreds and go against everything I've talked about so far. But as an exploration of a dynamic that I'm surely not alone in experiencing firsthand, the pair being separated seems like a natural place to be. Adachi's actions could admittedly be seen as unhealthy, so the story heading in that direction and exploring Adachi's recovery could make a lot of sense.

- How the hell did the author know I don't celebrate Christmas? Yet more proof that Adachi is stolen from my unreleased (and unremarkable) life story, I'm taking this to court!

- ""The level Adachi wants to take our relationship was so impossibly high that I'd probably need to sprout wings to even attain it."" This quote hit me HARD, had to pause for a good 5 minutes and get my bearings back.

- Who else caught diabetes at the Valentines' Day episode, pretty sure it was so sweet that my toes fell off

- Shoutout to the VA that played Ekishaman, the fortune teller from the subway station. Not only did she provide Adachi with a great character moment, but she also made the most out of her 3 minutes of fame with some hilarious line delivery.

- BEST GIRL: Tough pick, this just isn't fair. Gonna go with Brunette Shimamura, seeing her true colors slowly emerge as time went on was really sweet.

Have you ever taken up a project with full enthusiasm, only to quit halfway? Maybe you were very interested in drawing, but stopped after a week because it was too difficult and you lost your motivation. Maybe you wanted to become a programmer but you stopped because it's just too damn hard.

If so, you NEED to watch this anime.

Most inspirational anime just tell you to ""follow your dreams"" and leave it at that. This anime will show you what it REALLY takes and what you must go through.

I should warn you. This second season will hit VERY close to home. All characters in this season portray a specific negative emotion/trait that people face while working towards their dream. And if you've ever tried pursuing that big project of yours that you wanted to do, you will have faced at least ONE of these:

- Jealousy
- Fear of failure
- Overly-ambitious
- Social anxiety
- Family matters or personal circumstances
- Lack of purpose in life
- Unwilling to improve because you've partially achieved your dreams

However, this is an anime about overcoming these problems. You'll be EXTREMELY inspired when the character that had the same problem as you overcomes it. If you want to know how the characters overcame these, read the section marked with spoilers below.

The music in this anime is quite generic and forgettable. The art kept varying from average to good. These are definitely not the anime's strong suits. What's great about the anime is the chill vibes, lighthearted comedy, and... oh boy, emotions.

>SPOILERS START HERE

I hope you've watched the anime if you're reading this section. I'd hate to spoil the experience for you. But if you find that the anime made you feel something but you can't explain it, read my thoughts below and hopefully they might help you clarify your own emotions.

Aoba's Jealousy

img220()

Aoba was extremely happy to work under  her idol Kou. However, no matter how hard she tried, she could never surpass her. Eventually, Aoba realizes that she's trying too hard to be Kou. She overcomes her jealousy by accepting the fact that she can never be like Kou simply because she isn't Kou. She had to develop her own style and not rely on Kou.

>You can't be like other people simply because you aren't other people. Don't be jealous of them, learn from them and do things in your own unique way.

Yun's Inferiority Complex

img220(v)


Yun was too scared of failure. So scared that she didn't even join the character design competition because she didn't want to risk failing. Because of this, she never tried to improve her skills. Wit the help of her friends, she was forced to design the final boss of the game the team was working on. This, of course, put a lot of pressure on her as she's not used to having so much responsibility placed on her. But this was the key for her to overcome her fear of failure.

>Failure is but a stepping stone towards success.

Hajime's Over-Ambition

img220()

Hajime always kept her head up. She had a great passion for games but her head was way too high in the sky, to the point where the ideas she proposed were unfeasible (and got rejected). On top of this, she was too proud to accept any help from others as she thought her ideas were genuinely better. When the time came to create a new game, the company was out of ideas. With the help of the director who ensured Hajime stayed grounded and adviced her to hear other people's ideas, she was able to finally able to bring her crazy ideas to life.

>Being ambitious is good, but the path to your dreams shouldn't be a lonely one.

Hifumi's Social Anxiety

img220(v)

This is one I don't really relate to, but I definitely sympathize with it. Many introverts are really good at a skill because they've spent a lot of time alone working on their skill instead of socializing. Hifumi was arguably the best one on the team, and the seniormost. She was offered a higher position but she refused it because she would have to talk to people a lot in a leadership role. It was only with the help of an understanding friend that she built the confidence to take this role.

>The world isn't as cutthroat as you think. Go, talk to people.

Nenechi's Lack of Purpose

img220()

This review is getting quite long, so this is the last one from my end. Nenechi was the only character in the series to not be skilled at anything. She had no goals, no purpose, nothing to look forward to. Then, on a whim, she decides to learn programming, WIthin 6 months, she was able to learn C and C++ and create her own small game. She worked hard for it, and landed a job in a game company. It may not be her passion, but she isn't one to say no to an opportunity. After all, life doesn't have an intrinsic purpose anyway, so why bother looking for one? Create your own purpose. Take every single damn opportunity you get.

>Sure, you might get better or worse opportunities later, but you will NEVER get the same opportunity. Take it while you can."
116605,"A lot of pressure was on Geek Toys this season to make up for the mistake J.C Staff made that was Date a Live Season 3. And for the most part, they did a mostly passable job. I'm glad we got more DAL and there's still quite a bit to like. But with that being said, some of these changes come with caveats... and even a few complaints from me in certain areas, to be quite honest. 

There won't be direct spoilers in this, just enough details to explain what they did good and bad here. So if you're on the fence about giving this season the time after season 3 left a bad taste in your mouth - you can read this without worry for ruining your watch experience and make a decision whether you want to dedicate time watching this from there. 

Story: We pick up right after the speedrun that covered the 12th light novel in the final epsiode of season 3 (no retcon episode for that, sorry for the fans who were hoping for that to be fixed. But it probably was for the best just to keep moving onward instead of wasting time backtracking). Shido goes back on his quest to help more spirits, and it pretty much follows suit on how they series has always gone. The twist in the plot starts to emerge as the first arc ends and we finally learn the intentions of the main villain, Westcott, and what he wants with the spirits after 2 seasons of knowing barely anything about his sinister plot. In the 2nd arc we get to see 2 unexpected characters return for a brief spell, some more information is slipped through, and then it ends in similar DAL fashion. The 3rd arc... is where DAL goes into overdrive: the Kurumi arc. We finally learn the story of Nightmare and how she ended up as a spirit. We learn of the final boss of series, and a twist on par with Kotori's reveal as a spirit in season 1. I won't spoil anything, but all I'll say is: DAL has approached it's Endgame, and with Season 5 now confirmed we now sit on the edge of our seats to see the final act. 

While there were a fair number of distractable slice of life episodes in between all the action, this isn't far off the course that the series has been doing throughout it's runtime. It's just become more noticable now that there's a darker, more interesting theme approaching and its being interrupted by all the s.o.l shenanigans. While I understand it can be bothersome, it didn't derail it enough to be harsher about it. 

Also if you still didn't get enough Love is War in your life even with it's latest season going on then you'll love this last arc in particular - you'll understand why. 

The biggest issue by far was the that the 2nd arc is... quite frustrating, given how they adapted it. They effectively sped up and did 2 novels in 5 episodes. And despite being sped up, they felt so sloooow which is the worst thing they could've done. 1 episode was essentially 1/2 of an info dump on the newest spirit, and the other half sitting around learning Ratatoskr as an organization. Which couldn't be skipped because they had already cut so much of what could've/should've been introduced/integrated in already during previous season - and so they needed to do it now or the future plot/events would make no sense. So they gave it the Slime Isekai table-talk treatment (except without even the benefit of being in depth) and called it a day. And then another was basically a filler episode where Shido and the gang get sucked into fairy tale land for... reasons. Meanwhile the Mukuro arc is going on and this episode genuinely accomplishes effectively nothing going there. I can live with filler episodes if they're placed correctly, this wasn't. It was frustrating to watch this season weekly and on rewatch it honestly felt worse. It was the first (and only personally) time I got bored watching this series. 

The final arc is good enough to not only salvage - but CARRY this season with how incredible it is, but it does require you to go through an extremely testing middle arc that may frustrate and bore you. It is worth it, and this arc isn't all terrible, but it is unquestionable my least favorite in the DAL anime. 

Consensus: solid story that's continuing the escalation setup by last season. While it has a bit of a frustrating middle, it generally kept me interested despite its interruptions and has set the stage for it's next season - which will be the climax of the series.

Art/Animation: The new art style divided the community to some extent. Of personal opinion, I liked the character remodels and vibrant colors that gave so much more detail and life to the cast and background art. Though I understand why other folks don't, it took a lot of familiarity away from the series and no longer matches the illustrations of the source material. And I admittedly do miss that a bit. But it was universally a step up from last season's trainwreck deviantart level style, so the general impression I've seen is that it's gotten at least a ""pass"" from most the fanbase.

Tho there was also the unfortunate factor of some additional censorship sewed into this season. I don't care that some of the echii was diluted down in some scenes (that was mostly expected), but the darker parts of the story were significantly changed to be less gruesome - to the point where it almost changed entire scenes and brought down the weight of the final arc (Nibelcole and Shido's room scene for example). LN readers have been very vocably upset about this particularly, and I agree with them. 

But even without the artstyle debate, a far bigger problem quickly emerged. Moving to the case of contention within this season: The CGI fights. Ima keep it real with you chief: at it's best it wasn't pretty, and at it's worst... it was just awful. The rough transitioning between 3D puppets to still frame 2D action shots as they collided didn't look good. The Origami vs Inverse Tohka fight was supposed to be one of the most action packed moments of the season: it punctuated the OP of this season and from that it looked like it was gonna be great. But after waiting 8 episodes for this promised hyped up fight, we instead got... essentially 2 plastic action figures bashing into each other with only the hands of the kids holding them edited out. The space fights with Mukuro were also very ugly at times when it dipped into the CG for portions of it. The only thing thing that looked fairly good with the CGI was the airship fight between Fraxinus and Goetia.

It's no exaggeration to say the animation is worse than season 3's, but I'd even go as far and say that the CGI was so horrible it could be on par with the likes of Arifureta season 1 - that's how bad it was. And if you've seen or even vaguely know of Arifureta's reputation regarding it's animation: that should upset you immensely. To clarify, I'm not CGI-phobic - but when you utilize CGI it needs to feel as seemless and naturally a part of the production and scenes its used in, as opposed to feeling so out of place it sticks out and takes you out of the experience. And the CGI this season definitely felt the latter. Going from 2D animations to rough looking Playstation-esq block models for fights looked terrible. It is by far the biggest universal complaint from fans this season. Not the biggest issue overall for some people, but nobody liked it.

Overall, for the 2nd season running animation was by far the weakest element. Like season 3 it wasn't unpassably bad to kill the anime, but by God it was awful. The eye-capturing action that makes DAL so unique and special from other harems was butchered badly this season. The only thing saving this grade was that the 2D elements looked better than before, and they put a lot of effort into making the background and fine details look much better. But why wasn't the most important elements and action scenes given as much care? Geek Toys needs improvement here: Badly.

Sound: While it was dissapointing to have the tradition broken and not have Sweet A.R.M.S do the OP, Miyu Tomita did a pretty good job and still gave another equally banging one for this season. As far as background tracks goes, they mostly kept up with properly matching the tone of anime and it's scenes. Now we didn't get many new tracks this season, but tbf they had already been doing Date a Bullet and we heard quite a few of those throughout the Kurumi arc - so I'll give them a pass. My only dissapointment comes from not having an orchestrated version of the OP in the final episode as we've had in the 3 seasons past, but it's basically nitpicking of a hardcore fan at this point. 

Voice acting remains solid, on the original japanese end. I'm not gonna factor this into the grade at all because it would be unfair and is irrelevant to anyone who doesn't watch alternative versions/dubs. But the English dub this season... is a mess. 

It seems that they couldn't secure back all the original VAs when they needed to this season, so there's a pretty messy rotation of different VAs filling in for multiple characters - and its extremely noticable. Shido was voiced by 3 different VAs throughout the first 6 episodes before they manage to secure his original VA back for the 2nd half of the season, and they not that similar sounding in voice. You have whinny sounding Shido, the original Shido (who did 1 episode in the first 6), and really gruff Shido. It's absolutely bizzare. Reine has a different VA for the first 3, as well as many of the other minor characters (but they don't matter as much tbh). They didn't re-record anything with the original VAs for the blu-ray either, so we're eternally stuck with this version. Upon rewatch it really got to me and irk'd me so much that it takes you out of the experience. While I typically am a preferably dub watcher, this has hard converted me to the original sub going forward.

But back to point: disregarding the dubs problems, overall sound/music was great - still the series' best and most defining aspect. 

Characters: I'm not gonna pretend that DAL doesn't have the problem that most harems have as they keep growing in size of sidelining less relevant characters in favor of the ones that are the focal point of the plot - because we all know it's absolutely guilty of it. Yoshino, the Yamai's, Miku, and Natsumi were benched for the majority of the season, bar a few specific scenes where they got some crumbs for attention. And Kotori remains in the same logistics point of directing the plot she always is in (which isn't bad tho, I like Kotori's role - she just doesn't grow or change here). Some points are gonna be docked from this category inherently. That being said, this isn't a new problem for the series (or the genre in general) so you just learn to go with it and focus on the ""main"" returning characters to develop or take part in the plot in a notable way. Which were: Shido, Tohka, Origami, Kurumi, Reine, and the villains Westcott and Ellen. 

For the new characters of note from this season: We have our 2 new spirits Nia and Mukuro, the new DEM adaptess Artemisia Ashcroft, Nibelcole, and the final boss of the series... the Origin Spirit. 

Of the 2 new spirits, I liked Nia the most. She broke the mold a little bit being that she wasn't some oblivous, innocent girl that Shido easily charmed into liking him like most of the cast. She's an older women in her 20's who's confidence, lack of a filter, and awareness of exactly what Shido is trying to do put him into uncomfortable, less cliche and more interesting situations - which was very refreshing. It got a few genunine chuckles out of me and I was interested in seeing where her story goes. She does get mostly sidelined sadly after her arc ends, but that is the series for ya.

Next up is Mukuro, who falls back into the tropey nature that most of the DAL girls fall into: innocent girl that nearly immediately falls for the MC, but with another gimmick. Personally I found her very uninteresting, though I can see why some fans would like her - she is pretty much a cupcake in both looks and in personality. My distate in her could be attributed to her arc feeling... rather boring. It felt like it dragged on and on, but in reality it was being speedran so much that most of the best parts from the light novel had been cut out. Of the 5 episodes from the Mukuro arc, 1 was near completely dedicated towards info dumping on the Fraxinus organization's backstory (because that had been neglected in the prior seasons up till this point, for some reason) and another was spent on the Fairy Tale episodes that was pretty much a filler episode. 2 Light novels essentially essentially condensed into 3 episodes wasn't a great idea, as it made me feel more annoyed with Mukuro as a character than making me like her. We got all her most boring parts and lost most of the good stuff. 

Artemisia takes the place of Mana and Origami as the head AST that follow's DEM's commands. There's apparently a lot more to her, but from what I've been told from light novel readers a good portion of related backstory and scenes involving her have been cut. So for the time being, she left extremely underdeveloped and she kinda drops off from the story after the halfway point. Guess if you want more information on her you'll have to read the light novel... but given that it's expected to be an estimated 2+ years as of writing this before it will get officially brought over in english - it's gonna be awhile unless you go to an unofficial translator. :/

I guess there's also Maria, the newly named Fraxinus A.I that helps the crew out. And while this isn't anime spoilers, it is a direct reference to the DAL visual novel Arusu Install. If you've played the game you know who ""Maria"" is. But if you haven't don't worry, it bares no weight on the anime. It's just a neat reference. 

Not gonna explain who Nibelcole is as well as the Origin Spirit, doing that without spoilers would be too much giveaway. All I'll say is that Nibelcole was notably watered down in brutality in the anime, as I've seen some of translations from the light novel about some of the things she was supposed to do in a few scenes... look up at your own discretion. 

Old characters: 
Tohka and Origami get their time in the spotlight in the Mukuro arc, but in an unconventional way. Again, don't want to spoil - this review is intended for folks sitting on the fence after going through season 3. Westcott and Ellen's plot starts to unfold, and they get a lot more screentime. 

Mana is back after being gone for the entirety of season 3, and that's nice - but she doesn't do much in the grand scheme of things here other than show up in a couple of scenes. 

Reine gets more involved in the plot and we see more of her this season. And we're gonna see much more of her next season.

And Kurumi... is once again, the biggest attraction. Her arc is the reason DAL has skyrocketed to the top of almost every poll in the final weeks of the season - and for good reason. The production team clearly went all-in on Kurumi's popularity to carry the season, and it did. The reason DAL 4's the highest rated season is almost entirely off of the strength of the last arc. 

But it came at a cost: because they needed to get to her arc this season, both Nia's and especially Mukuro's arcs were forcibly speedran so that they could have as much time as they could get to cover Kurumi Refrain, the 16th volume of the light novel. The blasted through 3 novels in 8 episodes. And while it paid off with immediate rating increases, a solid final stretch and very good last episode, light novel readers were pissed about it. And even a number of anime-onlys noticed the lack of development, especially in the Mukuro arc (like myself). So whether or not it was worth it is a matter of debate.

Shido: the root of many of the problems this season...
Lastly there's Shido, who unfortunately becomes the epicenter of so many of the structural issues within this season. The issue is with how he's been adapted - and how the mistakes and decisions made in the previous seasons have finally caught up and begin to matter now. 

Shido's backstory was completely neglected and cut from the anime. His background of being an orphan, which as a result made him wracked with insecurity and was incredibly fearful of being abandoned again by his foster family (the Itsuka's). A huge part of his personality and drive to save the spirits stems from this. While this didn't matter too much at the start of the show, at the stage we're at the point where these details are really starting to matter. Shido's backstory is the connection and link that helps him relate to and save Mukuro. And it's this connection why so many people like and shipped Shido and Mukuro. If the anime properly established this, it would've made the moment significantly more emotional - and shown some visual character growth from Shido. It would've taken some adjustments, perhaps best fitted in poritions or anywhere between episodes 4-8, but the payoff for it would've absolutely been worth it.

But no, we don't get that. Mukuro's arc is rushed and speedran so fast that it leaves room for none of that. Shido's climatic moment with Mukuro where he opens up about his past feels hollow, cheap, and more of a plot convenience pulled out the a$$ because its NEVER - EVEN - BEEN - BROUGHT UP - PRIOR - in the anime. And given where the plot goes from here at the end of the season, it'll be unlikely if they ever find a chance to fit it in. Which still matters, because the next season... Shido becomes more important than ever, and his backstory becomes even more integral to the plot. 

I hate being a debby downer, especially about my favorite series. But what I'm unfortunately saying is:
img220()

Section conclusion:
While many of the harem girls were pretty much sidelined to where they barely exist and Mukuro's arc was speedran to the point where it felt both rushed yet felt slow and boring - most of the ones that got focused on ranged from fair at its worst to very well written at its peak. Nia's arc may have been short, but she's entertaining as a character. Westcott's intentions finally being revealed was great. Shido starting to become more integral to the plot which is good (although there may be more problems down the line if they don't patch up the backstory loss). And of course, Kurumi's arc and backstory finally being revealed carried this season in the eyes of many.

Overall: I can feel comfortable saying that Date A Live IV was definitively a step up from 3 in terms of it's production. While it definitely still has its issues, the end result was not bad. Subjectively, DAL is one of the best harem series ever made and is still manages to be my favorite guilty pleasure anime of all time. It would've taken a truly awful season to change that, and despite my issues with this season - this wasn't it. While this is my least favorite season of Date a Live, I still enjoyed it overall.

We'll see if Geek Toys breaks the curse of every studio only doing 1 season of DAL before passing it along to the next. But if they do, and you happen to read this Geek Toys: I want to first say I appreciate your work towards adapting this series and picking it up from where J.C Staff abruptly dropped it. But please, Step up your CGI. Every fight made in 3D this season, bar the airship battle, was horrendous and by far the biggest thing that really held this season back.
This is a very fixable problem that I hope they recognize and put effort into fixing for next season to make a finale worth the years of build up and waiting.

Update: they are now confirmed to be doing season 5. I know not everyone will be pleased by this, but they're locked in at this point. All we can do is just wish and hope for the best...

Overall, Firm 7 out of 10 anime/season. While my opinion on the season is positive as a whole, the biggest issue with me that holds it back is how irritated the Mukuro arc's adaptation made me. It felt so slow despite being sped up so much. But even with that aside, it also would've needed to address some of it's issues listed above in the animation and character sections particularly for it to reach a higher score. The issue regarding Shido's backstory being cut is just too much of a problem that makes the issues with the Mukuro arc even worse. 

To be quite honest, this was a 6/10 anime that was carried and arguably even saved by the Kurumi Refrain arc at the end. And though that was enough to make a lot of people overlook the majority of this season's problems, to me it was not enough. Very good and worth getting through to, but not enough to not enough to completely forgive it for the problems it caused or had to sit through to reach this point.

Season 4 was definitively better showing over the previous season from a production standpoint (unquestionably), but as an adaptation it left much to be desired this time. I know people have nitpicked on details from the previous seasons, but of all 4 seasons (so far) this is first time I felt it without having to even read up on what they cut. It was... noticeably lacking compared to the previous 3. Not everyone will agree on how it was executed and whether the sacrifice of speedrunning through 3 novels to reach the Kurumi arc was worth it. But I think pretty much everyone will concede this: it absolutely had the potential to be better, but it also could've easily been much worse - and what we got was better than nothing at all."
2418,"Sword of the Stranger takes place in Japan during the Sengoku Era (Age of Warring States, c. 1467 to c. 1568) and follows a young orphaned boy named Kotarō, and his doggie, Tobimaru, as they are being pursued by China’s Ming Dynasty warriors for unknown reasons. Along their journey, Kotarō and Tobimaru encounter Nanashi, an unnamed rōnin (master-less samurai warrior) who has vowed to never draw his sword again due to a dark and malevolent past. Through various plot happenings, Nanashi agrees to guide Kotarō and Tobimaru to a place of reprieve for the boy, thus building a deep bond along the way.

 Please note: there will be spoilers for the film in this review, which will be marked when they appear. Read with caution. Thank you. 

I am at a loss for where to begin with my review for this film because everything about it is so damn astounding. The premise, the animation (especially the action sequences), the music, the contemplative motifs—all of them work together to complement and enhance one another to build a film that is literally a masterpiece, never overshadowing one for the other. It is evocative, dark, and exquisitely revelatory of the era’s more twisted climates as well as human nature.

On the surface, Sword and the Stranger is about relationships and making amends. We have a young boy who has no parental figure or mentor in his life. It’s just him and his puppy against the blazing world. Then Nanashi enters the picture and shows the boy what it’s like to have that warmth that stems from having a father. A bond formulates between the two between mindless bickering, lessons of horseback riding, and intimate revelations of each other’s melancholy past. You see two deeply lonely individuals come to terms with the fact that they may no longer have to be as such. A pure and basic story at its heart. However, the execution of said story is prolifically breath-taking.

The film originally released in 2007, which was eleven years ago. BONES was doing fantastic work in terms of animation (Eureka Seven and Darker Than Black immediately come to mind) during this time, really testing out which bounds to push, and which ones weren’t up to par. With Sword of the Stranger, we are finally able to see their full potential as creators, as the film was one of the very first ones to utilise a seemingly flawless implementation of CGI graphics into hand-drawn cinematography to produce something that is sensationally fluid from one scene to the next, with vividly mind-blowing action sequences, character designs, and lush, splendidly detailed landscapes. From the opening scene, where rain and mud waltz in a flurry of defensive foot movements and swishing sword fighting to the serenely calming scene where Kotarō and Nanashi are riding horseback through the shores of a beach amid a backdrop of the setting sun. Both are culturally very Japanese in nature and highlight the best part about the animation: the details.

The intricate focus on details is what ends up sealing in the film’s beauty and raising it to the level of masterpiece. Close-ups of rain drops preparing to land upon the forehead of a dying soldier, the slight movements of straw as another character’s hat is sliced open, the gentle caress of the wind upon the bloodied fabric that holds Nanashi’s sword snuggly within its sheath—these minute aspects are layered one on top of another on top of another to formulate such a smooth and all-encompassing watching experience. It is damn difficult not be drawn in by the animation, given how stunning it is. All of these things are further accompanied by the musical composition.

There isn’t a lot of heavy or consistent music in Sword of the Stranger, which is another facet that is quite akin to Japanese aesthetics, uniquely of classic literature. If you have every read Haiku poems or anything by Bashō, these things will stand out to you almost instantly. It’s limited in quantity, but whenever it does make an appearance, it does so at pivotal points to the plot—when two warriors who are to battle to the death finally meet, or when Kotarō and Nanashi hit a note in their harmonising friendship—and instils within you a sense of profoundness, insidiously building up the tension and anticipation for the ultimate climax to come. So, it’s basic but brilliant. It’s intelligently psychological and gorgeously moving, more so when you contemplate the deeper meanings portrayed beneath all of the simple elegance of family and redemption.

 Spoilers ahead. 

Duality. This is my favourite thing about Sword of the Stranger. The consistent and multi-faceted exploration of the duality of death and what it means to be alive.

The Ming Dynasty warriors all take a special type of drug that renders them literally immune to pain and torture, thus allowing them to fight and fight and fight until they no longer draw breath. Only one character—Luo Lang—working on the Chinese soldier’s side, refuses to partake in the drug. He is someone who searches for that rush that you can only get by feeling everything around you, specifically in battle. There is no feeling quite like the one you get when you are facing death in the face with the chance of having your heart stabbed through or your head lopped off to make you realise that you are truly alive. Numbing himself to this sensation is without question unacceptable and disrespectful.

Then you have Nanashi. All he wants it to feel numb, to forget his past; to find some black, ugly corner where he can go die. He doesn’t take drugs to stifle his pain and suffering as he does this via alienation and avoidance. Feeling alive is the absolute last thing that he desires in the world because then it makes the sins of his past real. It makes all of the wrongs he’s done a ghost that he cannot run away from.

This duality of death that you see—one where the idea of death is exhilarating and the very essence of why someone should live to their fullest capacity, and one where the idea of it is a welcome escape—is everywhere in the film; softly woven into the conversations between Nanashi and Kotarō; slipped in between the battles that the mysterious Chinese soldier has with others, as well as the ones that Nanashi has with Kotarō’s pursuers; even forged into the swords that both characters fight with.

You see the duality outside of the two characters as well; a whisper in the overarching plot that’s never blatantly voiced, but meticulously implied. The Ming Warriors are sent on a mission that deals with a very twisted belief that the Chinese emperors of the dynasty were obsessed with—immortality—and this obsession was astoundingly anti-Confucian. During the Warring States period, within Confucianism death was viewed as something to be accepted and embraced, just as life was. If you didn’t understand how to live, you could never really understand death. Emperors were hell-bent on running away from death as much as they possibly could, thus defying this pivotal belief; a belief that their entire culture—at the time—and government was built upon.

Luo-Lang was the perfect encapsulation of the Confucian ideal of life and death while the Emperor that he worked for and the warriors that surrounded him were the epitome of anti-Confucian belief. He was very much the walking, talking, sword-fighting personification of the dual-nature of death during the time period; two sides of a single coin, as it were.

 End Spoilers. 

When you take all of the motifs into account—as there are quite a few that I haven’t even mentioned here—while setting everything else aside for a moment, you will see that Sword of the Stranger is an amazing allegory for the struggles that both nations faced during the time period, particularly where the dynamics of leadership and the impoverished people, who are struggling because of said leadership, are concerned. The wrongs of the king are never worth the blood shed by the peasants to propitiate those wrongs.

All in all, there has never been an anime that has ever come close to being what Sword of the Stranger is: a perfect blending of excellent storytelling, complex characters, flawless animation and visual cinematography, superb melodic structure, and true-to-era exploration of the political climate. It is provocative, emotional, intellectually pensive, and one of the finest works of art that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing in my life.

As someone who rarely gives out perfect scores (five out of five for books, or ten out of ten for cinematic media), I feel that giving this film anything less would be a disrespect to what it is and what it stands for. Sword of the Stranger is one of those fundamental creations that I can honestly say: they just don’t make them like this anymore.

101386,"Cute and fun show about a girl who struggles to talk to people.

[PREMISE OF THE SHOW:]()
Hitoribocchi is show that focuses on the daily life of Hitori...Bocchi (yep).

It is very clear that she has quite strong Social Anxiety.
The whole set up of the show is that before entering Middle School her one and only friend, Kai, has told her that if she doesn't befriend the whole class she is not worthy of being friends with her.
Not the best thing to say to a person who struggles with such a condition but hey this is a fictional piece of work, I'll let that slide.

I think the rest of the show should be pretty clear for you, she goes around trying to befriend people in her class. At first she tries to make it so her class disbands but then actually puts in the effort.

There are many moments in the show were Bocchi's Anxiety gets blown out of proportion just for the sake of comedy, but honestly I don't feel like that was that bad.
If I recall correctly I heard multiple individuals say that they didn't like the show as much cause of this reason but as a person who basically is the male Bocchi I'll say that this was a lot of fun.
I watch Anime to escape reality, not to get dragged back into it. I mean it would be cool to see a show that has a deep tone and talks seriously about this but funny is funny. I like funny stuff.




[CHARACTERS:]()
Due to the nature of this show we are presented with multiple different characters.
The I'll be focusing on the main cast though since they are all so lovable:

Hitori Bocchi - Well I already talked about her quite a bit, she is very anxious and when she gets too happy she faints (or if she gets too anxious she vomits).
She is most often seen overthinking and planning ahead how to do normal human things such as saying ""Good Morning"".

Nako Sunao - She looks tough and acts like it but is a very friendly and nice person. She is the first friend Bocchi makes. She tries to make Bocchi feel calm and make more friends which is so nice.

Aru Honshou - The ultimate human form, there is no other human like Aru. She always shines bright, she doesn't lose. ARU!!! Unless she activates her normal mode and becomes the most unfortunate person on the whole planet.
She is quite calm but can get upset when people call her unfortunate.

Sotoka Rakita - Her sole reason for coming to Japan was because she wanted to see Ninjas. Yep, I shit you not. She thinks Bocchi is a master ninja cause she always hides from everyone else.
Sotoka is quite lively and energetic, always eager to play. She is also from another country and lives by her self which saddens me :(




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
This show has some really cute art style, really fits well with the show and our saviour Bocchi.
The animation on the other hand feels more average, it can be really smooth and great at times but mostly its the same ol' we got used to in pretty much every SOL.

Not to say its bad but nothing new or groundbreaking like Nichijou and K-On.




[MUSIC:]()
The OP, oh lawd is it catchy. I'm even humming and listening to it as I'm writing this review, its cute, catchy, and fits well with the show. What more can you ask for?

The ED, is also not bad, I mean the OP is much more catchy and I don't really go back listening to the ED but its not bad. After all of the anxious chaos that occured in the episode we are presented with a calm and relaxing tune. Not bad.
There is of course the ED2 (Wa Ha Ha one), my goodness, this is the one that really stuck in my head. Its just perfection. Its like the Chika ED. Catchy for all eternity.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
This show is just filled with cute.
My heart melted every time I watched this show. If you like SOL and just cute things then go ahead, watch this show.

I could relate to almost everything Bocchi did or thought which is always great, I think.
There were also sad moments, they weren't that strong to make me cry but I did shed few tears in the part about Sotoka living alone and feeling lonely."

I met Detective Conan aka Case Closed aka 名探偵コナン aka Meitantei Conan in 2016, Coincidentally, I went back to talk to a friend and he insisted that I watch Conan, so after much insistence I saw the first episode, and ok, it was good, however, I really didn't expect what the series would become afterwards. And today, 2020, I've rewatched Case Closed 3 times. Once a year I rewatch. And no, I'm not crazy. I'm normal. 

Don't be alarmed by the size of the series, as soon as you get used to it, and if you skip the fillers, there will be 350 fewer episodes for you to watch.


Detective Conan has the best worldbuilding I've seen. However, you may find the series tiring, as it is slow (It was not my case). The anime starts to work from episode 128, with the first plot twist, but the first 200 episodes are, practically, a cast presentation. The introduction of characters. From episodes 300, the series begins to reach its peak, lasting until around episodes 800. The story is perfectly connected, even using developed questions in episode 200, for example, there in episode 700. The way the author fits his work is sensational.

Conan's universe is rich in a small box. The story revolves around only one city, of course you'll get to know other places throughout the series like Osaka, but the focus is Beika, and that city is so developed that you will know it like the back of your hand. Conan keeps evolving and never stops, it's crazy how Conan gets better, better and better with each episode and with each arc. And on top of that it's a series that involves almost every kind of genre: Comedy, Romance, Drama, Psychological, Adventure, Action, Mystery, everything! The author creates, solves and connects everything. And you've no idea how beautiful he can connect.

img()

Look how many characters this anime uses (and there are still more, much more that were presented after). And they're all great characters. A good portion of them are developed in certain arcs that the series has, and many of them are also used frequently. There are all kinds of characters. Character development is something that won't be missing without a doubt. Case Closed even develops secondary characters. There are many secondary characters in Detective Conan who have a complete development without even needing it.

Detective Conan is a slow series, so you'll need to be patient as much to see the development of the characters as well as the plot progression. It's something that won't end in a single episode, it will be developed little by little. However, there are some episodes that would be called ""climax"" episodes, special episodes, including some that close some of the series' arcs or that are very important and impactful.

I usually say that Conan is similar to Gintama. But... is that one is comedy and the other is more focused on mystery.




Here we go, Detective Conan has 3 universes: Magic Kaito, Movies and Main Series (Detective Conan TV). 

img()

Kaito Kid
Kaito Kuroba is an ordinary teenage student whose father is often absent. When his father dies in mysterious circumstances, he discovers his father's secret identity: a famous international criminal known as International Criminal 1412: the Phantom Thief, and that he was murdered by a mysterious organization for refusing to help them recover their ""Pandora Gem"", a mystical stone that fell during the passage of a comet (often called ""Volley Comet""), whose consumption confers immortality. He promises to prevent the organization from gaining immortality, assumes his father's identity and begins his search for the treasure.

The Kaito who uses magic has his own series, Magic Kaito 1412. The one who doesn't use it is in Detective Conan.

Magic Kaito's universe needs to be different, because the Kaito in Magic Kaito 1412 uses magic, but magic in Conan would be a plothole, so it was necessary to separate the universes. In MK, he uses magic, but in Conan he needs to use tricks. 

Kaito was initially a crossover, but the series turned him into a Detective Conan character. If you watch Conan, you'll someday understand why.

And relax, is the same character. The only difference is: one uses magic and the other doesn't.


Movies

In a way you can watch them without seeing the anime series, as it is like a separate and non-canonical story, but it uses the plot of the series, even the current films already have a lot of spoilers. The films are becoming more and more canon, the author is trying to connect certain moments of some films and fit them into the main series.



img()

The films have their own stories and more focused on action, like, you know, BAAM BOOM YEAHH!!!! Good animation here and there and much better produced. They're inferior to the main series, but it doesn't mean that it's bad, they're also great.
While the series focus on mystery, the movies on the other hand like to focus in action. It's a good dynamic in my opinion.
From the date I do this review, there are 23 movies and 24th will be released next month in cinema. 1 film per year.


And 

https://anilist.co/anime/98604/Detective-Conan-Episode-One--The-Great-Detective-Turned-Small/

Detective Conan: Episode One. Do NOT start here.

This is a remake of the first episode, but narrated by several different places, what or where everything was happening on the same day as the first episode of the series.

There will be many character spoilers and revelations. Not to mention that it will totally break your immersion and much of your experience. It's a Special made to feel more nostalgic, only watch it when you arrive at about the 800th episode.

There are people who prefer the old animation and others who prefer the current one. I like both. The old one has its own charm

OST/Soundtrack

One of the best I've seen as well. Over 6 hours of soundtrack, 51 openings and I don't even know how many endings, but they're all recognizable, Conan's ost is unique.
They use a lot of the same singers too. Mai Kuraki, B'z and Breakerz are the main names for Detective Conan for music. The best known of Conan's soundtrack comes from the Saxophone. The most iconic sound in the series.

Urgh, I'm done. 


You have a timeline where you can create endless theories and debate with your friends, including solving cases and feeling the joy of everything you thought was being said and solved, you feel like a real detective! 
In conclusion, that's it. In my opinion, I really don't think there should be an anime that can beat this one for me! An incredible universe where anything can happen and be connected. This work is great, as much as worldbuilding as much as story, and it's very worthwhile. Thank you, Detective Conan! And watch it!"
118465,"This review will have some spoilers.

This was honestly really bad. It had a horrible story, which was completely made up of weird fetishes and ideas. Like there could have been a little more effort put into this to at least make it enjoyable.

Story
It really was so stupid. The whole I idea that a disease is going to wipe out half of the human population is understandable, and in a different setting, might have actually made for a good story. But no, apparently a million men, of which 5 are in Japan, survive, these 5 are referred to as “The Numbers”(1-5). They were all put into a sleep-like state due to medical conditions and they awoke in the midst of the epidemic. And they somehow developed an immunity to the disease, the 'Man Killer Virus' during this sleep. And obliviously these men are tasked with repopulating the world. Its obliviously something aimed at teenage guys who dream about that sorta thing in my opinion. It failed to create something interesting and created something that was more disgusting and just weird to watch. It was on the border of being hentai, considering they couldnt find anything else to focus on besides the sexual repopulation part. Its world-building was pretty bad as we really didnt know what was going on in the rest of the world until the end. And even in the end you only heard about the US, it could have been a tad bit more interesting if the rest of the world was included and showed what problems had arisen because of the MK Virus. This would have given a more varied perspective about the virus and could’ve added a lot more to the story. And either way most anime are normally always set in Japan, but I feel that if they changed it up, it could have been a lot better. 

The pacing was really bad too, it was slow in some parts but fast in others. At the beginning, it was slow and helped you understand what was going on but it flew through the end leaving lots of questions that might be there to suggest another season, still annoying though.


Characters
They all sucked, besides one dude who was kinda funny. Out of the 5 men, it mainly focused on two of them. These two were Reito Mizuhara, and Shouta Doi. Reito was the one guy that refused to “mate” because he had a childhood crush. While I guess this made the story a bit more interesting, because this man refuses to reproduce even when the world might end. But it was just so stupid, and he was basically useless all the way through. I dont get why he is the MC considering it was boring to watch everything he did, and they just started adding stupid stuff for him to do. The other guy, Shouta Doi however was the exact opposite. I’d say he had four stages, first he was hesitant, second he just went at with every girl, third he backed away and didnt do anything and fourth, he went insane and just went at it with basically everyone. He did sort of develop an attachment to one of the girls which affected him through those said stages. His ‘stages’ were the only funny parts to him. Because you basically just watched him commit crime after crime after crime, which just felt kinda weirdish to watch. There were multiple main side characters (if that makes sense) such as Reito and Shouta’s assistants. They managed everything from their daily life to the girls they got with, not to much to say about them. Since Reito wasnt focused on reproducing he focused on finding a cure instead, as well as his long lost crush. Towards the end he gathered a few girls to help him with the cure and they kinda made the show a lot better. They brought some actual fairly good humor which was good. But overall the characters were really bad and couldve been done a lot better.
  
Final Thoughts
I’m basically just gonna repeat myself but it really did fail. No one was really expecting it to be good, but it couldve been better than what it was. A stupid story with a bad cast and ending, nothing much more to it."
597,"There’s an old Chinese proverb that says if you save someone’s life, you’re responsible for that life, and that’s exactly what happened to seventeen year old Haru.  An otherwise normal high school girl, she spent her days being passionate about sports, having to skip breakfast because her alarm clock didn’t wake her up for school, worrying about a boy she liked, and wondering if she’d ever truly be able to find her place in the world.  One day, on her way to school, she saw a stray tomcat in the middle of the road, about to be run over by a truck, so she rushed out to save the poor creature. 

A familiar set up to say the least, but instead of the truck sending her into a fantasy world, it’s the cat who would ultimately turn her life upside down when he stood up, thanked her for her help, and scurried off back to the cat kingdom.  In return for her act of heroism, the cat king began sending her gifts that only a cat would enjoy, culminating in her engagement to the prince she saved!  With her human life slipping away from her, and her only hope lying in the hands of a mysterious Baron working with the Cat Business Bureau, will she ever return to the human world, or will she be trapped forever in the bonds of holy meow-trimony?

The Cat Returns was directed by Hiroyuki Morita, a one time director for Studio Ghibli, for whom this would be his only project.  It was originally conceived as a twenty minute animation commissioned by a theme park who wanted Ghibli to make them a short film about cats, which is PROBABLY why it landed in front of one of the studio’s story-board artists rather than one of their more prominent names.  It was ultimately a producer who was so impressed by what Morita was doing that he convinced Hayao Miyazaki to green light The Cat Returns as a full length cinematic feature, and while a backstory like that MIGHT give the impression that this movie probably has an uneven tone and a ton of filler, that isn’t the case at all.

The animation is very smooth and fluid, and while there are some exceptions to that... maybe one or two scenes that feel a bit stiff... it’s very deliberate.  At any given time, the animation matches the tone of the scene, and for such a fast paced story, the slower moments are few and for between, mostly concentrated in the human world, such as when Haru’s sneaking into her classroom.  Basically, corners are cut in moments that are important for a character’s identity and development, moments you’re not likely to remember by the end.  This is a level of sensibility you’d expect from a director who cut their teeth on storyboards, and it works perfectly with the pacing and comedic timing of the film.  Each setting is full of life and history, and drawn with such a high level of detail that even a field of grass can look breathtaking in some shots.

With pretty much any female protagonist in a Ghibli film, they’re going to be a bit on the generic side, but also fairly pretty or fairly cute, depending on their age.  The main character Haru does fall into the former camp, but she’s also one of the more interesting leads that the studio has featured, at least in terms of design.  It’s hard to say any anime character looks realistic, but she probably looks the most believable in a modern day Japanese setting, somewhat awkward, but still growing into her looks, as we can see the huge difference a simple haircut can make later on in the film.  The cats also look believable, which is high praise coming from a cat lover in regard to a movie that was directed by an alleged cat hater.  This is how cats should be animated...  No CGI, no human faces imposed on fursuits, no digitally removed buttholes.

The music has a folksy quality to it, very easy on the ears, but nothing you’d really seek out afterwards, unless you got a tune like Mutta wo Otte or Neko to Ohanashi stuck in your head.  The English dub, as is usally the case with Studio Ghibli films, is almost entirely a celebrity affair, but for the most part, I feel like it works really well here.  Unlike a lot of the young starlets that usually get cast as the protagonist of a Ghibli film, Anne Hathaway was both old enough and trained well enough to slot directly into her character.  She ranks right up there for me with Kirsten Dunst in Kiki's Delivery Service and Claire Danes in Princess Mononoke as one of the best Ghibli leading ladies, even though her film isn’t anywhere near as grand or dramatically intense as theirs were.  Elsewhere in the cast is Carey Elwes, reprising his role as The Baron from Whisper of the Heart, further proving he’s far more suited to playing a smooth-talking, debonair gentleman than whatever the hell he was doing in Porco Rosso. 

Kristin Bell plays a small supporting role that I wouldn’t even mention if it wasn’t for the fact that I swear to God I mistook her for Cherami Leigh at first(which is definitely praise).  Andy Richter does a great job playing an upbeat middleman for the King, despite the fact that his character was clearly intended to be female, Peter Boyle is a lot of fun in his only ever anime role, and then you have Tim Curry, playing a role so unlike any other Tim Curry performance I can’t help but imagine him muting his mic between each take so they won’t catch him giggling.  English Ghibli dubs are usually a mixed bag, and it is true that some of the actors attached to this project are far bigger than the part they played(I’m so sorry Judy Greer) I still really like the way this one turned out.  They found some clever workarounds for Japanese wordplay jokes, but it’s otherwise pretty faithful, and I highly recommend checking it out.

When you hear the name Studio Ghibli, what’s the first thing you expect to see?  It depends on the director, frankly.  From the legendary Hayao Miyazaki himself, you expect magic, artistry, a film that focuses more on visuals and music than story, but still manages to immerse you in another world anyway.  From the late Isao Takahata, you expect something a bit more grounded, as his films usually contain some degree of realism, along with a thoughtful message about culture and the environment.  From Goro Miyazaki...  Well, let’s just not go there.  In the hands of Hiroyuki Morita, The Cat Returns doesn’t really deliver on any of this.  The visuals are high quality, but they’re not quite as magical as the studio’s other projects.  It kind of has a message to it, but it feels like an afterthought.  There is an element of the coming-of-age narrative that’s become a hallmark for the studio, but it’s very subtle.

The Cat Returns came out one year after Spirited Away, a film that’s adored by millions(You know exactly how I felt about it) and carried a level of sensation and spectacle that earned it the only Oscar for Best Animated Feature that an anime has ever received, although later Ghibli films would also be nominated.  The Cat Returns looks almost quaint in comparison, and it joins films like The Secret World of Arrietty in a very weird spot...  It’s not regarded as one of the bad films, like Earthsea and Pom Poko, but it’ s also not considered a hidden gem like Only Yesterday or it’s sister film Whisper of the Heart.  The Cat Returns is to Ghibli what A Bug’s Life is for Pixar...  It’s a fun, decent movie that a lot of people like, but that you wouldn’t hold up as an example of the studio.  As far as critical and commercial success, and cultural relevance, it does feel like one of the lesser Studio Ghibli films.

I know that this is going to sound weird, but in my opinion, all of that works entirely to this film’s advantage.

There is a quality to this film that sets it apart from the rest of the Studio Ghibli catalogue.  There’s something it does that makes it work on an entirely different level from the rest of their output, and that spins it’s diminutive status into a selling point.  I might be wrong about this, and correct me if I am, but The Cat Returns is quite possibly the only straight up comedy that the studio has ever released.  This movie may not thrill you, it might not give you chills, or goosebumps, or the feels, or any of that other media goodness that we all love injecting into our veins, but it will make you laugh from start to finish with it’s surreal imagery, it’s brilliantly casual weirdness and laid back atmosphere that allows you to take it all in without being overwhelmed.

The Cat Returns never takes itself seriously, and it never asks YOU to take it seriously.  Rather, it encourages you to approach it the same way Haru does...  Bewilderment at first, followed quickly by an understanding that things are the way are, and an eventual willingness to embrace the weirdness around you.  Haru’s not the most deep or developed character, but the film is very efficient at letting you know who she is and why you should like her very early on, and the details given during that time tie in flawlessly with her acceptance of the shifting reality around her.  She’s quite similar to the unnamed protagonist in Humanity has Declined in her ability to guide you through a bizarre civilization without ever giving the impression that a bunch of sharks are being jumped.

The comic timing is spot on.  Certain shifts in environment are delivered with just as much uncanny surrealism as necessary to make the viewer ever so slightly disoriented, just enough to keep us receptive to the journey we’re being taken on.  The further we go into the Cat Kingdom, the more sight gags there are on display, to the point that you sometimes have to keep your finger on the pause button to catch them all.  There’s always something entrancing, to me at least, about a story that puts animals in the place of humans, but still manages to include animal like behavior in them, so that they’re not entirely anthropomorphized.  The story is full of cliches, not only from high school based anime but also medieval fantasy stories, but almost none of it is played straight, rather as an excuse for more feline imagery and cat puns. 

It even goes as far as including small plot elements from previous Ghibli films on a very specific level, but never over-relying on them so they stay just below the radar.  The two films it borrows the most from are Spirited Away and Whisper of the Heart, both of which are amusing nods for very different reasons, and there’s even a little Kiki’s Delivery Service thrown in there.  There is a flying scene, as you’ll find in most Ghibli films, but because this movie can’t play anything straight to save it's life, the characters are literally walking on a flock of birds.  Again, this isn’t the film you’re looking for if you want to experience the prestige and grandeur of Studio Ghibli, but if you’re just looking for something fun, unique and creative, you could do a lot worse.

The Cat Returns is available from Gkids, both in DVD, Bluray and steel case forms.  The license originally belonged to Disney, which is why there are so many different versions on the market, and also probably the reason that video reviews have been so difficult to come by on any site that takes the copyright goblins seriously.  The same is true, on every point, for it’s sister film Whisper of the Heart.  There’s also a picture book and manga, but I can’t find much information on either.

I can’t exactly call this one of the great Studio Ghibli movies.  Objectively speaking, if I were to rank the top ten best films from their catalogue this one probably wouldn’t make the cut, mostly due to stiff competition on all sides, but what I can say is that I’m glad Ghibli has something like this in their library.  With every other Ghibli film either offering an emotional roller coaster or a boring disappointment, The Cat Returns is somewhere in the middle...  A chill, laid back, light-hearted comedy that follows it’s own whims, explores it’s own creative vision and just has fun throwing around all possible varieties of cat jokes.  It may not be one of the best Ghibli films ever made, but for me, personally?  It’s on my top ten.

    I give The Cat Returns a 7/10."
156039,"Subpar power fantasy with flat characters and cliché scenarios leading to an overall mid cookie cutter experience. 

The story is poorly executed and the scenes are sloppily designed only to push forth a plot full of holes, a person with any brain will notice that many scenes make no logical sense and are simply convenient for the main character to progress forward. This show is only worth watching in the background to waste time and not worth your attention.

From the start, the general art style and presentation is only okay, but gets worse from there. Scenes feel empty as they seem to be designed to only prop up whatever character is talking and many events don't make much logical sense. For example, the stereotypical scene of a villager accidentally bumping into a corrupt knight walking down a giant street makes little sense to me when the camera pans out and shows how there is an enormous amount of space between the crowd and the small single file line of 3 knights. The villager is chasing a ball, and is willing to run a large distance just to collect it from the floor while bothering a knight they know to be evil and can kill them indiscriminately; why doesn't the villager just ignore the ball and stay in the crowd? Why risk angering a higher power for a simple ball/fruit?

Let's not even get into the fact that the MC is supposed to be a no skill commoner in the eyes of the Holy Knights but they charge him with taking their position to guard the castle. In what world does it make sense for powerful guards to outsource their guard duty to a powerless villager? In any sane world they would be fired for negligence of duty; better yet, if anyone tried to barge into the castle to kill the king they would be able to do it with minimal effort, because it seems like there are no other guards other than the one MC watching the entrance.

Oh, and the female love interest in the story seems to be hell bent obsessed to do anything for the MC. She seems to have nothing better to do in life except support the MC, and shows exceptional favor with no logical reason. There seems to be some backstory where she helped him out of pity and follows up with him, but what makes the MC so special when there seem to be hundreds of abused villagers in the same town? She is supposedly one of 5 noble family knights supporting the kingdom and part of the Holy Knights, but always seems to have time to focus on the MC. There is even a scene where she brings the MC, who is supposedly a normal house servant with her to run an errand, where they meet her mother and the mother seems fine with there being something between them. I honestly don't understand in what world a noble's parents are fine with them being with a random commoner no questions asked. But hey, this is the author's projected power fantasy where the world revolves around him, to each their own.

The story is full of holes, built around nothing but convenience, and any character that isn't the MC is but a folding screen meant to make the MC look better or push some sort of idea such as ""Holy Knights corrupt and bad"",  ""MC weak so pity me"", ""Blonde lady is nice and is the MC love interest""... Any story worth telling in this world is drowned out by the plot propping up the MC as a veritable new messiah.

Watching this show is like enjoying a slow burning dumpster fire.

Graphics quality: 5/10 (average, nothing to talk about)
Story writing: 5/10 (possibly interesting ideas held back by mediocre plot devices)
Execution: 4/10 (plot full of holes, events occur very conveniently)

I have no idea if the source material is any better, but the light novel seems like it would be just another edgy power fantasy in a stereotypical fantasy world. I really wonder what is suppose to make me say that this story is special compared to the sea of other source material stories available."
112788,"1)   Just as with many Japanese animated films, I found Umibe no Étranger on TikTok, but the video I came across was an edit using clips of the explicit scene. There's nothing inherently wrong with enjoying sex scenes from any anime, movie, etc. that aren't problematic. However, it's important to bring light to the fact that there is (or should be) more to BL anime than the explicit scenes, especially in a movie like Umibe no Étranger. This movie is so much more than that. Not to mention the sex scene in this movie was not put in as any kind of fan service, nor there for the sake of being explicit. It serves a purpose and meaning to the story as a whole. Umibe no Étranger is a beautiful story—which is why I'm writing this review. 

 2)  There is an age gap in Umibe no Étranger, and some would consider it to be large.  It is a bit frustrating to see manga/anime that pushes the limit so far when their ages could have been so much closer with no hindrance to the story, and it would be completely understandable for someone to be uncomfortable with their age gap of 7 years (the movie mostly takes place when Shun is 27 and Mio is 20). That being said, nothing about Umibe no Étranger is pedophilic, and nothing about their relationship can be considered grooming. As much as I wish their ages could have been closer,  the characters' relationship does not begin until Mio is well of age. Mio and Shun are both adults. 

 3)   I have not read the manga. This is only my review of the movie. 



 



Unfortunately, I was unable to find this movie anywhere that let me watch it in HD, although I was so anxious to watch that I didn't look very hard.  This took me out of the experience a bit, but the visuals, to me, were still very pleasing and comforting. 



This frame in particular immediately caught my eye, and I thought it was a brilliant and beautifully artistic way to represent the characters. I would include more screenshots but I don't really have the time to go through the movie again, and there aren't many pictures available online. 

 




Good representation for the LGBTQ+ community is hard to find across the board, but it isn't a stretch to say that BL suffers the most from over-sexualization. I was glad to see a movie like  Umibe no Étranger, and throughout the film, I thought to myself ""this actually feels like a queer person wrote it."" Too many films today, anime or otherwise, feel like a straight or cis person looking in and trying to describe what a queer relationship would be like. A film doesn't have to have the absence of homophobia (internalized or otherwise) to portray a queer character, because those are very real things that queer people experience. However, too often it feels like a film comes from a straight perspective, trying to fit queerness into the heteronormative world. Again, there doesn't have to be an absence of those very real problems like questioning one's sexuality or internalized homophobia, but if a story that's meant to be a romance focuses more on those feelings rather than how they affect that character's relationship, or the relationship itself, my bet is a straight person wrote it. 

Umibe no Étranger doesn't do that. [very minor spoiler next sentence] We see Shun struggle with his sexuality, but it feels accurate and real. His struggle to accept his sexuality isn't the focal point of the movie, but it has real effects on his relationship with Mio. An LGBTQ+ romance that isn't just a coming-out story? Wow, what a breath of fresh air. 

See next section for my small inclusion of the wlw characters, Eri and Suzu.

 


This portion of my review will contain spoilers.

I honestly couldn't tell you whether I was just in an emotional mood today or Umibe no Étranger was just that good, but I was already crying a bit after the first 5-10 minutes. There was just something about the way the director(s) portrayed Mio's childhood that really got to me. The contrast between his extremely happy self and the grieving, lonely 17-year-old Mio got me worked up. This movie does an amazing job at storytelling. There is a three-year time skip, but Umibe no Étranger doesn't waste your time with typical queer romance tropes. Even as Shun is struggling with his sexuality, this is simply a barrier in their relationship but is never meant to serve as the sole focal point of the movie. You can feel his frustration and Mio's as they try to piece together what they're feeling and how to go about their relationship. Their fears and concerns are relatable and believable. They are complex, mlm characters that are written brilliantly. This was what got to me the most; Mio and Shun feel like real people that you're watching struggle and fall in love. 



I also appreciated the further inclusion of wlw characters. These kinds of minor details really add to the immersion and representation of Umibe no Étranger, and it just goes to show that by being mindful of details like these can really help to normalize LGBTQ+ relationships in media. The inclusion of Eri and Suzu isn't forceful or out of place, because neither are queer people and their relationships. We simply exist, just as Eri and Suzu do in this movie. 
 


I'm really a sucker for these types of movies, in the same way I love watching 12-episode, emotional anime. Movies like Umibe no Étranger tend to be my favorites. I really enjoyed the storytelling, plot, and characters, and just the overall experience of watching a genuinely good BL anime. I can only hope that we see such good anime adaptations, shows, and films like this for GL anime as well."
228,"“It is difficult to fight against anger, for man will buy revenge with his soul.” The immortal words of the philosopher Heraclitus have never rung truer than they have with the rising popularity of The Hell Correspondence, a mysterious website that’s been trending among Japanese youth by word of mouth and sworn testimonials from the people who claim to have used it. If you’ve followed the popular URL to a dead end, it’s likely because you haven’t tried to access it under the right circumstances… The Hell correspondence website will only appear to those who try to access it at the stroke of midnight, and even then, it will only appear to visitors whose hearts genuinely burn for revenge. This is because The Hell Correspondence is not a joke. It’s not just some trend, or a petty game to alleviate minor school yard tiffs. The business of revenge is real, and like any business, the service it offers does not come cheap. In order to send the object of your ire screaming into the depths of hell, you’ll have to sell your own soul alongside them.

Of course, after you’ve used the site, you’ll hear all of this when you’re paid a visit from it’s contractor, not the dark lord satan himself, but a beautiful, emotionally detached young girl sporting a black middle school uniform and an untied hime hair-style. In a voice as cold and lifeless as her eyes, the girl will introduce herself as Ai Enma, and she will offer you a straw doll with a red thread tied around it’s neck. She will explain her services, as well as the toll they will take on your immortal soul should you choose to employ them, and she will leave you with one simple choice… Pull the string and send your tormentor straight into the depths of hell, body and soul, or deny the animalistic urge inside you and offer them your forgiveness. many Japanese souls have become clients of Miss Enma, and only a select few of them have been able to resist the temptation. But how about you? Have you ever known somebody who you’d sell your soul to have taken care of? You only have one soul to lose, but always remember; Beyond midnight’s veil lies the revenge that you could not exact alone.

Out of all the animation studios I’ve covered in this blog, Studio Deen probably has the worst reputation. I’ve reviewed some shows of theirs that looked good enough, with Sankarea being the most recent example, but if there’s any show they’ve done that perfectly encapsulates all of the negative criticism they receive, it’s Hell girl. It’s not the worst looking anime I’ve ever seen, but the character movement on display here is some of the cheapest I’ve ever seen. It’s embarrassingly bad, and with so many examples of off-looking animation coming to mind, you need only look at the first episode, where the first vengeance victim in the series has to watch a flashback of herself stealing money from a fellow student. The shot of her past self entering the classroom isn’t even the first questionable visual, and yet it’s so jaw droppingly bad that it’s easy to go into denial, claiming that there’s no way the series could ever look that bad again.

Oh, but it can, and it does so with surprisingly often. Movements are stiff and unnatural, running and walking cycles look awkward and out of place, and characters’ faces are constantly off-model, making for a show that you could almost say looks best when it’s not moving, and characters are just sitting around and talking. I say almost, because the show’s budget was clearly reserved for the show’s various punishment scenes, where Ai boards a flaming chariot and affords her victim one last piece of torment before ferrying them to hell. Hell girl rarely employs visual effects outside of these scenes, making for a night-and-day transition between the build-up and pay-off of each episode. I should be impressed by this, as I’ve praised some shows in the past for looking better at the right moment at the expense of quality elsewhere, but they definitely went over-board here. The climax of each episode does look more or less beautiful, with cg fire, endlessly creative visual imagery, the haunting flower design on Ai’s kimono, and a final parting shot of Ai rowing her victim down what I can only assume is the Japanese equivalent of the River Styx.

Unfortunately, as I’ve alluded, these scenes don’t make up for just how bad the rest of the show’s animation looks. The animation may be hit or miss… Although it’s really more miss than hit… But thankfully, the art design is far more decent. It’s never quite as good as the art cards that came packaged with the original DVDs would have you believe, but it’s still easy to get lost in the detailed, immersive backgrounds, and unlike the animation, this level of care doesn’t just get limited to the hell-related material… The backgrounds in Ai Enma’s realm and in the torment scenes are beautiful, yes, but the lighting at various points in the day and the level of detail featured in the myriad of different settings are also surprisingly intricate. As a side effect of the show’s episodic nature, there’s a diverse array of architecture that can often make the series feel more like a tour of Japan than a proper horror title. Similarly, the character designs are just as varied, and while a select few of the people who appear in this series may be on the generic side, they’re still diverse enough to distinctly stand out against the rest of the cast without ever leaving the spectrum of realistic design.

Hell Girl may not be a visual wonder, but where it truly shines is with it’s use of sound. The soundtrack is limited, and you may very quickly notice a few tracks that keep getting used over and over again, but in it’s defense, I can only say this; Don’t mess with perfection. Ai herself is characterized by the chanting of a childlike, disembodied voice, normally accompanied by string music, although there are several other tunes that tell her story. Due of course to the episodic nature of the series, there are several tunes that get repeated as a formula each episode, from the hauntingly complacent tracks floating around in Ai’s downtime to the climactic Jigoku Nagashi that closes out every individual story, but my favorite track would have to be a certain piano piece called Kakugo, which plays up the tension whenever one of Ai’s clients makes a game-changing revelation. It’s unnerving, it’s probably one of the best “Oh shit” type tunes I’ve ever heard in an anime, and it has the unique ability to cut in at any point during the episode, whether it’s following dead silence or cutting off another tune.

The English dub is an early Funimation offering, having come out about eleven years ago, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, the show’s episodic nature has left it’s mark on the cast, too. Hell girl’s dub features what can only be described as a revolving door of 2005 Funimation regulars. Brina Palencia performs one of her earliest roles as the title character Ai Enma, and while most of her dialogue is repeated in each episode, she’s still able to imbue moire and more nuance and developing emotion into what’s supposed to be an emotionless character, and in some of the most uncertain moments, she can convey that the character’s shell is being broken without letting her voice crack or her delivery betray her true feelings. It takes an overwhelming level of talent to have her cake and eat it too in this way, and it’s not hard to see why Brina was bumped up to Funimation’s main voice acting roster following roles like this one and Beck. Her lackeys aren’t quite as dynamic, but they’re distinct enough… Jennifer Seman is knowing and perceptive, Todd Haberkorn is cocky and laid back, and R Bruce Elliot is wise and authoritative, and they all convey a deep sense of devotion and loyalty for their mistress.

I’ve praised John Burgmeier before for being an outstanding talent behind the scenes who has more than enough voice acting chops to lend credence to his writing and direction, and Hell Girl features one of his unfortunately few starring roles. After spending eight episodes establishing the kind of entity Hell Correspondence is, we’re introduced to out-of-work reporter Hajime Shibata and his precocious daughter Tsugumi, who has a mysterious psychic connection to Ai. John Burgmeier remains sincere throughout in his attempts to thwart Ai’s delivery of vengeance, and even though we don’t find out his motivations until the last few episodes, he never really comes off as preachy about it. Luci Christian, despite turning in a cringe-worthy performance as Ai’s first victim(I blame bad direction), is able to make up for it when she returns later on as Tsugumi, a little girl confused between childish idealism and an adult understanding of consequences and the cost of life. Their presence in the story gives it the plot that it needs at exactly the right time, and these two actors could be more of a perfect selection.

As for the assorted revolving door of actors that pass through Hell Girl, there are very few bad performances, but quite a few standouts. There were a lot of flaws in the first episode, but Laura Bailey was incredibly likeable as Ai’s first client. Vic Mignona melts into the role of a crooked veterinarian, and Caitlin Glass is spectacular as the duplicitous foul-mouthed actress who will do anything to anyone in order to secure her future fame and fortune. Jerry Russel turns in a somber performance as an elderly former client of Ai’s who’s accepted his oncoming fate with a mix of hope and melancholy that touches even Ai’s heart. Kate Oxley and Leah Clark play a pair of twins, and since the fact that there’s two of them is meant to be a spoiler, they’re able to match each other’s voices to the point that even the most astute voice chasers wouldn’t know they were different people. Pam Dougherty and Carrie Savage play off of each other wonderfully as a cruel old woman and the poor, unfortunate soul she’s taken in as an indentured servant, with the bitter paranoia of the former feeding into and off of the heartbreaking despair of the latter. I didn’t see this series in Japanese, but I did see season two that way, and I sorely missed the dub when I did, so I’m going to have to recommend dub over sub.

One of the most consistent criticisms I’ve heard about Hell Girl is that it’s repetitive… It has a formula that all episodes must follow, making it something of a monster of the week show, if you were to replace interesting monsters with people beefing with each other. I can’t in good conscience say that this assessment is entirely untrue, as the show does have a solid formula that you’ll pick up on before too long… A person is tormented by another, they ask Ai for help, Ai tells them that they’ll have to sell their souls to hell in exchange for her services, the client gets cold feet, the torment kicks up a notch, they relent, and Ai gets to administer brutal psychological torture on the tormentor before maybe or maybe not giving them a chance to repent for their salvation… Although she never really means it. This may sound like something that might get tiresome after a while, as several anime with similarly cut-and-paste episodic plots are far too willing to rest on their laurels once they’re assured that people will watch the same story over and over again… Just look at Sailor moon and Detective Conan, thank you very much… But there are also several anime that evolve from their formulas.

Shows like Princess Tutu and Neon Genesis Evangelion started off just as formulaic as Hell Girl, with the former following the tried and true ‘Magical girl accomplishes task to collect a piece of something” formula that it probably had to rent from Inuyasha, and the latter established itself as one of the best monster-of-the-week anime of all time before diving headfirst into pretentious bullshit. Like those titles, Hell girl uses it’s first handful of episodes wisely, fleshing out it’s premise at a smart pace, not only exploring the stakes of what people will be doing to each other, but also the extent of ai’s power and the different ways that usage of the Hell Correspondence may vary. By the time the Shibata family enters the story to fight against Ai’s activities, we’ve already seen that a contract with Ai can be used to punish a murderer, save one’s life, and potentially also serve malicious purposes such as taking out one’s rivals. We’ve also seen it established the kind of people who can and can’t access her services, as a shrewd businesswoman with no real desire for revenge finds herself blocked from using it for financial gain. The Hell Correspondence site, Ai Enma herself, and the show’s truest theme, the true cost of vengeance, have all been firmly established by the time the plot gets off it’s feet around episode 9.

The plot culminates in a multi-episode climax that starts off with a certified gut-punch of an episode where the Shibatas are investigating the case against a pretty young nurse, and the results of their investigation shake any faith that young Tsugumi may have had about a black and white justice system where bad people deserve to die, as well as calling into question her… And any viewer’s… Belief that Hell Girl is a benevolent force that exists to help people and to do the right thing. Things spiral out of control from there, with Ai fighting against her curse and two very tragic backstories being revealed as the three main characters are challenged with their own pasts as well as each others’, but more importantly, it doesn’t answer any of the questions it raises about the nature of revenge and forgiveness. It explores the theme from so many angles that you can’t simply boil it down to either one being morally superior to the other, and that’s the sign of good thematic writing. I hate preachy shows that offer messages with definite answers, because life isn’t made of definite answers… It’s made of nuance, of shades of grey, and of different perspectives offering complexity into every single choice a person can make.

Is it okay to punish somebody if they’ve wronged you, or should you accept the fact that the damage has been done and move on? What if you know they’re going to wrong you again, and you have the chance to prevent it at they’re expense? What if you refuse to do so, giving them the benefit of the doubt, but they still hurt you again? Is it okay to get revenge on them then, even thought once again, the damage has been done? What if a person hurts you in a way that has serious implications on your future? What if you have to sacrifice a part of yourself to get back at someone, but it’s a part of yourself you can never get back? Isn’t it possible that someone else might come along and do something worse, but you’ve already cashed in your only chance to sell your soul for revenge, either literally or metaphorically? Could you kill someone to save yourself? To save others? These are the questions Hell Girl asks, and while the characters facing them may find their answers, it’s never made clear whether or not they’re making the right choices and taking the proper actions.

Of course, moral relativism isn’t the only thing this show has going for it. It’s still entertaining, which may be the most important aspect of all. The stories follow a repetitive formula, but it’s never the same story twice, and it’s really easy to get wrapped up in them. They’re all unique, a lot of them can leave you feeling emotional, and yet they’re all important, offering a development to the plot or a new perspective on the theme of vengeance. The only real exception I can think of is episode 10, Friends, which doesn’t really offer anything and ends in what I have to admit is pretty stupid fashion. Aside from that, there’s no filler, and barely any fanservice. In addition to offering a tour of the different Japanese communities and landscapes, it can also teach you a surprising amount about Japan’s various social issues, from obscure topics like collective responsibility and mob mentality to more well known phenomena such as Idol worship, the shunning of outsiders to the psychology behind hikkikkomori culture. Japan is a strange place, where being in the wrong place at the wrong time can have devastating effects on the lives and careers of not only you, but your family and friends as well, and Hell Girl offers an accessible window into how these social systems work.

Of course, I probably shouldn’t go any further without mentioning the obvious downside of having an anime be about vengeance… If there was ever an anime that deserved to have a bunch of trigger warnings attached to it, it would be this one. Hell Girl features a wide and mercilessly thorough spectrum of terrible things that people can do to each other, and never shies away from any of it. Throughout this 26 episode series, you’ll bare witness to acts of sabotage, stalking, attempted murder, actual murder, neglect, child abuse, rape, false accusations, dehumanization, fratricide, infanticide, and no less than two mutually exclusive instances of animal cruelty. This series is not for the faint of heart, and could easily reopen old wounds in the wrong viewer. Another obvious issue would be the pile of inconsistencies surrounding how the Hell Correspondence works… Sometimes people are offered a chance at salvation, sometimes they’re not. sometimes Ai approaches her client immediately, sometimes she has to investigate the circumstances first. She almost always waits to suit up until the string’s been pulled, but there are instances where she does so just to meet the client. There’s a group of girls that occasionally talk about the Hell correspondence in earshot of future clients, but it’s never clarified whether these girls work for Ai or are just doing things randomly.  After a while, the mechanics of Hell Correspondence start to feel arbitrary, which is kind of a huge misstep, but it’s still one hell of a show.

Hell girl is available from Funimation. You can find the individual DVDs pretty cheap on amazon, but full collections, including the thick series box collection and even the thin SAVE pack, are out of print and can easily run over a hundred dollars online. Two follow-up seasons, Two Mirrors and Three Vessels, are available from Sentai Filmworks, although the switch in companies led to them being released undubbed, and they’re not exactly cheap either, although Two Mirrors collection 1 can be found for mere pennies. A manga adaptation by Miyuki Eto is available stateside from Del Rey, and can be found online for relatively cheap, although it’s been over five years since I read the first copy, so I can’t speak as to the quality. A short-lived live action series ran for 12 episodes starting in 2006, and three further manga adaptations have not been released stateside, nor has the handheld video game.

I first saw Hell Girl when the first two episodes aired in Gaiaonline.com’s long forgotten theater feature in 2007. Funimation was airing a few shows there, but Hell girl was the one I became immediately addicted to. I went out and bought the first DVD, and before long, I wound up watching it on it’s own several times through. It quickly became one of my favorite shows as I gathered up each individual disk upon release, before eventually trading it all in for the thinpack to save room on my shelf. I can easily see someone getting frustrated with the formulaic nature of the series, but for me, it just kept getting better and better. Of course, even through my furious rewatchings of the first DVD, even I was able to recognize the pacing issues each episode had, as they could either flesh out the client, the tormentor, or the situation, but there was never enough time for all three… And yet, somehow, my biggest regret about this series is that with so many interesting characters, we never get to check back on any of them. Just one episode set in hell would be enough, really. In any case, if you’re looking for a spooky anime to watch this October, this anthology of antipathetic animosity easily gets one of my first recommendations. I give Hell Girl an 8/10."
440,"Once upon a time many years ago, there was a little princess, and she was very sad, for her mother and father had died. Before the princess appeared a traveling prince, riding upon a white horse. He had a regal bearing and a kind smile. The prince wrapped the princess in a rose-scented embrace, and gently wiped the tears from her eyes. “Little one,” he said, “Growing up alone in such deep sorrow, never lose that strength or nobility, even when you are a young lady. I give you this to remember this day… We will meet again. This ring will lead you to me, one day.” Perhaps the ring the prince gave her was an engagement ring… This was all well and good, but so impressed was she by him that the princess vowed to become a prince herself some day. But was that really such a good idea?

Many years later, Utena has grown into a young lady, and she has not let go of her nobility, dressing in a princely boy’s uniform as she enters middle school at Ohtori Academy. Her style of dress and noble disposition have earned her the mixed attention of her peers, and the ire of the teaching staff. One day, after heroically saving a demure classmate named Anthy from her abusive boyfriend, that boy notices the ring on her finger and challenges her to a duel for her new friend’s honor.

It turns out she wins more than just Anthy’s honor, though… She’s won her engagement, which is something every member of the student council is eager to obtain. As an outsider in this conflict, Utena will have to find out why they want her, why they disregard her feelings, and why they keep calling her The Rose Bride… And she’ll have to do so before the end of the world comes for her.

I’ve stated in previous reviews that JC Staff is generally really good at taking shoe-string budgets and making anime that are, at the very least, decent looking(Ookami-san being the exception that proves the rule). Revolutionary Girl Utena is the pinnacle of their abilities. The animation is low budget and limited by the technology of the nineties, but the majority of it is still smooth and fast-paced, making for some absolutely stunning visuals. There are clunkier moments, particularly in the first story arc, but the staticky frames never feel wasted, thanks to the brilliant use of framing and drop dead gorgeous imagery that’s always on display. Because of this, it looks a lot more expensive than it actually was.

Unfortunately, some of the most impressive looking shots are reused and recycled over and over again, and while it’s easy to excuse the epic stair-climbing scenes for this, as they’re primarily used in the same basic context of magical girl transformation scenes, it’s a lot harder to get over seeing the same exact fight animations in every single action scene. That’s only one minor hiccup, though… The actual character animation is intricate, and while I wouldn’t exactly call a lot of it graceful, you do often get the impression that every single piece of movement from the cast… Be it facial expressions or even subtle body language… is completely deliberate and carries it’s own distinct meaning. The CGI… And yes, there’s CGI in a 1997 show… is rare, but flawless, with the giant upside-down castle in the sky being the perfect example..

But even amongst all of that visual wonder, Utena is at it’s best with it’s character designs. The characters are highly distinctive, memorable, and instantly recognizable, even when it concerns the side and supporting characters. The ones who are tied most directly to the trial of the Rose Bride… Those being Utena, Anthy, and the entire student council… Are color coded, with each character’s hair matching a different color of the rainbow, and with each color representing an important aspect of that character’s personality and story arc in accordance with the teachings of a certain religion(and no, I’m not going to tell you which one). Their designs have become iconic, and deservedly so.

The music has also become iconic, and once again, it’s not very difficult to see why. In it’s downtime, Utena plays with all the music-box type tunes that you’d expect from a shoujo serie There’s a lot of light strings, like violins and harps, and a lot of piano and organ-based tracks as well. It’s nice for what it is, but it would be kind of boring if that were all there was to Utena’s score. Thankfully, when the action scenes start, that’s when this shit kicks into high gear. This is just my personal preference, but a Greek chorus is always a welcome addition to a story, and Utena goes the extra mile of adding a rock opera-type edge to it, making these songs both meaningful AND head-bangingly awesome at the same time. Their job is to get your blood pumping, and they do their job so well that at some points, they can actually lead to disappointment over how quickly and easily a lot of Utena’s duels end.

The opening, Rainbow Revolution(Or Rinbu in some texts, but it makes more sense in context the other way), is easily one of my favorites in terms of both it’s song and it’s video. The song is fast and powerful, has a great beat, and is catchy as all hell. The video keeps great pace with it, showcasing the absolute best of the series’ animation and metaphorical imagery, all while giving every single one of the main characters their chance to shine. The ending themes are also perfectly fine and serviceable, but I admit I skip them almost every single time they play. I’m not saying they’re bad… Far from it, they’re beautiful… But unlike the opening, they’re just not good enough to hold up against my desire to see what happens next in the story.

As for the English dub… Hoo boy, that English dub. Well, you’re going to hear the gospel from both sides of this argument, with fans claiming that they grew up with it and that it’s important to them, and its many many MANY haters saying it’s poorly acted melodramatic tripe. Well, I’m going to have to settle on both sides of the debate on this one. Much like Higurashi, and for somewhat similar reasons, I love the English dub of Utena BECAUSE of how awful it is.

Let me try to explain this through example; The worst performer in this dub by far is Leah Applebaum, who plays Nanami, the proverbial butt-monkey of the series and little sister to one of it’s main characters. Her only other claim to fame in the voice acting world is a single episode of Pokemon, and with this performance, that’s probably a good thing. Her delivery is loud, over the top and hammy, and she over-acts like it’s about to go out of style. She constantly emphasizes every other syllable she says, like a first time stage performer who’s trying way too hard… And failing miserably… To use iambic pentameter. It’s annoying, it’s ball-crushingly terrible, and it’s my favorite performance in the entire dub. Like, for realsies.

As heavily allegorical and fantastic as Revolutionary Girl Utena is, it never feels like a normal story, and it’s characters never really feel like real people, aside from Utena herself. It feels, from beginning to end, like a stage play, and I mean that in the best possible way. It’s melodramatic down to it’s very core, and because of this, the unnatural acting from most of the cast actually serves to express their emotions even more strongly. Nanami, as my chosen poster child, is one of the most melodramatic and annoying characters in the cast, so Applebaum’s performance… Which would make me wish death upon her in any other anime… Is an oddly perfect fit.

The same could be said about every character, really. If an actor’s performance sounds disingenuous and dead inside, it’s because the character is disingenuous and dead inside. If a performance sounds stiff and stilted, that’s probably because the character is hiding a lot of emotional turmoil behind a facade of pride and strength. Rachael Lillis plays the main role as Utena Tenjou, and at times, she can be a little flat and wooden in her delivery, particularly in the first story arc. Then again, it’s kind of to be expected when you realize that she’s playing the only down-to-earth character in a cavalcade of looney toons, basket cases and sociopaths. Besides, whenever she’s called upon to do so, her nuanced emotions are firmly delivered.

While most of the underwhelming performances do get better as the series progresses, there are only two performances in the dub that are genuinely, unequivocally good… But one of them’s just a recurring side character(played by Lisa Ortiz) and the other’s Crispin Freaking Freeman, who really needs no introduction or fanfare to accompany his name. Overall, the original Japanese track is objectively better in pretty much every way, so it’s the version I have to recommend… But to those of us who appreciate it, the charm of the English dub is a hard thing to replicate.

So… When you ask people who’ve seen Revolutionary Girl Utena to tell you whether you should watch it or not, you’re going to get answers that tend to fall into one of two categories. The first category, and by far the more common one, will be “It’s weird and bat-shit crazy, stay the hell away from it.” The other category will tell you “It’s one of the most important anime ever made, and it’s a far more rewarding experience than most people realize.” I fall more into the second category, but I can totally understand the sentiment of the first one… This show IS bat-shit crazy and hard to understand, especially for the people who made the mistake of watching the movie first.

To understand why Utena is the way it is, you have to understand where it came from. The original concept was conceived by a five-person group who called themselves BE-PAPAS, and they aimed to turn their idea into both a manga series and a televised anime series. They handed directorial responsibility of the series over to one of their members named Kunihiko Ikuhara, whose previous experience had consisted of several episodes of Sailor moon. Fearing that Utena would be his first and last major project, he jam-packed it with as much symbolism, subtext, and allegorical ideas as he possibly could, somehow successfully weaving all of his brain-children into one mostly cohesive and gleefully mind-altering story.

Deciphering that story is no small task either, and I dare-say that even after multiple viewings, I’ve only managed to scratch the surface of it… And I wouldn’t have even gotten that far if not for the writings of people like Hope Chapman and Ryan Haeker. In it’s 39 episode run, Revolutionary Girl Utena runs the gamut of such complicated topics as heaven and hell, abuse, psychosexuality, incest, self-realization, gender roles, homosexuality… And much, much more. These concepts are explored through the bevy of likeable yet heavily flawed characters, their often unsettling backstories, and their true motivations that often extend far beyond the desire to see the end of the world.

Most of these concepts are explored by the titular character, Utena, as she either struggles with them in her own mind or encounters them in other people. She’s an astoundingly well written and progressive character, a deliberately normal human being who’s as virtuous and benevolent as any hero should be, but at the same time deals with the same very real teenage insecurities that fictional characters so rarely exhibit. She walks a fine line between feminine and masculine ideals, even as she finds herself caught between the extremist male stereotype and the extremist female stereotype towards the end of the series. She’s constantly tempted to conform to other peoples’ ideals, and while she thinks she’s the only duelist who’s truly fighting for Anthy’s best interests, she may actually be forcing her own ideals onto the rose Bride.

But deciphering this series is NOT as easy as a simple character study. It requires extensive knowledge of different philosophies, religions and psychological theories, none of which you’re given any help with identifying. The easiest parts come when huge clues are dropped in episodes, and by characters, that are entirely unrelated to the subject you’re trying to understand.

For example, and a bit of a spoiler, there’s a plot point towards the end where the main antagonist takes several characters for rides in his car, after which they come out acting more confidant, more self-assured, and more threatening. So, what’s going on here, exactly? Is his car so awesome that riding in it is a life changing experience? Well, to understand this, you have to jump back several episodes, to a story where a very young boy is asking people what it means to be grown up. He’s told by many people that being grown up means doing grown up things, and later in the episode, it’s stated that giving blood is proof of adulthood, as you have to be 16 to do it. Well, do you know what you have to be 18 to do in Japan? Drive a car. The fact that he drives means he does adult things, and the fact that they ride with him… And this is also heavily implied by their body language… Means that he’s either doing adult things with them, or convincing them to do adult things with each other, showing them the ‘end of the world…’ Or the end of their youth. I’m talking about sex, if you haven’t figured that out yet. He’s corrupting a bunch of middle schoolers with his sexuality, and it’s such a well thought out metaphor that all it takes is the subtle visual of his car driving past the word “Stop” to tell you that sometimes, it’s not all that consensual.

And that’s one of the EASIER parts to figure out. This series is a Rubik’s Hypercube, one that lends itself to what may be hundreds of possible interpretations, and I have literally fallen asleep while reading a few of them. It’s a certified rat-king of complicated symbolism, extended metaphors, and mind-fucks aplenty, but luckily, there IS still a highly enjoyable story on the surface. Otherwise, I’d just say fuck it.

Revolutionary Girl Utena is available from Nozomi Entertainment, who rescued the series from obscurity after several years of the individual Central Park Media DVDs being out of print. They re-released the series back in 2011 in a much more attractive format, set in three beautiful artsy black boxes. They’re not exactly cheap, but if you’re patient, you can occasionally find a pretty decent sale on them. At the time of this writing, you can get all three sets on Amazon for around 110 dollars together. They’re well worth the money, too, as they’ve been cleaned up with many visual mistakes from the original printing corrected, and if that’s not enough, it also comes with three revealing booklets, a disk of extras, and the movie, Adolescence of Utena. It doesn’t include any of the CD soundtracks, but they’re all ridiculously easy to find at affordable prices.

Now that I’ve reached the wrap-up, you’re probably expecting me to say that this series is a masterpiece, and that it deserves nothing less than a perfect score. Well, no, it really doesn’t. Remember in my Wolf’s Rain review, where I said that it’s biggest flaw was it’s lack of accessibility? Utena has that same problem ten-fold, plus the issue of recycled animation. I love this series and consider it one of my favorites of all time, and I highly recommend that everybody view it at least once, but I can’t in good conscience say that any anime, of any genre, should require you to study in order to fully enjoy it. For those of us who have tried to interpret it, and those of us who plan to continue trying to interpret it, it’s nothing short of a bottomless treasure chest. For everyone else, it’s still a pretty cool story with outstanding visuals and music. I give Revolutionary Girl Utena an 8/10."
21284,"On first glance, this anime looks like any mid-tier 2010s anime that was forgotten the moment the season was done. An anime about witches living in a village is not a grabbing premise, even for a slice of life series. It not weird that not many people remember this anime aside from the fox clip. But there is something neat that this anime has: It has the Iyashikei tag.

Iyashikei anime are commonly known as healing anime, aka anime that exist so that the viewer can, as they say, ""heal"". This is often fit for cute, fun and relaxing anime, with relaxing having the most emphasis. One fthe most popular anime that has come out that is most representative of Iyashikei is Yuru Camp, an anime that I also personally love to death, and I am by far not the only one doing that. It is not uncommon for Iyashikei to get cult-like followings: The afformentioned Yuru Camp, Yama no Susume, Non Non Biyori, Tonikawa, The Helpful Fox Senko-San, all have very deticated fanbases.

So how do Iyashikei connect with people? Well, why don't we look at Flying Witch for that awnser (that is what this review is about, after all).

Flying Witch is specifically about our main character Makoto becoming a witch at the age of 15, but since she is so challenged in having the feel of direction, her parents decide to sent her to one of her relatives. From here on out, we follow the day-to-day lives of Makoto and the Kuramoto family. We learn about the powers of Makoto and the world of witches. We even get visits of Kowata, the sibling of Makoto, who visits the Kuramoto's house reaaaally often.

The plot is very simple, which is one of the defining characteristics of Iyashikei anime. Having complicated characters and plots get your more immersed with the characters and the world, but having simple characters and a simple, albeit a bit mysterious, world can give more focus on the tone, the comedy and the healing part of Iyashikei. Flying Witch has a simple story and simple characters, but they are endearing to watch. There is almost no cynicism in the anime, with also no amount of pandering. The main focus is the healing part, which is where Iyashikei can make or break for people. Yes, Iyashikei is not for everyone, it might not even be for the people who are fans of the show if they are in the wrong mood. Iyashikei is healing incarnate, so if you are already comfortable or are ready for action/drama, Iyashikei anime will come of as boring. But if you are in the mood for it, Iyashikei does wonders. Seeing characters you like do things they like and be happy, that gives an amazing feeling. Not worrying about any kind of stress, troubles or deadlines and just letting our mind cruise on the happy waves Iyashikei makes causes the feeling of being freed of your own troubles, pains and worries: You get healed.

But Iyashikei can't just be people you liking doing things they like, Iyashikei often have things that make them that extra bit special: Non Non Biyori has great character, Senko-san has a cute fox-wife, Yuru Camp has a great OST and comfy camping, and, what I personally see from it, Flying Witch has a great focus on casualness and an also great OST.

Watching Flying Witch is like taking a day off to work on your grandmothers farm: You see characters without any real worries do simple tasks in casual and funny ways. You meet people who often has magical elements, but are either wonderfully wacky or relatabily casual in their nature. Even with the more magical scenes there is a sense of laid-back wonder that captivates you. There is one episode in Flying Witch in which we see different character go through one day at different times of that day, thus visiting locations previous characters also visited, thus showing those locations from a new perspective. It is such a simple episode but it is one of the best episodes I have ever seen.

This anime healing factor is helped by the OST. As I am writing this sentence I am listening to Flying Witch's OST, and I am enjoying every second of it. The OST is filled with flutes, piano's, harps and more creating beautifully composed music that you notice how good it is during scenes but don't distract you from those scenes. It is amazing.

I know this review wasn't as much about Flying Witch as it was about Iyashikei, but I just wanted to express my love for this genre of anime that has helped me a lot during dark times, with Flying Witch being one of the best examples of it. On its own, Flying Witch is a great, fun anime that is easy to watch and enjoyable to discover the world. The OST is great, the characters are endearing and the world is interesting. It isn't a completely perfect anime, but it is perfect Iyashikei that can heal your soul. Gives this one a watch, especially if you love Yuru Camp."
98443,"I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say I liked it. Quite a lot too. Sure, it was predictable at times, and sure, the quality of the animation took a huge nosedive about halfway through, but I really don’t think it deserves all the hate I’ve been seeing it get lately.

First off: the story. It’s true that from about episode 3 you can tell who’s going to die based on how the anime works. But that doesn’t actually take away from the enjoyment. It’s just like having a friend tell you a major spoiler for a series – the surprise might be gone, but sometimes you enjoy it all the more for that. (The only difference here is that the anime spoilers itself.) I personally didn’t mind knowing who was going to die, it just meant I knew who to focus on when watching an episode. 

Character development was basically episodic. One episode per character (although there were exceptions). I thought Tiger’s story was great – that was probably my favourite part of the anime. Most of the backstories were interesting (with the exception of Snake and Dragon, or at least that’s my opinion), and the characters were just quirky enough that I enjoyed watching them without getting bored. That’s actually one thing that can be a con for an anime, but in this case was a pro; the amount of time spent on each character was manageable - bite sized pieces, if you will. 

The ending, whilst not necessarily a brilliant one, was nevertheless a fitting send-off for the show. The anime did take a rather different approach during the last episode – much more philosophical – but it addressed the question raised at the beginning. I thought the way the wish (the overall point to the story) was handled was very thought-provoking, and even though I didn’t necessarily agree with the wish itself, it was very human. That humanity is something that the anime needed after the Taisen bloodbath. It gave the show…closure, you might call it. There were some plot-holes, and some questions that remained unanswered, but in relation to those I don’t think answers were actually needed.

There were a lot of fabulous fight scenes (at least in the first half), and some pretty good music too.
The anime was faithful to its Battle Royale/Hunger Games trope, and even though there are parts of it that I feel could have been handled better, I respect it for that. (In regard to parts that could have been handled better…I’d say basically everything to do with Rabbit. My main bugbear; there was so much potential…)

Nonetheless, if you like the survival horror trope, and like seeing a mix of interesting characters (but don’t mind if there’s not much plot), I’d recommend you check out Juuni Taisen.

Enjoy watching! XD"
8630,"If you've watched anime regularly for the past ten years or longer, you'll remember the sudden boom in trashy harem light novels that occurred in the early 2010's, as well as the rush of anime adaptations that accompanied them. The plot for every single one of them went pretty much the exact same way: a boy with a hidden ability, who appears inept and hapless at first glance, meets a powerful, usually red-headed girl who is at the top of her class in every aspect and has a personality as fiery as her hair color. Their first encounter involves a fortunate accident of some sort, following which the girl calls the boy a pervert / sexual harasser / other words to that effect, and swears to remove him from every plane of existence. Yet as the boy's hidden power is unearthed, and his unwaveringly honorable and occasionally kind personality comes to the fore, the girl's smoldering grudge slowly burns into a blazing romance. Throw in some gratuitous fanservice, enigmatic enemies and a generous smattering of jealous childhood friend, and you have Aria the Scarlet Ammo.

And Campione. And Chivalry of a Failed Knight. And Bladedance of Elementalers. And Sky Wizards Academy. And so on, and so forth.

In the end, what makes Aria the Scarlet Ammo stand out is that it doesn't really stand out at all. It doesn't try to over-complicate things, or be more than what it needs to be. You shut your brain down, laugh at the stupid things, cringe at the cliches, and smile at how cute the girls are. In that sense, this anime is the best of its kind, but also the worst of its kind.

Premise (2/5): The first paragraph of this review tells you everything that you need to know, though the minutiae of the premise are still somewhat interesting in their own right. Aria, an S-class ""Butei"" (the series' term for a teenager who somehow knows more martial arts and gun fu than most action movie stars), is trying to clear the name of her mother, who's been sentenced to jail for so many crimes that her total jail time is set to last just under a millennium. Which, in a world where criminals run so rampant that the police alone can't be trusted to bring all of them in - hence the need for Butei - doesn't seem all that crazy. The Japan that's depicted in Aria the Scarlet Ammo looks remarkably peaceful for a place that's supposedly plagued with wrongdoers, but not much of the setting itself is shown, so one can only speculate about what goes on beyond the characters' purview. 

Aria's struggles to free her mother and find those who framed her eventually pit her against the mysterious criminal organization known only as ""EU"". I don't think Aria the Scarlet Ammo is Brexit propaganda, so I still have no idea what EU stands for - though I suspect that question would be answered if I read the light novels, which I don't plan to do. Along the way, it's also revealed that the characters are actually all descendants of famous fictional literary figures: Aria is Sherlock Holmes' great-granddaughter, and the descendant of Arsene Lupin, alongside the immortal Count Dracula himself, also make appearances. Which makes absolutely no sense, given that the characters' lineages have little to do with the actual substance of the story, but it is what it is.


Another day, another bedroom destroyed by your murderous girlfriends.

Characters (1/5): Tsunderes are an acquired taste. Tsunderes who can actually kill you, probably even more so. If not for the guns strapped to her thighs and the swords on her back, Aria would give off the air of an angry kitten which you can't help but love even if it keeps trying to scratch your eyes out. I was more than fine with how she was, mainly because the other girls in the show were, to put it bluntly, mostly quite boring. Riko, a salacious anti-hero with a badly-explored traumatic past and the inconceivable ability to manipulate her hair without touching them, was perhaps the most interesting member of the rest of the cast, but the plain truth was that there simply was not enough time in the anime to elaborate on all the characters' backstories. Aria the Scarlet Ammo does its best with what it has, and I couldn't really ask for too much more.

The main male character, Kinji, has the ultimate harem protagonist power: his beleaguered mind houses a smart, savvy, slick operator of an alter ego who only comes out when he's aroused. Thus, a lot of the anime involves Kinji getting horny in his hour of need so he can actually be useful when the shite hits the fan. Most of the time, he's a wet-blanket failure of a Butei with nothing remarkable about him whatsoever. The main antagonist, who is apparently the manifestation of Count Dracula - although I don't remember Count Dracula being a werewolf - spawns out of the body of the students' hot homeroom teacher and takes little over half an episode to kill. Sounds stupid, but again he feels like a victim of the poor characterization caused by the short overall series length.

Horrible, I know. But what else did you expect?


The angriest kitten.

Audiovisuals (3/5): For an anime that's clearly more about fanservice and eye-candy than the actual story, Aria the Scarlet Ammo pulls a lot of punches. That's not a bad thing, as I don't particularly like fanservice, and it means a lot of resources are devoted to other, more substantial things. For example, the action sequences are surprisingly decent, and the character designs are cute - though they may be off-putting if you're not used to seeing eyes that stretch halfway across a character's face, or absolutely humongous foreheads. (Just early 2010's anime things, I guess.)

The soundtrack was alright, though special mention has to be given to the OP and ED, which were great both audially and visually. Hearing the instrumental rendition of the OP playing during the climaxes gave me chills, and I appreciate the anime being tasteful about its use. All in all, the audiovisuals served their purpose, which is good enough for me.


Barebones eye-candy.

Execution (2/5): Like a lot of light novel anime adaptations, Aria the Scarlet Ammo only gives viewers a taster of the whole series. Most of these adaptations are little more than glorified advertisements for the light novels - which is a shame, since I could see myself watching more seasons of this if it were animated, but I simply can't be bothered to chase the story via the light novels. The light novels are still running, which shows amazing longevity for a series like this, but I suppose it's not the most difficult thing in the world to make such a straightforward premise last as long as the author needs it to.

In any case, many of the aforementioned problems are purely down to the anime not being long enough. Nothing is really explained all that well, and so the story keeps tripping over its many deficiencies. Characters constantly shift in and out of focus, and a few of them end up serving little to no purpose. There probably is an elaborate and fascinating plot hidden in there somewhere, but nothing I've seen suggests that that might be the case. Aria the Scarlet Ammo is mindless fun, but its self-imposed limitations mean it can never be any more than that. Not that it really tries to be, anyway - I enjoyed the humor and the action wherever I found them, and the anime's linear and uncomplicated structure lent itself to that enjoyment.

Expect anything more than a cookie-cutter superhero harem story, and you'll inevitably drop the anime and watch something else. Expect nothing from Aria the Scarlet Ammo, and you'll never be disappointed.


A dumb show with dumb characters, but it has its moments."

============================================
[EN]
Arslan Senki is released alongside with part of Spring 2015 Anime Season. Followed by other great animes like [Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season](http://anilist.co/anime/20792), [Grisaia no Rakuen](http://anilist.co/anime/21006), [OreGairu 2nd Season](http://anilist.co/anime/20698), [Owari no Seraph](http://anilist.co/anime/20829), and many other anime that makes me pass Arslan Senki during the airing season.

For disclaimer information that, i'm watching this first time and never read this manga, LN, or anything like that. Also, i've never watched this anime's [2nd Season](http://anilist.co/anime/21424). So, i wrote this review honestly after finish watching this anime.

First of all, lemme start with some short, quick, and spoiler-free review regarding the anime.

This anime's main chara is Arslan himself, an innocent child, a son from his father that also known as King of Pars called Andagoras III and her mother is a Queen of Pars named Tahamenay. God, you don't belive how beautiful is she.

If we talked about Political, i can relate this anime like [Tales of Zestiria the X](http://anilist.co/anime/21221) with same political issue but ofcourse not with any magical thing.
About Tactical Battle, i can relate something like [Kakumeiki Valvrave](http://anilist.co/anime/16668), [Aldnoah.Zero](http://anilist.co/anime/20632), and [Code Geass](http://anilist.co/anime/1575).
This anime is really unique, because most of many anime that has Millitary theme is set a world theme like Space, Present Millitary War, or Kingdom with Sword and Magic world theme. But, Arslan Senki using world theme of Persian and even Indian which is really unique experience to watch.

If you like and finish watched 3 anime that i've mentioned above, then i recommended you to watch it.

Below this are Heavy Spoiler review. Please Read it with caution!

Story Development: 8.1
The entire story of this anime title is: A story of Arslan who retaken a kingdom where once they've lost, for first 12 episodes. Yes, for first 12 episodes. The pace of the story also step-by-step is changing to another direction of really brighter and also... a darker story.

Because i don't like OP Characters, here we are shown a story of Arslan that ""he fight from zero, without any knowledge to lead, without any knowledge to fight, and a new spirit to begin with"". Arslan begun a story as innocent kid who destined to become a next King. Arslan also very different with other noble kid in his age, we all know that ""a kid always have a sense to know more"" and that sense is also with Arslan. In meantime he's practicing, his father cameback from battlefield and captured several Lucitanian soldier to Ecbatana which is Kingdom of Pars's Homeland. There was also a Lucitanian soldier who looks like a kid Etolle, because of Arslan's curiousity, he came to where she was locked up. Before Arslan reached the cage, a group of three kids also searching for Lucitanian's kid that held on a cage came to torture this kid. But, Etolle uses this chance to escape and held Arslan as a hostage until she leaves Ecbatana.

From a little summary above, this anime has dark story to be told. Yes, this Kingdom of Pars has Slavery Law. And because of that, Etolle also wants to free all Lucitanian Slave to their freedom.

Not only that, dark story need to be told. There was also a dark rebellion from inside the royal noble family of Pars done by Andragoras that makes Arslan's first battle a great loss. Yes, a great loss, ofcourse Arslan gone shock to deep from his heart and a bit of trauma that his comrades dead in front of his eyes.

Another summary story that very political came from indian themed kingdom called Sindhura that also has a same struggle with Arslan but in terms of Royal Lineage of Sindhura. Making an agreement to help Rajendra takes a throne as a King of Sindhura.

I don't want to spoiler more, but it's really interesting how each story flows and makes me curious about something unexpected happen.

Character Plot: 7.8
this anime has bunch of great character design and it's personality. I'll list few characters this anime has pros and cons:
1. Arslan
He's really plain minded person, also a king that really populist among lower society level. You can tell with how his face looks when facing Etolle and others, caring with everybody and really a good person.
2. Farangis
The only true maiden of love war here is Farangis. A dedicated cleric to the goddesses Misra that also strongest female fighter in the world (ofcourse, according to her own account). A real Waifu here for Motherlike lover.
3. Etolle
First episode of this anime, you may look this is a boy. But oh man, after you've reached 2nd half, you'll realized that she's a girl. She's should be a knight in an honor to protect Arslan. Yea, seriously. If that's gonna happen, she's waifuable.
4. Gieve
From all of Arslan's party, he's really toxic amongst other party members. I really don't like him especially when he talks to Tahamenay. You think, why i'm giving Character Plot to 7.8? Because of this person.

Graphic/Visual/Effect: 7.8
This anime has pretty normal and standard visualization. Nothing special but, plus point on battle, where the point of view is really accurate and bring the feel of battle

Background Music: 7.5
The background music for this anime is... nothing special and normal for it's genre. As long as it's fit with it's battle, no problem with it.

Overall: 7.8
What makes me like this anime? Because... this has same feel like previous anime i've mentioned. And watched at very great moment when Indonesia has really terrible situation. Politics regarding presidential election is always happened every 5 years, and we Indonesian have same president candidates this time with different vice president. Just funny because, the election isn't even started, but opposition calls this election is not fair, there was many fraud like distric leader isn't independent, etc. And something terrible happened at May 21st and May 22nd 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Luckily, that incident not ended up like how Andragoras III killed Osthros who is known as his Brother and take over the throne also it's wife.

I hope you guys enjoyed the show, thanks for reading my review. And then, until next time :)

==================================================================
[ID]
Arslan Senki dirilis bersamaan sebagai bagian dari Spring 2015 Anime Season. Diikuti oleh berbagai anime hebat seperti [Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season](http://anilist.co/anime/20792), [Grisaia no Rakuen](http://anilist.co/anime/21006), [OreGairu 2nd Season](http://anilist.co/anime/20698), [Owari no Seraph](http://anilist.co/anime/20829), dan masih banyak anime lain yang cukup membuatku melewatkan Arslan Senki pada saat musim tayangnya.

Sekadar informasi bahwa, saya pertama kali menyaksikan Arslan Senki dan belum pernah sama sekali membaca Manga, LN, dan sejenisnya. Juga, saya belum pernah menonton Season 2 dari anime ini. Jadi, saya dengan jujur menulis review ini setelah menyaksikan animenya terlebih dahulu.

Pertama-tama, saya mulai dengan ulasan singkat, cepat, dan bebas spoiler tentang anime.

Chara utama anime ini adalah Arslan sendiri, anak yang )innocent, seorang putra dari ayahnya yang juga dikenal sebagai King of Pars bernama Andagoras III dan ibunya adalah Queen of Pars bernama Tahamenay. Oh God, you guys won't belive how beautiful is she.

Jika kita berbicara tentang Politik, saya dapat menggambarkan anime ini seperti [Tales of Zestiria the X](http://anilink.co/anime/21221) dengan masalah politik yang sama tetapi tentu saja tidak dengan magic.
Tentang Tactical Battle, saya dapat menggambarkannya dengan anime seperti [Kakumeiki Valvrave](http://anilist.co/anime/16668), [Aldnoah.Zero](http://anilist.co/anime/20632), dan [Code Geass](http://anilist.co/anime/1575).
Anime ini sangat unik, karena sebagian besar anime yang memiliki tema Millitary diatur tema dunia seperti Space, Peperangan jaman sekarang, atau Kingdom with Sword and Magic world theme. Tapi, Arslan Senki menggunakan tema dunia Persia dan bahkan India yang benar-benar pengalaman unik untuk ditonton.

Jika Anda suka dan selesai menonton 3 anime yang telah saya sebutkan di atas, maka saya sarankan Anda untuk menontonnya.

Di bawah ini adalah ulasan Heavy Spoiler. Silakan baca dengan Kesadaran pribadi!

Pengembangan Cerita: 8.1
Seluruh cerita dari anime ini adalah: Sebuah kisah tentang Arslan yang merebut kembali kerajaannya, untuk 12 episode pertama. Ya, untuk 12 episode pertama. Langkah cerita juga selangkah demi selangkah berubah ke arah lain yang really-really brighter dan juga... a darker story.

Karena saya tidak suka Karakter OP, di sini kita diperlihatkan kisah Arslan ""dia bertarung dari nol, tanpa pengetahuan untuk memimpin, tanpa pengetahuan untuk bertarung, dan semangat baru"". Arslan memulai sebuah cerita sebagai anak yang tidak bersalah yang ditakdirkan untuk menjadi Raja berikutnya. Arslan juga sangat berbeda dengan anak bangsawan lainnya di usianya, kita semua tahu bahwa ""seorang anak selalu memiliki rasa ingin tahu lebih banyak"" dan pengertian itu juga ada di Arslan. Sementara itu dia berlatih, ayahnya mundur dari medan perang dan menangkap beberapa tentara Lusitania ke Ecbatana yang merupakan Kerajaan Tanah Air Pars. Ada juga seorang prajurit Lusitania yang terlihat seperti anak kecil Etolle, karena penasaran Arslan, dia datang ke tempat dia dikurung. Sebelum Arslan mencapai kandang, sekelompok tiga anak juga mencari anak Lusitania yang sedang ditahan datang untuk menyiksa anak ini. Tapi, Etolle menggunakan kesempatan ini untuk melarikan diri dan menahan Arslan sebagai sandera sampai dia kabur meninggalkan Ecbatana.

Dari sedikit ringkasan di atas, anime ini memiliki dark story untuk diceritakan. Ya, Kerajaan Pars ini memiliki Hukum Perbudakan. Dan karena itu, Etolle juga ingin membebaskan semua budak Lusitania untuk kebebasan mereka.

Tidak hanya itu, masih ada dark story yang perlu diceritakan. Ada juga pemberontakan gelap dari dalam keluarga bangsawan kerajaan Pars yang dilakukan oleh Andragoras yang membuat pertempuran pertama Arslan menjadi kekalahan besar. Ya, kekalahan besar, tentu saja Arslan menjadi sangat terkejut dari hatinya dan sedikit trauma yang kawan-kawannya mati di depan matanya.

Ringkasan cerita lain yang sangat politis datang dari kerajaan bertema India bernama Sindhura yang juga memiliki perjuangan yang sama dengan Arslan tetapi dalam hal Royal Lineage of Sindhura. Membuat kesepakatan untuk membantu Rajendra naik takhta sebagai Raja Sindhura.

Saya tidak ingin semakin spoiler, tetapi sangat menarik bagaimana setiap cerita mengalir dan membuat saya ingin tahu tentang sesuatu yang tidak terduga terjadi.

Character Plot: 7.8
anime ini memiliki banyak desain karakter yang hebat dan kepribadiannya. Saya akan mencantumkan beberapa karakter anime ini memiliki pro dan kontra:
1. Arslan
Dia benar-benar orang yang berpikiran jernih, juga seorang raja yang benar-benar populis di kalangan masyarakat kelas bawah. Anda bisa tahu dengan bagaimana wajahnya terlihat ketika menghadapi Etolle dan yang lainnya, peduli dengan semua orang dan benar-benar orang yang baik.
2. Farangis
Satu-satunya maiden of love war di sini adalah Farangis. Seorang ulama yang berdedikasi untuk dewi Misra yang juga pejuang wanita terkuat di dunia (ofcourse, menurut pengakuannya sendiri). Real Waifu here untuk yang suka dengan Motherlike personality.
3. Etolle
Episode pertama dari anime ini, Anda mungkin melihat dia adalah seorang laki-laki. Tapi oh man, setelah Anda mencapai 2nd half, Anda akan menyadari bahwa ia seorang gadis. Dia harus menjadi ksatria dalam kehormatan untuk melindungi Arslan. Ya, serius. Jika itu terjadi, she's waifuable loh.
4. Gieve
Dari semua kelompok Arslan, dia benar-benar toxic di antara anggota lainnya. Saya benar-benar tidak menyukainya terutama ketika dia berbicara dengan Tahamenay. Anda pikir, mengapa saya memberikan Character Plot ke 7.8? Karena orang ini.

Grafik / Visual / Efek: 7.8
Anime ini memiliki visualisasi yang cukup normal dan standar. Tidak ada yang istimewa selain, plus point on battle, di mana sudut pandangnya benar-benar akurat dan menghadirkan nuansa pertempuran

Background Music: 7.5
Background music untuk anime ini... tidak ada yang istimewa dan normal untuk genre itu. Selama cocok dengan pertempuran itu, tidak ada masalah dengan itu.

Secara keseluruhan: 7.8
Apa yang membuat saya suka anime ini? Karena ... anime ini punya cerita yang sama seperti anime sebelumnya yang saya sebutkan. Dan menyaksikannya pada momen yang sangat tepat ketika Indonesia memiliki situasi yang sangat mengerikan. Politik mengenai pemilihan presiden selalu terjadi setiap 5 tahun, dan kami orang Indonesia memiliki kandidat presiden yang sama kali ini dengan wakil presiden yang berbeda. Lucu aja karna, pemilihan bahkan belum dimulai, tetapi oposisi menyebut pemilihan ini tidak adil, ada banyak penipuan seperti pemimpin daerah tidak independen, dll. Dan sesuatu yang mengerikan terjadi pada 21 Mei dan 22 Mei 2019 di Jakarta, Indonesia . Untungnya, kejadian itu tidak berakhir seperti bagaimana Andragoras III membunuh Osthros yang dikenal sebagai saudara laki-lakinya dan mengambil alih takhta juga istrinya.

Saya harap kalian menikmati tontonannya, terima kasih telah membaca ulasan saya. Dan sampai jumpa di review selanjutnya.

if you still wanna watch the Movie then do that before reading this Review
You've been Warned



I have a feeling i'm a person that doesn't have ""Standards"" in anime when ether it's being Cynical or just there for having fun. I for one not the kind of person who can tell right away when Something is Style over Substance, especially when it's in something i am enjoying to the fullest like the Majority of Trigger's works. but i can clearly tell you that Fireworks has No Style, Nor Substance. because let me tell you, this is a Mess

At first it doesn't actually doesn't seem to be a Bad Movie. it's animated by Studio Shaft which has a decent track record of good shows and movies (including Madoka Magica which is one of my favorites), had a pretty Great music video to follow it's Hype, it has the Producer of Your Name in it, as it was advertised in Trailers and Posters of the film, and all of that sounds like it could be a great movie right? No. 
Fireworks is probably the Worst Anime movie i have ever seen in my life that's on par with Ni No Kuni so you know it's gonna be quite a Disaster



so what's the Story about? well it has 3 plots that connects into a Grander story.. i think, 
these 2 Plots are:

Plot No. 1 - Nazuma's Parent problems and romance with Norimichi. also a Love Triangle with Yusuke too with a Sphere that can travel through time
Plot No. 2 - Norimichi's class mates wants to blow up some Fireworks cause they wanna see if they're Flat or Round

Before we get deeper onto the Main Characters and Story, let's talk about it's Presentation instead

the Animation is Awful. the Trailers made the animation look great and almost on par with other beautiful anime films like A Silent Voice... but in the actual movie, the 2D animated scenes are really mediocre looking especially for how each and every scene for some reason the characters faces and body proportions are really off and inconsistent to each other. sure there are some nice looking shots and animation bits but it's mostly flat, and don't get me started on the 3D animation... it just doesn't mix well with the already less than pleasing 2D animation and feels like such a Distraction to the viewer. it's not like in Promare were both 2D and 3D animation mixes up well with each other giving it a Beautiful Stylish touch to the film, Fireworks is like ""The Scorpion King"" levels of unpleasant visuals.
aside from that, the voice acting is surprisingly bad along side Dialogue that reeks of poorly written. these are all good actors and yet it feels as if the Direction on it is not even trying to make it feel more emotional or stronger than it is which is terrible. the Soundtrack is forgettable at best and at worst Sappy and on the nose with no flair to it

Anyway back to the Story and Characters

Plot No. 1 - Norimichi's friends wants to throw some Fireworks because they wanna know if the Fireworks on the Sky are Flat or Round. i wished i was making that up but yeah this is plot 1 and that's about it. feels like it has no impact or really any importance to the plot cause they just wanna see the Fireworks if they are Flat or Round and that's like... boringly dumb, and there's also a ""Haha"" funny joke about the friends about the Teacher's chest Size and it was just dumb and uncomfortable at best..

Plot No. 2 - Nazuma is in love with Norimichi so she decides to call him and Yusuke (aka the worst character of the whole movie but we'll get to that later) into a Swimming contest and Yusuke wins but in reality she wanted Norimichi because Yusuke doesn't really show off that he has feelings for her as we see her running away from her Mother so it seems like she's in quite the trouble but we don't know quite yet why.. maybe is it abuse?

and then there's the Marble that is the driving force that keeps the movie going. so whenever you throw this Ball as far as you can, it can make you travel back to the previous point you mention as the Ball is thrown like say ""I wanted to be there with her and give a hand!"" and then you go back into that moment from where you were so you could change the future. the Rules of how to use the sphere is very straight forward but.. what is this thing made of and how does it can even do that? guess what? The movie never explains about it and it's a huge Plot Hole that can ruin someone's experience on wanting to know more about it. i'm not into being too picky with Plot Holes but this was the first movie to bother me the MOST about it

Now onto the Characters. everyone is literally forgettable and serves nothing aside from moving the plot forward to whatever it goes into. only 3 characters here matters aka the ""Love Triangle""

img520()

This is Norimichi. he has no personality aside from being a main character that doesn't have anything special inside of him aside from being another ""Pretty boy"" Main character which is somehow even more bland than other Main characters who are considered ""Tiring"" and ""Boring"" in animes recently. he also can't make up his mind sometimes like when he's about to go out with Nazuma because of the Date thingy but at his house he's like ""I can't cause i'm too scared"" but then a minute later he decides to go out with her anyways so like... what was the point of that scene? so yeah he's not the WORST Main character ever written but man is he a Boring character

img520()

Nazuma is just yet another Generic female character and there's barely any sort of good character development or story that i could follow about her to make me care about it.. her plot about her mother forcing her to go away with her whenever they go to a new place cause she got a new Boyfriend like... ok??? there's also this one kinda cute scene on the Train when she's talking to Norimichi about her ""Feelings"" and how she wants to be a Singing Idol and again, why should i care when this character barely have made me invested on her because of Parenting issues.. and the Music and scene itself isn't even Powerful or good because of that HORRIBLE part where everything simply turns into a CGI Fairy Tale and it's Horrifying :')

img520()

and then you have Yusuke. i HATE Yusuke with a loving passion. you know that ""First"" time on the timeline that he wins instead of Norimichi? well when Nazuma asks for his help while hanging out with his Friends, when she goes away with her mom by Force he just Laughs at her like ""Ha. Girls they're so silly am i right??"" and on the other time line where Norimichi wins, Yusuke gets so jealous with Norimichi that at one point he gets unecessarily mad at him that, at one point when he sees Norimichi and Nazuma together on the Lighthouse he PUSHES THEM FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE TO LET THEM DIE!! i mean of course they don't actually die because they had the Time Travel Sphere but if it happened without it, i'd confirm that Yusuke is a Horrible person by this scene alone, and the others before it. I can't see a single person who enjoys this character who would legit kill his own friends because of Love. he's the main reason i hate this movie so much..

img520()

As for the Ending? well.. i don't even know what the Hell happened and i don't care about it. but to keep things simple, the Time Travel Sphere that the main characters had was simply left off laying around the Beach and then a guy who was responsible for the Fireworks just like... put the thing on the Fireworks launcher, fires to the Sky and... glasses containing people's desires starts to fall from the Sky and i'm supposed to feel anything about it? even the Music that, i'll admit it's very beautiful, doesn't make the scene any more interest or strong. and then at the end of the movie we see the Teacher calling the students names and when they call up Norimichi and Nazuma's name they don't respond cause they disappeared or run away? who knows if this was a Bittersweet ending or not, cause the Entire experience was a Spicy Trash Fire if you ask me

I'm sorry if my Review will end up feeling complicated and a bit hard to follow with my mediocre English and I really hate being overly negative with something like this and i know how there's so many people who loved this movie and i respect that. anyone can enjoy this movie regardless of what i say to them or not. Anyone can love a anime as much as they want... i Loved Space Patrol Luluco for crying out loud, and that's one of the least talked Trigger animes out there since people mostly talk about their other stuff.. but i'm sorry. this Movie was shockingly terrible as every minute felt like an annoyance, sign of Boredom or just lacking enjoyment on the Plot

it may not be the Worst movie ever made overall as there's plenty of worst animated or just overall movies in general that deserve worse.. but this is almost as bad as those for me.."
153658,"I am writing this review after 5 hours of finishing the movie in the cinema and I felt it was great and not that great at the same time. I finished the anime about 3 months ago and I'm used to the 8-12 episodes tournament style of story telling. They'll normally spend 2-3 episodes doing flashbacks and hyping the audience up for the finale. However, since this movie was only around 2 hours long, they don't have the luxury to include all characters' back stories, how their parents died, how volleyball was their way of life, their revenge arc etc. (That was obviously a joke). It does some comedic relief at the start of the movie, it felt like getting the audience warmed up for the story. In between these comedic skits there would be sudden pauses and the whole mood would get serious but it's back to comedy again. In the later half of the movie shit hits the fan and they get serious... yet they don't.

In previous matches Karasuno has played. It felt like a kill or get killed situation. The vibe was very tense, the mood was very sharp and the players were out for the taste of victory. But in this match (Karasuno vs Nekomata) it felt like a match to settle their long rivalry, and not as tense as the previous matches. Maybe this is because it's been a while since I finished the anime and my mind has overhyped the previous matches or whatnot but that's how I felt after I've calmed down and gathered my thoughts. I can't elaborate the details of what happened but for those who have watched the movie and would like to know my shit takes, I'll include a spoiler section very down below.

Putting that aside, by no means am I saying this was not a hype movie. The cinema does the anime justice with it's godly sound system, a lot of times I found myself in tears (not crying) because of how loud the sound of the volleyball hitting the ground is, it felt like I was really watching a volleyball match at the front row. Other than that, the animation quality also went up. Instead of wide shots (shots where the viewers can see the whole court and where the ball is going), they included more ""follow the ball"" shots, basically instead of showing a zoomed out view of the court, they zoomed into it and also tracked the ball to make the vibe more intense. I don't know if they used CGI or not but as far as I can see, it was all hand drawn. I couldn't notice any CGI being used. OH and also they included a first person POV shot of what it feels like to play on court, damn that was epic.

To conclude this review, the ending of the movie really caught me off guard. ""That's it?"" was what was left in my mind when I saw the ending and sat partly through the credits, letting the whole movie sink in. Maybe that's exactly what the director wanted it to be, a not so tense friendly match of long rivals as opposed to a hardcore game of call of duty. Whatever the case may be, I didn't like it that much.

Feel free to DM me anything. Though I'm not active on this site.

=== Spoiler section ===

!The reason why I said it wasn't as hyped is because in the previous matches they were literally fighting to fight Nekomata. So they had to qualify in order to fight it, they're basically putting their dream on the line on every match and betting it all to win. The movie however, everyone was smiling. Even when Nekomata lost they still smiled, there was no one that was crying... actually there was but the whole mood was too positive for me to feel like it was a life or death situation. Typing this I realise I'm a too pessimistic person.!"

The opening sequence of a cat-natured girl with a soft, piano melody trailing behind, Acchi Kocchi bares its mellow-sweet virtues without a poker face. Detailing the school-life and afterschool shenanigans of Io and Co., the show's poison seeps for relentlessly, numbing pleasure.

Despite the tranquil opening sequence, though, Acchi Kocchi derives much of its relaxing effect from its slapstick. With its colorful cast of the prankster duo Mayoi and Sakaki, moe (through blissful ignorance) character Hime, tsun/kuudere hybrid Tsumiki and the Jack-of-all-trades Io, their distinct personality quirks ensure commonplace shenanigans. The show modestly sticks with the traditional manzai routine, the basis of many of the jokes, but generously rotates the boke and tsukkomi roles between everyone for slight refreshment. Where Mayoi's dysfunctional inventions takes up the helm of one joke, the next one renders her the bewildered straight-man in the face of Tsumiki's superhuman physical prowess, and oft the unfortunate victim of it. 

The thin veil of romance between Tsumiki and Io is still one of the most endearing things to bear witness to. Though, it's much more one-sided, making it all the more enticing and ship-worthy. The cat motif often make up both the jokes and intimacy of their relationship, with Tsumiki's (accidental) feline mannerisms striking a nerve within the cat-loving Io. Though, the amusingly diabetic moments aside, there's occasionally a few heartfelt scenes removed of the comedy that makes the romance subtlety pop out.  

Inside the cube of a school setting, Acchi Kocchi diligently reuses the subsettings per the invisible guidelines of the school comedy, slice-of-life genre. The afterschool arcade, the summer excursion, friends' homes; nothing sets Acchi Kocchi apart its genre peers largely in this respect and it's appreciated.  


 img420()

 img420()




For how simple Acchi Kocchi is, there's still consideration behind cultivating its relaxing charm. The background music has subdued heart, taking care to ease the audience with its soft melodies, chirpy tunes and occasionally an upbeat chant in the more action-oriented scenes. The aforementioned opening sequence is one such considerate instance, with a gentle piano accompanying silent shots of the snowed city. Though scarce compared to the comedic ones, the more tranquil scenes of Acchi Kocchi best boast the its calming musical virtue, alone feeling like a mini-therapy session. 

Though not quite chibi, the character designs somewhat border around there with their bobbly heads and rather pudgy bodies, which stays true to the original manga designs. Nothing out of the ordinary in this genre, I suppose. For how amusingly skewed some of the characters' personalities are, the VA cast performed well in bringing their caricature-like personas to life. Most notably, Rumi Ookubo's aloof, reserved tone for Tsumiki and Hitomi Nabatame's obnoxiously energetic and dramatic for Mayoi. ​As an offhand comment, I thought Acchi Kocchi and Lucky Star were set in the same universe years ago because of the similarities between Tsumiki and Konata's designs. 

Though not nearly much of a fanatic as Studio SHAFT, the show often uses vectors, arrows and the geometrical likes as indicative transitions to flashbacks and new scenes. Strangely enough, they somewhat contribute to the encompassing relaxation. The bubbly font stylization, the fat and bubbly shapes and occasional chibi character icons pop with subtle cuteness, even if they appear for a split couple seconds. More apparent, though, is the similarly bubbly color design. In scenes removed of scenic backgrounds, there's always bright, vivid colors behind the characters.  While not a decisive factor in discussion, I appreciate the care that went into the small details of production/direction.

School life and afterschool shenanigans laid on the table, no hidden hand of distinctness behind it; Acchi Kocchi is modest in its relaxation endeavors. Though distinction can be a virtue when done right, staying true and simple to the craft has always been one. ""Generic"" has been a term stigmatized to a degree, but seeing Acchi Kocchi execute and utilize settings, situations and a slapstick comedy style I've seen many times over in other shows has been a delight. Rewatching this show after nearly a decade, I can vouch for its timeless relaxing effect. The slice-of-life genre is bountiful with tranquil riches, Acchi Kocchi one of them. Take the time to not necessarily watch this show, but take a breather."
120209,"Second season of a show I never expected to get. Not at all, I am part of the group that really didn’t see much special or interesting in the first season. It was a pretty generic harem, expect this time it is a reverse harem. With a main character who is scatter-brained and silly, and along the way various comedic things occur. Honestly didn’t impress me in the end, so imagine my surprise when it got a sequel, and a movie now.

Now as for this second season, how does it do? In some aspects I do like it more than the first, but in others it doesn’t improve at all. It is a real mixed bag for me, and in the end I’ll end up giving it another average score. With an opinion of guess it is fine.

The harem has taken a backseat it seems like with this second season. Compared to the first season, many members of the cast barely got screen time and no real dedicated episode focusing on them. Instead it seemed like it wanted to focus more strongly on a few characters and grow them. With one aspect getting a decent amount of focus being the romance between Gerald and Katarina, if you can call the minor stuff we got actual progress. As with any harem show, you can’t have actual progress occur because that would ruin somebodies favorite ship. Instead you get hints of progress that get instantly disrupted and stopped before any more can happen. But once you realize it, you loose interest in that plot point completely. If nothing is ever going to happen, why bother getting invested?

The story of this season followed the first in a very similar way. Lots of small stories that are rather disconnected from each other. Events that don’t really have much of an impact on the characters or larger story progression. And than it all suddenly happens in a couple episodes. All the major story progression and character progress just happens, with no build up over the season or hints that it would happen. You suddenly get progress with Gerald’s romance and Keith’s attraction to his step-sister and Katarina’s ability to just stumble into objects and events that progress the plot. Side characters and members of the harem show up to play their role than fade away again. Expect, none of it feels well planned or crafted. In one way I am glad the movie is happening, cause it should solve this issue since you can’t spend the majority of a movie on completely irrelevant events. They will be forced to dedicate the entire thing to progressing the major story.

In general, my thoughts are largely the same as the first season. If you want some minor comedy show to pass the time, go ahead and watch. But don’t come into it expecting progress and developments that feel important. Instead you will find silly stories that feel more like filler than actual episodes focused on something."
5530,"I really hate the end of this anime. I have so many questions and it kind of feels like te last two episodes didn't fit the flow of the storyline. ""Is this it?"" was the first question that came to me as it finished. It was kind of rushed.
The story kind of grabbed me around episode 6 and I really wanted to find out if Alice and Oz would find the thruth, so it was disappointing to me that it was kind of an open ending which was basically screaming for a sequel.

I love the story of Alice in Wonderland and at first, that's why I started watching this anime. I like that a lot of characters from the book like the Mad Hatter were incorporated into the storyline of this anime. But I also feel like they could have done more with the storyline.

I think I might have to read the manga, seeing that that is also finished publishing. But I have no idea if it will continue after the story of anime.

Synopsis of the anime:
To young Oz Vessalius, heir to the Vessalius Duke House, the perilous world called the Abyss is nothing more than a folktale used to scare misbehaving children. However, when Oz's coming-of-age ceremony is interrupted by the malicious Baskerville Clan intent on banishing him into the depths of the Abyss, the Vessalius heir realizes that his peaceful life of luxury is at its end. Now, he must confront the world of the Abyss and its dwellers, the monstrous ""Chains,"" which are both not quite as fake as he once believed.

Based on the supernatural fantasy manga of the same name, Pandora Hearts tells the story of fifteen-year-old Oz's journey to discover the meaning behind the strange events that have overtaken his life. Assisted by a mysterious Chain named Alice, whose nickname is ""Bloodstained Black Rabbit,"" and members of a clandestine organization known as ""Pandora,"" Oz begins to realize his existence may have more meaning than he could have ever imagined."
1691,"If you're trying to watch this show for a deep plot or complicated story, you will be disappointed. I came to watch a tsundere show and what I got was many times better. Kazuma and Ayuno's relationship is hilarious and an endless source of entertainment where yeah, the tsundere trope is played to death but still I just enjoy seeing Ayuno get trolled by Kazuma in various ways every episode. 

It's a nice breath of fresh air from the usual of the main character bending over backward for the tsundere and putting up with her antics. Kazuma actually refuting Ayuno and fighting back makes the situation much less cringey than most other tsundere shows. It's just nice seeing a mc who can stand on his two feet and snap back at the tsundere being many steps ahead of her which isn't usually hard due to her dumbness.

Kazuma as a sort of anti-hero, guy with a rugged history and morally questionable but still follows his own moral code is a little cliched. Though, I would take his character any day over the guy who is full simp and just takes beatings from the tsundere with no repercussions. 

There isn't too much of love triangle crap that you usually see, where the audience and really the whole show knows that Kazuma and Ayuno are going to end up together. The way it's used to instead make Ayuno angry is pretty funny to watch. Also it's good to see the main couple is the main couple, no harem or multiple relationships or whatever. It's just wholesome teasing and a tsundere. The side characters do alright in promoting the main couple, and they do their job of keeping interest in the main love story. It's good to skip the ""will they won't they"" stuff that you also often see to build fake suspense. 

It honestly feels like good progress is made with the relationship with most arcs, and that they do have chemistry and a fun character dynamic.  It really is the relationship the two have that make the show worth watching and entertaining where watching their moments is entertainment.

The plot and magic system aren't really anything too original or anything to get obsessed over. The main villains are mostly there to question Kazuma's past as we the audience piece it together. The overall message of getting over the past and fighting for the present works although it is a little overdone with most battle shounen. 

I wouldn't go out and say that the show is a masterpiece or that the romance is anything revolutionary, but what works works. It's a fun watch, would definitely watch it again. It's one of those shows where the fillers are just as if not more entertaining than the main plot. I couldn't really care less about where the story goes as long as I know Kazuma is still messing with Ayuno."
21688,"some spoilers for Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito

Literature is an interesting, often captivating medium, filled with immaculate descriptions, and exciting worlds to explore with your imagination as you read the carefully thought out words of an author who built that portal for your mind. Some may say that with the advent of animation and film becoming truly mainstream, that literature has become someone of an under-appreciated medium.

The Mahoutsukai no Yome OVA, above all else, is a tragic yet pleasant reminder of the power of a story, especially the power it has on a child. Falling just shy of true greatness, it manages to still achieve dramatic tension and absolute pleasantry, seeping into captivation. It's a major appeal of literature, especially for a child, in which this OVA captures greatly. 

As you know, this OVA is a prologue about the childhood of Chise, and it's a pretty tragic one, showing pretty well how Chise became the more reserved and quiet girl we knew today. She’s a decently strong protagonist facing a ton of childhood hardship due to what she sees and the isolation and scorn that comes of it, and it's tough to see her become so melancholy to the point where it seems like she may snap into tears at any moment, which she only does when something happy occurs in her life. Unfortunately, it doesn't show how she came into her current residence or how she began the study of magic, and given that this is a world in which magic still exists despite many people living without seeing magic or magical creatures, we never actually see any magic. Regardless, it's still a decently bittersweet tale, especially when Chise meets Riichi, a decent character/man who still struggles with guilt and anxiety over his promise and always wants the door closed to keep certain dark creatures away. You can tell how this ends.

None of the other characters get a chance to really shine thanks to the time limitations of this OVA, but for what they were, they were decently pleasant additions (especially the ever-wise Elias and Silky, who keeps an annoyed state when her food is neglected), though as you’ll see soon, I find the best partly these characters to be the lovely character designs. Still, Chise carries this narrative on her unfortunate shoulders, as we see things from her perspective given that she narrates the bulk of the story to the cast. Yet we see some things from when she is asleep at some points, which is odd. I do have a few other minor gripes. Riichi saying his last words after being bitten borderline in half wrings hollow in this scene due to the fact that it’s insanely convenient. I heard someone say that this means he died a long time ago given the current age of the person he made a promise to, so his spirit was trapped in the library. However things are so unclear that he may as well have just gained immortality (the kind that can be revoked by being killed), and given that he interacts with the physical realm still, that seems more plausible, if still unclear. Also, how come Riichi’s and Chise’s eyes grow red when reading? If it's meant to be conveyed that they're emotionally unstable, not only was that already cleared up beforehand, but it is in and of itself a bit hamfisted, especially thanks to that. If no, we don't know why. There are a few other minor ones but I forgot them, so meh.

Again, let me make it clear that none of these are major gripes but they do add up and prevent this story from truly reaching the greatness it could've had. It's still an emotionally resonant narrative with a nice protagonist and an ability to captivate us, so don't try to make it out to be that I find the story bad, but even with the very limited time it had, it could've done more. I can definitely forgive a few things thanks to this insanely limited run and the fact that it is ultimately a prologue. So, what else made the narrative captivating other than the protagonist and emotional resonance? Well, that should be quite obvious, dear viewers…

WIT Studio was the main team in charge of this production and it looks really nice. The character designs are fantastic, with special mention going to the designs of Elias, Angelica, and Chise. The visuals are certainly captivating not due to the admittedly solid animation or the CGI furniture that only looks ok, but for the designs of everything from the creatures to the characters. The water fairies, in particular, are wonderful designs and again the actual character designs adapted by Hitotaka Hatou and done by Kore Yamazaki look lovely as well. The environments are also very pleasant to look at, especially in the scene where Riichi reads the picture book Chise treasures and we see all sorts of stars and galaxies in the sky. This, above all else really drew me in when watching, making an already sort of nice viewing experience that much better.

The background OST is a pretty nice one that has decently pleasant, sometimes softly melancholic music, all of which fit rather well with the scenarios at hand, even if none of them are inherently standout tracks. There is also no OP theme, which felt weird, but the ED theme, “CLOCKWORK QUICK AND LIGHTNING SLOW"" by Julia Shortreed, fits this exact same description as the rest of the tracks, so it's not very memorable, but it's decently melancholic. 

Like a good book, this anime drew me in. While it regrettably falls short from true greatness, even taking its inherent nature into account, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable anime to watch. As per its role, it made me eagerly anticipate the main body title that would follow this work. For doing it so gracefully, I commend this short series."
21410,"I was first introduced to the series in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7x64u9/whatsyourfavoriteanimetropethatyoullnever/du5sagf/) thread, where /u/Shimmering-Sky mentioned loving battle couples. It was one of those tropes that I hadn't really realized I was fond of, but after finishing Alderamin, I'm certain that it's something I want to see more of. The main characters, Ikta and Yatori, work very well together in the ways that they play off of one another. One has brains, the other brawn, and their communication - verbal or otherwise - is impressive and endearing in a lot of ways.

The story involves the main character, Ikta Solork, ending up in the military after saving the Empire's princess, despite never having wanted to be a soldier due to his distaste for war. Alderamin is a military drama, for the most part, with underlying themes that cover ideas such as the senselessness of war and the importance of individuals rather than a nation.

The animation is nothing special, and the fights are short. It doesn't look impressive, but it doesn't look bad, either. The main focus of the action - and, by extension, the story - is Ikta's notable skill as a strategist. For anyone who likes smart, competent characters, I'd definitely say that Alderamin is a good choice. Ikta is lazy, a product of circumstance moreso than upbringing. However, this doesn't prevent him from acting when he needs to, and he's a character who places priority on the victory with the least amount of casualties rather than the most sound or crushing wins.

There's definitely a sense of fascination and curiosity that kicks in whenever the characters find themselves in a pinch. Watching as Ikta plans out his strategies is fun, and the series also likes to tell you that he has one without detailing it so that you can then watch it play out. The unwavering trust that Yatori has in Ikta and his methods of thinking is definitely one of the strong points of the series, with their interactions being definite highlights.

If I had to point out one thing in particular that I found bothersome, it's that in order to allow Ikta to shine, we have to suffer through numerous more rash or incompetent people who outrank him. While there may be characters who seem to be smarter and disagree with those incompetents, they, too, are outranked, but orders are orders and they must respect them. A lot of the drama, specifically towards the end of the series, is a result of this. On one hand, it's great to see Ikta and his squad in action, but on the other, you can't really help the feeling of ""if these people were a bit smarter in the first place, this situation never would have happened.""

One thing that I enjoyed outside of the premise is the way they portray some of Ikta's other traits. He's a womanizer, and he's seen often flirting with women, even having one encounter where he meets someone whose mom he'd slept with. However, he's not perverted in that sense; the anime doesn't resort to any of the standard pervert tropes. Ikta is never seen groping a woman, and his conversations are more flirtatious and suggestive in nature rather than just plain outrageous. While not necessarily unheard of, it is refreshing, especially considering that this is a light novel adaptation and that, in a lot of ways, it's one of the more guilty mediums of doing so. 

I'd definitely recommend Alderamin on the Sky to people who like military dramas, battle couples or main characters who outwit rather than overpower their foes. While I can't say that there's anything exceptional or outstanding about the series, I can definitely say that there's something worth enjoying here."
106319,"Bonjour à tous
On se retrouve aujourd'hui pour faire le point sur cette anime : Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou!.

img()

Pour commencer, Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou! est un isekai qui nous raconte pour la nième fois, l'histoire d'une personne qui est morte dans le monde réel et qui se fait réincarner dans un monde qui ressemble à de la magic fantasy, avec de la magie et tout le bordel.
Sur le fond de l'histoire, ça va, mais je pense que le genre commence à être vu est revu, mais bref passons.
Ce que je trouve dommage, c'est que l'on n'a pas l'impression de regarder un anime de maintenant et que pour ma part, j'ai pensé que c'étais une remasterisation d'une vielle série, mais non, c'est bien un anime produit en 2020. Déjà, pour moi, les graphismes font un peu vieillot, mais bon, passons encore sur les goûts et les couleurs.
Ce que je n'aime pas, c'est le manque de profondeur. Je trouve que tous les personnages à part Wendelin sont sous l'exploité. On connaît à peine leur passé et c'est à peine si on s'attarde sur eux. Pour moi, je l'ai pris, juste comme des compagnons random que l'on a collé au personnage principal pour qu'il puisse avoir un groupe et recollé à ""l'aventure"" dans un monde de fantasy.
Ce que je n'aime pas non plus, c'est que, pour ma part, je n'ai pas vu une réelle évolution dans les capacités des différents personnages malgré les entraînements qu'ils subissent. Je trouve que c'est dommage que l'on ne voit pas leurs accomplissements.
De plus, c'est à peine, si on utilise le fait que le personnage principal soit une personne réincarnée pour mettre du piment dans l'histoire.
Il y a aussi que plus l'on avance dans l'anime, plus le groupe de ""compagnon"" qui accompagne Wendelin sont de plus de plus de jeune fille donc l'anime dévie de plus en plus dans le harem ce que je n'aime pas trop.

Conclusion :

Hachi-nan tte, Sore wa Nai deshou! est un anime, selon moi, qui est assez décevant. Je m'attendais à un anime du genre isekai avec de la réincarnation, ce que j'ai eu, mais je l'ai trouvé assez mal utilisé. C'est à peine si le fait de venir d'un autre monde lui apporte un plus dans son périple. C'est pareil, je m'attendais à des combats assez épiques. Et ba, pour tous vous dire, je n'en rappel d'aucun combat de cet anime, c'est pour vous dire à quel point ils sont marquants.
Je ne vous le conseille que si vous avez du temps et que vous aimez vraiment les isekai avec de la réincarnation.

100185,"I don't even know why I watched this, you can't keep up with ANYTHING. Random characters keep appearing out of nowhere and you have no idea who are they, angels? gods? people fighting among each other? I really liked the previous seasons I don't know if it was because I was dumb enough to like anything or because it was better, and after watching this I don't even feel like re-watching the old ones anymore. What a wreck.

Art: 7/10
Gotta admit it's okay, J.C never fails to impress. The characters looked memorable and the abilities graphics looked nice, sadly it's nowhere near as good as Railgun combat animations but it's better than previous Index seasons I guess. Despite everything, this is one of J.C's strengths in my opinion.

Story: 3/10
Nothing makes sense. I think you have to watch the visual novel to understand anything but that is no excuse for this poor writing. An anime series needs to stand up on its own otherwise just make it a TV Short or a teaser to that novel. No matter if the story is good or not I think it's poorly executed.

Sounds: 7/10
Fine I guess, isn't exactly anything to write home about, and I didn't notice any amazing OST either, might have been cause I generally didn't like the series so don't quote me on that. The ending song was okay though.

Characters: 3/10
There was absolutely no character development at all. If you watch the characters on their first appearance and at the end of the anime they all act and think the same. Except the ""bad guy"" as usual cause godmode Kamijo Toma punched sense into him.
I wish Misaka showed more action she literally did absolutely nothing, she is supposed to be #3 esper for god's sake. The whole anime doesn't need to revolve around her like Railgun series but come on, the little Misaka had more camera time than the original one.

Enjoyment: 2/10
Watching this anime is painful. It's so painful that every episode I thought about dropping it.
I gave this one point cause it made me smile every now and then at the absurdity of everything that was happening, I'm glad I had friends to talk to so we could mock this writing and it brought us something to talk about.
The second point was for nostalgia, it brought back some good days around the time I started watching anime, good old days.

Overall this is not worth watching, save your time if you're thinking about picking it up."

Boogiepop and Others (2019), is [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE)'s second attempt at the adaptation of [Boogiepop light novel](https://anilist.co/manga/31315/Boogiepop/) series by [Kouhei Kadono](https://anilist.co/staff/97933/Kouhei-Kadono). While to some it might be awful or flawed, too others such as myself it was quite excellent.



The story is told through the perspective of several characters, which helps provide context to the story arc/event happening around them, then out pop Boogiepop or as she says ""I am automatic"".  As for the story possessing any mature, depressing or dark kind of atmosphere, I felt nothing of that what so ever but it had something that pulls you in. The screenplay and dialogues doesn't get bog down by unnecessary exposition and speech, it strikes the right balance between dialogue & action. This story does however suffer from poor pacing which is why it is so disliked.



While [Boogiepop](https://anilist.co/character/2598/Boogiepop) and [Nagi Kirima](https://anilist.co/character/2608/Nagi-Kirima) are memorable, particularly their backstories, the other characters just fade away, they have nothing for you to really like about them or remember them by, which is why a lot of people get confused as to who these characters are. (Similar faces doesn't help either)




Every single one of the audio effects were quite good, I really like the O.S.T done by [Kensuke Ushio](https://anilist.co/staff/119254/Kensuke-Ushio), as It helped convey the scenes well, I will only dock half a point for it's repetitive nature. The opening by [MYTH & ROID](https://anilist.co/staff/119976/MYTH--ROID) is amazing as always they never seem to disappoint.




The updated visuals look great but the production team would often cut corners by having faceless people in the background and characters with similar faces & hairstyles which I found quite distracting. The animation was great especially in the fight scenes which were fluid and well choreographed. 
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwCEKEEB0)



While it was airing I continuously put off watching this series because I have the attention span of a fly and considering that this was a mystery & psychological anime, I knew I wouldn't return to it or would end up hating it because I thought it would dragging on and on with countless amounts of dialogue. 
What ended up being a great idea was to watch it 3 episodes at a time and I couldn't get enough and ended up watching the 4th episode and being completely confused because I didn't know that every 3 to 4 episodes was a story arc in it's own.

I picked this anime up on a whim during Fall 2020 seasonals hunting. My first impression towards this anime was something about average - the genre was sort of one I would be interested in, the artwork (again, off first impressions) was not my type, and this anime alongside seasonals such as Tonikaku Kawaii and Wandering Witch didn't seem like an anime worth pursuing. 
Nevertheless, this show ended up being a joy to watch, due to it knowing exactly what direction it wants to go in and creating a wonderful experience.

Character Development and Likeability: 25/25
Characters are very well done. The character chemistry is excellent, plenty of time is given into how the characters make decisions and interact with each other, and everything is done very well in order to deliver us a very lighthearted comedy. Indeed, the core foundation for the comedy is mainly based off the characters' interactions with Princess Syalis, and what ends up as a result of their very well-meaning intents is episode upon episode of heartwarming and enjoyable comedy. Full credit for the character composition and personality pool being very compatible to pull this off - and extra credit if I could for the teddy demons, they're so cute!

Plot Development: 15/25
The plot is very straightforward - the princess gotta sleep. While the episodes offer the high quality fluffy comedy, I personally found the beginning episodes a little repetitive and dryly formulaic. Additionally, the comedy through extremely fortunate circumstances for the princess in the beginning episodes grew less enjoyable over time. However, the plot is not confusing in any way - the setting is very much straightforward, yet lacking a distinct variety of storytelling techniques.  

Artwork: 10/15
I personally was not a big fan of Princess Syalis's disproportionately big eyes, and I was frankly shocked upon learning that she was an adult towards the end of the anime. The rest of the artwork and animation, to a relatively new anime watcher such as myself, was a pleasure to enjoy.
Emotions were stylistically depicted well in the anime.

Music: 12/15
Background songs fit the mood of the anime very nicely. The OP and ED were a joy to listen to, and I did not skip them at all. In fact, I must remind myself to listen to ORESAMA's works more; she has a very enjoyable voice.

Emotion: 15/15
Nothing extra to say here. The anime walked in confidently proclaiming itself as a mainly comedic anime and handled it masterfully. There was not a single episode where I did not chuckle a little bit due to the characters' interpersonal chemistry.

Dialogue: 2/5
This anime, in comparison with the others I've watched, had some fundamentally basic dialogue structure. It was no lyrical masterpiece like that in Bunny Girl Senpai, nor was it absolute garbage such as that in Looking Up At The Half Moon. However, the word choices were generally repetitive and genuine misunderstandings due to faulty communication are plenty. 

Please do not go into this anime taking it seriously. This is strictly a comedy show that serves to warm your heart up with these well-intentioned and fitting characters, yet has ended up being one of the shows I have laughed at most in 2020. If you are looking for intelligent comedy, or something more emotional, I would not recommend this show. If you are a fan of lighthearted comedy, I absolutely recommend this show."
100010,"...Can we just skip this one? No? Are you sure? I'm pretty sure we can skip this one and it'll be fine. Really???

Mahou Shoujo Site is an adaptation of the [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/85666/Magical-Girl-Site/) by [Kentaro Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/113199/Kentaro-Satou). Which is apparently a spin-off of [Magical Girl Apocalypse](https://anilist.co/manga/70175/Magical-Girl-Apocalypse/) which I guess is magical girls + zombies? Didn't really ever think we needed a combination of magical girls and horror but here we are, I guess...
 
I just want to say right out of the gate I don't fucking see what people saw in this at all. And I'm not even talking about the people who liked it. I'm talking about the people who hated it and dropped it out of seemingly vehement disgust.
 
img440()
 
To me, it wasn't edgy enough. It wasn't gory enough, it wasn't bad enough, and it wasn't funny enough. It might partially be a result of the transition from manga into anime... like maybe there's some edgier stuff that was just toned the fuck down or something.
 
But yeah, episode one was the closest this series had me going. The over the top tragedy stuff with Asagiri was wonderful. When she was talking about like wanting to die, I kind of couldn't think of a rebuttal. Because of what we're shown of her life, it's basically a living nightmare.
 
img440()
 
She gets the shit kicked out of her and is tormented at school, then she comes home and gets the shit kicked out of her by her sadist brother, and her parents just completely do not give a single shit. Also, the cat? The fucking cute cuddly looking cat that looks like it doesn't even belong in this series?
 
img440()
 
""Yeah, there's no way that cat's gonna be found by the bullies and be gruesomely killed in some wa--oh, it already happened.""
 
For a glorious moment, I thought this was gonna be the series. Girls who have suffered horrible and terrible lives who are given magical girl powers and then just go on fuckin' RAMPAGES of viscera everywhere.
 
img440()
 
Instead no. Instead fucking no. Like that shit is immediately thrown out of the window once episode one is done. The show just immediately becomes finding out more about the site and magical girls entering a conflict between the entities that run the Mahou Shoujo Site. And...
 
...that was just supremely boring to me the entire way through. I just could not care less about it.
 
img440()
 
But the Tempest is gonna be an apocalyptic event and... I just did not give a single fuck. Like there's a point in the show where they describe like a way better version of this show, and that's like the idea that there's a contest of like winning your way to be guarantee your survival once the Tempest hits.
 
But the way to win the contest is you have to be like the magical girl who causes the most pain and suffering. Why couldn't that have been the show. Why couldn't that have been the fucking show.
 
img440()
 
Yet no, we gotta battle the Mahou Shoujo Site! Which... in addition to not caring much at all about, I'm not sure how I or anyone was expected to ever take seriously. Like I started laughing every single time they showed like the table with all of the site administrators around it. Wow, they look so spooky! I'm so scared!
 
img440()
 
These idiots are pissed off that the magical girls are using their powers against the site because they learned about the Tempest but how did they learn about the Tempest...? Oh, the way the site's programmed is if you click a certain part of a site administrator's body, that'll take you to another section of the site that is a literal countdown to this mysterious apocalyptic event that the site administrators seem very in favor of happening.
 
img440()
 
Maybe... maybe you should have... not had that be visible? On your site? That you run? You're the ones running the site so if you didn't want them to find out about that then WHY LET THEM BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT?
 
Really, apart from I guess episode one, the closest times I was ever entertained through this show was when Asagiri's brother was on the screen or talking.

That [voice actor](https://anilist.co/staff/95270/Nobuhiko-Okamoto) knew exactly what was he doing and was just being as over the top and insane sounding and annoying as he possibly could. When the brother just starts full on fucking with the magical girls in spite of whatever's currently happening with the site, I was honestly very entertained.
 
But good things of course have come to an end, and the show returns to the bland magical battles and talking about the site and I just... ugh.

Completely boring! I guess apart from Asagiri's brother, I kind of liked Asagiri's friend. Though I've forgotten her name at this point. But that's about all the things I can think of even praising. Like the edgy parts or the parts where some of the magical girls were acting insane were... fun? It's... it's still just not enough.

Maybe there'll be another magical girl and full on horror combination in the future that changes my mind (I doubt it), but I just don't think it works honestly. The spooky site administrators are just... they're just funny. I laughed or chuckled almost every single time they were on the screen and especially when they started battling with the magical girls. I would describe basically the entirety of this series as laughable.

When the most entertaining parts of your series is when you're trying to be as dark and ""feel bad"" as you possibly can, and the rest of your series is just occasional magical battles or just talking about a spooky mascot website that's gonna bring about the apocalypse (which of course sounds fun in concept but isn't in the execution)... eh. Just... eh.
 
A completely deserved 3 out of 10. I probably wouldn't recommend it. It's not good, and it's not funny enough to be ""good bad."" I guess when it comes down to it, all I'm saying is I really wish the entire series was about that brother character."
136707,"Since watching a pharmacist isekai comedy last year, I fell in love with the setting of being a pharmacist in another world. That's why when I watched ""Isekai Yakkyoku"" coming in Summer, it was a must-watch for me. Now, the artwork at first promises an SOL type of adventure with a few comedy doses here and there. But the series took the pharmacy setting too close and offered a believable MC with a sober past life and a significant focus on an ""Iyashikei"" style of telling the story.

What's the first thing this series does right? Tackling one of the most significant weak points of the average isekai and that is, offering a beefy story for the past life of the main character. Although it still sins on offering short moments for this telling. Our main character is an actual pharmacist enslaved to his job due to the guilt of losing his sister when he was young. This situation dictates most of the main character's actions in the new world and his motto of always doing his best to help others.



This theme of doing the best to help others is the main motive of the main character and his motto and how many conflicts in this series are solved. Ad while doing so, defeating some of the tropes of the isekai genre. Evil church? Nope, they can't be bad in front of the wholesomeness of the MC. And more... and that brings me to the beautiful storytelling.

Instead of simple SOL stories or comedy limited to raunchiness or ""jokes"" that cause boredom, like other isekais in this season, ""Isekai Yakkyoku"" tries the wholesome approach with heavy storylines of people having another chance or being moved by the MC actions to do more of what they would have done on their own. As the protagonist's goal is to have a Pharmacy share his knowledge in the new world and help people with fewer resources, he will meet new people and encounter a few enemies along the way, and this is how the series will introduce new characters who will be friends or foes along the way.



Some of these stories have potent effects on the viewer; episode 8 was the most powerful in that regard, with the story of the pharmacist who decided to sideline with Falma.



Now, those moments have a powerful ally in their delivery; the music and the tracks chosen were perfect to deliver the wholesome effect in each of them. Even the ending, which undoubtedly got a rushed villain and a rushed conclusion, had powerful wholesome moments in the end. Aside from other isekais, it offered a satisfying conclusion without setting any new season or any dormant villain around there. And that's another refreshing thing to see, a proper ending, no setups, just a stunning conclusion on the aftermath of the events of the last episodes.

All seiyuus did a terrific work. The opening and ending were beautiful, and what more can I say? It's a crime this series doesn't have ""Iyashikei"" as the most prominent tag. We need more series like these; more takes on the isekai genre far from the harem power fantasies, more stories like this and Ascendance of the Bookworm.

I'll rate this series as a 08/10. Series like this sell its source material pretty well, as I'm wondering if the light novel also has that lovely and wholesome feel as this anime adaptation.

Thank you for reading! ^^"
97617,"Restaurant to Another World is... bizarre. I mean after all, the execution of the anime is exactly as the title says; it's a restaurant to another world. It's a bit challenging to even call this an isekai in a traditional sense, but rather it takes the form of the blending and merging of worlds and cultures.

img()

For the unitiated, the series follows a restaurant which operates regularly in the modern/real world almost every day of the week. Though on the day of Satur (the 7th day of the week, Saturday), its doors open in all sorts of locations strewn about another world. It is clear that there is a force manipulating the restaurant in where these doors might appear, though the magic and power surrounding the restaurant won't be the focus of this review.

The series takes on an episodic format. Each episode the list of regulars at the restaurant expands as we continue to see the same faces enter on the 7th day of each week, each with their own signature meal that they order and feel adamantly is the best on the menu. Each with some reason why they feel so strongly about that meal. When a customer orders a meal, we learn about their life through what they say or through their trip to the restaurant. For a series in which the main characters almost never leave the restaurant, this series has some of the greatest world building I've seen in an anime within this genre.

I caught myself towards the end of these series having a moment to recognize that as this restaurant was sitting on my screen showcasing the banter between customers, I knew and had come to like every customer there. I knew their stories, I felt fondly of them. Though in a way that felt natural. Through the characters, you begin to understand the world. You understand their behavior and their interactions.

The series does a fantastic job at capitalizing on this in order to expand the world further and add some additional depth to our main chef and waitresses.

The light novels for this series release so infrequently compared to others, and are the author's only active project. While other light novel authors may have multiple ongoing light novel projects, write their novels in both webnovel and light novel formats at the same time, or enter into regularly serialized contracts for the frequency of releases, this doesn't appear to be the case here. At no discredit to the series that follow the aforementioned format, the time taken for what seems to be yearly releases for the light novels of Restaurant to Another World is noticeable. The care and attention given to each customer's story, the energy of the characters and how naturally they seem to blend into the world, and the overall atmosphere.

I'm not sure that there's much more than that to say about this anime, but I think that's a good thing. It's so simple in concept, so comforting to watch; yet also so much more heartwarming, special, and expansive than I could have imagined. We're not here to solve the problems of the fantasy world. We're just here to offer a warm meal to those that are."
152137,"Isekai Shikkaku (No longer allowed in another world)  

An interesting if controversial premise that like many isekai of this style fails to fully capitalize upon it. However, It happens to be a concept that personally appeals to me quite a bit and it doesn’t fall flat on its face like so many of its compatriots. It manages to at certain points tell a somewhat poignant story that it blends with dark comedy even if other times one portion overpowers the other leading to disaster. For this reason I am rating Isekai Shikkaku as a 7/10 on the anime scale. 

The comedy in this anime generally comes in a few forms, someone threatens sensei, sensei carries out an unexpected action, or one of the female characters is in love with him. I think it’s somewhat impossible to classify comedy as good or bad so I will just say my opinion on this and not factor it into my rating. I found the threat bits to generally get a light chuckle from me if they were integrated into the scene well, the unexpected actions ranged from an eyeroll to an actual laugh (rare for me!). The women in love with him bits were, as I think anyone who knows me would expect, completely uninteresting to me and I found them very annoying. 

Following from the comedy's use of women the show has a baffling mix of some of the best (low bar) handling of women's issues in an anime to aspects I find annoying and off putting. The first thing you would notice upon watching the show is the truly terrible female character designs. There’s no defense for this, I don’t know why they did it, it undercuts the show’s messaging a lot and is a real shame considering that I think many of the other designs are pretty okay-good. On the positive end the show frequently touches upon women's issues from ostracization, marriage inequality, and the negative impact of traditional female roles. Reading some of Dazais’ work it’s clear this is drawn from his interest in the lives of women which he writes about frequently, Schoolgirl and the setting sun touching upon similar topics as seen in the show. Regardless it’s good, anime should do this more!

To theorize a bit more on the designs it’s very possible they are derivative of the worst aspects of the show. It’s clinging to isekai tropes, the more it tries to commentate on these directly or interact with them the worse it gets for it. The show is at it’s absolute best with simple character interactions and observations of humanity in the style of Dazai’s bibliography and it’s lowest when discussing chosen ones and magic swords. This habit is probably the source of the over saccharin and strange plot points which occasionally pop up throughout the anime. One of the worst of these is the rapping character who appears about midway through and isn’t utilization besides to commentate on isekai powers. 

If you’ve made it this far I can now address the elephant in the room, the pretty big controversy over Isekai Shikkaku being made in the first place. The open question is it disrespectful to the memory of Osamu Dazai who himself died of suicide to create a character that is similar to him and draws from his literary works in this way. Reading through his works as I worked my way through the show I’m not so sure that the main character of Isekai Shikkaku “sensei” is intended to be Osamu Dazai himself. Dazai would frequently include gloomy suicidal or otherwise depressed writers through his works which while similar to him were in my opinion not supposed to be him, writers write what they know. If you accept this to be the case I think a possible intention of the writer may have just been to create a character in his style in which case I think that’s basically fine. The consumption of sedatives in harmful amounts being tied to a desire to not feel fully healthy is very similar to the activity of Naoji from setting sun for example.

Edit: A friend has pointed out that date at the start of the manga aligns with Dazai's suicide. This is pretty unfortunate and I still stand by what I said here about how the character is treated within the work. Maybe I'll return and write a bit more about what I think his personal thoughts on that would've been but that seems like a very fraught topic. Much of the discussion over his feelings about himself assume short story characters are self inserts which I strongly disagree with."
148048,"Kamikatsu was so outside of my expectations for an isekai that I just fell more in love with each episode despite such a strong start. An anime I didn't even consider watching until half the season was over, I couldn't have fallen harder or watched those first 7 episodes faster! Our cast is immaculate with 
-  Yukito being one of my favorite manipulative bastard protagonists I've ever seen(and his backstory fits the idea so well). 
-  Mitama always putting a smile on my face with her antics and it's clear that the production team really liked her as well.
-  Roy fitting the what I would call ""Zenitsu role"" yet unlike bad series he always get punished for being an absolute horrible annoying character.
- All the archons generally working really well in their roles and never feeling like they don't belong.
- Funni sisters and Rishu just being... the best honestly.

I also wanna praise the artstyle, the funny CGI was always putting a smile on my face because once you're in on the joke you realize, oh Mitama, this is one of the funniest and high energy anime comedies. The artstyle is what I'd probably consider ""begging for epileptic seizures"" a lot of the time but honestly that's my style I have no taste besides pretty colors. The cuts to pixel art are my favorite choices for directing an anime besides the way that Monogatari cuts away for gags. Some might say that the pixel art is so they can be ""lazy"" but I think Kamikatsu isn't afraid to perfectly use the tools at their disposal to make sure the visuals are never boring. Plus if you are dissing it only because it's pixel art I think you're just boring. 

The story and it's themes are put together so well that I don't think I could ever do better, and it's one of the reasons I want to experience more media. The story quickly goes down a path that you would never expect from a seasonal isekai and I can only give my highest praise for that. 

As well the ecchi in this series is something that caters to me very well. The degeneracy that this series gets up to is some of the most cracked I've seen in a non-eroge and was so fetishy that it reminds me of how great anime can be when it does something most other mediums refuse to. 

Voice acting in this series brought out the comedy to the insane level that it sits at, and the OP/ED are straight addicting, while also not really being what I usually expect from an anime. 

Personally I think this was one of the best anime to come out this year in an already stacked Spring 2023 season, and I'd recommend it to only my most degenerate anime fans, but it's definitely a big ask and I know they won't be as into it as I am, but please give KamiKatsu a shot!"
172019,"A nice start to the final season of Dr. Stone.

This cour was very very nice, it concluded on a very satisfying part which really makes you want to continue watching the next few parts; personally, since the first episode I found it to be quite fast, which did impact my understanding of the characters a little bit, as it felt like everything was going a bit fast and not leaving a lot of space for developing some of the characters shown for the first time in this season.

For the content in itself, I found it very fun to watch week-by-week, perhaps because this arc is well-written in the manga, but I think that they adapted it nicely in the anime, some of the flashbacks we got, on top of the new developments between the characters made it a blast to watch, especially compared to some of the older seasons, which dragged on for a little bit too long (such as the second part of season 3).

Now for some of the bad parts - sometimes they rushed over a lot of the things that were happening to get to a ""better"" part of the arc, this in itself would be fine, but I think they could've handled the earlier episodes a lot better in terms of showing how the characters felt about certain events ( !Like when they were crossing over the pacific and Ryusui was challenging Senku, I think they could've shown a lot more of the crew's overall reactions other than just Gen and Kohaku.!); also, sometimes the animation quality would drop, this isn't VEEERY noticeable except for a few episodes, but it did feel jarring sometimes. The second part of the anime also felt a little bit rushed in a way that it's ""in your face"" a lot, sometimes you're just watching and suddenly everything is high-stakes out of nowhere, but that can be excused because of how fast the pace was overall.

In the end, this season's shaping up to be very story-based, this doesn't mean that it won't have it's action moments (this is Dr. STONE, after all) but it feels like they're trying to wrap things up neatly and fill in a lot of the holes left in the story, as is the function of a final season, lol.

Compared to some of the past seasons, I enjoyed this one a lot more than the last one, it felt written way better, had way more action parts, the character interactions were fun, the arc is engaging and really makes you want to keep watching, binging this season might become something I do in the future later.

To finalize - This season feels like the ""essence"" of Dr. STONE, it doesn't take itself TOO seriously, focuses on Senku's development while also giving the rest of the guys like Chrome and the others a chance to shine, which I found fun to see, aswell as being action packed to the brim with content. truly a 9.5/10 Season in my eyes."
21560,"We're never going to get a worthy Beserk adaptation. This is something that fans of the manga have just come to accept after God knows how many years of waiting. The 90's anime really wasn't all that bad, but it was a slideshow even for time period, and the Golden Age films were an unsettling mix of decent hand drawn art and horrid CG, not to mention they just retold the same story that we've seen adapted twice now. The Golden Age arc is effectively a prequel to the rest of the Berserk franchise, so have twenty years where nothing but that was adapted is incredibly frustrating, especially with a series that has as strong and beautiful a piece of source material as Berserk does.

Berserk (2016) takes the terrible CG from the Golden Age movies and makes it the main focus. There are smatterings of hand drawn art mixed in, but never enough to offset the CG and just enough to remind you what this new series could have been. We're finally pushing past the Golden Age arc into the core Berserk story, but the studio took a massive liberty with the source material and condensed about 400 panels into just five minutes of animation to accelerate the story to where Guts first encounters Farnes and her group of knights. This is the ""Black Swordsman"" arc, which serves to introduce us to the broken and desperate post-Eclipse Guts, and like I said above, is cut to about 5% of its original content. From this point, more large changes from the source come at a rapid pace. The entirety of the ""Lost Children"" arc, one of the most emotionally powerful arcs from the manga, is completely cut, with the story accelerating to Guts being captured at Farnes' camp. There is also an anime original (but Miura directed) episode that fills that gap between the camp and the beginning of the ""Conviction"" arc, that is decent and introduces us to just how damaged Farnes really is, but is still tragically low quality compared to the source.

It's at this little-less-than-halfway point that the adaptation really starts to step it up and make you mad at what you're given. The ""Conviction"" arc is more or less extremely well adapted, as in true to the source, in its entirety; it's just adapted into complete garbage. Aesthetically, Berserk (2016) is about as bottom of the barrel as it gets for the CG portions. CG movement is jerky and unnatural, models ""pop"" jarringly out of the average backgrounds, and the texturing is incredibly low-fidelity. They try to emulate Miura's hashing-based shading by slapping a half-assed version of the effect on top of the 3D models, and it does nothing but look incredibly stupid. The small amount of 2D, hand drawn art is actually decent but nowhere near the quality that Berserk deserves. The sound design is also particularly terrible, which is a shame because the VA and music are both actually pretty alright.

Everything about Berserk (2016) is just a massive letdown, and is even moreso considering the studio seems to really wants to adapt the source into animation faithfully (outside the strangely accelerated start) but obviously does not have the budget or talent to do so. I'm not sure what has to be done for Berserk to get the high quality anime adaptation that it deserves, but I'm convinced that it must be fucking impossible.

Go read the manga, don't waste your time with this."

Enter The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses, a show whose trailer quickly became the recurring conversation in the leadup to the Summer 2023 anime season. Even before a single episode had aired, everyone seemed to map a feeling onto it. “It looks like garbage,” one would say. “It looks awesome,” another would chime. “It looks like awesome garbage,” shouted a third person. The truth is that all three are correct, because studio GoHands managed to create a show that would be impossible to disappoint, providing an endless stream of frustration for its detractors who saw it as nothing but drudge, comfort food for those who wanted something free and easy with its romantic comedy, and hilarity for those who wanted to see the “most extra” presentation for shockingly mundane material.

On the surface, it reads as a kind of [cinemanarrative dissonance]( https://en.everybodywiki.com/Cinemanarrativedissonance) – the mundane story of the text does not match the insane story of the visuals. In a film textbook, this might be framed as a death sentence; for The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses, it is the essential ingredient to fueling most reactions towards it, positive or negative. There is absolutely no reason why Mie’s hair should flap around like it has a life of its own when the window isn’t open, or the sound to go insane when she says something that makes Komura’s heart almost explode, especially when a situation just doesn’t call for it. Perhaps it could be said that the visual styling for The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses is to somehow recreate the way in which Komura sees the world. His thoughts concerning Mie almost cause his brain to short-circuit in real-time, and we become privy to his wigging out by gazing into the abyss of weird body proportions, camera angles, and aggressive effects. It is as though his mind constructs reality like the mirrors in a funhouse. That might be amusing for an attempt to find compositional harmony within this series, especially when confounded by questions that seem tailor-made to address something amiss in cinematography.

webm(https://imgur.com/KOveXA2.mp4)

But buried underneath an endeavor like that is something far more cosmically eye-rolling, the question of “why is this like this” – of all the pieces of media GoHands could have given this treatment to, they gave it to something this plain!? Even Hand Shakers, perhaps GoHands’s most-infamous and well-known property, could offer the excuse of being a battle fantasy. It seems almost like a joke, but one that insists on treating it like a serious artistic decision, all the while you can’t escape the sense that it’s constantly winking at you to let you know that it’s aware it’s trying way too hard, and still occasionally failing outright.

Point being, The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses is a showcase of GoHands putting in not 100%, but a very particular kind of 100% that offers an endless supply of what-the-fuckery for those who see it that way. When American film critic Pauline Kael wrote in Harper’s Magazine in [1969](https://web.archive.org/web/20170719153532/http://www.paulrossen.com/paulinekael/trashartandthemovies.html), “…movies are so rarely great art that, if we cannot appreciate great trash, we have very little reason to be interested in them,” she could only dream of a show like this.

English Version:

Sasaki & Miyano is a faithful adaptation of the manga with the same name created by Shou Harusono. Studio DEEN through the colors it uses, the combination of music, animation and special effects manages to convey the innocence and sweetness of the original story.

The romance between the protagonists of this series is cute and light, with the passing of the episodes, it blossoms little by little. Being a romance and Slice of life anime, there are no exaggerated or unnecessary dramas that complicate the situation of the characters. We only see how normally in reality this situation could unfold.

The idea of this anime is to be light, where you can enjoy and forget for a while the tasks that you have to do that day. Its comedy isn't too marked or exaggerated, it's more focused on the audience being able to relax and have a laugh.

This might be one of the more innocent adapted Boy Loves anime. Sasaki & Miyano bring something good and new to this genre, it shows in a slightly romanticized way the ""reality"" of one of the characters that is a Fundashi. It also helps to break stereotypes of the LGBTQ+ community and people who are fans of manga, especially BL.



Moreover, a bit of the daily lives of both Miyano and Sasaki can be seen, where we see their relationships with their different friends and how respect, support, emotional responsibility and commitment are represented in different aspects, both romantically and in friendships. Although it may take a bit of a slow pace, you can see the growth of the characters through the 12 chapters.

Regarding the animation, it is not a masterpiece, but DEEN knew how to use its resources and achieved a combination with colors, effects and animation that harmoniously gives more strength to the innocent and adorable concept that can be detailed in all the Series. The spectator can appreciate through the effects the love, affection and warmth; because these had a very good representation.

Sasaki & Miyano is one of the gems of this season where the viewer can feel the love of these two students through the screen. A short, light and full of love anime which will make the audience feel calm, enjoy and relax for 30 minutes of their daily life.

La idea de este anime es que sea ligero, donde se pueda disfrutar y olvidar un rato los deberes que se tienen que hacer en el día. Su comedia no es muy marcada o exagerada, está más enfocado en que la audiencia pueda relajarse y reírse un rato.

Este podría ser uno de los Boy Loves adaptados más inocentes. Sasaki & Miyano traen algo bueno y nuevo a este género, muestra de una manera un poco romantizada la “realidad” de uno de los personajes que es Fundashi. Asimismo, ayuda a romper estereotipos con la comunidad LGBTQ+ y las personas que son fan de los mangas, sobre todo de BL.

Además, se puede apreciar un poco de las vidas diarias tanto de Miyano como de Sasaki, donde vemos sus relaciones con sus diferentes amigos y se representa el respeto, el apoyo, la responsabilidad emocional y el compromiso en diferentes aspectos, tanto románticos como en las amistades. Aunque puede que tome un ritmo un poco lento, se puede ver el crecimiento de los personajes a través de los 12 capítulos.

Con respecto a la animación, no es una obra maestra, pero DEEN supo usar sus recursos y logro una combinación con los colores, los efectos y la animación que de forma armoniosa le da más fuerza al concepto inocente y adorable que se puede detallar en toda la serie. El espectador puede apreciar a través de los efectos el amor, cariño y calidez; debido a que estos tuvieron una muy buena representación.

Sasaki & Miyano es una de las gemas de esta temporada donde el espectador puede sentir el amor de estos dos estudiantes a través de la ventana. Un anime corto, ligero y lleno de amor el cual hará que la audiencia pueda sentirse calmada, disfrutar y poder relajarse por 30 minutos de su vida diaria."
108307,"It's about time I'm dedicating myself to write a review on anilist, about a series that belongs to my favorite anime franchise Psycho-Pass.

During the last two weeks I rewatched the third season of it, and completed it with the anime movie ""PSYCHO-PASS 3: FIRST INSPECTOR"", which I'll integrate in my assessment and rating of the overall season and this review, regarding the fact that it basically represents the final episodes of it. 

I first saw season three around two and a half years ago and before my recent rewatch I remembered that I was unsatisfied with it and my overall critical view on different aspects. May it depended on changed and blurred memories, or was it through the movie First Inspector, that rounded and completed the open-end of the season, in either case I finished this particular season three, with a much more positive feeling and an impression of it as a considerable improvement on season two. How I come to this conclusion and to describe what are in my opinion the elements I consider the weak points as well as the strengths of the show, are aspects I'll tackle in this review.


One of those strengths, is something I want to mention before, because it will appear several times in the review, and this is my classification of season three as an excellent done sequel. I will elaborate this point especially under the category ""characters"". 




A few years after the events in season two, a duo of two good old friends, in the person of Arata Shindou and Kei Mikhail Ignatov, joins the the Division 01 of the CID of the Public Safety Bureau as inspectors. During their first case and operation, they see themself confronted what seems at the surface like an ordinary accident, but soon they discover that there is more behind of it. In a new environment, they have to adapt and learn how to shoulder responsibility. Luckily, the childhood friends can rely on the other and they can share many burdens, but the extend of the criminal actions will put even their friendship to the test. 

img500()


Already with the plot, the third season of Psycho-Pass orientates itself on various main elements of the franchise, that are also unmistakable pillars of the plot in season one. Again a weakness of the Sybil System is exploited by the inviduals who serve as the antagonists of season three. 

!In this case it is Byfrost, a system itself that once was used as a Bug- and Erroridentification program for the Sybil System in its early days. In this system, that has a hierarchic structure, the congressmen at the top, gamble and play about events in the society, that they themself initally orchestrated through a gap in the system, and make prognosis about the developments of the events.!

Similar to season one, Division 01 of the CID must solve individual crime cases that are connected together with a shared origin.

One aspect that bothered me concerning the plot was, that in my opinion the third case was too convoluted, there were too many twists and turns and with the large count of characters and the additional acting characters in the background, it was difficult to keep the track and overview of the story. The pacing of the events was enormously stretched, which extracted the dramatic and tension of the anime at this point. 

What I prefered in contrary was the wide range of topics that where brought up through the individual cases from a financial scandal and corruption, over elections in the society of sybil to the debate about a district for immigrants.

Probably the best aspect about the plot in season three was the final, that is shown in Psycho Pass 3 FIRST INSPECTOR. The plot is is brought to a logical and satisfying ending, moreover it offered an outlook into the future of Psycho-Pass and introduced aspects that will probably play a role in further series. It completed storylines of individual characters and, in return, represented as well new beginnings, in the form of the resumption of storylines of other characters.


The Worldbuilding was mostly not extended in season three of Psycho-Pass. Though there was one point that was occasionally thematized in this season, which were the Slums and abandoned districts as the central location in the story. The anime took its time to explain their existence, the daily-life of its habitants and its functions in a japan that is ruled by sybil.
!
It's roles as a sealed off and segregated room of social exclusion. To seperate the ""good"" and ""bad"" persons in the society and by that using those abandoned districts as anarchistic prisons, to shield of their side of it.!

img450()


Likewise to other Psycho-Pass productions, it were the characters that stood out for me particularly and they represent the aspect I prefered the most about this season. I always characterized it as a particular strength of Psycho-Pass to have a comprehensive examination of the characters, by giving them enough screen time, space to develop and appear, as well as to grant them extensive interactions between the each other and through that create unique dynamics  and a good group atmosphere. Especially thanks to the deep-going evaluation fo the characters, one can identify, sympathize and relate to the different characters.



In season three we have an almost entirely new and changed constellation in division 01 of the CID.

Starting with the main characters Arata Shindou and Kei Mikhail Ignatov. Both have possibly from the start the best chemistry of all Psycho Pass duos of protagonists. 

img500()

They are well balanced and complement each other good in terms of their characteristics and other points. They embody contrary traits on different fields. Arata is the cheerful, carefree and philanthropic part from both of them, while Ignatov is more reserved and distanced in his behaviour. What they share is their distinct sense of justice and the believe of humans as the last instance to decide what they judge as right or wrong and to take responsibility for that decision. 

!

In terms of Arata Shindou there were smaller issues that bothered me a bit, first are his too obvious and strong similarities and shared characteristics with Akane Tsunemori. His bonding with enforcers, having a critical view on sybil and an individual view on justice in this society as well as having a Criminally Asymptomatic Constitution. That is simply too much to speak of a simple imitation.  Furthemore his ability of mental tracing in addition with an extraordinary physically condition, were something I felt as overexaggerating.!


Tenma Todoroki

The enforcer is on the outside a slightly different version of Tomomi Masaoka. What differs the two is their personal background and their characteristics. Todoroki is the son of a well-endowed and influential family and suffers from the fate of abandonment after the didn't turn out as they expected him to be. He also has a strong sense for justice, which he wouldn't admit publically and his inner passion for being a cop isn't as strong as the one Masaoka had. Apart from that he has a laid back character and the habit to come to the wrong conclusion because he instantly shouts the first thing that comes to his mind.

Kazumich Irie and Mao Kisaragi

The character of the enforcer Kazumichi Irie was probably my favorite addition in the series. Not only his character is extraordinary funny, but his personal packground it what mainly makes him interesting. With his socialisation and origin, as someone who who grew up in the slums, far away from the stabil society of Sybil he brings up an interesting perspective to the show and world of Psycho-Pass. Through his experiences and road of life, he portrays and offers a different view on Sybil and the shadow sides of the system.

Unfortunately Mao Kisaragi, was from the cast of characters the one that remained bland and superficial for most of the time. Near the end we discover more about her and her backstory but that wasn't enough, that she could leave a lasting impression on me.

Now I'll get to the previous mentioned point why I regard it as a brilliant sequel.

This has to do with the treatment of old, beloved and seasoned characters and their implemention in the story.  In comparison to new characters, there are around as equally characters in the story from seasons before, who already went through experiences and developments, and are treasured and respected by the fans. 

What now sets a good sequel apart from a bad or only mediocre sequel, is to integrate them in the story, without resulting in the extreme of either overshadowing the new characters by the old ones or diminishing the old ones by the new. In my view this season of Psycho-Pass managed this balance perfectly, which is why  I hold it in such high regards. 

The new introduced characters have their moments as well as the old ones. The former logically have more screentime, to have them porperly introduced to the viewer and to let them take the steps to also become fully established characters of the franchise. But this is done not by making them a simply just better versions of the old ones, but by giving them challenges to overcome, equip them with weaknesses and strengths to form a believable character. 

Though the members of the old crew have less screentime, they nevertheless keep their old characteristics and strengths that resulted from many experiences throughtout the seasons. 

To see the old team interact with the new one always made my Psycho-Pass heart jump higher and I loved to see the dynamics and situations between the Suppressing Action Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and division 01 of the CID. 


The animation was good and appropriate for the year of 2019 when it was released. Its remarkable how fast one grown used to this level of animation, especially when I recently took a look in the episodes of the first season and I was surprised how far the animation quality improved since them.

A special mention deserve the many hand to hand combat scenes and fight choreographies in the anime. Psycho-Pass is surely unmatched in this category and they were always a pleasure to watch.


The music was typically for the anime, I loved the addition of soundtracks of the first season, as soon as characters from previous seasons had an appearance. Another aspect that I also appreciate is how for each season of Psycho-Pass, they modify and more or less change the main theme of season one, and use it as its main soundtrack for the current one. 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGhdhT1YgMY)


A third season of Psycho-Pass that heavily orientates itself on elements that carry the franchise and that made it popular in the first place, and therefore is in my view a far more interesting season than the second one. Depending on individual taste, the similarities to aspects from the first season can be viewed as too strong. Though to its defend, it also tries to bring in new aspects, topics and characters to the series and world. In particularly in questions of characters and how to bring new and old characters into line in a sequel, this series is an ideal example.

There is no stopping the furies of mother nature. Destructions with uncontrollable capacities, natural disasters are a wake-up call to humanity, leaving behind ruins that signal a time of healing and strengthening to those who survived through such an ordeal. Rising up from the rubbles, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a story about reality; one that reveals the facets of humanity as it gradually explores the aftermath of a seismic convulsion.

In the sultry annoyance of summer, an already sour middle-schooler by the name of Mirai is unwillingly dragged to a robot exhibition that her younger brother, the optimistic Yuuki, wants to go to. Because reality appears to hate her and due to some family circumstances, Mirai has a nihilistic outlook on life, and in one random moment outside the exhibition center, these pessimistic thoughts of hers seems to come alive. Amidst a dead silence, the swarm of fluttering birds warns the coming of a colossal beast. As if to break her unhealthy perception of reality, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake has suddenly arrived...

...And just like that, the whole world shook.

img()

With Tokyo crumbled to a demolished state and casualties spiking up to the thousands, it's clear that this disaster has become a large-scale crisis. After getting saved by a single mother named Mari following the mainshock, these two antithetical siblings along with their motherly guardian head off on a difficult journey to reunite back with their respective families. Through this precarious endurance, they confront a world ripped to the very core of humanity; growing up and changing as the struggles of reality unravel in front of them. The story did take time to build up momentum and there are times when the pacing needlessly drags on with uneventfulness, but the result of their development becomes clear nearing the final leg of the journey.

Mirai starts to reconsider her pessimistic attitude towards life, bit by bit gaining a deeper sense of understanding of the whole world upon experiencing its fragility. The happy-go-lucky Yuuki learns more about the reality of the situation outside of his innocently bright interpretations. And Mari serves as a strong role model for these two children, comforting and protecting them with parental devotion. The more they walk, the more their interpersonal relationship strengthens them as people as they encounter what the emotional qualities of family, life, and death mean within the wreckages.

But despite those clear portrayals of humanity, sometimes the story backtracks with its own realism. The attempt to create tension, more contrived than natural, is definitely the biggest flaw for this show. There's this habit where the children go through a streak of moving towards obvious dangers, only for an ill-timed aftershock to arrive and prove the danger, then always getting saved in the nick of time that really questions if they've forgotten what they've learned from previous life-and-death experiences. Especially when they're close to reaching their home. The suspense just feels artificial and brushes aside their delicate changes all for some goosebump moments.

img()

Returning back to the realism, the art, while plain and basic, fills the world with natural colors perfect for a metropolitan setting. Well, at least one that's changed to a fractured condition with smokes everywhere, wrecked buildings scattered around, and jagged fissures split across the ground. Significant in size, the sceneries drive home the horrific scale of this natural disaster, and it's not hard to realize why it's such a life-changing event for the main characters. Which speaking of them, the animation fluctuates quite a bit in quality, but it's generally solid enough to capture their movements. The CGI crowds, however, might need some time to get used to, though the rescue robots do look great.

Other than the melodramatic music that blares during the forced tension, the sound details are generally well-done, with the quieter audio such as the silence and piano tracks stirring emotions more authentically. The voice acting puts on a convincing expression, particularly for Mari as her soft voice exposes the gentler sides beneath her durable exterior. Then there are also the diegetic sounds such as the media reporting on the state of disaster, making everything feels more worryingly genuine.

And it's that realness—the recognition that the story told in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 can happen to anyone—that gives the show an emphatic human quality despite some of its setbacks. The time after a catastrophic earthquake is the time of rebuilding, where people gain a better understanding of reality and where the endurance of survivors manifests itself as one of the greater aspects of humanity. This show really is a powerful reminder.

98449,"Let's be honest, we all know how Netflix works. We can rarely find good content in it, and this is one of them. Children of the Whales (Kujira no Kora wa Sajō ni Utau) is a Netflix original 12 episodes lenght anime series, which story still has to be told. The manga is in publication (with currently 17 volumes published). In this review there will be anime spoilers, but surely not manga ones.

STORY: 100/100

Chakuro is a boy who can't stop himself from writing. He needs to write, to put his emotions into a piece of paper and telling everything that happens on his bizarre home. A place that the population calls Mud Whale, literally a ship which sails the sea of sand. People in this Whale are devided in 2: the ""marked"" ones and the ""non-marked"" ones, that is the capacity of using a power called saimia. The ones who can use it have strangely a very short life, that's why on the Whale the ""non-marked"" ones rule over the entire population.

img220()

""Why are we here?""
""Why our lives are so short?""
""What's beyond the Mud Whale?""
""Why the Whale sails aimlessy?""
""Are we the only ones alive in the world?""

The ignorancy is able to block an entire population, making them think something that isn't true, mistaking fantasy from reality, blurring their minds trying to be positive even in their strange situation. But even the smallest sign of rebellion can represent a danger for the peace. Keeping a secret isn't always to hurt people, but to protect them from something bigger than them.
That's what they will have to find out, through all sacrifices, through pain and death, in a world that emotions aren't tolerated anymore.

!The ""children of the whale"" are the only ones left to feel emotions. The world rejected them because they created only caos and disorders, such useless things as love and pain are just a weight. The people outside the Whale gave all their emotions to the Nous, the heart of their ship, which gave them a power like the saimia. But the Mud Whale is the only ship whose Nous didn't ask for emotions in return to the power. It took the lives of the inhabitants.!

img220()

A story where the emotions are perceptible even through the screen, where tears can fall against our will, where characters are so relatable to our modern society. 

Of course, there are some things to point up. The shortness of the series seems to rush the events, most of the times it is hard to understand what's happening, even if it is later fixed with the ""episode summary"". Still, what we are able to see is only just a little part of the whole story. 
Sadly a season 2 is nowhere to be found, so I myself have to read the manga aswell (I randomly checked some manga panels and the drawing style is so clear and linear, highly recommend). 

ANIMATION: 80/100

Speaking of animation, even if this is a Netflix production I have to admit it kinda surprised me. The drawing are very soft and the colors are vivid. The animation switches from static to smooth in a blink of an eye. Of course it isn't the best animation I have ever seen, but well done for being from Netflix.

CHARACTER DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT: 60/100

Don't get me wrong when I say character design is one of the most importand things in a story in general. It is able to print in our mind a solid image of a character that we will never forget, even if years will pass we'll still remember him/her. Sadly the characters design here is very limited. Only the ""main characters"" seem to have something that blazes in our eyes, but if you already saw many animes, you will find difficult to remember them. 

Another problem is that the whole development of the single characters isn't shown this much. Most of them just stays the same, playing only side roles, the only ones who get a little of development are Chakuro, who matures his idea on the outside world and on the meaning of emotions !even through his enormous lost after Sami's death!

img220()

and Ouni, who always wanted to escape what he called a prison and he ended up fighting to protect it !He totally becomes a different person after Nibi's death, who was his only best friend!

img220()

We will see if there will be a season 2 what happens next, or else wait up for my manga review :3

MUSIC: 95/100

What captured me the most has been the music. My favourite one is surely the ending song, Hashitairo, by rionos, I leave the video link here so that you can check it out!
youtube(https://youtu.be/La8vev65haU)

The vibes that this song gives me is something I honestly can't express in words, it is something that enters in your heart and stays there, warming it up during the cold days in winter, or covering you gently like an umbrella when it rains, or a sweet hug that makes you smile and why not cry. That's what a song should do, makes you feel emotions you can totally relate on, and when you think of the anime it is the first thing that comes out from your mind. Truly a masterpiece for ears, eyes, and heart.

LAST THOUGHTS

If you are searching for an anime that is different from the ones you've always watched, but that still satisfyes you and leaves a mark in your heart, this anime is perfect for you.
But after that you must switch to the manga.
An anime with such high potential with such a cut is really a great disappointment, I just hope the manga has all the answers for all the questions I still have.

162896,"Elusive Samurai is an anime I didn't expect to watch for this season. The only time I saw the promotional material for it was CloverWorks' Twitter account promoting it for the Summer 2024 seasonal anime. I originally wasn't interested, but I decided to take a little look at the promo, and what caught my eye is the animation being weirdly smooth, a little too smooth. The character designs were also colorful, and vibrant to say the least. So I decided to give it a try.

Now that the season is over, what did I think?
I think Elusive Samurai is a rather wacky, but well-animated show that has a unique and decent starting storyline. The characters are wacky, weird, and highly stylized into this symbolic story of a real life era in Japan. 1333, the Kamakura period. I have no knowledge of Japan's history, especially in an era that has apparently not been adapted yet in media. 

Elusive Samurai obviously dramatizes events with symbolisms and literal character depictions of the real people who lived in these times. So take the 'reality' aspects of this show with a grain of salt. 

Story-
The story is quite intriguing. Like I said, I have no knowledge of any of Japan's history so to see it depicted like this is interesting. It definitely has a more Shogun feel with the story in particular, but less gritty, less serious, and more wacky. To see a prince start from the bottom of the barrel due to a betrayal and war, is very interesting and the fact that Tokiyuki is a talented young man with very agile capabilities, and has a rather almost masochistic attitude towards fighting. To the bottom, rising to the top with his trusty crew. I always wondered how people back in the day managed territories or provinces that were new and smaller, which is what this answers for. Tokiyuki getting a new found family and retainers for the future of the Hojo Clan was quite interesting too! It takes one step at a time, and seeing the dangers around them during these times, which includes possible invasions, civil wars, actual wars, and disagreements that lead to death made me think how hard and difficult these times were and it gave me an impression on history itself. Takauji itself is another story that captivated me, a symbolic demon that lost his goddamn mind. (Unrelated but I think he hot af, don't @ me)
All in all, the story is interesting, intriguing, and decent so far. Would like to see more. 

Characters-
Characters in this show is split. I think I really like Suwa, his crazy and wacky (sometimes creepy) faces he makes towards Tokiyuki, his future seeing sight, his role as a father figure and priest, his goofy personality that bounces off the MC quite well, AND VOICED MY GOJO'S VA!? What is there NOT to like?
Tokiyuki is a decent character too, starting from bottom to top. He obviously has childish traits as he is a little child but his achievements and feats are no laughing matter, he is quite masochistic when it includes the adrenaline of fighting, his determination, his beliefs, and OF COURSE, the power of friendship. 
Takauji as a villain has not been seen too much, but whenever he's on screen it's like he DEMANDS his presence on screen, he is an intimidating and actually menacing villain. Takauji has that crazy eyes, crazy happy go lucky attitude while murdering and creating chaos around him. I may have bias because those type of villains interest me more, but ANYWAYS- he is a rather creepy villain that you wouldn't know he would be the bad guy until it was too later. The way he manipulates everyone around him is crazy. He one ups his victims like flies before they start DROPPING like flies. One scene in particular that had me hooked was Takauji and his brother, when he was painting Buddha on a wooded wall, that scene as a whole made me even more interested in Takauji as a villain. His symbolic depictions are fire too. 
The last character I like is Genba. Genba is just a goofy goober that wants money and a highly skilled thief that just takes shit. He is a funny guy and I really like his character design. His personality as a arrogant, sneaky and conniving 10 year old that is also a wacky and horny bitch is not what I thought he would be but here we are. His interactions with other characters are funny and I really like his vibe. 

Now, everyone else, almost irrelevant. ALMOST. 
Shizuku is Suwa's 'right hand man' type of person, she is the first person from the main crew that Tokiyuki has seen in episode one. But, idk she has been in the sidelines a LOT in the show, the only part that she was needed was the introduction and the episode where she made Tokiyuki see spirits, that's it.
Nezu has done nothing until he is needed to fight or jump motherfuckers alongside Ayako. Nezu had a sort of mini arc towards the end of the show, around the 11th or 12th episode but his little arc was just kinda 'there', at least for me. He is quite close to the MC but I never seen interactions 1 on 1 with them so sometimes their closeness is just a tad bit forced. 
Ayako has almost no screen presence, other than some few gags of her being a strong girl that Tokiyuki can't beat. She had a few hardcore moments like her fight with one of the 3 men invading a village alongside Nezu. 
Fubuki is a little better, he was introduced way later in the show, has some fire ass skills and a very honorable attitude about fighting. But, it was dwindled after the village invasion arc as his only other trait is being hungry. That's it. Being hungry, like Luffy. He is RAW as hell don't get me wrong, but how you gonna do this man like that after his sheer AURA presented in that arc. He probably will have more screen presence in the future, so I won't go too hard on him. 

The rest of the characters of the crew I just mentioned are just 'aight', but they kinda underdeveloped and I think there are WAY too many characters to keep count in just 1 big MC group. But, I'll let it simmer and cook once season 2 is announced. 

The villains that are not Takauji are just DISGUSTING XDXD Why they gotta do them like that. I do like that they take them in a literal sense, like Sadamune having great sight so his eyes are bulging out of his sockets. We got a Master Splinter motherfucker that has great hearing so his ears have teeth. Ant Man motherfucker having a cold dark heart so ants are literally at his chest. The symbolism is crazy in this show, but everyone who's not Takauji are just ugly ass mofos XD They are great characters though as they provide new sides to the stories, some hilarious interactions and scenes as well. 

By the way the humor in this show is outta pocket on many levels. I actually was shocked how crazy some of the humor is and I straight up laughed. The BDSM scene was CRAZY. Genba flashing was crazy. Tokiyuki bouncing booty while drunk was crazy. Any Sadamune and Master Splinter scene was crazy. Suwa 60% of the time is outta pocket. 
I forgot to mention that this show has 4th wall breaks too. There was just a lot of shit going on. 

One thing I'll say is that the show is VERRYYY gory and violent, they go batshit wild with it. They be doing too much sometimes, body parts, blood squirting, women and children murdered, DOG SHOOTING!? Like they have some wild shit, I didn't expect it to be super gory but that's what I get after ignoring the R-17 tag. 

Animation-
The animation MWAH! What is more to say? This is the cleanest shit I have ever seen, it gave me those Disney/Studio Ghibli vibes with it's soft color palette and painted backgrounds. It is so pretty. Possibly one of the best. Although, there was some obvious production struggles as there is CGI unfortunately, in this case, a little janky. Due to the overwhelming amount of crazy animation this show has, it dwindles just a little then it picks right back up. The only episodes that have a complaint from me is episode 4 and episode 12, those are just CGI fest and still frames. It isn't as bad as people think though, I still think it is ok but compared to the rest of the masterpieces of episodes? Mid. They also have some cool sets like cutout animation, stop motion, and sometimes 'real' esque animation too. I hope the animators got that bag. 

Voice Acting-
Won't say too much because I am glazing at this point, everyone did a fantastic job and GOJO VA GOJO VA GOJO VA RAAAAHHH 

Music-
Music is great as well, definitely fit for those old era Japanese times, although I swear to god I heard a Thriller sample in there somewhere XD

There isn't much more to say, I say that with even some of its faults, and little bit of nitpicks, it is a good show! I would recommend! 

8.8/10"
16524,"I will be up-front and say that I am probably incredibly biased in my opinion of Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet. You see, I'm a BIG Xenoblade fan and this anime had a lot of similar vibes going on. For those of you who haven't played a Xenoblade game (which I fear might be most people out there), it's a bit difficult to explain. I went to a good friend of mine who is also a massive fan. He provided a very brief summary of how the world in Xenoblade looks that I really liked:

>'Science fantasy' where there's futuristic tech in proximity to more traditional aesthetics and cultures. Something more down to earth, while having fucking crazy science.

Hopefully you now have a better idea, even if it might be very vague. I will compare this anime to Xenoblade a few more times my review. But my goal is to illustrate my personal thoughts such that anyone can understand regardless.

I will avoid spoilers in this review.








Imagine an isekai where the main protagonist (Ledo) has an OP mecha (Chamber), in a world where everyone has much cruder technology. In other words, a massive disparity in power. However, Ledo is still in a totally new world. Everything they once knew and believed isn't helpful and is constantly questioned. And to top it off, Ledo is forced to interact with a foreign group of people. The general story revolves around Ledo having to adapt to this new way of life.

If you were going in expecting epic fights and action, then you might be disappointed. That isn't really the focus (not to say that there isn't any action). Rather, the focal point is the world-building, which I think is done incredibly well, in my personal opinion.

I really liked how the world got established. We the audience, alongside Ledo, are trying to learn and understand this new world. Though for us, new might not be the right word, since there is technology that we might be familiar with. Even so, these people rely on salvaging to get a lot of the stuff they use. So even they themselves might not even fully understand the technology, since it can come from long before their time.

Then there's just the whole premise of seeing how people might adapt to living on a planet seemingly covered entirely in water. I thought that the system shown was unique and interesting. It might've been borrowed or inspired by something else, but I couldn't think of anything. I've seen some people compare this to Waterworld, but I never saw it, so I can't personally comment. But for those of you who have, it might have a similar feel to that.

img()

Honestly, this all just reminded me a lot of the world in the different Xenoblade games. One of my friends who saw this said it felt like they fused the Argentum Guild (from Xenoblade 2) with the Blade Barracks (from Xenoblade X). I personally just felt a mix of the colony life from Xenoblade 1 and the salvaging aspect from 2. It felt strangely nostalgic and I loved it.

I guess to more specifically point out what it was that I liked, it was this blend of technology that we might see today with that of the future. There was this cool environment of past (what was salvaged) and future (what came with Ledo) coming together to make something that works for the present. And the anime did a really good job at still showing the difference between the two (which I will talk more about in Art/Animation section).

The story itself could probably be best described as feeling very much like a slice of life in the first half of the show. Tons of ambience and beautiful scenery to behold. For me, I found it to be unique and loved it. As for the latter half of the show, I think most who have seen this would agree that it was a bit rough around the edges. I won't go into much more detail, but I just wanted to acknowledge that there is a noticeable change in tone/direction that could potentially impact personal enjoyment (which depends on what one is hoping to get out of this).

Additionally, throughout the story, there are a few plot-holes. I was able to look past them and didn't let it ruin my enjoyment. However, they were present and I wished that they got addressed. So if stuff like that bothers you, it could be an issue, but I don't think there were enough problems that made the show unwatchable or anything like that. There were just a few parts that had me scratching my head and that I wish had better explanation (or in some cases, got explained at all).

I do think it's worth pointing out that this is an anime original. Meaning that it didn't have any source material to go off of. With that in consideration, I honestly think that even if the story got a bit shaky towards the end, it still stuck the landing for me.








It is very clear from the start that the most attention is given to Ledo, Chamber, and Amy. There is still a pretty wide cast of supporting characters, but they don't have close to as much screen-time. So if you wanted to see development beyond the main characters, you will be disappointed. Not to say that the supporting cast doesn't get any development, but it isn't much, is only for a few of them, and is spread out.

I don't really think there were any characters I hated. Nobody seemed overly annoying and I just loved each and every one of the crew. My favorite character overall would probably have to be Chamber. For an AI, I think he was written exceptionally well. It was weird, he didn't feel like a full-on robot, but wasn't human either (obviously). I got similar vibes to J.A.R.V.I.S. from Marvel.

If you were looking for romance, this ain't the anime for you. There is zero romance and very minimal fan-service (only a few scenes and didn't seem too forced to me). For some, this might be a huge deal. For others, a breath of fresh air.

To my surprise, there were some moments where philosophical questions got brought up. I suppose it made sense, since Ledo constantly had to reevaluate what he formerly believed. What was once accepted as truth and purpose became questioned. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into much more detail. But the show raises some interesting questions that I honestly never thought to ask. And while Ledo and some other characters do examine these questions and share some insight, it still felt as though it could've been explored more. I think that part of the issue stemmed from the show only being 13 episodes. But I still thought it was an interesting inclusion and that it didn't hurt my experience much, if at all.








This is a very beautiful anime. It's very colorful, it's vibrant, and the art was just really well-done in general. 

img()



As I've said before, this anime did an exceptional job at contrasting the two worlds. Ledo's technology was all black and/or just dull in colors. Conversely, everything else in this new world was full of color and life. But despite this obvious difference, it worked and looked great.

As for the fights, I think it still looks fine. CGI is clearly used for any mecha/ships, which isn't all that surprising for me. Almost every other mecha I've seen up to now has done this. Since I am still new to anime and the mecha genre in general, I can't speak to how frequently it gets seen. All I'm trying to say is that I personally found no issue with its use. It didn't hinder my enjoyment or experience, but it is noticeable and definitely isn't the best. So if the use of any CGI is a turn-off for you, then you might not like it.

img()




I don't think I have much else to say. I just really liked how this anime looked and didn't see much wrong outside of maybe some nitpicks with the CGI.








Holy shit. Where do I even start. I liked the OP for this show. It really fit the vibe (for the most part) and was just a bop. I can't comment on the ED; I would usually skip it to see the next episode as fast as I could.

Then there's the OST, which is, in my opinion, one of the best I've heard in any anime up to now. Tarou Iwashiro did a fantastic job at bringing everything to life and setting the mood. Each scene had a track that felt appropriate. And once combined with the already beautiful visuals, really elevated my experience. Everything just worked for me.


youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEKxtugT8R0&list=PLCsOwPldZgDSO3uCJQGcfGZvHIA5cKZlT&index=12)





As for the audio, it generally seemed great to me. All in all, anything to do with sound was a 10/10 for me.

Nothing is without its flaws. Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet might not be perfect. Despite that, I still enjoyed it a lot. I fell in love with the world and characters and was left wanting more. Unfortunately, we won't be seeing a season 2. However, there are a pair of specials and OVA that expand on the story. So if you liked this and wanted more, then you'll most likely like those too (I think, I know I did). I know that a lot of people who enjoyed this anime were really disappointed about the sequel not happening. I too was one of them. But now I'm not sure. It ends at a good spot (with a fairly ""final"" ending) and doesn't overstay its welcome. I don't know if I'd want a potentially bad sequel to mess anything up.

I think I would honestly give this a 10/10. But what even is a 10/10 anyways? Is anything truly flawless in every aspect? After some introspection, I determined that for me, a 10/10 would be something that I found a lot of entertainment in. There might have been some bad parts, but ultimately, the positives outweighed the negatives so much that it didn't matter. I enjoyed it from start to finish and felt as though I had to nitpick to find anything I really didn't like. This is something I can see myself re-watching in the future. And most importantly, this is 100% something I would recommend to anyone else. It is sad this anime seems to be so underrated.

I give Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet a 10/10."
127090,"It's not often I write reviews. In fact, I've yet to publish one here. However, this show has managed to force me to write one as this has to be one of the worst shows that I've watched. 

Now, there are plenty of shows in my completed list that people would consider ""bad"" or ""trashy"" but I generally find that these shows will usually have a couple of redeeming elements to them. With Isekai Harem, there is close to nothing good nor redeeming about this show. It's a vapid, shallow piece of media that after it's done, will leave the average person with nothing more than a few hours of their life now irreversibly lost.



The main character, Michio Kaga, is on the Internet when he finds a website that lets him create skills and abilities for a character. Upon completing his character, he's transported to another world where he is given the abilities that he chose. Once he wakes up in the new world he quickly starts hacking his way through various bandits raiding the village he's been placed in. One of the bandits is taken prisoner by the villagers and we quickly learn that captures are typically sold off as slaves. Michio then travels to a city with one of the villagers so they can sell the bandit and this is where he's introduced to a slave trader named Alan. After some persuading, Michio sets his sights on a slave named Roxanne. A wolf-kin girl who Alan is currently selling. Eventually, he raises funds to buy/own her and they start adventuring in the labyrinth in the city and later a different one that's located in a nearby city. 

Now, anyone who has watched the show might be wondering why I've left the details out of how he gets the money and I've done that because in all honesty; it doesn't matter. It's trivial when you compare it to the overarching ""plot"" of this show. That being that once he's got her it's pretty much just Michio and Roxanne doing samey labyrinth combat in each episode and then going back home to bang. 

And that is where my dislike for this show stems from. It has absolutely nothing to offer you. It's not fun, as they do almost the same thing for most of the episodes (bear in mind that this is only 12 episodes) and it's certainly not a show about the characters. The main people are Roxanne, a Stockholm syndrome slave whose main purpose is to have big boobs and constantly suck off (literally and figuratively) Michio. Michio meanwhile is as bland as white bread and has the personality of a horny, cardboard box. Yes, technically there's a second member of his harem, Sherry, who shows up for the last couple of episodes and is just another object for Michio to get off with. Oh, and this isn't even a decent harem show as the poster shows 5 girls and you'll only see the last 3 in a flash-forward moment, and at the very end where within the last few minutes of the last episode you're shown a montage of Michio going to different places to buy and then having sex with the girls. As for any insight into their characters well...errr... maybe in the sequel (haha)? Please note that as I write this there are still a couple of OVAs to come out but let's not kid ourselves thinking that they will be any better.

As for animation, I'm assuming most of the budget went into drawing Roxanne's tits jumping up and down during her and Michio's many love-making sessions. Saved by the labyrinth fights then right? As if, hope you enjoy cheap and stiff looking animation with the same enemies used repeatedly. Not like any of the fights had any kind of stakes whatsoever.

Overall, your time is better off watching so many other things. I soldiered on through this slop purely because I had convinced myself that there would be some kind of payoff to make the whole thing worth it. Nope. I wasted my time and hopefully, anyone reading this will take my advice and not watch this show.

I give Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo (Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World) a 15/100"

It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that, for most in the anime community, “dubbing” is an insidious, charged word. That single word is powerful enough that, at it’s mere utterance, most anime fans’ faces will turn into an ugly sneer, their stomachs will lurch, and they’ll have to fight off the urge to violently vomit. Most fans strongly prefer subs to dubs and are quite inflexible in this preference. To them, dubs are of shoddy quality and even the best ones fail to capture the sense of the original work, due to changing the audio. If the reception of the dub of Ghost Stories is any indication, however, anime fans are more than willing to like, even adore a dub if it doesn’t at all care about being the equivalent of the original. Ghost Stories is a parody dub, through and through and this fact seems to have paid off for the creators. A somewhat lackluster show is now immortalized thanks to its dub. Almost everyone suggests to watch the dub rather than the sub. From what I can see, everyone absolutely loves it. My personal take is that everyone absolutely loves the concept and how marvel it is, more than the dub as a whole. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed my time with Ghost Stories, it’s just nowhere near a masterpiece. In total, jokes seem to miss more than they land and the show takes a while to hit its stride.

The original Ghost Stories was a formulaic, monster-of-the-week anime about grade school children having to deal with all manner of ghosts that haunted their school and the surrounding town. The distributors were worried that the show would flop in America, so save for some ground rules such as not changing names of any character or ghosts, the dubbing team was instructed to “do whatever else you want to make the show successful.” To the dubbers, this translated to making an irreverent parody series, filled with all manner of jokes. While the premise remains the same, the characters change wildly. The one trait that they share is that they’re all quite rude to one another, thus helping foster the irreverent tone I talked about.

img520(

I won’t be comparing the dub to the subs; most reviews I’ve seen seem to be preoccupied with the quality of the subs and it seems to me that this compromises them scrutinizing the dub. The bottom line is that, from what I’ve seen, you should really only have the dub in consideration when deciding whether or not you want to watch this show.

Starting off with the positives, while the tone of the dub is irreverent and the dub itself is a giant gag, the voice actors really care about their work. In this instance, their task is making people laugh. Because of this, performances don’t feel phoned in: every voice sounds like the actors are actually trying. Keiichirou sounds absolutely awful but that’s because his voice actor is trying to make him sound that way; every bout of inane babbling on his end (and the laughs they garner) are intentional. Rob Mungle’s performance as Amanojaku is absolutely a riot as he chews the scenery just from his voice. Whether he’s making some snide remark, making a joke, or just getting angry, I’m liable to crack a smile just because of how much fun he was having in the booth. Another standout voice actor was Brittney Karbowski as Mio in episode twelve. Her performance was just so over-the-top that I couldn’t help but laugh. Mio’s rabbit-loving antics combined with Karbowski’s performance really stole the show. There are several voice-based gags in this show but another one that I get a kick out of is Miyuki’s (voiced by Shelley Calene-Black) random, hysterical screams in episode 17.

And of course, the dub features amazing jokes. They make fun of everything and everyone under the sun. While they don’t always land (as I’ll get to shortly), when they do, they’re great. I particularly loved the episode in which Momoko reveals her backstory as a nymphomaniac drug addict; it’s so different from her current day self-righteousness that it’s absolutely hilarious. This show really endorses laughing at things that often one shouldn’t laugh at. 

img520(v)

I most often found myself laughing at situational comedies rather than throway jokes. An example is the aforementioned bit with Momoko and also a section in which Satuski and Keiichiro’s father has his genitals mutilated after playing with a doll ghost. I also in general enjoyed the sex-related jokes and anything involving Momoko, as she was my favorite character of the principal cast (unless you count Amanojaku). It’s not really something addressed in the show, but it’s kind of hilarious that, even in the dub, the characters are still stated to be in upper elementary school when they each should realistically at least be about three years older.

img520()

Ghost Stories also employs meta jokes very well, as they actually hold a purpose in showing how ridiculous the show can be. One particular one I love is a variation of a monster running towards the characters. Their actions bound to the animation, they can only remark, “well, how about we stand here and stare at it some more.” Amanojaku’s hilarious heel-face-turn is rendered as, “Why am I doing this, it doesn’t fit my character arc. Oh well, I’m getting paid, it’s a living.”

img520()

The music is surprisingly good for this show, if not a bit mismatched for the dub since it can get legitimately eerie at times. At first, I thought the music was generic or public domain because I swore I heard it before. As it turns out, I basically did, for the composer also worked on Inuyasha as a show that also dealt with monsters, I guess he couldn’t help but end up making an OST that sounds similar. The music isn’t bad, it can just be a bit distracting if you’ve watched Inuyasha.

img520()

The animation isn’t too great. The characters will be off-model very often. If you notice it, it can be very distracting, but I honestly was too busy focusing on the comedy to really care.

And now we move onto things that don’t work. 

The dub can be quite crude and there are certain jokes that I just don’t find funny. Call my PC or whatever, but I find “jokes” about Keiichiroi being “r-t-rded” or a “f-g” pretty tasteless. I roll my eyes when Keiichirou and Satsuki’s mom being lesbian is framed as a joke in and of itself, like homosexuality is just intrisically funny. The same goes with Jewish jokes And I didn’t really find most of the black jokes funny either (yelling “Just pretend you’re being chased by a big black man,” to prompt a character to run faster), but that might just be because it’s harder to laugh when you feel like you’re the butt of a joke. One thing to keep in mind is that the dub holds no punches, just as its likely you’ll find something funny, there’s the likelihood you’ll find something unfunny. Hopefully it doesn’t get to the point where you’re offended, but if you’re anything like me, there will be and it will take some enjoyment out of the show for you.

img520()
One type of humor that didn’t do it for me were pop culture references. Unfortunately, there are many, many references in Ghost Stories and I got very few of them, leaving me annoyed and baffled. The primary problem with references is that they are very situational: either you get them or you don't. If you get them, great, you’ll have a laugh, but if not, you’ll be left scratching your head, wondering what’s the significance of what was just said. As reviled as they are, at least with Family Guy 's cutaway gags, even if you don’t get the initial reference, the show shows you why it’s funny. To some, it may seem lazy and an insult to viewers’ intelligence, but for crude comedies, I don’t think the point is to stoke viewers’ intelligence in the first place, it’s to make them laugh, and references often don’t do that because one has to get the reference. Plus, references are inherently lazy if nothing is done with those references. At the very least, Ghost Stories usually packages those references with jokes but they fall flat if you don’t know the reference. As a geek, I have a very specific range of interests and I wouldn’t get references that fall outside of that range. I got a Jessica Alba reference, but that’s only because she was in Fantastic Four. I got the Charlie Sheen and Oprah references, but that’s only because they managed to stay in the limelight. I can only imagine even less references will be funny for future viewers. Alanis Morissette, Steven Foster, Linda Blair, Al Sharpton are all names that I don’t know, yet they’re referenced, meaning those jokes flew clear over my head. Unfortunately, references are the most common type of joke in Ghost Stories, meaning I just plain didn’t get a vast majority of the humor. The references are fired in a machine gun manner: fire as many at the audience as you can in hopes some of them land. Making matters worse is that the cast really likes to run some references to the ground. Made all the more annoying because I still don’t get the blimin’ reference. I swear I’ll lose my mind if I have to hear that X is/will be deader than Y’s career (usually Christian Slater, whoever the hell that is). Oh, and comparing the events of the episode to The Ring which I’ve never watched.

img520()

I can excuse the overreliance on references due to the fact that the entire dub was apparently ad libbed. Honestly, that makes me impressed, though still doesn’t make them any funnier, it just makes me less annoyed at the cast.

Another problem is that the anime really doesn’t get hilarious until the ninth episode, “The Corpse that Roams in the Night – Shirotabi."" There are certainly funny moments prior, but this is the first episode that I’d say is funny in its entirety. There are a few more afterward. While Ghost Stories is certainly funny, it's rarely gut-busting in its comedy. Some of its mean-spirited jokes and overreliance on references hurt it, but even without these, it’s oftentimes not that funny. It might be a bit dull for some viewers early on, so I might suggest watching select episodes (9-13). Still, as I said, there are laughs to be had in every episode, even if they’re not guffaws. The concept itself is quite marvel, so I’d recommend checking Ghost Stories, I’d just caution not to expect the magnum opus of comedy.

20574,"I don’t think it was made for me, but I resonated with it all the same. High score girl. Whatever I write here probably won’t put everything I love about this show on paper. This show takes place in the early 90’s with our protagonist, a 6th grader named Yugichi Haruo. He’s not very kind, and his grades aren’t the best, to be honest he’s kind of a shithead. But he is good at one thing, his passion, video games. He spends a majority of his time just dicking around at various arcades around town. On one faithful day, Haruo encounters a beautiful, smart, rich girl from his class named Ono. Who absolutely decimates him in street fighter 2. After 30 consecutive wins against him, Ono follows him around various arcades playing various different games. From then on, the two create a strange bond with each other.

High score girl is a small slice of life comedy that takes place over Haruo’s life. From his elementary school years, until his first year in high school. The story describes his growth and how Ono along with the various other characters in his life, help Haruo grows and improve. This, by itself, sets itself off of a lot of other slice of life shows. Where they don’t go through long periods of someone’s life. The only example I can think of off the top of my head is Clannad, which is in my top ten and is considered one of the greatest anime of all time. Main difference is, aside from the smaller eyes, is that the characters are a bit more one dimensional then Clannad is. It's not that they’re bad, it's safer and uninspired. They fit into normal protagonist and -dere stereotypes, but they are handled in a wonderful way where you don’t mind. I must say, Ono is the only main character I’ve seen who never says a word over the course of the entire show. She only communicates by facial expressions, actions, and the occasional grunt. She’s cute though. Its heartwarming.

As you can guess, the show’s main driving point initially was that it has to do with being a kid in the 90’s and an obsession with video games. This describes its audience pretty well. It was appealing to mid to late 30’s Japanese men who grew up to playing these games. To them, it's a nice nostalgia trip tied up with a protagonist that they could easily imprint themselves on. I understood this from the beginning of the show, and I didn’t think I would particularly enjoy it due to how I couldn't relate to growing up in the 90’s. But, I was wrong, and ending up being very invested in these characters and how they’re relationship grows. I loved their character dynamic, and what they did together as friends. Just friends playing video games, Harou treating her as a rival and Ono just following him around.

Video games is the backbone of this entire show. If video games were involved I doubt this show would have gotten any traction at all for reasons I will explain later. This show was made/sponsored by square enix themselves. Therefore, they had enough to get entire clips of game footage where the characters explain and react to what's happening on screen. The very first episode they explained how some cheap strategies worked in Street Fighter 2. It's not just Street Fighter they reference and directly mention a bunch of big time games that were popular or hyped at the time. There was an entire scene talking about how hype they were for the new virtual boy coming out, which if you know you’re gaming history, didn’t do very well. High Score Girl really put you in the place of a kid that’s hyped for the newest games in the 90’s. I’m not even a fan of arcade games and I feel like I’m that kid being excited.

The main problem, which is pretty major when watching this show, is the animation. High Score Girl is an entirely CG show, but do not take that away from the experience this show can give you. But man, it does look pretty garbage. I loved the soundtrack for this show, especially with the OP “New Stranger” and ED “Houkago Di(e)stra(u)ction”. I mostly compare this show to Dagashi Kashi. Mostly where 1) its 2 people being brought together by the same passion, and 2) it's a show made to sell things. Yeah High Score Girl is an advertising show, it displays games coming out now in the transition periods between in the middle of the show where ad breaks would role. It’s sort of off putting, but it's neatly and clearly separated from what's happening in the actual show, so it doesn’t really matter. I give this show a 10 out of 10, with the recommendation for everyone and anyone to watch if they don’t mind some CG that isn't really disruptive to the type of show. This was truly the best show of the Summer anime season. This has been PixEFit’s spoiler free but not really review of High Score Girl."
129192,"Well, it's an anime anyways. It was fun in the aspect of just watching an OP main character wreck absolute havoc on anything that tried to stand in their way. That... is about it. Well, that and the slimes are really adorable.

This anime is seriously lacking though. The animation is rough, the art style feels like it could use some fleshing out, and the plot just barely exists. Our main character has absolutely no personality what-so-ever. Honestly, the little slime monsters and literally every other character in the world have more personality than our robotic, logic-only main character. If you really think about it though, even our main character’s “logic” barely exists. It’s like the entire driving force (what little we’re given) is to lay low (while showing everyone how OP they are), and never, ever, ever get clued in to what the average life and average person in the world is like. Everything is just so flat. This is certainly not an anime that will get your heart racing, nor will it draw you into a great story line. It simply exists.

It’s not the worst anime out there, that’s for sure. At the very least I found some enjoyment in the little things. We had some cute slimes (I really liked the slimes, okay? They remind me of the junimos in Stardew Valley, which are a personal favorite of mine). It at least tried to have a plot, and tried to stick to some form of continuity. Every once in a while we caught a glimpse of our main character’s past life, which gave us some insight, anyways. Also, as far as we’re aware it was not, in fact, Truck-kun (or similar) which caused our main character to arrive–so that’s a unique train anyways. Instead it’s a vague reference to a summoning ritual done at least a decade in the past which activated later on or… something. Again, plot is very, very minimal so without details it’s hard to say. And details are not something you’re going to get with this one, so if that’s on your must-have when it comes to an anime, walk away.

If you're looking for something mindless to just watch, this will do. Seriously, don't try to think too hard over this one. The only endearing characters are the slimes, and that's saying a lot. If you go into it looking for anything else, you're only going to be disappointed in the glaring plot holes, lack of plot building, and absolutely zero character building or endearment. Don't go into this one with any sense of expectations, and don't feel bad if ultimately you decide to drop it. I know I almost did. Only reason I ended up finishing it is because it’s been a high-anxiety week, and the mindlessness of it was exactly what I needed–without all the romance tropes that are currently annoying me."
14837,"I do not like Dragonball Super. I agree with all of the criticisms against it, and all of the character assassinations present. Sadly, it is a stain on something I love.

But if you take one thing away from this, please let it be this: Battle of Gods is not Dragonball super, it does not suffer the issue of misunderstanding its source, it does not deserve the hate its given. Battle of gods is brilliant. I mean it, Battle of gods is beautiful.

First, keep in mind the period it was being released. We had gone so, so long without NEW Dragonball stuff. After all this time, its back. Dragonball, our childhoods, our inspiration and dreams, its back. The man who could do anything, who rest assured his wife and audience everything would be ok, was back. 

That same Goku does not last too long.

Beerus shows up and molly whops him. The impossible happens, Goku loses, and is embarrassed. Immediately the goal is clear as day, as always in dragonball: beat the big bad, beat Beerus, the man on the hunt for a ""Super Saiyan god"".

It doesn't waste much time setting up who Beerus is, he's divinity and he is merciless, and he's coming to earth to take our childhoods away.

I adore Vegeta here. Hes still a bit of an egotist as he always will be, but hes a family man and a defender of earth first and foremost. He's fine with doing a dumb dance, and eating Takoyaki and putting on a show so long as it protects his home. A lot of DBS regresses the purity of DBZ Vegeta, but I personally thought he ruled here, fighting a man he knows he has a guarantee of losing to purely to protect his loved ones. No cares for surpassing Kakarot, or being number one, just to keep the ones he fought for vs kid Buu safe. Vegeta at his purest after Z.

And he loses, as Vegeta tends to do (lol). Showing first and foremost a new conflict: the old Ki wont work here, we cant win with emotion and force, we must ascend, we must go higher. Its brilliant in setting up the soon faulty DBS power scaling, and it sets a distinct tone for the movie, and a distinct goal for Goku: ascend, and save the world.

And that he does, as he comes to earth last second to save the day, as he always would. Through Shenron and through Videls child, showing how far Saiyan's have come due to earth and just how important these bonds really are, he achieves it.

Anti climatic don't you think?

Intentionally so, and Goku makes full point of such, pointing out how he's not happy with his form as he does not feel he earned such. Intentionally anti climatic, giving the audience the same feeling of dissatisfaction as Goku, and hinting towards the climax by leaving a gap in our expectations purposefully. Its genius.

They do battle, Goku stands his own but never fully grasps Beerus. As hard as he fights, he never fully feels Beerus out. This isn't Goku fighting Beerus, this is super Saiyan god doing battle. This is not the way Goku fights, he's built HIMSELF to be so strong, this is not how he wants to win.

And thus, its not how he wins. Channeling super Saiyan god into super Saiyan, the form he worked on and perfected with his son, he fights Beerus as son Goku, going all out as the warrior raised on earth; not the warrior gifted a new form. 

He loses. Despite going all out, despite fighting as Goku, he loses. Thus, Beerus explains the universe. or well, universes. There are 12 total, and within just this one, is Beerus and Whis, two people so much stronger than him. 

As Gokus mentor, Roshi did his best to instill one moral into his student: there is always someone stronger than you.

And it comes full circle here. Now, not only are there two impossible to scale people, but potentially billions across MULTIPLE UNIVERSES. As an ending to Dragonball, this would genuinely be the best there is, leaving such ambiguous and leaving Goku to train on this new level, in a sense that satisfies him, sending him on a now infinite quest to be the strongest. I believe dbs ruins such by exploring said universes, but i digress.

There is no better example of Goku as a character than Battle of Gods (don't misread this as ""this is the best Goku""). Comforting, backed against the wall, trying to the end. It is Goku at his purest, bringing out all of his best qualities and displaying just how special he really is. Dragonball really was back, Super Saiyan's were back, Ki blasts were back, GOKU. was back. That, alone, is beautiful to me."
143277,"Urusei is the last anime I thought I'd like yet it made it's way into my heart. 

Now I don't care about presenting you the anime let's just get onto why I love it and why I didn't think I would. 

I thought Urusei Yatsura was a ""pervert/voyeur"" anime. 

And by pervert I don't mean it as ""ohhh no, fanservice, boobs I can't watch this anymore, it ruined my whole experience !"" I mean it as a delusional phantasm with mere palliative effects for it's viewers. The whole point of these stories is to make it's viewers virtually obtain something they can't have in real life, trapping them into being comforted in their miserable state and using their emotions and lust for the sake of selling. It's malicious and that's what I mean by pervert anime. (third time I talk about this in a review lmao)

With this paragraph you can tell how far I was from liking this anime. I expected it to be about some random waifu who completely and absolutely love a nobody despite him not deserving it. And after watching the first few episodes well... My worries were pretty much confirmed except for Ataru (mc boy) actually having a personnality which kinda invalidated the perverted self-insert story theory.
I was also pissed off with the Ataru/Shinobu romance b#llshit that made no sense.

And after few other episodes, I realized how utterly wrong I was. To me, this anime is nothing perverted, if anything it's full of love and good intentions for it's viewers. 



Ataru's archetype is basically that bratty kid who'd really to feel a breast or two (doryoku mirai...). I expected good ol personnality-less mc-kun so it was a good surprise honestly. And what's good is that his attitude isn't an excuse for the author to make it a one sided gender slander thing like ""oh look how men are beasts that only care about sex"". Shinobu (who's a female) is comically seen as shallow as she was the inital love interest of Ataru but she shifted to the ""school prince"" because of his looks and status. Ataru wants the dude dead but he ain't even mad at Shinobu. 

Who would prefer a pathetic dude with no future to an intelligent dude from a good family who holds one ? Though, the contrary could also be said. What kind of fool would only search for looks and material things in their partner ? That's basically the anime. It mocks boys and girls or men and women for their habits of falling in love with anyone for stupid reasons : looks or status. It isn't seen as something illogical but it's still being made fun of even though it's natural and comprehensive behaviour.

It isn't a one gender slander thing or a perverted anime. Urusei Yatsura is also not another waifu oblige anime where all the main girls are just perfect and the guy is the only the dense worthless dude with flaws. No character is put on a pedestal for ""husbando"" or ""waifu"" sake. They're all being made fun of, they're all ridicule and in that sense, they're all equal. 

It's a wholesome anime with relatable stuff, as much as it is exaggerated for comedic purpose, it's episodic and self-aware and Idk it's just good man.



To conclude, I find Ataru and Lum's romance interesting. As I said earlier, all the teens in the story ""fall in love"" for dumb reasons : grudges, status, looks, jealousy, lust etc but Lum is the only character who romantically like Ataru for who he is, not for societal titles and Ataru, despite being attracted to Lum, hates her but slowly falls for her, not for her looks but for the genuine loving and caring person she is. It's an unrealistic yet sweet  version of love that reminds you what you really want in your partner. There's a huge difference between that and the destructive self insert I described earlier. Some people probably found it unfuny, boring, trash or embarassing but I don't care, I enjoyed it, it has a meaning and from my perspective it perfectly is what it's trying to be and it's all that matters."
156415,"I self-identify as a ""midsekai"" enjoyer. Anything involving transportation to another world, reincarnation, or similar tropes, will pique my interest immediately. It doesn't matter how generic an isekai is, I'll give it a chance and likely get at least some enjoyment out of it (Shinka no Mi S2 did push past even my limits though). 

In an age where LN titles writers are running out of creativity, reading the title ""I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince So I Can Take My Time Perfecting My Magical Ability"" exerts a sort of gut reaction that I'm sure many others felt. 

>""Another midsekai just dropped, when will it end?""
""Sigh""
(Zip)

And as I began watching the first episode, everything seemed pretty standard up until Lloyd's duel with Sylpha. Even then I thought, 
>""Damn, there goes the rest of the budget.""

Except as the episode progressed to Lloyd's fight with Grim, the animation quality stayed constant. And I actually thought to myself, 

>""Damn, they kinda cooked""

Dainanaoji was filled with moments like this, and although it doesn't truly attempt anything novel, it's an isekai that punches well above its weight. 

This is where the good ole' midsekai moniker gets its name. You have a weak dude reincarnated as a prodigy, who can do anything he wants, to anyone he wants. Nothing here is all that unique from a plot standpoint, except for maybe the fact that Lloyd is well liked by pretty much every member of his family shown in S1. Since S2 is on the horizon, I suspect we'll see some of the other siblings (the talented and dashing Prince Albert is still only the 2nd born) that may not feel the same way. But everyone knows we aren't watching midsekai for the plot. 

Similar to the plot, we have a pretty standard fantasy setting and world, with magical beasts, humans, and enemies in the form of demons. Nothing here to really write home about. 

Let's first address the elephant in the room. Yes, I agree that Lloyd's young femboy aesthetic is a lot bit strange. However, I really like Lloyd's character overall. I think the essence of his character being his love for magic and how dark his character can be at times, is contrasted really well with how carefree he is because of it. It kind of reminds me of Shadow from KJN in how he's driven by one thing and anything else is inconsequential. Also similar to Shadow, it isn't that Lloyd only cares about magic, !as evidenced by his decision in the final episode to take the assassins guild as retainers. Yes he says he did it solely because of their magic potential, but I feel like he really does have a heart deep down under his 14 consecutive barriers.! 
Seeing Grim's increasing numbness to any surprises involving Lloyd's power was also pretty fun, and I think his consistent involvement as the ironic voice of reason was a welcome addition. Jade's arc was also pretty enjoyable, and Sylpha is Sylpha, no complaints there. 

This is where Dainanaoji really shines. As far as I can tell, this was animated by a pretty new studio. I don't know anything about them, but I know they did some solid work one way or another. I loved the art style of this show, and I think the use of chibi designs for humor segments was very well done (and I assume done to save budget). I don't think there was ever a dip in quality for any of the action sequences, which is not something you can usually say about midsekai. Overall, this anime was visually appealing pretty much the whole way through. 

I think the use of cuts in some places where humor is thrown in (like with some of the chibi segments) was good, and the OST fit pretty well. OP is nothing crazy, but again I think the OST was really solid for this type of show. 

As I mentioned before

The simplest way to describe this show, is fun. If you like power fantasy at all, there is very little not to like about this show. It takes all the most basic tropes found in isekai, and just does them well. At no point does it try anything truly unique, and that's ok. I don't need innovation in my midsekai, hell, I don't even need quality content to watch them. But Dainanaoji, is quality content, and is something I'd definitely recommend for anyone that's a fan of the isekai genre."
17513,"This anime has no plot. Literally. You would think that an anime whose premise is a girl surrounded by six vampires would be interesting and mysterious, well, no. There are literally not many spoilers to tell as there is not much to tell! If you are going to watch this, keep in mind that you will only see a girl being abused, and nothing else. There is no reflection, there are no moments where you look for empathizes with the protagonist because of her torment, but you arrive at the moment where you simply know that this anime aims to get girls horny by bringing ""erotic"" scenes of physical and psychological abuse of six sexy vampires to a girl with no personality. And here comes another point, the protagonist has no personality. And I'm not saying it to be rude on purpose, but the only words of the protagonists are No! and Stop! but deep down it gives the impression that she ends up enjoying it, which makes this even more horrible.
This anime is targeted to females, which makes it even sicker, as if we find enjoyment or something ""cute and romantic"" in such things. Therefore, it is a just misogynistic anime. There are scenes so cruel, without being bloody. that they are equivalent to group sexual abuse, where two vampires approach her to bite her, but it is not difficult to reinterpret the scene.
Another point is that this anime does not appeal to anyone. Do you like vampire stories? Well you won't see that here, just guys abusing a girl with the excuses of being ""vampires"". Do you like teen romance between girl x something? There is no here, they do not love her nor she does, there is only abuse. Do you like perverse shows? This is not even good at it, since it's super edgy.
There are times when you can't even be outraged because you no longer take what happens seriously, but the series tries to seem respectable even adding past to the characters so that in the end they do not develop, they do not arise, nor is there an characters arc, they are there only to justify the actions of the characters.
It is an insulting show in many ways, and not only to women, but also to the genre of vampires.
The worst thing is that the anime is not presented as an anime of abuse and eroticism, but a vampire story, which it is not. It is a story of six wicked boys abusing a hyper submissive girl wrapped in a vampire atmosphere with no plot background.
Only the soundtrack is slightly enjoyable in this anime, which could be one of the worst ever.

But let's face it, things like these wouldn't exist if there wasn't a demand. It is really sad that people consume this and like it, or try to justify the characters. Pathetic. 
If I had to rate it I would give it 3/10. 3 because its soundtrack is decent, the opening serves its purpose, and the animation is sometimes a good thing."
146953,"So here it is. A show that got a sequel about half a decade later. A bit of an unexpected one at that. 

A solid plot was built up only to be stepped on and then built up again. 

Before I go any further here, I should mention that contrary to what seems the popular opinion, I quite enjoyed season one of this series. I enjoyed it because it had the main couple of characters as the focus while allowing the supporting characters some room to feel relevant. Plus the plot of chubby kid becoming fit as a teen in order to get back at the young girl who broke his heart during childhood after he gets her to fall in love with him seemed like a fun concept to me. But needless to say, that season wasn't conclusive so here we are. Some spoilers to follow. 

 


Well pig's foot, go and do something. 

Makabe Masamune, or Pig's Foot (the nickname given to him by the girl he loved when she rejected him and the reason for his revenge plan), is someone who frankly has a goal and he wants to see it through. 

At this point (season two) it is well established that he has found the girl who broke his heart, Aki Adagaki, and has built a friendship of sorts with her as she unknowingly doesn't know it's him. Her servant on the other hand, Yoshino Koiwai, is well aware of who Makabe is. They have worked together to get Makabe and Aki closer together in hopes of making Aki see that the ""rival"" in the relationship (Gasou Kanetsugu) is not who he says he is since he is posing as Makabe and Aki believes him just due to looks and well, chubbiness. So in a way, the main characters are not just Makabe and Aki. 

 


What do the French think? 

The first arc of the season is a class trip. Automatically, we are shown or directed at potential pairs because it's France and the city of love is reason enough. A new character is introduced, Muriel Besson, a French girl who loves Japanese culture because of manga culture she has taken interest in. I will tell you now her character ends up fairly pointless. She does help minimally by forcing Aki and Makabe to pretend date and spend time together while she gathers inspiration for her romance manga, but that's not to say that the main pair wouldn't have been together anyway as they tended to run into each other frequently. 

Visually, we at least get a completely new setting here until they return to school which is at least a nice break from the norm. The animation itself is not too spectacular however and the music is more or less generic or more specifically, unmemorable. So the season has basically had a rough start at this point in all honesty and it carries over to the end for the most part. 



Oh, let's talk about Neko. 

Neko Fujinomiya, the other girl in this story. In season one she arrived as someone who loved Masamune as a kid and still does. Here, her love remains. So she tells Masamune that. Guess who gets rejected? So much for that right? 

Now let's move to the other boy in this story, Gasou. Now he, he is dating Aki under the false pretense he is Masamune. So he's winning correct? Well.....Aki and Masamune (the real one) are getting close anyways. It all comes to a boiling point and after that gets concluded, guess who gets forgotten? So much for that right? Honestly I was happy about this one because Gasou was a terrible terrible character. 

Well I suppose that makes 2 for 2 supporting characters becoming unimportant then. No wait 3 if we include French girl. 5 actually? We can't forget the classmates who were more important in season one and who I haven't even mentioned here yet. If you're noticing the pattern by now, it's that supporting characters get a role then get dropped. Which is a bit of poor writing in my opinion even if they are support characters. 

We do have a survivor though! Yoshino! The maid :) 

 


A twisted ankle isn't the only twist that happened

Throughout the series, I personally thought Yoshino lowkey stole the show. She is always around to help Aki and/or Masamune depending on the time and place and situation. At least surface level, she is a key player. There is a revelation here which I'll include in spoilers as it is a huge plot point, but it is the reason she is the one true support character who breaks the ceiling the other characters are under. 

!Spoiler: It was not Aki but Yoshino disguising herself as Aki when she broke Masamune's heart and called him Pig's Foot. In other words, Yoshino gave the nickname and is the whole reason for Masamune's intended revenge. !

From the very beginning, Yoshino is around. Whether personal or for the well being of others, she pushes the plot forward and at about 3 different times this season she makes the plot progress to where Masamune makes it further into his plan. Basically, without Yoshino, there is no Masamune's revenge. 

But on the other hand, without Yoshino there would be far less twists. 

One thing this season does is employ so many twists that the narrative gets thrown off until it comes back to the original basis again. 

In a nonspoiler manner, without Yoshino we don't get this ending and zero progress towards anything. But with Yoshino we also get such chaos that I didn't even know how to react. 

In a spoiler manner (and huge spoilers ahead)
!Spoiler: Yoshino, after admitting Aki isn't at fault because it was Yoshino who hurt Masamune, encourages Masamune to admit his feelings to Aki. This gets the idea of dating between Aki and Masamune to greatly progress while it also leads to the end of the fake Masamune ploy by Gasou...where it's revealed he is actually a girl. Yoshino also ends up being secretly in love with Masamune which turns out to be a whole 'who will Masamune choose' fiasco as well. Some various other occasions have Yoshino at the front of them but the point is, Yoshino covertly made the season move forward but added such confusion to the mix. !

Either way, it can't be said Yoshino failed to steal the show. 

 


The Ice Queen/Cold Princess melts.

Aki is someone who hates men. Stemming from her childhood where a certain chubby kid left her alone, she dislikes guys. Well actually, maybe she develops a type. Therefore, she dislikes Masamune now. 

That's....pretty much it. She's a little naive and also brutally honest which doesn't change until the near end of the series. I didn't personally mind it but I see why there is disdain for that. 

Masamune in the meantime begins to not feel so revenge focused and it leads into feelings of love. In both cases, the whole reason for revenge begins to become unimportant. And yet.
 


Masamune's plan for revenge....successful?

So if you've noticed, I didn't really have much to say about the season positively. But I also didn't completely dislike it. 

To specify, there were moments that led to bliss. (Fake) dates, confessions, and some of the humor were all fun bits of the season. 

But the grandest part of it all? Masamune had a plan to break the heart of the girl who broke his heart long ago. Did he succeed? 

I will give credit that it all linked together by the end, even if there were some rough patches there. That's about as descriptive as I can be about it. 

If you want spoilers 
!Spoilers: He did succeed. It just didn't turn out to be as direct as we were led to believe. (Not Aki but Yoshino) !

In any case, if you like the show and want to see it through to the end then go ahead and see this season. If you have no interest or disliked the previous season, there isn't enough here to change your mind. 

So long pig's foot!"
18677,"This must be the type of anime you can call: Cliches

The begin was quite a good start, trainee heroes, destined to fight the demon lord and POOF, the demon lord is dead

Now the hero works other job to support his own life but doesn't feels right because that's not what he wants, but when his friends ask, he just make that uncomfortable face like of he talks it out, he's gonna die

Etc, etc, the story now develops to how he has to take care of the demon lord's daughter and deal with her and work his job as the same time because that girl is a pain in the ass

And because she's the demon lord's daughter so she must have a great power that the other bad guys want to exploit and in the end, the hero will come and save her and bring her home and they live happily ever after

For the character: 
Our main hero, who somehow have emotional issue because he can't become a hero who defeats the demon lord

The main girl, aka the demon lord's daughter, a kinda dumb girl who always make a fuss about everything, because every ecchi harem anime needs a dumb girl

The girl who is the mc's colleague, very kind and cute and has big boobs, because every ecchi harem anime needs a kind girl with big boobs

The manager, a very sly and witty character who somehow always know how to solves everything in her way, has big boobs, because every ecchi harem anime needs a sly girl with big boobs

The vice manager, who always complain about the mc, like the manager very much

The straight face girl who seems to doesn't give a shit about anything but actually is a very good person, we don't see this type of character much in ecchi harem anime

The former classmate who is a tsundere, always make a fuss about what the mc is doing, nice body, because every ecchi harem anime needs a tsundere"
7817,"Yamada (No first name given) is a fifteen year old high school student at the top of the food chain. Every girl wants to be her, every boy wants to be with her, and she wants to have sex with 100 guys.

While that may sound like the premise for the most thinly-veiled escapist jerk-off fantasy since Kiss X Sis, Let me make two things perfectly clear: First of all, unlike the two abominable creatures from KXS, Yamada doesn’t live in a world where her behavior is considered normal, or even worse, encouraged. She lives in a world much closer to our own, and the few people who know about her endeavor spend a decent amount of effort trying to advise her and keep her under control.

And second of all, Yamada is all talk. She’s a virgin, and the story clearly acknowledges that she has no idea what sex is, let alone how to get up the nerve to have it. In order to gain experience and overcome her insecurities, she decides that the first step towards carnal domination is to sleep with a boy in her class named Kosuda, because, in her words, he’s a “Plain Jane cherry boy.” Yes, Cherry boy is term they use.

In any case, these two plot elements go a long way in making the character of Yamada not only funny, but 1000 times more likeable than she should be. Her constant efforts to take a step towards losing her virginity are peppered with her complete lack of understanding about common logic or human behavior. She is, in every way, a dog chasing a car, and it is hilarious at nearly every turn.

By the way, did I mention that several characters get an Eros deity? A little chibi wiseman version of themselves that floats on a cloud and gives them comically misleading sex advice that they can’t even hear? Yes, that element could easily become annoying, and probably will for some people, but unlike the narrator from Okami-san, they only appear once in a while, and remain consistently funny when used. You could take them or leave them, but I thought they were great.

Now, if you don’t notice early on from such exquisite phrases as “Totes,” “Cherry boy,” “What the crap,” and “Rocking your V Card,” this is a Jamie Marchi script, and her dialogue has a habit of being a little… Slangy. And while it’s subdued, there is an element of pop culture references as well. To put it bluntly, Yamada randomly blurts out the most inappropriate things, and much like the dub for Panty and Stocking, Marchi’s writing can occasionally reek of ‘trying too hard.’ Thankfully , the actors do a pretty damn good job with it, especially Yamada’s VA. Her voice is supplied by Brittany Karbowski, who’s been rapidly climbing up my favorites list lately. I am convinced that she can deliver any line you put in front of her, no matter how ridiculous or obscene, without losing a single drop of sincerity. She goes a long way towards making this a highly recommendable dub. The other actors do their jobs really well, too… Cherami Leigh does a commendable job going out of her comfort zone to play Yamada’s long suffering best friend/straight man foil Miharu, and the deity actors fill out their roles as well, but Brittany is really the one who makes the script hers.

NAME REDACTED doesn’t have a particularly difficult job, playing a character like Kosuda… He’s bland and ordinary, but compared to most anime male leads, he’s actually rather unique… He reacts to Yamada’s sexually confused insanity the way a normal boy would, rather than just getting freaked out and taking a moral high ground. Although he’s confused about what her advances mean, he’s still receptive to them, although as it turns out, he’s just as nervous and unsure as she is. And thank god, for once, both characters screw things up just as often.

There are a few other elements at play, dealing with Miharu’s boyfriend, Yamada’s younger sister, Kosuda’s childhood friend, Kosuda’s older sister… I’m happy to say they actually ACT like brother and sister… But the main sub-plot deals with Kyoko Kanejo, a rich transfer student and rival for Yamada. Their rivalry in the fields of both beauty and popularity go a long way in highlighting just how shallow these values are, but the most memorable thing about her would be her ‘dark secret…’ And once it’s revealed, it’s a story element that would normally bug the crap out of me were it handled any different. But like Yamada’s ambitions, the fact that she’s completely delusional about it saves her from being wholly unlikeable.

Outside of the opening, the animation honestly isn’t very good. Talking heads prevail, and the animators are not exactly coy about the budget saving tricks they’re using… speed lines for intensity, bouncing images for walking, and so on and so forth. Thankfully, unless there are a bunch of frozen characters in the background, it’s easy to ignore. On the other hand, where the show really shines is with it’s artwork. The backgrounds, while stiff, are highly detailed and vibrantly colored. The character designs are well thought out, very expressive, and easily recognizable.

What really impresses me about this series is it’s dual appeal. For those looking for a gleefully sadistic sex comedy, Yamada’s First is exactly that… The jokes are fast paced, well executed, and rarely ever miss the mark. There’s fan service abound, but it’s rarely ever in bad taste.

For those looking for something a little deeper, this show hasn’t forgotten you, either. It has an almost nostalgic feel to it, as if it were written by someone who wanted to see how an exaggerated, over-the-top version of themselves would have dealt with their own real life experiences. The character development is subtle, as Yamada slowly gets a grasp on the reality of her feelings and hormones, and Kosuda slowly becomes more interesting and likeable as he interacts with her.

I was a little shocked to discover that it was based on a four-panel manga. Normally, you can tell this right off the bat from the story limitations and the pacing of the jokes, but up until I looked it up, I honestly thought it was based on a more traditional style manga. The pacing of the jokes is kind of a dead giveaway, but the story seemed to flow a lot smoother and more seamlessly than similar titles like Kill Me Baby, Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star.

Yamada’s First Time is available from Funimation. You can stream it pretty much anywhere, or just watch it for free on Netflix. I wouldn’t recommend paying full price for it, but if you can find it on sale on Amazon… It’s about 23 dollars for the BR/DVD combo pack at this particular moment… Then you should totes go for it.

All in all, this series works great as a comedy, and just as well as a coming of age story, as it takes an unflinching yet not unforgiving look at the genuine awkwardness of adolescent relationships. It has a few minor hiccups, and we never do find out where Yamada’s thirst for sexual conquest came from, but it’s hard to deride a show that’s this consistently funny and unpredictable. I give Yamada’s First Time a 7/10."
16918,"I’d expect no less than this beautifully crafted story from the writer of Full Metal Alchemist. 

I’m not good at writing reviews but I did feel strongly enough that I wanted to convey a couple thoughts as this story really stuck with me. This has definitely become one of my favorite ""Slice of Life’s"" that I’ve watched so far. Working in the food industry, the content was already very familiar... but even so, it's left me with more compassion towards what I do.

It’s a story that revolves around students attending an agricultural school and learning the ins and outs of farm life. Although at first that may sound a little dull, this show does anything but drag its feet. It serves a perfect balance of comedy and light drama which drives this story forward, filling it with an immense amount of heart. Even if you are unfamiliar or uninterested in what the core of the show is about, the true message deals with the reality and struggles of getting older and just being human in general. In that sense, it's extremely relatable and something that I think everyone can truly benefit from.

Personally, it has helped me gain more insight on how much work is truly done in this industry before it even comes to my hands. It’s highly increased the compassion and respect I already had for the food that we eat… and the animals we eat it from. This would not be an easy show to watch for vegetarians, as it’s very transparent in how the meat industry works. But I will say, if you are at all curious as to its process, this would be a great little watch. It is a graceful approach to what really in the end is a ruthless truth. The trials you watch the MC go through, even though he knows the inevitable outcome, make you think very hard about how you would feel and what you would do in such situations. 

Most of the characters are explored really well, giving you a good sense of depth. You get nice back story on some of the heavy hitters and their families, which really helps you understand them and why they are the way they are. The relationships feel so natural in that it even invites you in, making you feel right at home with them. The only negative aspect that I will mention is that I felt the need for more background on the MC to help understand more of his grievances, but I’m sure that season 2 will dive more into that. 

Although it felt like sometimes the story wandered a bit— it actually makes perfect sense. What this show is really trying to say is that it's okay to not know all the answers and that there's always this never-ending search of what we are all trying to find in the meaning of life and in ourselves. At least that’s what I left with! 

I am so thankful for another season and can’t wait to jump into it when I’m ready. So, if you’re looking for something comical and light-hearted but also for something that will slightly challenge you and your feelings, this is a perfect fit. 

Thanks for listening to what I’m realizing is a less factual and way more personal review! :)"
14829,"This review is all subjective and my own personal opinion. You do not have to agree with it, nor am I asking you to. I hope that this just helps you get an idea of what the anime I am talking about is like and form a basic and general consensus on it. The ratings I give anime and manga are mostly my personal overall enjoyment. Also please note that I will be talking about the Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya series as a whole. I also have not watched this series since about two months ago or so, so my recollection of the series is not perfect. This review will be relatively spoiler free, but I will hide potential spoilers. TL;DR will be at the bottom.

First off, I should give you some idea on what Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya is. Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya is yet another spin off of the widely popular Fate franchise. This anime takes place in an alternative timeline to Fate/Stay Night where the fourth holy grail war does not happen. There are more details I could go into, but for simplicity's sake, I will not in this review. This image here is a timeline of the extended Fate universe, so have a look if you are interested in seeing how Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya fits in the timeline.

Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya starts off fairly, shall I say normal. I have not watched any other Mahou Shoujo anime so I am not sure if this is the norm in the genre. But anyway, it starts off with Illya going about her day, going to school, talking with her friends. You know, the usual. And then, Luviagelita and Rin get into a fight using magical sticks and then said sticks run away, per se. I am being pretty broad here but please bear with me. One of these magical sticks happens to find Illya... whilst she is in the bath of course. This sets the scene for what is Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya.

The overarching plot for the first season is essentially that Illya is tasked by Rin to collect the 'seven legendary class cards', something Fate fans should be well familiar with. She is not the only one searching for these cards though, and Illya has to deal with the many obstacles that come her way. The plot is simple and easy enough to follow, which is a good point of the anime. The other Fate's can get quite complicated at times and can make one really scratch their head at what is going on, but I never felt that too much whilst watching this series in my personal experience. This mostly applies to all of the other seasons and the movie. I will say though, as the series reaches its later seasons (and the movie), the plot becomes more interesting, in my opinion. I never felt too bored by the plot of the series, but it is certainly not the best I have seen. Please note that the movie does take place before the first season, but I would not recommending watching it until you are done with the other seasons.

This anime is full of familiar faces for those well versed in the Fate franchise. The characters in this series are decent, at least the main ones. Illya is not a bad character herself, she is not terribly annoying albeit she is a little naïve. Illya is her usual, cheerful self. Miyu, one of the other main characters, is calm, serious, and collected. She is probably one of my more liked characters in the series. However, Miyu and Illya both shine the most when it comes to their relationship. Their relationship was fascinating to watch, seeing how their friendship, and them, evolved over time. I would say it is one of the better parts of the show. Rin is well... Rin, so if you are a fan of her you will enjoy seeing her here, she is pretty much her usual self I would say. Luviagelita is not bad herself, although she is annoying at times. The supporting characters are not bad, they are not worth going into too much detail for the sake of this review.

The animation gets the job done. The action and fight scenes are animated well, they were fun enough to watch. The animation never felt too off nor poor quality. This was my first time seeing fight scenes in a Mahou Shoujo, and I was not disappointed. It was intriguing to watching Mahou Shoujo fights for the first time. I cannot think of too much else to say.

The opening and credit themes of the series are pretty good, I listen to them from time to time on Spotify. Alas, I cannot remember enough of the anime to know what the music was like in it, so I am unfortunately not able to give a proper review on the music of this series.

So this sounds all good, right? I have just described a decent Fate spin off, with not too many glaring issues thus far. But I cannot finish this review without talking about the most glaring issue I had with Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya. Which is...

Oh boy. I stay away from ecchi anime for a reason. I have not watched many ecchi's and I dislike the genre. But this... this was surely something. Ecchi scenes are abundant throughout the entire series (except the movie, which is part of what makes it great), right from episode one. Remember how at the start I mentioned that one of the magical sticks finds Illya whilst she is in the bath? Yep, it is what I call the start of an ecchi scene. !The cliché moment of someone walking in whilst someone having a bath happens of course... which ruined the viewing experience. This gives you an idea of what is in store.! In fact, pretty much all of the ecchi scenes just ruined the viewing experience and left a bad taste in my mouth. One should keep in mind that most of the main characters are ten-year old's... and yes, they are in the ecchi scenes. It really felt unnecessary to be in the anime, and yet it is there. Sometimes I wonder myself if ten year old's speak the way they do in the anime sometimes, some just make blatant sexual references that feel quite off. I am not sure if it is much different in the manga, but it is pretty bad nevertheless. I felt as though the ecchi scenes were just put in for the sake of fanservice, which I myself am not a fan of. This anime really could have gone without the ecchi scenes, it would have been much better without it. The later seasons do have a little less ecchi, making them more bearable. If you are going to watch Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya, prepare yourself, and hope someone does not walk in during the worst moments.

Some of the seasons get quite filler heavy, I remember this being the case the most with the second part of season two. Some of the episodes just felt really unnecessary, and they were not exactly a joy to watch either. From what I remember, not much development happens in these fillers making them skippable. Another thing to mention is that season two introduces a new antagonist, which I just found to be obnoxious. She does get better as the series goes on, as she appears in the rest of the series.

Is this anime series good? That is the question you have to ask yourself. Opinions can vary greatly, I have come across some that enjoyed the series far more than I did. But to sum up this review:
- Plot is simple and easy enough to understand.
- The main characters are good, especially the relationship between the main two.
- The animation is alright, it gets the job done.
- Music is decent.
- There is so much ecchi in the series, it is unbearable at times. The ecchi is what really brought this anime down for me.
- The series gets better as it goes on.

Would I recommend this anime? If you are a fan of Fate and can get past the ecchi, then I would. Otherwise, I would not other than the movie. There is nothing especially spectacular about Fate/Kaelid Prisma Illya and the ecchi just ruins the experience.

Thank you to those who took the time to read this review. This is my first review so please be understanding of any shortcomings present in it. If you did not like this review, then I apologise for wasting your time."
21769,"As a piece that primarily revolves on the date between Iroha and Hachiman, you don’t get a lot of backstory here, it just drops you in immediately. That does not negate its charm though, we get to see Iroha in her natural element; a forceful, yet sly demeanour that puts full effort into getting Hachiman to really enjoy himself. We don’t have any distractions, it’s one-on-one, as a date should be and provides some very entertaining and memorable results.

From the initial get-go of Hachiman choosing to go to the movies, giving Iroha a movie to watch alone while he enjoys his own and then to meet up afterwards really shows how Hachiman’s mind works. He’s constantly in battle with himself for just a comfortable existence. He’s more than happy to go about doing things on his own than to do so with others. This is in sharp contrast to Iroha’s persona, where she is going out of her way to get attention, to push the boundary between charming and cunning. It really sells their banter to one another, an often crude, blunt and tease ridden relationship.



The ping-pong scene after is one of my favourite scenes in all of anime. It’s the very reason I chose Iroha over both Yukino and Yui as best girl for this series. It’s due in fact of the sheer relentless onslaught of Iroha’s actions of being one step ahead of Hachiman at all times. From distracting him (both deliberately and inadvertently with sleight of hand and choice of clothing respectively) her charm here far extends her screen time in the 2nd season. You really see it first hand here in a more intimate way. She acts genuinely only to him and he’s doing the same with her. It’s just a fresh take on the cliches that we’ve come to know in the genre, let alone the show.

It also wouldn’t be a real episode with Iroha without touching on the on-going gag of her rejecting him at one point. And I can safely say that here, this is by far the best scene she does so in.
>""I’m sorry but you can only do that when hanging out a couple more times.""

Previous outcomes would be her just scoffing at the notion of something happening. At this point, Hachiman’s odd charms might be softening on her. We also get Yui and Yukino’s extreme jealousy when they pose their results to them the next day, another gag that I personally can never get tired of.

The 2nd half of the episode actually revolves around both girls doing the same activities that Hachiman did with Iroha on the following weekend. It’s a fun little montage that serves as a comparison to show how really different all 3 girls are to interacting with Hachiman. Add in continuing gags of Yukino’s lack of bust size and cat and dog contrasting metaphors, and we have another episode that pads ammunition towards which girl will win in the end. The episode ends with a heartfelt photo of the 3 members of the Service club. I wish what was covered here was more than one episode, but even so, the 30 minutes of quality content really shines through. The coyness of Iroha really provides a nice buffer to the tsundere attitude of Yukino and the bubblyness of Yui nicely, and I can safely say this episode cements Iroha as a nice 3rd choice to Hachiman, even if there clearly is an obvious endgame in mind.

I could wholeheartedly say this is a mandatory watch to anyone engulfed with Oregairu already. An OVA that caters to a specific character, but in reality shines light on the differences the 3 mains have with each other as well. If one episode can do that with fantastic pacing and great character development, it's definitely something to not overlook.

110733,"Zombie Land Saga has yet again proven to us that an idol anime can be more than just the music and the dancing. It entails a perfect combination of an enjoyable story and an excellent ensemble of characters. This anime easily creates a compelling narrative that can get anyone hooked on it instantly. The lovable characters always comfortably put a smile on my face, and there's no doubt about that. Every episode contains a plethora of comedic moments, with something new and creative added in each time. This season has decided to take more of a serious edge on things in the story. And that is where Franchouchou's revenge comes into play. 




Let's start from the beginning. Franchouchou's original mission was to save the Saga Prefecture as these zombie idols. After overcoming the difficulties generated by being from different eras in history, their undead zombie bodies allowed them to challenge all the limits of what a typical idol can achieve. But some things are inevitable and cannot be stopped. Everything seemed to be going fine and dandy for these seven idols until a devastating defeat led the girls scrambling for cash to pay off a crucial debt from the disastrous EFS concert.  

Franchouchou was at the height of its glory, yet this one fatal mistake made by Kotaro turned everything upside down. Due to this concert being a failure, the group went into debt, and each member of Franchouchou (including Tae) had to get jobs to provide for themselves. Kotaro would sink into a deep depression because he couldn't stand the failure of the performance. Franchouchou would, later on, make a comeback after performing at a small event. After gaining some confidence, this is where these idols would start making their moves. But once Franchouchou's secret was unconcealed to one person, their plan for revenge wasn't going to go as smoothly as planned. With Saga on the verge of danger, Franchouchou would need to overcome any obstacles that stand in their way. Saga's curse will do everything in its power to stop Franchouchou.

The revenge element plays a huge role in this second season. I mean, it's literally in the title. In the first season, it was all about establishing the characters and getting introduced to each individual. But this season provided us more background information on what this whole project is and the mystery surrounding the plot. Witnessing Franchouchou exact their revenge for Saga is what we needed this season. We also get more character-driven stories throughout the show, all of them being impactful and remarkable in every way. These multiple elements made me want to see what was in store for this show. It's just that great of a season.






Since we already know who these characters are, I'll briefly summarize the essential episodes dedicated to them and give my thoughts. (Bolded if you don’t want summaries)

Kotaro Tatsumi - In this season, Kotaro plays a crucial role in the story. His decision to have Franchouchou perform at the EFS concert led to his depressed state, as he would frequently get drunk because of his careless mistake. He would consistently ignore Sakura whenever she would try to convince him to stop drinking. After his talk with Xu-Fu concerning the girls, he still did not want to give up on them. Time was running out as he needed to do something to save Saga itself. His passionate feelings towards the group gave Franchouchou a second chance. Kotaro properly apologized to the group after what had happened at the EFS concert that year. He was determined to get their revenge at the same concert by advertising campaigns to make sure it would succeed this time. To me, Kotaro completes Franchouchou. Without him, these girls would be distressed if he was not around. Doing their makeup, planning their performances, and giving them advice makes him a perfect manager for this idol group. No one could do an even better job than him.



Lily Hoshikawa - Her plan to accrue even more fame for the group would involve a national TV talent show. She would be competing against her main competitor, Light Oozara, who is also a child actor. Sakura finds out that Light has a plan to win over the audience. Lily is unaffected by this since she is an experienced actor with immense courage. As Light declares that he would not lose his fame when his youth fades, he also intends to have Lily out of the picture as part of the process. When it is his turn to perform in the finals, Lily is surprised to find out that he was singing the same song she was planning to execute. She would then quickly change up her costume and both the lyrics and the music on the fly. Although her efforts were efficient, Lily was still unable to defeat Light. She shows good sportsmanship by congratulating him, but Light feels like he was the one to be defeated. He thinks his skills are not on par with Lily, but she reassures him that he is a successful performer that should chase after his dreams. Lily has been a great addition to Franchouchou. Despite being so young, she acts like an adult with her professional aspects. Her mature nature demonstrates her ability to fit in with the group. Lily's Shrimpy’s iconic personality makes her a very memorable character throughout the series. 



Yuugiri - The show saved her story for the second season, and they did not disappoint with this one. Her backstory goes way back to the year 1881, where she was a legendary courtesan. She meets a clumsy yet courageous person named Kiichi Momozaki. He talks about his vision for a free Saga, a Saga independent of Nagasaki, as he pursues this goal because of his grandfather. Yuugiri admires his dream, but Kiichi's friend, Shojiro Ito, utters that times have changed and that everyone should accept that Saga is gone permanently. Kiichi's grandfather is not doing well, but their plan to petition for the return to Saga moves apace. Kiichi manages to find some new comrades who are also willing to revive Saga, but this raises Yuugiri's suspicions. She later overhears the distrustful comrades discussing a more violent means of retaking Saga and would discuss this with Xu-Fu, the grandfather who isn't healthy. Xu-Fu makes a claim saying he is Saga itself and refused the medicine given by Yuugiri since it won't help. She forces him to take it as it presages Yuugiri's involvement in freeing the prefecture. Shojiro warns her about this revolution that Kiichi unwittingly stirred up, but Yuugiri trusts Kiichi's actions and is willing to assist him. She writes three letters, one to her allies in Nagasaki that will help Kiichi later on, another one to Kiichi himself on instructions to free Saga, and the last one to Xu-Fu to inform him about her actions. Shojiro would massacre the revolutionists, almost killing Kiichi in the process, but Yuugiri would eventually stop him. She would guide Kiichi away to Nagasaki with the letter, telling him to read it when he arrives. Yuugiri's and Shojiro's battle begins, with Shojiro collapsing in the end after being struck by her sword. As he lies dying, he admits that he wanted to see the Saga that Kiichi would save. After his death, Yuugiri takes all the blame for the failed revolution. It resulted in her execution by the military. Kiichi restores Saga, and Xu-Fu is healthy again. Now back to the present, she performs her song with Franchouchou and retires to a private bar. Xu-Fu runs this bar as they discuss the modern era. Yuugiri mentions that she intends to walk her path in Kiichi's new Saga. These episodes were just god-tier. What looked like an uninteresting character in season one became one of the most legendary characters in season two. I'm glad that she's a part of Franchouchou. Her motherly nature towards the girls and her ability to learn very quickly in the group makes her one of the best members. I love how she is particularly collaborative with the group. She doesn't ask any questions and complies with any instructions. She shows concern and acts maturely, as she is intelligent in analyzing every situation.



Junko Konno - After Ai lets Junko take over as a leader, she becomes worried that they weren't making any progress at all because of her. Junko feels useless belittling herself for not knowing how to guide the girls. She questions if Franchouchou would be able to leave a powerful impact on their performance. Sakura reassures her that everything would be fine and that blaming herself wasn't the right thing to do. After Ai and Sakura overheard the conversation between Ai and Shiori, she gets into an argument with Ai asking her if she prefers being in Iron Frill over Franchouchou. She then consults Kotaro about this dilemma but would then be told that she's admitting her worthlessness to the group. Kotaro encourages her to win Ai back by breaking everything in her path and would eventually do so. Junko's calm and collected traits assist Franchouchou, even though she tends to get shy sometimes. Throughout the series, she manages to feel more secure and lends her idol experience to the group.  Her determination to get what she wants gives Franchouchou a path to success, and without her, Ai wouldn't be able to handle the group herself.



Ai Mizuno - In her episode, she warns Franchouchou not to become too confident in their abilities just because they were finding success in the radio show and the performances that they were consistently having. The other members would soon rely on Ai a lot more, as later on, Kotaro would realize that they were dependent on her way too much. He would then sign Ai up for multiple solo gigs as she would then task Junko with leading in her stead. Ai wouldn't be able to perform against Iron Frill because of this. The leader of Iron Frill, Shiori, approaches Ai and asks her to enlist into her group since she thinks Franchouchou isn't well suited for her. Ai and Junko would later get into an argument because of this matter. After Junko regains her confidence in herself, Franchouchou finally performs their show without Ai. After a successful first song, they would, later on, invite Ai to the stage where they would sing as a group this time. Both Ai and Junko would reject Shiori's offer afterward. Ai's determined personality as a former idol constantly grants Franchouchou the experience that they require. Her guidance and the skillset she possesses aid the group in becoming thriving idols. She is the most responsible member in Franchouchou, as she always plans out their training, teaches the basics of the idol business, and speaks the most on how they should approach their shared goal. Ai strives to be constructive but is very kind and supportive of each member.



Saki Nikaidou - She gets an episode that focuses on her connection with White Ryu and how he was her childhood idol back in the day. Kotaro announced that Franchouchou would be participating in a television program to reach a larger audience. They would be collaborating with White Ryu, as Saki is delighted to spend the whole day with her longtime idol. The day ends with White Ryu announcing that he would be discontinuing his radio show. He wanted to hand it over to Franchouchou instead of putting an end to it. Saki was deeply affected by this, as it was thanks to him that she didn't feel alone and lost in Saga. After saying their goodbyes, Saki confesses her feelings for him, but White Ryu reminds her to direct her passion towards those who are lost in Saga, not to him. After he tells her that they'll meet again once she becomes a fully grown woman, Saki realizes that she'll never be able to experience life as an adult since they're zombies that cannot age. Saki would break down into tears, as Sakura would try to comfort her, but would, later on, start crying with her too. Saki has been my favorite character since day one. Her transition from being a badass leader of a biker gang to becoming the leader of an idol group is astonishing. It was emotional to see this courageous and rebellious character crying. This scene undeniably broke my heart. Without Saki, Franchouchou wouldn't be the same. Her great appreciation towards the group is what makes her an outstanding leader.



Sakura Minamoto - She didn't have an episode dedicated to her, but Sakura was still an important character nonetheless. Sakura did her best to convince Kotaro to attend their concert while trying to make their comeback, but this would result in a minor argument. She has always looked up to him as Sakura wanted the old Kotaro back, the one that comforted her and the one that had promised her that he would never leave her. Kotaro would eventually show up and encourage the girls to keep singing for the displeased audience. Sakura was moved by his words, as the new song performed by Franchouchou would finally satisfy the audience. She thanks Kotaro for everything that he has done and for not giving up on Franchouchou. Sakura is a character that has been very unlucky from the beginning. From the constant struggles she faced, she finally managed to find her place within Franchouchou. Sakura is a resilient character that never gives up on her dreams. Even though she has a sweet personality, Sakura, in my opinion, is the strongest out of all of them.



Tae Yamada - If she's legendary, then her episode also deserves to be legendary. It starts with Yuugiri giving Tae the task to buy groceries. She would soon become followed by the investigative journalist Shinta Okoba. After stalking her for quite a while, we see at the grocery store Maria Amabuki, who fills Tae's order for her. She starts talking about her group dance performances and their intentions to become famous. After inviting Tae to a dance event Maria and her group were competing in, we see the chicken mascot Cocco-kun also participate in the event. Tae gets on stage last-minute to challenge the mascot and would become victorious. Tae earns the prize money and offers it to Maria, but she attempts to refuse it. We can see Officer Suenaga intervene as he takes everyone to a jet ski race so that they can spend the prize money on making bets. Tae bets on Maria Higashitsuru and wins tens of millions in yen, just enough to absolve them of their steep debts. Tae is just way too legendary. I honestly don't have anything else to say. (cough cough read Gaiden if you're interested in Tae's backstory)



Other characters like Maimai were also great. I was a little disappointed that she wasn't able to join the group. Being voiced by Kana Hanazawa just made me feel worse. It was nice seeing a potential Franchouchou member participate in one episode, though. I'm glad there's one person outside of Franchouchou that the girls can trust. 






There isn't much to say about the art. It's similar to the first season's art style, so it hasn't changed much. But of course, there are a few touches here and there that make it more visually appealing. I don't know how to explain it, but I found the colors/lighting to be more eye-catching here in comparison to the first season. The beautifully made art for the OP and ED was also welcoming. Everything looked great, but the CG animations for their performances were still okay. It generally doesn't affect the anime itself so no worries on that end. Some performances were better than I expected, so I'll give them props. 

Now for the music. The anime does a fantastic job with the background music and the actual songs from Franchouchou. The sound design was great, and not to mention the character-dedicated music perfectly fits in with each member's personality, as this element also resonates deeply within the plot. Zombie Land Saga has never failed to provide us with the best music. I always find myself listening to the official soundtrack. Everything was flawless in this category, and that's what you would expect from an idol anime. Franchouchou has the ideal voices that a musical group would want. It's all thanks to these extraordinary seiyuus who put in all of their love for these characters.

I can't express how much I adore this series. From the well-established characters and story to the wonderfully produced music and art, it provides you with everything a fan of this series could ever want. We're already three years into Zombie Land Saga. Now that season two has ended, I find myself questioning what I should do with my life. If you're looking for answers just like me, I recommend checking out [Zombie Land Saga Gaiden](https://anilist.co/manga/132552/Zombie-Land-Saga-Gaiden-The-First-Zombie/) if you want more content, as previously mentioned. 

Zombie Land Saga is a must-watch anime for non-idol fans, and I can't stress this enough. If you liked season one, then season two is something that you should consider watching. You won't regret it. Wouldn't you like to witness some zombie idols become legends?



!I realized this was more of a summary, not a review. Oh well, here's Saki to make up for it.

160900,"I’ll be the first to admit I am an inconsistent writer. My life is a constant barrage of new tasks and distractions that keeps me from accomplishing, well, pretty much everything I set my mind to. Things get especially difficult to manage around the holiday season but here I am, back in the game, because over the past 13 or so weeks I’ve been subjected to one of the most indefensibly piss-poor, psychologically agitating pieces of “art” I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Hametsu no Whatever, Who Actually Gives a Shit About the Title of This Garbage is the rare kind of complete and utter disaster that only surfaces once every few years, whenever anime studios have to really start scraping the bottom of the barrel for content. It single-handedly snapped me out of my depressive stupor because of how eye-openingly bad it was. It even inspired me, in a way, to never produce anything on this level of quality, lest I never call myself an artist again in my life. I’ve started writing and illustrating again thanks to Hametsu, and I at least owe it or the author of the webcomic or the staff behind the adaptation a bit of thanks by trying to interpret this work of pure schizophrenia before I inevitably sink back into the oblivion of daily apathy.
Hametsu is an anime where not a single aspect of it is pleasant or inviting. It shocks you in with a bleak, cynical first episode full of rape, slavery, genocide, and just about every one of humanity’s worse vices before shifting gears and psychotically jumping between genres every single episode like an ADHD kid who managed to ingest a red skittle and keeps trying to entertain himself with whatever’s around him. We go from EXTREMELY fucking edgy revenge fantasies where characters unironically say stuff like “I don’t even feel like raping you so I’ll just kill you” that sounds more like an Anal Cunt song title than real dialogue while standing waist-deep in pools of blood rife with faux-philosophical melodrama about how “humanity is…LE BAD”, to corny shoujo shenanigans where the unbearably annoying main girl fawns over the edgelord bishounen MC and gets scared by a spider or something and turns into a chibi while silly comedic music plays. It genuinely feels like a series that was on the brink of getting axed every chapter. At a certain point I should’ve discerned that there was nothing of value on display here and moved on, but it’s hard to look away from a trainwreck.
From the very first episode, Hametsu wants you to know that this is a serious show. The comically evil and petty human emperor genocides every witch on the planet because modern technology has made magic obsolete (the emperor actually says “the fruit of our wisdom, the smartphone” is superior to fucking magic that can level cities) and sexually assaults Adonis’ mentor/love interest in front of him before shooting her in the head while thousands of people salivate like animals. Adonis is then placed into stasis (for some reason, they never really explain this brilliant little moment of bad writing) to let his hatred marinate for a few years until he’s ready to kill his way to the emperor. Want to understand the complex mechanisms at play that led to all of this happening? It’s simple, really. The queen is actually a time-traveling witch who has the power to mind control everyone on earth except for other witches, who are all female and reproduce asexually using a magic tree on the moon, and the other female MC is a reincarnation of her from the future who has the same magic power as her or something according to the author Yoruhashi’s previous work (which is untranslated so I’m doing my best to try and interpret it using what meager Japanese I know) so she decides to mind control the king and everyone under her rule into hating witches so she can wipe them all out and end any competition to her reign, and also the anti-witch technology is giving everyone super cancer.
Got all that? Good, because after Pinkshit (I’m not even going to dignify this character by calling her by name, you’ll learn why later) manages to execute a prison break by stealing the controls from a wildly out of place caricature of a transsexual, Adonis breaks out and decides that instead of killing the emperor, he’d rather cause 9/11 2 and gun down thousands of innocent people (children included) onscreen because they’re guilty by association. From there, the show descends into misery porn and over the top wangst for the next 5 or so episodes. They go to the moon, all the witches want to revive Adonis’ mentor and kill him, he summons the humans to kill them instead and revives Pinkshit (an annoying nag he’s known for all of a day), kills a guy named Yamato who wants to fuck his sister or something, burns down the magic witch tree and leaves. Is this Alpha Male behavior or blatant stupidity? Also, remember the king? The queen brainwashes him into an heroing by throwing himself off a building because he got super cancer from the anti-witch technology. He’s not important after all. What is important, however, is her becoming an Idol of all things, because it wouldn’t be a product of the absolute dregs of the anime industry in 2023 without idolshit being forced in even when it makes zero sense in-universe. Now the two are suddenly back on earth and the show takes a few episodes to devolve into a bunch of thinly-connected shoujo-lite moments where Pinkshit and Adonis are radically different characters out of nowhere and there’s an unfunny quip or silly moment every 5 seconds. 
This is where the series’ two main issues become clear as day; firstly, it can’t commit to anything. The tone shifts around with little restraint in between episodes, sometimes multiple times within the span of 2 minutes. It introduces a dozen new characters every single episode and either kills them off before they can meaningfully grow or develop or blatantly writes them out of the story once the writer gets bored of whatever subplot they spawned from. Even Adonis’ revenge plot gets phased out halfway through the fucking anime. This is not how you write a compelling story; this is a teenager’s emotionally charged fanfiction you’d read on LiveJournal in 2006 where every character is based on someone from their high school.
The second glaring issue of Hametsu is how unlikeable each and every character is. I don’t think Adonis requires or deserves an in-depth explanation; he’s a one-dimensional perpetually emo dipshit with zero critical thinking skills who can’t even seem to remember his own motivation. He gets his ass kicked in every single fight and only manages to win because of his tremendous plot armor. No one ever refutes his insane rhetoric outside the other worst character, Pinkshit, who is honest to God one of the most insufferable characters ever written. She is a walking woman moment; nearly every single line of dialogue from her is her whining and crying about how Adonis shouldn’t kill the enemy combatants who are literally trying to murder and/or enslave the both of them and their entire race at any given moment. She doesn’t shed any tears for the innocent people Adonis slaughtered earlier in the show, but she’s more than willing to slap him in the face and bitch him out for defending her from the never-ending onslaught of armed soldiers and cyborgs who want nothing more than to see them hanging and literally killed off the last members of her entire fucking race a few minutes ago. Pinkshit’s even more out of touch with reality than the guy who wants to commit mass murder, and she’s supposed to be the moral high ground of the anime. Every 5 seconds she’s whining about how “we can all still live in peace!” like a braindead hippie who reduces every single complex human thought process down to the simplest possible rationalization. Sure, she may have a point, this conflict is only arbitrary and would’ve been avoided altogether if anyone in this setting wasn’t staggeringly retarded, but just because every character is a slave to their own emotions perpetuating a totally pointless and dumb as fuck battle doesn’t mean we need a character pointing out what’s already obvious every single minute they’re onscreen as if that isn’t the most annoying thing a writer can do. I’m not sure if Pinkshit’s intentionally written to be out of touch because you can never be sure of anything with this show, but if she is it shows the author has only an incredibly shallow and cursory grasp on the concept of pacifism. Writing a character who is both naïve and likeable is admittedly difficult, and Yoruhashi decides to forgo that entirely by writing Pinkshit to be so comically stupid and braindead that any sense of likeability is automatically thrown out the window whenever she opens her hole. The only thing she really excels at is rabidly simping for Adonis and taking the brunt of his abuse, because pandering to the “I can fix him!” crowd is a guaranteed way to print money. 
Meanwhile, every other character in Hametsu is some kind of raving degenerate with no moral compass or a weird sex pervert. They’re all shallow, one-dimensional psychopaths. As a matter of fact I couldn’t tell you any of their names, but I can tell you what atrocities they engage in, because every character in Hametsu would feel right at home in the Dirlewanger Brigade. And the more savagery and inhumanity gets thrown in your face, the cheaper and emptier it starts to feel. There is no moral gray area here outside of Adonis; everything is presented in extremes. In Hametsu, you are either a good guy or a remorseless monster who will gladly inflict any type of suffering onto whoever you can when it’s convenient. The only in-between is Adonis, whose mass-murdering behavior gets portrayed more like a he’s just a tortured bad boy making a few mistakes rather than a victim warped into a mass murderer by his circumstances. He has no depth. If the story even bothered trying to explore his thought process and rather than trying to gloss over his atrocities, there’d be at least some semblance of humanity to him. But then his previously defined personality gets thrown out because Pinkshit’s intolerable idealism starts rubbing off on him. At the end of the day the only character I can say I thoroughly enjoyed watching onscreen was Shirousagi, the white guy with dreads and an absolutely baller hat who beats Adonis so hard he looks like he’s about to cry and gouges out Pinkshit’s eyes onscreen. What a Chad. He is exactly what he’s presented as, and in his case that’s alright because he’s a stone cold badass and the closest I came to actually rooting for a character in this entire anime. Hametsu is probably the only anime where a guy who looks like Brian Welch rips out a Mori Calliope clone’s eyes and then crushes them, so at the very least you can’t call it unoriginal.
You’d think I’d at least have something good to say about Hametsu after I spent nearly 2000 words railing on it harder than a Thailand ladyboy, maybe some words of praise for the production quality of the anime? Woefully, there is none. Yokohama Animation Lab is just about the very bottom rung in the anime studio society; almost every project of theirs is rated a 6 or below on here, and that’s probably not an accurate gauge considering how many users wantonly hand out 10s to every anime they watch. The opening animation is probably where 99% of the show’s budget went, and if I’m being truthful it’s not that bad. The song (Kieru Made by Hana Hope) is far too pretty and refined for a show like this. It almost feels dishonest; I was expecting something more like Musashi Gundoh’s infamously deranged opening, that’s a clear and present indication of exactly what you’re about to watch, but Hametsu’s opening feels like it belongs to a much more refutable anime. And on that note, I can’t bring myself to praise its extremely shitty animation and presentation. I’m not sure what I expected considering the source material was almost entirely unknown outside Japan before the anime was announced, but this anime treats drag and drop animation like a fucking Olympic sport. Every fight is a slideshow where off-model characters slowly move across still frames and jitter around. There’s a scene in episode 11 where Pinkshit drops to the ground that’s utterly weightless, and she looks completely stiff. This scene was so ridiculous looking I had to pause the episode and get a drink to steel myself into finishing it. The anime was directed by School Days director Keitarou Motonaga, a guy who is infamous in this day and age for fundamentally not understanding the source material of the projects he directs (see: Digimon Adventure tri, an incredibly pretentious borderline fanfiction-tier movie series that almost killed the franchise in terms of animated projects). 
Hametsu is a show I can’t fathom anyone taking seriously, even the people behind it. The part of my mind that’s still trying to comprehend why this even exists can only rationalize it as being some kind of avant-garde parodic work. It is one of the few anime I’ve seen that goes from comically overblown edge and misanthropy to goofy preschool humor within the span of a minute every single episode. There’s a scene in episode 3 or so where Adonis brutally kills a bunch of soldiers onscreen and within 20 seconds or so it cuts to one of the villain generals chibified and dancing around while making stupid noises. That’s basically the thesis statement of this anime. Either nobody had any idea what they were doing behind the scenes, or they knew exactly what they were doing and none of us are intelligent enough to grasp this kind of cutting-edge satire.
Either way, tl;dr:"
101361,"[Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger](https://anilist.co/anime/101361/Tenrou-Sirius-the-Jaeger/) is a work that perfectly embodies the words ''It works but could do better''.

It's production and conceptualization was helmed by [Masahiro Ando](https://anilist.co/staff/101518/Masahiro-Ando), better known as the director of the widely known animated movie - [Sword of The Stranger](https://anilist.co/anime/2418/Stranger-Mukoh-Hadan/).
And his brand of cinematography and overall flow is apparent in every aspect of the show.

The premise of the show isn't anything that has never been seen before or exceptionally original, it's the unique execution that makes it stand out, the atmosphere and the creative psuedo-victorian take on Japan that looks extremely pleasing to the eye. Though that's as far as the setting goes, it doesn't really play any major role in the overall plot and the show could easily take place at any other setting without losing anything.

The story revolves around Yuliy - a member of a secret organization called the '""Jaegers"" and their goal to hunt the vampires which aligns perfectly with his interests since he has a personal agenda against the blood suckers due to a traumatic experience in his childhood.

The plot itself is extremely wavy in terms of quality - at points it can become gripping and sometimes it's paced poorly resulting in janky progression.
For a vampire story, the vampires besides the deuteragonist of the show - Mikhail, the big brother of Yuliy are left largely unexplored and while there is a valid motive for their actions, it never really comes across as most of them are just following the guide book on how to be a generic ""Muahahaha I'll kill you""  villain.
And that doesn't apply to only the vampires, as the rest of the Jaegers bar Willard  are just as neglected beyond their initial moments. A large chunk of the supporting cast is literally there so the show has more characters, even though they contribute almost nothing to the plot.
The show mainly plays with the dynamic between Yuliy and his brother, and to a degree with his father/son relationship with Willard which had great potential but the show's tight runtime left us scarce on actual character building or flashbacks to get us to know and care about their connection.

Putting aside the story, it's the visuals that take the cake in the case of Sirius, the animation is phenomenal, fluid, with proper easing and flow and the show doesn't lose even the slightest bit of consistency in detail when they go for sakuga (high-budget, full frame animation) scenes, which is usually the case for many other anime.
The action scenes are choreographed akin to a martial arts movie and are just beautiful to look at, they're made all the more impactful due to the great use of particle effects and proper timing when it came to playing tracks from the OST.

The character designs are also great and pretty memorable, designed by the one and only [Kinu Nishimura](https://anilist.co/staff/126425/Kinu-Nishimura), famous for being one of the most major illustrators for the majority of Capcom's fighting games back in the 90s.
She's a primary artist for Street Fighter 2, 3 and 4 and is involved with the Capcom VS SNK games as one of 2 primary artists, as well as the Darkstalkers series.
So now you know the reason as to why the characters look so unique and cool.

The sound design is stellar, with fantastic use of sound effects and a good soundtrack which consists of a lot of epic songs that will get you pumped in the given moment. Their memorability is questionable but they're a good listen nonetheless.

Overall, the world of Sirius delivers a compact story with tons of great action but it does fall short in more than a few aspects and it could've been so much more. Here's hoping that there's a sequel one day, given the possibilities it's world has it would be a shame not to double down on it.
I do recommend watching the show, if not for the interesting dynamic between Yuliy and Mikhail then for the amazing action and animation from Masahiro Ando's creative mind."
20047,"Cute girls kissing and not much else. For some people, I guess that's enough.



When this anime first came out, I was extremely excited. Being a fan of yuri and not having many good animes to satisfy, Sakura Trick seemed like the first real big anime for the genre. Hoping for a fully fleshed out story with yuri seemed like a stretch, and sadly we did not get that here, but it seemed to make up for it in other aspects. 


We follow Haruka and Yuu's story, how they handle their attraction to one another both emotionally and physically (mostly physically), and how they try and hide their relationship from their friends (which there's no point to since everyone is kind of gay here). They are very sure about their feelings for one another, no subtext here. They make this clear through dialogue and numerous romantic scenes, and if you're a sucker like me it really does make you feel a little fuzzy inside.



Althought it's really sweet, silly and maybe a little ridiculous at times, it never truly goes ""anywhere"". Typical slice of life but with lesbians. Very cutesy OST, some of the tunes got stuck in my head. Most characters are likeable but the show focuses on Haruka and Yuu, so don't worry, if you like those two they'll be stealing the spotlight most of the time. It's got goofy moments, heartwarming moments, wtf moments and hot moments, the whole shebang.

I'd say some of the scenes have rewatch quality, but overall, it's just a sweet anime you'll probably want to try at least once. 

However, if the first two episodes don't interest you, the rest won't. The show lets you know what it's about right from the start.

Pros:
Pretty art-style
Good, cutesy music
Cute girls
Kissing
Cute girls kissing (eachother!)

Cons:
As it's a slice of life, nothing major happens
Things can seem repetitive at times



My bias score: 7.5/10
Otherwise: 6/10

For a yuri anime, it's one of the best. Definitely something I recommend to a yuri fan."
416,"I was surprised to find this film had no reviews. Porco Rosso (1992) is a funny, wistful story about flight, war, and idealism, all soaking in this cosy bath of nostalgia. Go watch it! It’s Miyazaki’s birthday today, you know. This might just be his most characteristic movie, featuring the grand sweep of flying, anti-war sentiments, working women, and pig metamorphosis (kinda weird that it happened twice). I suppose all it is lacking is a dash of environmentalism. 

What it is not lacking is planes. Miyazaki loves those things. Possibly a bit too much. The flying, the planning, the building, the crashing and burning—within his long list of plane-related work, Porco Rosso pulls this stuff off the best, and is certainly worth a watch even if the subject matter (anthropomorphic grumpy plane pig) doesn’t light up the sky for you. I enjoyed it a lot more than 2013’s The Wind Rises, which insists on telling a long, self-indulgent biography of plane-maker-war-criminal Jiro Horikoshi and kind of forgets that the majority of us do not care about airborne hunks of metal. 

Porco Rosso is plenty indulgent itself, described by Miyazaki as “idiosyncratic” in a way he doesn’t believe films should be. He whipped the movie up as a promotional short for a goddamn airline (dream come true for the guy), and he based it off his plane-centric manga called The Age of the Flying Boat (1988) that acts as a campy tribute to aviation. Due to certain real-world events, though, things had to change (more on this later). 

img()

Porco is not your typical Ghibli protagonist. He's a chauvinistic, lazy, jaded pig. He was a heroic French pilot in World War I, but after becoming disillusioned with the country he fought for, he set off on his own. We're introduced to him living a cruisy life as a freelance bounty hunter, reprimanding sky pirates in the idyllic Adriatic Sea before sliding into the smoky Hotel Adriano where he sits down, lights a smoke and just looks very, very cool.  Naturally, Miyazaki creates a stellar tourism ad for the area. 

On the surface, the movie is an airborne romp. A love letter to early aviation, sure, but one that is instantly enjoyable and accessible to those of us that did not grow up in a literal plane factory. The central plotline (extracted from the source material) follows Porco's rivalry with this American caricature named Donald Curtis, and it's consistently (consistently!) hilarious. Whether it's Porco's dry wit, Curtis' campy stupidity, or the delightfully funny minor characters, the laughs persist throughout.

But Porco Rosso is a lot more than that. While Miyazaki and the gang were putting together their fun little airline short film, they were blindsided by the Yugoslavian ethnic war. This news would echo into the movie.

img()

Miyazaki is not just a giant plane nerd. He's a romanticist. A pacifist. An environmentalist. A Marxist. A feminist! He is all manner of good -ists in the world. Spectating the collapse of Yugoslavia's socialist state broke something inside the beloved filmmaker, and he ended up channelling these feelings into his work. How can you live when it seems like the world is going backwards? How can you reconcile that awful feeling of being disillusioned by humanity? To varying degrees of visibility, I feel all Miyazaki movies reckon with these questions. 

Porco Rosso puts forth an answer. Become a pig! Say goodbye to your humanity and lapse into misanthropy. It's a bit pathetic, but can you really blame Porco? As I've hinted at throughout this review, this is a funny movie with a sunken heart. Beneath the bright colours and witty gags exists a tragic backstory: Porco lost all his friends in a war that amounted to nothing. The country he fought for no longer represents his injured ideals. Better a pig than fascist. Better a pig than a human. 

If you haven't realised, Porco is not-so-subtly Miyazaki. I don't think it's any coincidence that the filmmaker selected a pig as his alter-ego—he always seemed to like them. And, against all odds, it makes perfect sense in the movie. I never once questioned why Porco was a pig, as it just kind of came into focus over time. The benefit of animation, of course, is that the medium can pull this fantastic animal nonsense off so seamlessly. 

As such, I actually dislike Miyazaki’s flaccid attempt to link some type of supernatural “curse” to Porco's pig form. That wasn't necessary.  I get that he likes his curses, but we understand why Porco is a pig. It just works, and the implied magic only serves to complicate things. 

img()

Anyway, meet Fio! Miyazaki ain't no pessimist, so he cooks up one of his signature girls to breathe life into his stinky pig of a man. Fio is this hard-working, passionate girl who builds Porco a plane and comes along with him. In addition to being a strong, likeable character in her own right, she does so much for this movie, ultimately leading Porco back to his humanity. There's the idea that, if people like this are the future, said future might not be so doomed after all. 

 I will say that, much like in Castle in the Sky (1986), the teenage heroine is at several points presented as honey on a stick for a conglomerate of thugs who thirst over her throughout the movie. Bit iffy. Her relationship with Porco, at least, is a joy to watch. Save for a few scenes...

She's not the only great character populating this film. The movie gives us Gina, who was not present in the source material. She is unfairly cool. Every man in the Adriatic Sea appears madly in love with her, and unlike with Fio, I totally get it. Her singing and general vibe are almost solely responsible for the mature, nostalgic feel of this film. I just wish she had a bit more screentime. Being such an important part of Porco's past, present, and prospective future, she lacked just one or two scenes. 

Even random, no name characters—like the sky pirates, the schoolgirls they abduct, or the old engineer women—are packed full of joy. Miyazaki writes with such care. It's the little things, you know? He does the little things well. 

img()

It goes without saying that this movie is gorgeous to look at. It's spectacle after spectacle. I’m not going to pretend that I know all that much about direction, but it's there to gush about if you have the right vocabulary. Miyazaki is as good as they say and then some.

Joe Hisaishi is also here, as he tends to be. This isn’t my absolute favourite soundtrack of his, but you know what? It's subtle. It fits. This whole movie just fits together very well, Hisaishi's ""Bygone Days"" lapping at the shore all the while. 

And the dub is great! Well, one of them. Turns out Japan Airlines took it upon themselves to make an English dub of their own, and I'm honestly quite curious how it turned out. I can't imagine it being better than the dub I watched (the main dub, I imagine?) which was stacked with great casting calls. I found it a lot funnier than the raw audio, but my poor Japanese could have had something to do with that. 

img()

Porco Rosso doesn’t overstay it's welcome. It actually holds back a bit. Brevity is the soul of wit, they say, and this is a very witty movie. A grand, pig-reversing ending just wouldn't fit, you know? Some things can't be resolved so easily. 

I did think the film wrapped up a little quickly, even if I liked the general hopeful-but-still-ambiguous note we left off on. Miyazaki leaves his audience longing for more; and I think he feels the same way after leaving so much unsaid. By all accounts, this was a passionate, unplanned movie constructed in an entirely different way to his previous work. He was anxious that it wouldn't work out, and then stunned that it became (at the time) his most popular film overseas. 

He's even expressed interest in creating a sequel! It won't ever happen, of course. In his own words, ""my heart couldn't take it."""

〈 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘂𝗻... 〉

As silly and goofy as it may sound, I have never been able to get along with history, astronomy, and other so-called serious, deep subjects. Either my teeny-weeny brain does things differently, or I just have a natural gift for excelling at things nobody really gives a damn about—it is hard to say. Whatever the case, no matter how desperately I tried, I could never seem to memorise momentous historical events or make sense of the mind-boggling laws of the cosmos. That being said, in spite of these problems, the older I got, the more these topics started to pull me in like a black hole. There is something irresistibly wonderful about them—something that makes them worth studying. Sure, I still have trouble recalling even the most basic of facts, events, or natural phenomena, but I do my best to stay mindful of the incredible forces that have created, shaped and governed our cheeky little planet for aeons.

So, when Orb: On the Movements of the Earth began airing, I was hooked from the get-go. A historical fiction set in an alternate version of [my homeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland), tackling one of the most fascinating turning points in human understanding—the rise and development of [heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism)? Say no more and count me in. Week after week, I found myself glued to the screen like a doe-eyed toddler, eager and hungry to see what the show had in store for me. While I had my reservations at first, the more I watched, the more I realised that this anime was not just extremely gripping, moving, and chock-full of delicious food for thought—it was a passion project and a labour of love filled with intense passion, insane talent, an intimate appreciation for the world we live in. It took me a while to admit it to myself, but Orb was everything I could have asked for in a historical drama; it was tailor-made for me. And once that clicked in my brain, I fell head over heels in love with it—utterly and absolutely.

Before I attempt to break down what makes this series the astonishing masterpiece that it is (without spoilers, naturally), there is something that needs to be said out loud—something obvious, yet not immediately apparent to everyone: Orb is by no means a historically accurate tale, and you do not have to be a history buff or a born-and-bred Pole to notice the multiple inaccuracies peppered throughout the story. Things like characters wielding [weapons that did not exist in the 15th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapier), American date format appearing in a notebook, letters and book covers written in Polish that, more often than not, read like they were run through an awful translation tool, [the Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChristianChurch) being an unforgivable evil entity that loved indiscriminately burning people at the stake as if it were their hobby ([it did happen, but not to such an extent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WitchtrialsinPoland)), inquisitors making use of [anachronistic torture devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearofanguish), and scientific breakthroughs being either simplified or streamlined—these things might raise an eyebrow or two, but they are not in any way, shape or form detrimental to the watching experience. Orb was never meant to be a squeaky-clean history lesson or a perfect recreation of [the Copernican Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CopernicanRevolution), which took place a century later.



No... at the core, Orb is an anime about something far grander and more intangible, something you cannot exactly pin down with dates, facts, or timelines—it is about life. Throughout those twenty-five episodes, we witness both the beauty and the ugliness of humanity, the highs and the lows of a bygone era. Though dramatised and exaggerated for the sake of creating a compelling narrative full of thrill and excitement, the Kingdom of P, the events that transpire within its borders, and its people are a sobering reflection and a sad reminder of the struggles that have defined and moulded our species for centuries. And it is precisely because of its divine-like writing and devilish originality that Orb does not merely stand out from the crowd—it lingers, burrows its robust, thick claws deep into your flesh, refuses to let go, and forces you to ponder and reflect on the world around you.

And make no mistake—this world is a brutal, unforgiving place. Orb is one of those exceedingly rare anime that take place outside of Japan, let alone in an epoch of knights, peasants, swords and arrows. But unlike the cold, harsh landscapes of the northern parts of Europe, we see in [Vinland Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/101348/Vinland-Saga/)—a comparison that gets thrown around a lot—this story takes place in a fictionalised version of Poland. The real place, after [its Baptism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChristianizationofPoland), gradually became a deeply religious yet unusually open-minded nation, where faith and science coexisted in harmony rather than constantly clashed. Plenty of scholars were connected to the Church—[Copernicus himself was a Catholic canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NicolausCopernicus)—and intellectual pursuits were not automatically perceived as heretical acts of defiance. But in the Kingdom of P, everything is turned upside down. Here, gossipy whispers travel farther than stern shouts, and the stars above are less terrifying than the men who claim the ground beneath their feet is the centre of the universe. Science and faith are no longer two sides of the same coin; they are sworn, fierce enemies. Thus, when an idea begins to take shape—an idea that challenges the very fabric of religious dogma—the balance of society is thrown into question and seemingly at risk. And so begins a long, strenuous process of unmasking the truth, making the blind see, and turning the deaf into listeners; it is time to inform the masses about the movements of the Earth.

As the story is broken up into three (four if you count the wholly distinctive epilogue) pieces, throughout the journey, we meet, befriend and follow multiple protagonists—[brilliant minds](https://anilist.co/character/279998/Jolenta), [idealists](https://anilist.co/character/280001/Rafa), [sceptics turned believers](https://anilist.co/character/280002/Oczy), [even men of the cloth](https://anilist.co/character/279999/Badeni)—each of whom has their life turned upside down beyond recognition by the falsely dreaded ""heresy"" of heliocentrism. Their personalities, ambitions, backgrounds, circumstances, and worldviews could not be more different, yet they, one by one, fall victim to the system that refuses to loosen its ironclad grip. Their voices are silenced, their names erased from history, their lives forgotten to time, yet the one force that binds them all—the idea that, in a way, is the real protagonist of the story—cannot be executed, outlawed, or burned to ash. With every thwarted breakthrough, each passing of the colloquial torch, heliocentrism's potency seems to flicker, fade and dim... only for another one of its champions to step forward and reignite the flame. Truth is like fire—it spreads. Just as a flame is sustained by fuel, heliocentrism is carried and maintained by those willing to suffer and sacrifice themselves in its name. But these folks are neither mere mouthpieces and vessels for this scientific insurrection nor straightforward cogs in the metaphorical machine of change and advancement. They are authentic, flawed, and relatable individuals you grow attached to, whose lives you cherish, whose outlooks you admire, whose victories you celebrate, and whose suffering you agonise over. They have their own lives to live, dreams to chase, burdens to bear, battles to fight, tales to tell, and missions to carry. And it is the process of watching them expand their wisdom, reach groundbreaking conclusions, perfect a theory that could change everything, and piece together the truth that I find to be nothing short of spellbinding.

In the same vein, [the antagonists](https://anilist.co/character/279996/Nowak) are more than just harrowing boogeymen or faceless oppressors. To them, this is not enlightenment but destruction. Heliocentrism is a direct attack on order, stability, and the power structures that have kept the world in check for centuries. However, in spite of their apparent cruelty, they are not cartoonish, one-dimensional bad guys twirling their dapper moustaches from morning till dawn. Whether we like it or not, they are mere human beings, just like the heroes we root for and cheer on. The lower ranks of the Church and the inquisitors are driven by blind faith, by righteousness so intoxicating it leaves no room for doubt or negotiations—they truly believe that knowledge of this magnitude can do more harm than good. On the other hand, the shrewd figures at the top recognise that controlling knowledge is as crucial as controlling faith; it is about maintaining authority by any means necessary. These men carrying out God's supposed ""will"" simply embody the nastiest, most abhorrent side of humanity in a way that feels all too real and terrifying. There are no caricatures or black-and-white morality here—only the beauty of knowledge and the brutality of oppression locked in a battle as old as time itself.



As you have probably gathered by now, the clash between scientific discoveries and religious doctrine is the most glaring and immediate conflict in the series, essentially fueling and serving as the foundation of every major and minor event and happening. To acknowledge and recognise a heliocentric universe as the true and correct one is to undo centuries of belief, dismantle authority, and throw divine order into disarray. In this world, the only truth allowed to exist and thrive is God's will, and those who claim to be His messengers and speak on His behalf have the final say in every matter and debate. And yet, for all the horrible and horrifying deeds committed in the Church's name by its avatars, faith itself is never presented as wicked, malicious or the natural enemy of free will. Belief, for many, is a source of strength and meaning, the same way knowledge and research are a source of enlightenment and reason. Nevertheless, the real tragedy comes from the moments when these two forces collide and clash since, within the Kingdom of P, they cannot peacefully coexist, no matter how much they could or should.

That is, unfortunately, how human nature is—limited, stubborn, and often resistant to change. Revolutionary concepts or discoveries like the titular theory compel us to question, second-guess, and rethink everything we thought we knew about the universe, how it operates, and our place in it, and that kind of realisation can be exceptionally tough to swallow and process. In a way, knowledge in Orb is a liberating though disruptive force that reshapes, transmutes, and even, in a convoluted manner, destroys. If the Earth is not at the centre of the universe, if everything revolves around the Sun and not our funky space rock, what does that say about us? Does that mean we are not special, not chosen, not divinely placed by the Creator at the very heart of His creation? Are we, when all is said and done, nothing more than a tiny pebble on an enormous, boundless cosmic roadway? Knowledge, in other words, is never neutral. Yes, it is freeing, yet it can be just as crushing. In the right hands, it is a tool that uplifts, supports, and opens the door to a better, brighter future—in the wrong ones, it is a deadly weapon, a set of aching shackles, or a closely guarded secret only a select few can see. And although truth must always be pursued regardless of the price, is it entirely wrong to want to control how it is introduced and how it evolves, to safeguard society from chaos?

But then again, the truth is never set in stone. What is considered heresy or factually incorrect in one era becomes common sense in the next. Theories and ideas that once shook the foundation of civilisation and posed an actual threat to the status quo eventually became its concrete cornerstone. The march of progress is like a never-ending book, each discovery a new chapter, and our interpretation and utilisation of its content always shifting, never absolute. The past and the future are in constant dialogue, and the heart of the cycle of discovery and innovation never truly slows down or stops beating altogether. Meanwhile, the universe continues to operate on its own terms, wholly indifferent to human belief or opinion—yet we, time and time again, insist on shaping it to fit our worldview. The main characters' desire to align human knowledge and understanding of the world around them with reality, while their opponents seek to bend reality to their will so that it fits human beliefs. This constant strife between nature and humanity far exceeds the realms of religion or science, for it practically pervades every facet of life, which is why courage and sacrifice mean so, so very much. Every character—whether they be a scholar, a commoner or a mere child—must weigh their convictions against the very real and fatal consequences of standing by them and their actions. Is your cause worth dying for? Is it worth suffering for, even if you will never see the world you envision and dream of? Are your goals and ideals really worth the ultimate price?

And yet, despite these painful, dreadful questions looming over their heads, these remarkable figures press on. They choose willingly to give up everything for what they believe in, only to be swept away by time, erased from collective memory and scrubbed out from the inexhaustible pages of time. But that is the uncompromising, ruthless temperament of our reality—innumerable untold visionaries and pioneers are persecuted, condemned, or even executed for their life's work, and their findings are either eternally entombed or attributed to someone else. And still, they stubbornly and proudly refuse to lose hope and spirit. They push through the despair, confidently believing that something—anything at all—of what is being left behind will precipitate change, no matter how small. But what is legacy really about? Is it about being vividly remembered, or is it more a matter of making a palpable impact? These individuals never get to experience and relish the fruit of their labour, yet they keep the torch lit, which time hardly acknowledges or takes any cognisance of.

This is why, in the end, what I said at the start of this review holds true—this tale is so much bigger than science, history, religion or even individualism. It is about the tragic yet awe-inspiring human drive to understand, learn, advance, and move forward. It is about staring into the gaping, terrifying maw of the unknown and choosing to venture into the depths to chase after the answers to life's mysteries and reach the truth. And within that valiant search, that heroic quest is both magnificence and ruin, revelation and repression, enlightenment and oppression, and humanity continues to keep its collective head high and march on as it always has done.



Alright, enough of that. It is time to stop stargazing and bring our feet back to solid ground—we need to talk about the audiovisuals.

First things first: Orb's soundtrack is a bloody phenomenal project. [Kensuke Ushio](https://anilist.co/staff/119254/Kensuke-Ushio) is my favourite anime composer, and every time his name pops up in the credits, I know—without a shadow of a doubt—that, at the very least, the music will be top-tier, even if everything else shits the bed. Naturally, the same applies here. The more subdued, sombre tracks work hand in hand with silence to produce a sense of serenity and respite. At the same time, the faster, more dynamic pieces that accompany skirmishes or tense confrontations send a shiver down your spine and fill you with excitement and awe. Finally, the compositions reserved for some of the most pivotal moments of the show not only feel out-of-this-world but also fully sell the importance and exquisiteness of the events transpiring on the screen. In sum, every single track fits its assigned scene like a glove and infuses said moment with so much personality, verve, and grandeur that it is impossible not to get a horde of goosebumps crawling up your arms.

And then there are the openings and the endings, which I love even more. [Yorushika](https://anilist.co/staff/154702/Yorushika)'s ""[Aporia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTFysCtF6g)"" and ""[Hebi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0QFJTvOLM)"" work wonders as the perfect farewell to each episode—they are delicate and gentle-sounding and neatly symbolise both the eerie calm before the storm and the invigorating energy of every development. However, when it comes to the anime's music, nothing comes even remotely close to [Sakanaction](https://anilist.co/staff/343312/Sakanaction)'s ""[Kaiju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukYEgbe2QPw)"" in terms of poignancy, replayability, and sheer magnificence. At this point, I have listened to it probably hundreds—if not thousands—of times, and it consistently makes my throat tighten and my eyes well up. It knows exactly where to hit you to land that emotional sucker punch, and it hits you hard. It fills you with this indescribable feeling of longing and sentimentality, while, at the same time, verbalising the heart and soul of Orb and its vivid reverence for the planet, the stars, and us. Whenever I am feeling down or hopeful, I know this song will be there for me, ready to make me feel what I need to feel.

Unfortunately, when it comes to visuals, I do have a tiny, little bone to pick. There are many instances where the character models are wonky-looking—their facial features are oddly distorted, their faces alter their shapes from shot to shot, and their eyes, noses and mouths sometimes seem to melt or twist. Combine that with the highly detailed backgrounds and the frequent use of wide shots, and certain scenes start looking noticeably unpolished and rough. Now, do not get me wrong—when the occasion calls for it, the emotions of the characters can and are wonderfully conveyed, but it cannot be denied that a lot of the less eventful scenes suffer from a disappointing lack of consistency.

Regardless, that is as far as genuine missteps go, as most of the other issues come down to personal preference rather than genuine flaws. For example, many may deem the lightning to be very hit-or-miss—the anime is not afraid to shroud its countless night scenes in near-total darkness before bombarding the screen with the intense sheen of the stars or celestial bodies—but, in my eyes, this [Chiaroscuro-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro) approach adds a massive, thick coating of seriousness and realism that perfectly complements the story's weighty themes and beautifully communicates the gravitas of every vital event or impactful line of dialogue. The same applies to the backgrounds—they appear by the numbers at first glance, yet successfully encapsulate both the grit and grace of [the Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiddleAges)/[the Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance). Both the nature (the expansive meadows, dense forests, and green plains), and the architecture (the rustic, simplistic houses, churches, and whatnot) feel genuinely natural and lived-in. It is all thanks to the muted, desaturated, and atmospheric hues and tints that, in a sense, transport you straight into the setting—you can practically feel the chill of the stone walls and the warmth of the Sun on your skin. In short, despite the occasional inconsistencies, the art style is rock-solid, and when it wants to go all out, it more than delivers.

As far as animation is concerned, it faces the same hurdles—it can be terrifyingly stiff, almost lifeless at times, but it does its job well enough. When it decides to pick up the pace—whether in a fierce clash between two fighters, a heated ideological argument, or a simple yet striking spiel—it does not just work; it shines like a star. These bursts of fluidity and dynamism may be brief and short-lived, but they are unforgettable. At its worst, it is passable; at its best, Orb is drop-dead gorgeous. No, it is nowhere near [Frieren](https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Frieren-Beyond-Journeys-End/)'s level, but it does not have to be. It is fine the way it is.



Ultimately, a work's exceptional quality is only a part of the equation. What really matters is whether it clicks with you. After all, why ought we praise something if it fails to resonate with us in any capacity? Why should we be wowed by ingenuity when it fails to hold our attention and bores us to tears? Why must we admire something that never reaches us? Thankfully, in the case of this beauty, we are not forced to choose one or the other—here, thought-provoking content and boundless fun go hand in hand and deliver in spades. Countless scenes are filled with philosophical debates and weighty conversations, yet they are nothing short of absorbing. The fight scenes and acts of violence may not be the talking point of the story, but when they do show up, you cannot help but be hypnotised by their intensity, abruptness, and the way they impact the characters' fates. The pacing, the time skips, and the unconventional structure of the narrative—sure, they might take a bit of getting used to—keep each twenty-something-minute episode infinitely fresh and pleasant. No matter which one I put on, I had an absolute blast, savouring every single second of it. This is entertainment in its purest, most electrifying form.

All in all, for an anime that had spent months comfortably flying under everyone's radars, Orb: On the Movements of the Earth turned out to be nothing short of a masterpiece of colossal proportions. While it is not without its shortcomings (some of which are glaring and sometimes tough to swallow), this diamond in the rough feels like it was tailor-made for me. Free from the usual gimmicks, tired constraints, and cheap tropes that so often flood the medium, set in a one-of-a-kind setting that is strangely intimate, driven by themes and ideas that stimulate the mind and ignite the imagination, and packed with endless thrill, terror, and tension—though it certainly will not be to everyone's taste, in my eyes, the biggest underdog of 2024 is one of the most exhilarating and emotionally impactful experiences I have come across in quite some time, and I will gladly sing its praises for as long as I can.

Thank you [Uoto](https://anilist.co/staff/128963/Uoto), [Kenichi Shimizu](https://anilist.co/staff/119190/Kenichi-Shimizu), Kensuke Ushio, Sakanaction, and [the rest of the amazingly talented, passionate staff](https://anilist.co/anime/151514/Orb-On-the-Movements-of-the-Earth/staff) for making those twenty-five episodes feel like something truly special—something I will treasure for years to come.

98505,"Cute girls show that actually takes itself seriously? Well....anything works I guess? Who would have thought this show would work so well? This is easily one of the most surprising anime of the year! This show was a joint project between studios Studio 3Hz and Actas. This series is directed by Masaki Tachibana who is best known as the director of Barakamon. He has also worked on shows such as Flip Flappers and Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig. This is his second director gig. The writing for the series is handled by Ichirō Ōkouchi who is best known for his work on the Code Geass series. 

Princess Principal is one of the few CGDT shows to get something right that many of the shows of this genre don't do.  What is that? Well to put it simply, its the characters and writing. 

Before I jump into the meat of this review, I just wanted to explain my main complaint with CGDT (Cute Girls Doing Things) shows. My main problem with shows like these is how the characters lack depth, and there is no clear end goal. It just feels like 12 or 24 episodes of them checking off a list of anime tropes and clichés. There is no attempt to make the characters stand out besides being a whatever anime archetype they are. 

Thankfully, Princess Principal is one of the few shows to get this right. A show like Princess Principal doesn't need to be just cute for their concept to work. What it does do is show you, that giving a character an episode to flush them out can pay off in the long run. We start to like the character for who she is and not because she is cute. Cute can be an aspect of liking a character, but when it is pretty much their whole character. There is nothing. 

Now, let's get onto the review. I know that is what you have been waiting for. I'm happy to give you what you want. We are going to Black Lizard Planet. 

Story (8 out of 10): Our story takes place in the fictional world of Albion, England. During the 20th century of the Kingdom of Albion has control and monopolized this mysterious substance. This has led to unrest among the citizens of Albion. So, a couple of years later, the Commonwealth launches an operation known as Changeling in an attempt to replace the current ruling class in power with a small group of girls. A girl that looks like the princess catches wind of their plan and offers to help them with their plans if the Commonwealth promises her that she can become Queen of the Kingdom. 

The story of Princess Principal isn't an overarching plot but more so episodic plots that end up connecting later. They make sure each character gets their moments in the spotlight to shine. Mr. Ōkouchi really makes sure every character is flushed out to the best of his abilities. But he doesn't do the same for the villains of the show as they are barely around. He does a good job framing them as a threat, but they rarely cross paths with our main heroines making them seem like wasted potential. 

Besides that, it also can be unfocused sometimes with focusing on things that are not important to the plot. For example, in episode 7, it feels like more of a side mission in an open world game than an actual meaningful episode to advance the plot and characters. The same can be said for some missions they go on. I am always asking myself, ""What does this have to do with the plot?"" Like there is one mission at the end of the series that felt out of place to me. 

Overall, the story is good but lacks a good villain to oppose our girls. So, you're left with cute, interesting girls beating up grown men. I really like the beginning of the series as it serves as a good introduction to our cast. I also like the direction they went with the ending leaving it open for a season two since a season two is the only way they are going to fully realize their vision for what they want to do. 

Art (9 out of 10): As stated before Studio 3Hz and Actas did the animation for this project. They both really come out swinging this time around. Actas doesn't always have the best animation, but they really surprised me here with this show. I can tell Studio 3Hz handle majority of the action scenes as each one is unique and different. I think Actas handled the big booming perspective shots. All of them were exciting and intense. So, they knew what they were doing in that department. 

The character designs were done by Kouhaku Kuroboshi. Who I know from his illustration work from Kino's Journey. First off, I would like to tip my cap to Mr. Kuroboshi for his unique designs for all the female characters. He really makes every girl in the show look different. You can tell who is the oldest and youngest among our five main girls. He really gives them expressions through their clothes, that can really tell who they are as a character. He also makes sure their eyes are designed. When you look at the girls you can tell how each of them looks different. Ange’s eyes have a sharper and darker look while Beatrice’s eyes are a lighter color. 

Though, I feel this is lacking when it comes to the male character designs. Every guy in the show looks bland and boring. No one really stands out even the boss of the girl has a mediocre design. The same goes for our villain. I can say overall, he really nails the 20th century Victorian London style. I think my favorite designs of the show are Ange, Dorothy, and Gazelle. So, overall, I think the artwork and animation were really good. 

Characters (10 out of 10): Now onto my favorite part of this show. This show is really driven by its amazing characters. The characters of this show are nothing less than fantastic. I am talking about the main characters of course. Let's down the line and talk about how effective each of them is. 

Ange: The queen of Black Lizard Planet. Ange is just a lot of fun. One of her main concepts and calling cards is her ability to lie and tell when someone is lying. She also has the ability to change her personality depending on the situation. You can never tell when she is being honest unless it involves one of the other major characters in the show. She is very laid back and is very aware of her surrounds. Ange never tells you who she is unless she uses the cover of ""Black Lizard Planet"" to tell someone about herself.  Yes, she can use the anti-gravity machine she carries, but I feel her power to outsmart everyone around her is even better. She is the all-around member of the group if you ask me. 

Beatrice: She joins the team later. She is the younger member of the group but has a very dark backstory that involves her father using her as an experiment. So, she now has a voice box. With this voice box, she is able to change her voice to match any voices she hears. This is very helpful when they’re on missions. It's a really unique ability. She isn't the best fighter of the team, but combat isn't her focus. She plays more of the role of gathering intel. I love her expression and how she really keeps herself calm when on these missions since she is the most likely to die. Great character, and really has her heart in the right place. She only joins because the person serves joins. So, she is very loyal. 

Chise: Up next is the only Japanese member of the group. Oh, I forgot to mention everyone is British in this show. Anyway, Chise is the samurai of the group. She is the main the hand to hand fighter of the group.  So, she takes care of any bad guys that get close. Her character reminds of a rule 63 loli Goemon. That doesn't mean she is bad. Her backstory in her first episode it was okay. The other episode she got was really cool. I do wish they went more into the reckless side of her. Overall, she is just a solid character being the typical samurai. Her costume is really cool. 

Dorothy: Now time to talk about my favorite character of the show! Dorothy is the femme fatale of the group while also being the leader. She is the most level-headed of the girls and is cool under pressure. Dorothy never really does enough to much of a whore. She knows how to use her body right. She really plays the role of the femme fatale. Dorothy is very sexy and a very strong female character. She always knows what to do. Her backstory is not a bad angle with her being abused by her father either. IT tells you Dorothy never always had it figure out. Her real name is Daisy. She changed it to Dorothy. In her episode, you really got to see how she became the strong and powerful woman she is today. It's very well done. 

Princess: The last member of this group and one of the most interesting. She is the public figure of the group. Princess is also the only reason Beatrice joined the team. She is the only one that can freely move around without having to hide her image. Princess is the most inexperienced in being a spy (same goes for Beatrice) but she proves to be very clever. She isn't one for combat, so just like Beatrice and a little bit of Ange. Her best ability is to be able to outsmart her foes. Now there is a huge plot twist involving her and Ange that I won't spoil, but I will say it was amazing and really will make you like Princess and Ange even more.

Lastly, I want to talk about Gazelle. I really wanted to see more of her because I felt she could have been a good foe for the girls. When she is on the screen she is really making her presence known. She is evil and very brutal. Episode six is one of the best examples of her being outright brutal to someone. She along with the other guy really needed more screen time. I hope they get more in a second season. I do think she has a great design though. 

Sound (9 out of 10: The opening theme is solid getting that spy theme perfect, but I feel the ED really nails the moe factor with a cute upbeat song with some really good animation. I also felt the voice acting all over was solid. I felt the voice actors really did a good job of being the characters than just being an archetype. I think the strongest performances of the show were Ange and Dorothy if you ask me. Lastly, I felt the sound effects for the guns and explosions were nice and didn't feel stock. So, I feel the show has some good sound design. 

Overall (9 out of 10): Princess Principal is easily one of the most underrated shows of the year. This show was such a treat to watch. I really like how they made the character the center focus, and we could take what they're doing seriously. This wasn't cute girls playing Kickball. These young girls working deep undercover as spies and acting like spies. I highly recommend shows for anyone who is a huge Lupin the Third fan and those that have wanted more depth when it comes to moe shows."

Cathartic in nature, GochiUsa is a heartwarmer that has its roots in providing contentment—similar to the relaxation one can feel from sipping freshly-brewed coffee. With an ample amount of lovable charms and a cuteness as cute as the twitches of a bunny's nose, it's the ideal to show to hearten oneself. I mean, just look at my smiling face!

But let's be clear first. The show doesn't have the most imaginative story as it follows pretty much all the things other CGDCTs have. Instead, it's in its setting—a town with European resemblances—that gives GochiUsa a special kind of appeal. Elegant, idyllic, and traditional, the town's architectures are adorned by timbered buildings and cobbled streets, making it a breath of a fresh air away from the usual high school setting. Really, it's the perfect environment to have some joviality. Like an ""on cloud nine"" kind of thing. And you can find out just how peaceful this show can get when you enter the Rabbit House, a café where caffeinated aromas linger about and where plenty of lightheartedness is waiting to be met.

A place full of endearments is inviting me.

After being greeted by the gentle Chino, who has an odd fluffball of a rabbit atop her head, Cocoa starts a new life in the town by working as a Rabbit House waitress. From there on, she meets the other girls, all of whom are equally as adorable, and this is where the euphoria begins to seep through my heart. There's no deep drama. No major conflicts. The setting has already established a tranquil state-of-mind prior to everything else, and that peacefulness continues to emanate throughout every episode. As a result, all the activities the girls do here—working at their cafés, partaking in silly fun, or developing their friendship and sisterly bonds—are enjoyable to watch. The fluffy atmosphere simply blankets their interactions in a way that makes me want to cuddle them.

Or ""Mofu mofu!"", as Cocoa will adorably say.

There's also one other aspect that elevates my fondness for the show. That is, each one of the girl's personality reflects the beverages in which they're named after: hot cocoa for Cocoa's comforting sweetness, cappuccino for Chino's mature and childish duality, Thé des Alizés for Rize's cute tendencies despite her strictness, uji matcha for Chiya's refined elegance, and the Kilimanjaro coffee for Sharo's insecure sensitivity toward her own image. So if you think of GochiUsa as one wholesome café, then the girls are basically its warm, little beverages. Endearing, isn't it?

img()

And to further paint the soothing image of the show in your mind, the art—while more on the average side animation-wise—utilizes its soft pastel palette harmoniously in conjunction with its visual design. I already talked about the architectural beauty of the town, so let me expand on that by saying the numerous outfits, sweets, and expressions here are some of the other things that give more delight to an already delightful setting. It's like what they say—appreciate the little things in life. Because as tiny as the aesthetic details may be, they all add up together into one pleasant whole that makes the show continuously fun to bunny-hop through each second along the way.

The soundtracks deserve a mention as well, as they too contribute to the easy-going atmosphere. Whether they're the fairytale-like or the restful tunes, all of them share the commonality in rejuvenating one's heart and soul, and to highlight the lovable voices of the girls at the same time. You can certainly say the audiovisual has inspired the affection within me.

At the end of the day, GochiUsa is a show that personifies what happy serenity is all about. It may have used the same kind of ingredients found in other CGDCTs, but the comfort it creates with its town setting and affectionate girls is distinct enough to be appealing—a charm that I like to compare with the refreshing, sweet, and tranquil atmosphere of a café.

Start your day with coffee. End your day with this heartwarming show.

13655,"Short Review ( still good though!)
This review not only designated to this series but to the other 2 seasons that come after.


The Pros to 'Little Busters!'
1. As you progress through the series, the characters starts to grow on you. Each time they reveal a secret from their past, you cant help but to think ""I know how you feel"" and ""I understand"".
21. The background music is quite soothing.
31. Teaches us that friendship is quite important.
41. In 'Little Busters!' it not also teaches us that friendship is important, but also shows us that ""everyone needs a friend"".
img220(/revision/latest?cb=20131112085840)
Conclusion
Little Busters! Is one of those hidden gem anime that waits to be discovered. Although JC Staff was that anime production company in charge, I think they did quite well. Although it was quite disappointing that a dramatic scene from a 24 minute episode only to be resolved in 4 minutes. Compared to its big brothers 'Clannad', Little Busters is miles away. Negativity aside the anime displayed good comic relief, nice music and the multiple colorful characters. Overall, this anime was quite heartwarming and taught every viewer that friendship is the greatest medicine for a troubled heart.

20984,"WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS AND SWEARING IN THIS REVIEW. PLEASE BE ADVISED.

Hello, and welcome to my review of おくさまが生徒会長, or in English, My Wife Is The Student Council President. First flaw is that she isn't even really his wife, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I hope you enjoy.

Story: 2
Honestly, if you haven't watched this series, I'll summarize it for you. It's a fap fodder show. You watch the characters do basically non-essential stuff before Wakana or some other girl suddenly gets into whatever fap moment the episode shows. I must criticize the Student Council President part, because while yes, she is the Student Council President, THE STUDENT COUNCIL DOES BASICALLY NOTHING. You know the most important thing she did? Made it acceptable for people to hold hands. FANTASTIC LEADERSHIP WAKANA, A FUCKING PLUS. We see a rather shitty ""love triangle"" if you want to call it that, where Misumi also gets into sexual situations, and since she has bigger breasts, she's obviously chasing after the guy and also had more fap worthy moments. I must also say that Izumi is basically the only guy character, which makes it even more possible for the girls to be thirsty for him. Misumi is basically the ""enemy"" of the Student Council, and she has her own little person, and so does Wakana for that matter. You all know that moment where the two little people meet up and they fight for the honor of their ""master"" and it's usually funny? There was only one encounter, and it was just, I lost brain cells from watching it. It was stupid, forced, cliche, and made me want to punch my computer. I might also add that this series is also a comedy (how fitting), so we see all the ways of how Izumi is a ""pervert"", such as Wakana intentionally leaving her panties in the living room so Misumi can see them and then suddenly make Izumi make up a lie that he is a cross-dresser. GRADE A CONTENT GUYS. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. Izumi and Misumi end up in a love hotel, and a sex toy suddenly fall into Misumi's private areas and basically going full blast to Izumi's utmost horror. Izumi also later sees Misumi's privates in full later in the series because we've obviously gotta make that peach joke! Also, when I watched the final episode I thought, ""Wait, how is this the last episode? It felt like a regular episode."" YUP, THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET MARRIED OR HAVE A WEDDING OR ANYTHING. JUST GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Characters: 3
Jesus Christ, I want this to end. Our main MC Izumi is basically that guy who works hard, gets his stuff done, etc. He is a rather bland character throughout, except when he's being authoritative, stopping Wakana from doing stupid stuff. Speaking of Wakana, she is like an 8 year old that has boundless amounts of energy. She doesn't even look fit for the job of Student Council President, and is quite naive. She also does whatever sexual act she's supposed to for the episode, like letting Izumi take off her panties in an alleyway because screw decisions, we need fap material! Misumi is a rather voluptuous girl, yet she is pure and dancing in the green hills of Europe, which of course is a stereotype that is quite common in ecchi and hentai. She tries to enforce stupid stuff, like no holding hands, (remember that from earlier?) or showing you're in a relationship with a person. But we saw her privates anyways, who gives a damn! (Christ, I feel like face desking.)  The rest of the characters are basically useless to mention since not even the anime gave a damn about them. And when they did show up they were basically fap fodder, like Misumi's sister straddling Izumi and Wakana's mom falling onto Izumi in a way so Izumi can accidentally lick her privates. (OH JOY) Might I add that Wakana's mother looks like a third grader and sounds like one as well even though she is FORTY(or thirty, I dunno). If you're into that stuff then good for you, but I'll stay away.

Sound: 7
Sound was fine, but the characters sounded like those voices you'd regularly hear from a hentai or something like that. Music was fine as well but nothing stood out to me. Opening was pretty meh and cliche.

Visuals: 7
The visuals were rather normal, nothing that made me go, ""OMFG THAT JUST MADE MY EYEBALLS ORGASM."" Sometimes the quality was lowered, but I didn't really care all too much. Please note that this is the last good thing about this series you will hear.

Enjoyment: 1.5
This show is fap fodder as I stated in the beginning. It adds nothing to your life but wasted semen on something you could've felt good that you masturbated to, but NOPE. The ecchi scenes aren't even that great, it's just toned up a bit. The comedy doesn't add much to the show, I never really even laughed at all. The story and characters were absolute shit. I don't recommend watching this series in the slightest, except if you want to see how shit an ecchi series is compared to this. I know there's an OVA, but I didn't watch it as I could've cared less. If they got married and then had sex FUCKING WOOPEE, good for them. This series is the worst anime series I have ever seen. May my eyes not have to suffer through something like this again. Once again, I hope that you enjoyed. If you think this series is actually good, then good for you! You can like whatever you want, and be proud of it. ^O^ Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!

9379,"Anyone who loves the Monogatari series would love this anime. I'm not skilled enough to write a review without spoilers but I will try to minimise the spoilers as much as possible

The plot is about Makoto Niwa, a high schooler, due to his parents' circumstances he had to move to live with his aunt. There he discovers that his self proclaimed living alone aunt actually has a daughter, Erio Towa. Erio suffers from amnesia a few years ago, the reason is unknown, she claims that she was abducted by aliens but Makoto denies it. The plot can best be sumerised as ""the boy who cried wolf's lie is the reason for the wolf's appearance""

From the starting episodes, we are lead by Makoto that what he thinks and says is the absolute reality for the anime. ""Show me proof, if you want me to believe you"" can be used to describe how Makoto chooses to believe or not at something. And is by that mindset that he denies anything that can't be proven. By having a denial mindset at start when doing anything, he is usually quick to give up on most things. He believes he is right because ""if you can't prove that something does exist, then it does not exist"" even though that is not actually proving that that ""something"" doesn't exist. Later on, as the frames pass by and the viewer jumps from episode to episode, the viewer will start to doubt Makoto's logical thinking. As Makoto meets more people and is presented with the belief of aliens by them, he still denies those beliefs. However, he will later on realise that ""the boy who cried wolf"" is actually himself and that his black lie will shatter all his beliefs, pride and ideology

Anyone who loves the Monogatari series will love this anime as well as it has Studio Shaft's unique presentation style when it comes to portraying characters' expressions, ideology, personality and beliefs. This is especially crucial for this anime as it relies on our main character to get us deceived

Although in the end, as expected for a 13 episode anime with such a large plot, it did not explained every important detail to us but I still love it

Read the below part if you've already watched the anime as it contains spoilers

!I want to ask, is Yashiro the same Yashiro from Adachi To Shimamura? Because Both Yashiros wear a spacesuit frequently, have slightly different hair, has same personalities, has a duty to protect the universe or something and has esper powers. I googled the author and they share the same author too, maybe both anime are in the same universe or something. In the end I still don't know anything about their universe but maybe I'll read the manga/LN. And if you have any recommendations that is similar to this anime, please do DM me!"
104463,"A Certain Scientific Accelerator (Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator) is a Japanese manga series, which was written by Kazuma Kamachi (Heavy Object) and illustrated by Arata Yamaji. An anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff and A.C.G.T aired on July 12, 2019. The final episode aired on September 27, 2019.

Accelerator is considered the most powerful psychic in Academy City and one of a few able to shift to the level 6. He, however, now lives a peaceful life and tries to recover from the past injuries. His rest is interrupted, when a rogue group within Anti-Skill called DA that is obsessed with bringing justice to Academy City so much that it would even opt for kidnapping and experiments on humans, causes pure havoc in the city. While Accelerator does not like to be bothered and hates problems, Disciplinary Action, or DA is enough of a threat for Accelerator to take actions, mainly because of the fact that the rogue group, for some unknown reason, is trying to kidnap The Last Order. Now only Accelerator can save the Academy City and The Last Order from the zealous fanatics, working in DA.

While A Certain Scientific Accelerator is not a direct continuation, or prequel to any of the series, you will need to watch A Certain Scientific Railgun to understand what is going on in the series, otherwise it will be somewhat difficult to interpret the story-line. You might also watch Toaru Majutsu no Index to get a full understanding. With that being said, the main villain of A Certain Magical Index franchise finally gets his own TV series. While many might hate him for the person he is, attentive viewers and readers will understand his motives. It was nice for him to get a personal TV series that will show the viewer more about Accelerator. In addition to this, just like in Toaru Majutsu no Index, Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator unites magic and science and the end result of this is quite of a mystery that is not only breathtaking, but also disturbing sometimes. And when it becomes disturbing, it will make you feel hella uncomfortable. No spoilers, though.

Animation wise, it is, without a doubt, an absolute masterpiece: characters design, backgrounds, action scenes, facial expressions; absolutely beautiful. Sound wise, if there is an English dub one day, I would still highly recommend you to watch it subbed; there is only one Accelerator and it is Okamoto Nobuhiko.

As for the characters, there is only one new protagonist that is worth mentioning, Rosenthal Esther. Let us omit the type of magic she practices and just say that she is a magician that wants to meet Accelerator to inform him about the upcoming events. She is a very easy-going individual, who, in reality, possesses a terrifying power. Anyways, A Certain Scientific Accelerator has a pretty nice character cast, including supporting character, as well as villains.

All in all, A Certain Scientific Accelerator is a great addition to the franchise. As mentioned before, it might be difficult for you to understand the plot of A Certain Scientific Accelerator without watching other TV series, but it will still be enjoyable, so it is up to you to decide.

9 Misakas/10, says Misaka Misaka trying to hide the fact that the whole review is nothing but fangirlism, but actually giving it 9 Misakas, instead of 10, hiding her attitude towards the said series."
104462,"As someone who watched all seasons and spin-offs of Toaru series (AKA Raildex) I can say for sure that it has many ups and downs and by the time I'm writting this review I believe Railgun T is highest peak of Series, without being nitpicking and biased I'm going to discuss about positive and negative points of Railgun T.

Discalimer : to make the review a little more rational I'll constantly will compare RT to its predecessors RS and Index series or some other, I DO NOT mean that those animes are bad by any means.

First things first, let's talk about Characters, just like Index Series, Railgun has a lots of characters with their even far more unique personalities but unlike Index series it will not throw any of older characters to trash can and keep a focus on newer characters which eventually will have the same fate, for ex: 
Aisa Himegami is one of important, or if I can say so a popular characters which has a total useless part in seires now, and that is just because her arc is over, so is her entire roll. 
but at the other hands, even far less popular and important characters in Railgun T, which you even may not recall them from previous Railguns has a decent roll in new season like Kinuho Wannai and Maaya Awatsuki. while most animes fails to deliver this level of character creation they either emphasise or totally forget side characters, but in railgun T you can still easily say who are main characters, while side characters are still getting enough attention.

Second thing second, art style of anime is a marvel in 2019/2020. okay hear me out in this one, while most animes out there even Index III or Accel hard-try their way through a wierd and bad looking 3D-esh-like art style, which make absolutely no sence AT all,  or at the other hand some anime has a realy old-looking and crappy art style, railgun T is one a few animes out there which still keep the very essence of an anime  and have an up-to-date visuals for a 2020/2019 anime. for EX : as someone who really love monogatari series, I have to say I never liked style of it specially kizumonogatari, it is not an anime style if you put wierd 3D and real life objectives.

Third thing third, lets talk about art of creation, to be more specific, making a good story is hard, but how to tell it is the important part. Story progress is times harder than story creation. a really good story can be unbrearable with a bad story telling and it's work the other way around too. at a first glimpse Railgun T story may sound familiar repetitive,  but how they deliver it and make different events make it realy smooth. for another EX : index stories are always more complicated and have more depth to them, but the way it is told is like someone want to make people confused on purpose. while railgun take you through ride like train, slow at begining with a proper acceleration. Railgun T embrace all it can and represent them in a smooth way which you will neither get lost or confused.

Last things last, for first time in my life I'm considering fan-servis a positive point, well let's say if you are watching laid-back camp and lucky star you know you are watching best CGDCT animes out there so you expect fan-servis, but if you are watching a action an serious anime (at least for me) I like that it have a full focus on story not stupid fan-servis. but the way which railgun T using fan-servis I can say for 100% is by far the best in animes, this is some how the way which Final Fantasy 7 did it. without making it obivous it uses character cuteness to make amazing fan servis. for last EX : I watched 6 seasons of toaru series and I've never even notice Pierce Aogami but right now he is my fav male character :).

that's it, I hope this review was usefull to you.
thanks for reading"
173694,"When an anime opens with a scene of child abuse, you know it's going to be a mess. And a mess this is.

To get things out of the way: this anime is not good, by any stretch of the imagination. However, if you like what it's bringing to the table, you'll probably enjoy it anyway. I know I did.

Content warning: This anime contains depictions of child abuse, bullying, sexual harassment and rape threats against most of the major female characters, premeditated murder committed by a protagonist, abysmal cost-cutting CGI, and in general a crapsack world where only the worst can ever come out on top and anyone who is nice is going to end up worse off for it. Also, this review may contain unmarked spoilers.

The general premise is that a bus full of high school students, all either terrible people, bullied into silence/complicity by the terrible people, or both, ends up isekai'd into a crapsack world. There, the goddess Vicius (a very fitting name) tells them they're heroes, that they have ranks for their power, and gets them to turn against the lowest-ranked person: our protagonist, Touka Mimori. He gets banished to certain death, but is able to survive because his ""terrible"" skill is in fact overpowered. And swears revenge on Vicius for fucking him over.

It's my understanding that this is likely the usual tropes of the subgenre, though I'm not familiar enough with it to know for sure. What I do know is that it's not going to appeal to everyone.

Expectation-setting spoiler for plot progression with this adaptation:

!If you're looking for closure, you won't find it here. The anime as it is now ends on a cliffhanger of a plot hook. Touka is not yet at the point where he can take his revenge, nor does he meet any of his former classmates by the end of episode 12. There's the beginnings of a romance subplot, but it barely gets off the ground.!

Touka as a character is very edgelord-appeal. He's not particularly empathetic, barely hesitating before murdering not just monsters but people, and at times seems to enjoy it. What he does have is pragmatism, forming (mutually beneficial) alliances with people he thinks would be useful for his goals.

The other isekai'd characters are sidelined for large chunks of the story, as Touka was forcibly separated from them and he's the protagonist doing protagonist things half a continent away. That said, they, and Vicius, do appear every so often.

The plot comes across as contrived in places. Lots of conveniences that benefit Touka, so you'd probably need some level of ""turning your brain off"" to tolerate it.

The animation quality is... mediocre at best. Close-up shots are decent-enough 2d animation; distance shots and also monsters - of which there are many - are CGI, and really noticeably awkward CGI at that. Stiff movement is very obvious in those scenes. But again, if you can turn your brain off, it's close enough to watchable.

The music is fine. I did enjoy the opening theme, and the rest of it didn't feel out of place to me.

In conclusion:

If you like revenge stories where everyone's a terrible person but the protag's at least a sympathetic terrible person, and don't mind lowering your standards, it's possible to enjoy this. Would I recommend it? Not really, unless you're looking for exactly this sort of edgelord isekai revenge story for mindless edgy fun.

To repeat the review summary: I didn't say it was good, I said I liked it."
123802,"The Saint’s Magic Power is Omnipotent, yet another show based around the idea of reading the source material to actually feel satisfied with the story. So much is left behind and unfinished, and just leaves me feeling that so much more could have been done with it. So much potential, wrapped up in a show I know will never get a second season or more content. Now in this case, I am already reading the Manga so I guess it isn’t a massive issue for me in this case. But I will always mention it when it happens, because it always leaves me disappointed.

Now onto some of the actual content of the show. It felt unbalanced, like we got a long prologue and a cut down first arc. We spend episode after episode in this episodic style, following Sei in her daily life. During this section we are mainly getting world and character building in spades, and it feels like it is working well. But it has a massive flaw, nothing honestly happens during this period of time it feels like. You keep wanting to get some progress on whatever the actual story will be, or see this romance between Sei and Hawke actually develop into something. And this stage goes on for so long I end up loosing interest, when I know nothing of consequence will actually occur during the episode.

Than you get the progress and things start moving at a lighting fast pace. Aira’s story suddenly gets pulled into the forefront and is used to get the actual story moving. And it never stops once that happens. But it occurs so late into the show, it just have the proper time to actually do anything. This also causes things to feel a bit unexplained and rushed, like they suddenly realized they need to hit a certain point, and they waited too long to get there. Something else that starts to actually occur during this section is progression with Sei and Hawke. But once again, it happens so late that nothing I really want to see happen can. They just don’t have enough time to progress the story or the character in a method that I feel is all that satisfying. And leaves us with a conclusion that just isn’t, this isn’t a conclusion to anybodies story. Instead it is the beginning of a story we will never see in Anime form.

Onto other things, visually I think the show looks good. Nothing felt super high quality or outstanding, but definitely of a better quality than many shows. This is also I think partly due to the lack of action due to the genre, many shows will stand out due to flashy fights, and this doesn’t have anything of the sort to pop or show off. None of this is a negative, just due to the nature of the show.

In general, I guess I would say the show is fine. Nothing outstanding. But don’t go in expecting a satisfying conclusion to a story. This is 100% a old fashion Light Novel advertisement, the type of thing I really do hate. What I would give to allow more studios and directors freedom to make original shows with flexible episode numbers and lengths."

First impressions, so we got harem show where people fight for half price bento's and there is some heram shit going down sounds fun enough.
Side note a bento is a Japanese lunch box in case you didn't know that.


Story, 6/10

So bento is about the main character who goes to a shop to get himself some half price bento. But then gets his ass kicked by a girl when he try's to get one.
After that he soon learns that one doesn't just simply get himself a half price bento one must earn it though honorable combat and blood shed. This contest of strength and willpower is known as the bento brawl where the wolfs get to fed and the dogs go home hungry. 

So to sunrise bento it pretty much about these group of people who beat the living shit out of each other for what is essentially half price food, and I thinking to myself man this is really stupid this will never work and to my amazement I find that this actually works.
Now I am not saying that this best story ever made because it's extremely simplistic in both ideas and presentation. but I think what makes it work is that it takes the battle shounen mentality and compressed it into one of the most mundane of tasks which is shopping.

This show also includes some harem/school life elements as well 
And your properly thinking that it's going to be one of those things where the main character a bata male and has all these badass girls protecting him well if you thought that then your wrong because it more like they kick his ass and then he kicks there ass and they become apart of his harem so it's like a reverse Kung fu harem and the school life parts are self explanatory.

One thing I think is quite fun about this show is that 
For one the characters seem to take this whole bento brawl thing very seriously. For example you got characters having monologues about honor and way of the warrior type of shit.

But a negative I got to say about it is that it really doesn't have any type of logic to it and that kind thing kind of bothered me a bit. So pretty much turn off your brain while watching this show.




Characters, 6/10

The main character can be pretty much be sum up as the normal high school student who is a bit of a pervert and likes old school games and is a bit bata male at first.
but after a while he starts becoming a bit of a badass in his own way 

The side characters are pretty much two dimensional at the most.

But they are quite the interesting bunch of ....... no interesting isn't really the word I would use probably I should use the word zany so the are a zany bunch of characters.

They all have some personally even though it's really basic.




Art, 7/10

The animation was very well done it isn't at that God level of animation quality but it looks very nice.
It also has very bright colors that is uses.

It also has some very well done fight animation as well.

It has a very genneric art style that you seen it once you seen it all.

The characters designs are also generic as well.


Sound, 6/10 

It has an ok op that fits the tone nicely.

It's ost to me is pretty generic. nothing really stands out about the ost.



Enjoyment, 7/10 

So this show some what blowed me away of how fun this show was.

I like that it's got people fighting over stupid shit.


I also liked the really cool steet fighting.

I also found the characters to be fun as well.


Overall, 6/10

So overall if your looking a dumb fun anime then you will find bento to be one kick ass of a show. But if your the kind of person who like his shows a bit more serious and have logic behind then this show won't really be your cup of tea."

〈 𝘓𝘰𝘧𝘵𝘺 𝘢𝘮𝘣𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴... 〉

Every once in a while, I like to chill on my porch with  a cigarette in one hand and [a can of piss-cheap energy drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonsterEnergy) in the other and ponder random stuff like a pseudo-intellectual geezer from an old-school movie. So, one day, while inhaling my favourite cancer-inducing chemicals, I began to wonder: have I become too cynical and critical about anime? Maybe I need to loosen up, be more open-minded,  turn off my brain and have mindless fun, as they say. Considering that it might be the case, I let out a big sigh, took a swig of that delicious carbonated diabetes-like beverage, headed to my room and booted up the absolute joke that is Ninja Kamui to get those silly thoughts out of my head.

Cutting it some slack and being less judgmental? Do not make me laugh. Even though it did suffer from some issues behind the scenes, that does not mean that we ought to overlook its bullshit. But I am getting way ahead of myself, so I should take a step back, take a deep breath, and dissect this stinky corpse of an anime to find out what kind of gruesome, inhumane crime we are dealing with.



Ninja Kamui kicks off with what can only be described as an absolute sugar rush of a premiere. Blood splattering all over the place like a bunch of confetti from [a pinata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%B1ata), blades striking against shiny armour plates, [kick-ass insert songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhhS0-GnkxU) blasting in the background with their intense and energetic notes, and a surprisingly well-put-together, well-coordinated and well-thought-out fight choreography—with fight scenes like that peppered throughout the first episode, it is no wonder why so many folks were hyped to see what else the anime had in store for them. While I do not find the episode that impressive on its own—it feels like half a dozen episodes condensed into one and a lot of its emotional beats are fundamentally hit-or-miss—its vigour and confidence are very contagious and it hooks you in without breaking a sweat. If the show had maintained this level of excitement and energy throughout its run, it could have been a fun, undemanding and easy-to-digest popcorn flick. But alas, that did not happen, as this is where the positives come to a screeching halt.

Yes, the second the first episode wraps up, the rose-tinted glasses of hope and promise come off, and the grim reality hits you in the face like a brick. The initial bombastic nature of Ninja Kamui almost immediately wears off, which leaves us with a mishmash of random events and half-baked ideas sellotaped with not a speck of cohesion in sight.

You see, the show struggles with a severe identity crisis; it basically cannot figure out what it wants to be. Does it aim to be a bloody and gory revenge story about an exiled ninja seeking payback for his family's murder? Or does it desire to be a tad bit more complex and intricate mystery thriller with [whodunnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit) undertones? Or perhaps it strives to be a CGI [mecha](https://anilist.co/search/anime/Mecha) clusterfuck with human-sized robots duking it out and some international conspiracies sprinkled on top? It tries to be all these things at once, and, let me tell you, the outcome is anything but pretty.

I genuinely despise it when series go down that road because, more often than not, it ends up feeling like too many people are tampering with the script, turning it into this bizarre amalgamation of completely unrelated visions and aspirations. Of course, there are numerous examples of anime that have arcs that are very different tonally and conceptually from the rest of the content ([Frieren](https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Sousou-no-Frieren/) is a great recent example of that), but the key difference between them and Ninja Kamui is quite subtle yet crucial: decisiveness. While Frieren or other shows are extremely confident in their genre shifts and allocate just enough time to make them work, Ninja Kamui does everything in a very half-assed manner, as it offers no breathing room for both its ideas to fit smoothly and flow with grace and for its viewers to get accustomed to the changes.

Here, the transition from one genre to the other is as seamless and smooth as munching on a pile of dirt and washing it down with a glass of sewage water. In episode 1, it is all about the ninjas and their brutal battles to the death. By episode 2, we are already balls-deep into an FBI-led investigation into a spree of murders that are linked to the mysterious organisation we quickly learn about. Then by episode 5, we are forced to watch clashes between clunky humanoid trashcans with some of the weirdest blocking and choreography I have seen in a while. Once all the pieces of the puzzle are in action, Ninja Kamui decides to blend them all and feed the viewers that disgusting, mushy and slightly sticky slop.

Nevertheless, at this point, there is legitimately no incentive to care about anything happening on the screen. Those interested in the ninja stuff did not appreciate the genre switch and left. Fans of the more detective work scenes, seeing that they were a one-time gimmick, quickly bailed. The few people who genuinely respected the show's direction and welcomed the mechas and the shady businesses of [AUZA](https://anilist.co/character/327163/Joseph) had nothing to chew on and were sorely disappointed by its sheer clumsiness and emptiness.

[The characters](https://anilist.co/anime/151639/Ninja-Kamui/characters) do not fare any better. They come across as a bunch of run-of-the-mill caricatures without any visually appealing characteristics, understandable motivations, or compelling traits to speak of. The antagonists are like those one-dimensional Saturday morning cartoon baddies—they exist solely to spout the same annoying one-liners over and over again and be total dickheads to [the protagonist](https://anilist.co/character/326717/Higan) until they are inevitably and soundly defeated by him. They are utterly devoid of personalities, goals or ideals, and, better yet, the show desperately tries to humanise them at the eleventh hour as a last-ditch effort to artificially raise the non-existent stakes and inject some emotionality into the fight scenes. How cheap!

Of course, it is not just the villains; the rest of the cast grapples with a very similar set of issues. [Higan](https://anilist.co/character/326717/Higan) always conveniently finds a way to be rescued and obtains the power-ups required to overcome his adversaries, [Mari](https://anilist.co/character/326723/Mari) somehow receives more screen time than other supporting characters vital to the plot despite being dead for the entirety of the story, [Emma](https://anilist.co/character/326719/Emma-Samanda) meets her end in the most hilarious way imaginable, and every other character associated with Higan is a cardboard cutout with a singular purpose. How can I be invested in the narrative when these are the characters I am stuck with?

Perhaps it would be easier to overlook their lack of quality and refinement if the narrative itself had some substance, yet as you have already determined, that is not the case here. The frequent genre shifts and the overabundance of ideas are a massive roadblock for the series and they halt its progress time and time again. However, to suggest they are the only thing holding it back would be quite naive. The anime constantly attempts to punch above its weight, pretending to be far grander and smarter than it truly is, but these feeble efforts are pitiful at best.

AUZA, [the ninja organisation](https://anilist.co/character/327169/Yamaji), and every single theme they represent are portrayed in such a dishonest and unconvincing fashion that I struggle to see them as anything more than a cheap way of adding depth. The motifs of loyalty, family, foreign influences, nationalism, honour and all that jazz—fascinating and compelling in a vacuum—are rendered absolutely eye-rollingly insipid and ill-fitting to an extreme degree.

News flash: themes become commendable and respectable when thoroughly explored and permitted to thrive; by treating them as mere additives, the narrative takes a massive hit.

Seriously though, not every show needs to be chock-full of thought-provoking or striking ideas to be effective and efficient. Truth be told, all it needs is to understand how to strike a good balance between its various components or fully embrace its plainness and keep things simple and basic. Nonetheless, Ninja Kamui shits the bed on both of these fronts; it is neither a fun no-brainer nor a brainy action-packed thriller. It is merely a gigantic failure that betrays your feelings and lets you down.



When it comes down to it, the show's gravest offence is how unfathomably boring it is. Despite advertising itself as an exhilarating and undemanding escapade, it is actually a far cry from what was initially promised. No matter what it threw my way, I remained entirely disinterested. From the fights to the conversations between the characters to the lengthy exposition dumps, everything was extremely painful to watch. Funnily enough, I even dozed off in front of my laptop not once but twice while watching it, which might be the biggest criticism I can ever direct towards an anime. Bravo, Ninja Kamui, you are not only horrible but also utterly unwatchable—what an achievement!

Well, you could say that it is at least good at wasting your time.

Ah, I have no clue what more can be said about Ninja Kamui and its antics. It is genuinely dreadful but in a peculiar way. You cannot quite put your finger on what exactly makes it so rubbish, yet, deep down, you sense that something is fundamentally wrong with it. It tries to juggle too many things at once and falls flat on its ugly face as a result. Just skim through [a few of its earlier fight scenes on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBLuvgu3lc) and call it a day. There is no point in subjecting yourself to this mess.

Now, if you will excuse me, I am off to watch something actually worthwhile.

552,"My favorite anime of all time. I'll try to review it using my head rather than my heart. Rsrs. God knows how I wanted to score this anime with a big 10. Still, it would mean putting it at the same level as Fullmetall Alchemist and above Steins, Fate, Death Parade, and other excellent adult shows. Digimon is suitable for all ages, therefore can't do certain things (and don't need to). I think it's like comparing a child to an adult, which is clearly unfair. But I must say, what an exceptional child!
I watched it as a child and loved it. A few years ago, I rewatched, fearing to destroy a good memory of my childhood, but, in the end, I got even more impressed with its quality.
Digimon revolves around eight children and their partners, the Digimons. Each of the children has a distinctive personality. You can tell who's who easily. They are not there just to add cool Digimon transformations for the group. You can relate to their personal problems. Their interaction is gold. The friendship and care for each other, the internal conflicts, and even the fights are relatable for all of us.
The villains are charismatic. They are aware of the world where they live. Most of them have their own ideal, not being just the general evil that must be destroyed. Myotismon even shows some good morals at times. I could even see a little bit of a victim in Pinocchimon (almost filling pity about his situation) rather than pure evil.
The music is powerful and reinforces the drama. It sure has caused an impact on me. The highest point is in Myotismon's saga. Every time it played caused me to tremble.
Incredible depth for a child's show. Not like the most that treat children as they were unable to feel more complex emotions, it's a show that respects its audience. Of course, don't expect the depth of an adult show. It has considerable flaws. The Etemon's saga is somewhat weak. The series has some cliché, and, most important for me, doesn't deal with death, which Tamers did. In that regard, it went deeper than the original.
If someday I have a child, I surely will watch that with him or her. It's an example, more than that, is a master class of how to make an anime for children keeping the fun and colorful and magical world with cute characters, making an easy plot to follow without calling them dumb. I'm writing that, BUT, you, grown-up, will have a lot of fun watching this as well.rsrsrs. Before being for children, Digimon is a good story and, therefore, is good for anyone, regardless of your age! I've watched Digimon at least three times at different moments in my life and in all of them it didn't disappoint me. On the opposite, I admired more and more this great show. Doing this review made me want to rewatch, and I'm sure I'll do it soon."

Motto To LOVE-Ru is a show that brings in the goodness of fan service at your doorstep just like the first season, except it's even better! With new characters and perspective on previous ones, there is a guarantee for enjoyment to blossom at each episode.

Previously on To LOVE-Ru. Episodes came in like a filler train wreck and the cargoes that toppled out were too heavy to be enjoyable to carry. I mean, the contents inside were too similar, so there really was no point in carrying them anyways! That's my quite peculiar analogy on what I felt during the first season, but it gets the point across. And now, the curtains unveiled in this season and oh boy was that a welcomed surprise. How and why is it better? First thing would be in how the episodes are structured. Rather than dragging the length out with a single episodic story, they decided to put in three mini stories for each episode. This new structure helps to give more diversity, an aspect that was lacking during the first season. It paves way to much-needed focus on the cast of girls, particularly with the beloved golden assassin and the disciplinary tsundere. What comes out of that is progression on the romance life of many girls, along with the development on their personality showcasing the sides they’ve never truly shown before. The culmination of each girl's differing personalities add up to many fun and silly situations that make them so likable and laughable. Though with all that said, this season still comes with issues. Some comedies are not funny and even though it's an ecchi, the dragged on fan service may get a bit excessive at times. While there are occasional boredoms here and there due to the lesser-than-previous-season repetitions, their entertaining pureness overweighs most of these issues. Main boy Rito went through so much ever since he became unlucky so I got to hand it to him for dealing with everything. Keep up the good work!

And with that out of the way, we do a hop and a skip to the visuals of the anime! At first glance, the difference is already noticeable once we compare it to To LOVE-Ru. Just like how Lala can transform her clothes with the help of Peke, the anime did a transformation in its art style. The biggest difference is that the colors are whitewashed, making everything look slightly less saturated than before. It took a bit of time to get used but at the end, I really liked how it looked. In a way, it's an upgrade, especially when the linework still feels refined and the animation retains normality and consistency. There are a couple of visible amplifications for the art, particularly during the more significant scenes that appeared throughout the show. As for the character designs, no changes there and they all look youthfully cute (except the principal). Ecchi scenes are still as exaggerated as ever with more gloss to define the curves, so nothing really new there. When the characters go through all sorts of havoc, they come in with a bunch of expressions and of course, the white-eyed ones that's really common in comedic anime are no exception. From happiness to clumsiness, whatever face they decided to put on places a smile on my face. Especially with that Celine. Her non-stop smiles are too contagious. Most scenes are blasted with loudness and energy radiating out of the girls. Definitely can't see Rito taking a break with that going on in his life. Cheerful soundtracks complement with the bright tone and the character's voice acting are done well, capturing the charm  of each character.

Motto To LOVE-Ru is simply a step up to the previous season. It's an improvement on pretty much all aspects, and that's a good thing because better enjoyment comes out of better quality. If To LOVE-Ru is an enjoyment that reaches the Moon, then this one has enough fun comedy, romance, and personality to reach Mars. This journey of harem and ecchi is awaiting you!"
115740,"It's become well-known that Japan is fixated on isekai. The rules regarding the isekai differ depending on the work, but they all embody the idea of touching on another world in some form. On paper, there is nothing wrong with such a concept. In fact, this type of story framing has been around for hundreds of years. Many western classics like Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz also touch on this concept. It's a tool designed for escapism, and it rightfully works to varying degrees depending on the work. I get the appeal, but it often leaves much to be desired on my end. So, how does KamiHiro fare against the tidal wave of isekai that has placated the masses over the years?

On the surface, it's pretty much like the typical isekai. The MC is noticeably overpowered and everyone points out his amazing feats. However, that's where the commonalities end. The series doesn't feature harems or even romance for that matter. Most of the series explores the fantasy world, especially in regards to the varying uses of slimes for an improved standard of living. It centers around a guy named Ryouma, except the story itself is catered moreso towards commentating on Japan's oppressive work culture.

The world of Sail Fall is quite different from our own world. It contains no oppressive multinational corporations or safety nets designed to benefit the average worker. It's a world where most people are totally at the mercy of their employer, but everything remains strangely idyllic. Magic exists, but there's very little practical use of magic. Enter Ryouma. He observes that people are annoyed with slime stench on their clothes and armor, so he opens up a laundromat service. He notices that his employees had to travel from distant cities to work, so he offers them to live in-house. He remembers the painful experiences that brought him to this world, so he gives his employees vacation time even though they were content with working without breaks. Ryouma perfectly understands the struggles of Japan's oppressive work culture, so he actively attempts to address this issue. Ultimately, this is still a wish-fulfillment fantasy. This show never pretends that it isn't, but is that necessarily a bad thing in its own right?

The show's biggest appeal is exploring the pains of modern Japanese society and how life can be better if people were actively concerned for others. Ryouma's second life becomes something where people reward him for the stuff he missed in his former life. He is appreciated for his work, and he gets joy out of actively helping others. He makes bonds with the folks around him and have them support his growth. This may all seem normal, and it honestly should be. But it isn't. If Ryouma represents the average person, then the show says a lot about how welcoming others with kindness can fundamentally change people for the better. The fundamental idea behind KamiHiro is one of healing. It's not designed like a typical iyashikei, but it still effectively works as one since it explores an otherwise ideal life that most people should strive towards.

It's also worth noting how the show touches on the concept of slimes. They are generally regarded as insignificant creatures. Many of them may have astounding talents, but they get written off as low-level monsters. In fact, they are so unimportant that most people are totally unaware of their practical uses. Cleaner slimes didn't exist until Ryouma tried putting his slimes to good use. One particular blood slime was so undervalued that its owner drank himself to tears from lack of prospective buyers until Ryouma bought it off his hands. I hope someone notices the connection I'm making here.

This mistreatment of slimes is essentially the same disdain that Japanese society has towards its workers. Upon arriving at Sail Fall, Ryouma began taming hundreds of slimes and cared for them all. He dotes on them and treats them beyond their outwardly insignificant demeanor. He sets up an environment for them to actively put their talents to good use. The slimes are otherwise nameless and faceless, but Ryouma cares for all of them like irreplaceable family members. In essence, he created a positive environment built from genuine kindness. The message is powerful and needs to be emphasized.

Beyond its thematic exploration, the characters are also surprisingly endearing. Ryouma's new family effectively takes him in and cares for him. The bond between him and Eliaria is noticeably sweet as they genuinely care for one another. She also happens to be quite skilled in her own right, like the scene where she successfully tamed a rare bird. It's pleasant enough to come off as cute without any overbearing moments from the supporting cast.

Ultimately, the show surprisingly had plenty of genuinely positive aspects. I love how it explores working environments and the necessity of kindness in everyday relationships. The iyashikei aspect might turn some people off, but I genuinely find it endearing. It's far from perfection, but I can't deny that I found this relatively delightful."

I have been watching seasonal anime for 4 years now, and I started right when Pop Team Epic was airing. Me being early in my anime journey, I didn't really get this anime at all, but it also never left the back of my mind. Each season enduring formulaïc shows that seem to solely exist to meet some non-existent generic quota, it easy to yearn for something different. Not even good, just different, and Pop Team Epic certainly was different. Seing clips and manga panels floating by each year, I have always been tempted to give this a proper watch, and now with a second season announced, I have finally gotten the time to give this anime a proper watch.... and I am glad I did so.

Pop Team Epic is about... yeah, what is it about? It has two main characters, Popuku and Pipimi. Popuku is the short, agressive one while Pipimi is the long mysterious one, and everything in the show is about them. They are featured in every segment of the show and thus the only returning characters each episode. These two are fun, but even though they have defining character traits, the characters themselves act different depending on what the scene demands. Not that big of a deal since this is comedy parody, but it does make the characters feel more like joke vehicles rather then, you know, characters.

And now let's talk about the big elephant in the room: The structure of Pop Team Epic. When I said this anime is all over the place, I meant it in every single aspect. Pop Team Epic is a satirical anime focused on parody and absurd comedy. Each 12 minutes episode is structured like a range of skits, which feature one elaborate skit (which is often a parody), and several smaller skits that range from Bob Team Epic, the stop motion songs, the cooking bits, the french bits and more. There is pretty much no overarching story and each episode feels like you are watching a compilation of funny youtube videos, and just like a funny youtube compilation this anime is very hit or miss.

Each skit feels very random and different from eachother, but a central theme is subversion of everything. From what you would expect the punchline to be, to how long a skit would go on for to if a skit even has a punchline. The last part is probably what keeps me from fully falling in love with the anime: many skits just don't have punchlines. This makes it feel like the anime just exists most of the time, just trying to be absurd like that is funny enough.

img800()

Still, when this anime hits with its comedy, it hits hard, especially in the parodying. The makers of this show have a great understanding of pop culture, anime tropes and general story tropes, and they use that knowledge to create some bold and hilarious stuff. From how the first episode starts (and then keeping that joke up each episode in the previews), to the numerous references each episode makes (even from really recent games), to how it is able to make fun of itself and its critics. They are also willing to go really far for a joke, like how episode 8 was aired eight times consecutively and how each episode is repeated but with different voice actors. It almost reminds me of Nichijou how deticated the anime is to its jokes and it is glorious. 

The last thing I want to touch on are the production values, which are amazing. I have legitimaly had doubts to even call this an anime for how much multi-media this show has. Not only regular 2D animation, but also stop motion animation, live-action, storyboard animation, sand-on-glowing-table animation, there is so much variety in the shows visuals, which only highlight how all over the place and wild this show is.

Pop Team Epic is a weird show. It has satire, parody, absurdism, ordinary jokes, wholesome bits, genuine emotional stories and more. It is all over the place and some of its jokes might work as well as others, but I am glad this anime exists. It is a bold show that is satirical and absurd without being tied down to usual anime customs. It feels like a middle finger towards the anime industry while still giving a warm smile to a viewer.

I don't think that this anime will enjoyable to everyone, but if you want something wild and different from the usual season cycle, definitely give this one a chance.

Liz and the Blue Bird, directed by [Naoko Yamada](https://anilist.co/staff/102498/Naoko-Yamada), is the critically-acclaimed spinoff to Kyoto Animation's smash-hit, [Hibike! Euphonium](https://anilist.co/anime/20912/Hibike-Euphonium/). It probably marks the most quiet juncture in Yamada's illustrious filmography, with its popularity dwarfed by the likes of its parent series, [K-On!](https://anilist.co/review/19172) and [Koe no Katachi](https://anilist.co/anime/20954/Koe-no-Katachi/)(KNK). Yet, Liz also represents a complete culmination of Yamada's body of work thus far, opening new doors for the animation medium and industry. An emphatic display of technical mastery, a heart-wrenching message compounded with metaphor, and one of the greatest films I've seen to date. Liz may not be an international phenomenon, but its artistic and emotional contributions cannot go understated. In celebration of the movie's 4th anniversary, this review is dedicated to exploring the factors that make Liz so special. For those new to the Hibike! franchise, this article also looks to offer the context needed to fully enjoy this film as a standalone story.

Fresh off the universal acclaim garnered from Koe no Katachi, Yamada swiftly set her sights on yet another masterpiece. Sharing key staff members from KNK, Liz displays a comparable, if not superior, degree of emotional resonance and technical expertise. However, these two films could not be further apart. If KNK is likened to a charting modern pop ballad, with Yamada's talents utilized to effectively deliver hard-hitting hooks at breakneck speed; Liz then is a more intimate classical arrangement, with our conductor patiently entrancing us with measures of increasing intensity, all before crashing over us in a symphonic, cathartic crescendo. 


The many cogs that make up Liz were turned by skilled collaborators running at top gear. Longtime Yamada colleague [Reiko Yoshida's](https://anilist.co/staff/97076/Reiko-Yoshida) screenplay is equal parts simple and instrumental to conveying the foundation of the Liz experience. Naturalistic dialogue in day-to-day conversations makes way for poetic prose in earnest displays of emotion during pivotal moments. Through a lush soundscape, Liz's phenomenal score and sound design live up to the grand standards set by its parent franchise. Hibike! Euphonium's sound designer [Youta Tsuruoka](https://anilist.co/staff/102194/Youta-Tsuruoka) immerses in the closed-in campus of Kitauji HIgh with sonic nuances laid across the school. [Kensuke Ushio](https://anilist.co/staff/119254/Kensuke-Ushio) builds upon the delicate piano score of KNK, by constructing his musical accompaniments around the realistic rhythms of footfalls and objects found in the real-life school Liz's setting is based on. A second composer, [Akito Matsuda](https://anilist.co/staff/109045/Akito-Matsuda), offers the more classical arrangements associated with the world of Hibike. An orchestra from the [Senzoku Gakuen College of Music](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-11-07/video-go-behind-the-scenes-of-kyoto-animation-liz-and-the-blue-bird-title-track/.139187) performed Liz's titular piece for the film. Yet another essential element comes courtesy of the late character designer [Futoshi Nishiya](https://anilist.co/staff/102729/Futoshi-Nishiya). His soft linework on the masculine Free! blends seamlessly with Yamada's mastery of the female perspective, leading to the accentuation of every tiny action. Each of these excellent aspects are more than mere displays of technical mastery; the facets of writing, sound and character visuals all embody grounded and symbolic attributes. The team's emphasis on detail-oriented storytelling perfectly complements that of Yamada's own skillset, which is made all the more impressive when one considers her method of helming series. Despite her specific objectives, Yamada is known to give room for her collaborators' individuality to shine. This balance between precise decisions and creative freedom allow for a versatile range of evocative elements that still feel unmistakably Yamada. Learning about these collaborators helps us to grasp the full breadth of Yamada's creative vision, and why her genius is so revered by industry animators.

Under Yamada, Liz's visual direction feels purposeful. Vibrant, colorful watercolors of certain dreamlike sequences are juxtaposed against the melancholic blue hues of the film's realistic school setting. The school is more than a mere backdrop, but almost a character unto itself. Save the aforementioned dream sequences and the final moments of the movie, Liz takes place entirely within the grounds of Kitauji High. What would have otherwise been a cumbersome limitation works to Yamada's creative strengths. Her use of space ensures that scenes are far less boring than one would expect. Standout shots provide an almost-claustrophobic feel for keen observers and are enhanced with thoughtful framing. The shot composition makes frequent use of lines in the background and lighting, and is key to keeping scenes feeling fresh. Her love for cinema shines through and works brilliantly within the animation space, thanks to the organic compositing of cinematic effects such as blurs and camera movements. Her timing of shots goes hand-in-hand with Ushio's score, imbuing the fitting tone for each sequence. Yamada is also keen on incorporating more unconventional artstyles in certain sequences, such as the use of [decalcomania](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/06/25/a-new-step-for-a-silent-voice-team-liz-and-the-blue-bird-impressions/) and abstract linework. Perhaps the most idiosyncratic attribute in this canvas of Yamada's is her unrivaled command over human expression in animation. Her work on Liz shows a perfected craft that goes far beyond her ""trademark"" leg shots. Closeups on our characters reveal their distinct mannerisms and unspoken emotions, creating the aura of relatability and a human touch synonymous with the KyoAni brand. 


Even Liz's detractors would agree that the film is undoubtedly a technical marvel. However, one common complaint they'd raise is that the show did not deserve a movie-length theatrical release. While a select handful of scenes could have been cut, Liz stylistic choices are far more than set dressing. Rather, they make up the story itself, and leaving out such important moments would diminish this movie experience. In Liz, the medium and message are one and the same. We've covered a variety of techniques incorporated. But in order to fully appreciate all these sensory elements, we must first understand the metaphor so-tightly woven throughout each scene. 





!
I feel alone. My loneliness is not a conscious choice of mine, but a matter of consequence. I used to be blissfully unaware in life. I never had anyone to call a friend, because I never actively looked for one. I was habitually closed off from the world around me, that's just my nature. I was never taught that human connection was important, and I never anticipated how much I'd hurt without it.
When I learned that there was a whole other way of living life, it felt as if the world fell out from under my feet. It felt like I was falling down, just as much as I was falling behind my peers in terms of building social circles and meaningful bonds. I had wasted so many years closed off from the world, stuck in mundane routines and chores. I had no one to call a friend, and the few people that gave me time only seemed to do so out of pity. I used to be blissfully unaware in life, but now all I could feel was regret. Regret for the life I didn't live, the childhood I never enjoyed, and the fact that I wasn't worth other people's time. As someone in need of value in his own life, I failed to offer any to those around me, and so the cycle continued. I didn't choose to be ignorant, I just didn't know. But now that I did, I was ready to change things. I threw myself into extracurriculars and unfamiliar activities, often at the expense of my studies, just to feel like I was making a change. My efforts to socialize and catch up did alleviate matters, but you can only get so far when the world is light years ahead of you. And so, I fell.
Finding myself in her cage was the best thing that has ever happened to me.

Liz is centered around two girls from the Hibike! universe, Mizore Yoroizuka and Nozomi Kasaki. While Liz mostly functions as a standalone film, some content may only makes sense or gets enhanced by having seen Hibike. Without spoiling the tv series, here's a brief summary of the two characters and their relationship.

Mizore is a soft-spoken, musically-talented prodigy. She and Nozomi belonged to the same middle school, where Nozomi invited her to join the wind ensemble. As the first person in Mizore's life to have reached out to her, Nozomi became a close friend and source of fixation for the shy girl. Mizore masters the oboe in large part due to her bond with Nozomi, who continued to play the instrument after Nozomi quit the club. Now, having found their friendship reignited in the Kitauji High orchestra, her co-dependency with Nozomi starts going to extreme lengths.

Nozomi is an easy-going individual with an aloof personality. She often finds herself surrounded by peers and keeps up a jovial demeanor. However, she lacks talent and admires Mizore's effortless skill from a distance. Her reasons for abandoning both the club and friendship are selfish in nature. In some respects, both characters are following in each other's footsteps. Mizore has made Nozomi her world, and Nozomi longs to excel in the way only Mizore can. This relationship, while intimate, is not one that can last. And it's this dynamic that is forever changed in Liz, as the girls meet at an emotional crossroads and come to a decision of the heart.

I loved her. I could never admit it to anyone at the time, myself included. But 3 years on and it's the first thing I'd tell you about the two of us: I loved her.
She changed my world completely. She stopped me from falling, and I found joy in her cage. She was all that I had, and I was content. She was everything I wasn't: street smart, good with people, and innately charismatic. She never needed me, and that's exactly why I wanted her. She knew how to make me feel wanted, and that was a feeling I needed. Her companionship gave me comfort and made me feel loved. In her cage, everything seemed to make sense. If she stayed by my side, I could let go of all my regret. I could leave my life of falling behind, in exchange for her comfort. As I craved the connection we had, I began to grow possessive and needy. I had loved to feel loved, but she didn't feel the same. She never needed me, nor did she want me to need her. 
She meant the world to me. And that's why I had to let her go.

""Disjoint."" This word is displayed following the opening scene of Liz, and both go on to define the rest of the film. Our girls are presented as close, yet out-of-sync. Their walk to the clubroom is accompanied by Ushio's ""Wind, Glass, Girls"", a track which is built around the footsteps of the brisk Nozomi and the measured Mizore ([110 BPM and 60 BPM respectively](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/06/25/a-new-step-for-a-silent-voice-team-liz-and-the-blue-bird-impressions/)) as they make their way to their club room. Yamada's direction shows Mizore  imitating Nozomi's movements, but cuts away before she can ever complete those actions, signifying that Mizore is struggling to follow her friend's footsteps. The two cannot synchronise, and this theme pervades the rest of the Liz journey. 



webm(https://webm.red/osL5.webm)




The second key device introduced is the nested story within Liz. The orchestral piece of the same name is an original piece composed exclusively for the film, and also exists as a fictitious companion storybook to the song. Both girls consulting the book is a recurring motif; as they try to understand the music piece, the tragic relationship the song is based off and, by extension, themselves. The tale is one of a village girl, Liz, who encounters an injured Blue Bird in the form of a human. Their story is one of farewells, as one remains fixated on taking to the skies once more, while the other beckons the bird to stay. A clear power dynamic is established, with the Bird being seen as ""superior"" and Liz as ""inferior."" This dichotomy carries forward to Nozomi and Mizore, as Yamada thematically frames Mizore as a figure who is needy for Nozomi. 



img100%(v)




Obstacles are introduced, hindering the pair from perfecting their song and driving a wedge between their shaky friendship. Motifs throughout the film escalate the tension; Liz often uses established Hibike! pairings to juxtapose their synchronisation with our main duo's lack thereof. The presence of other club members and cliques continually leave Mizore in isolation. The school campus gradually turns into a cage for the Blue Bird. Codependency in the height of your youth is being held back from your fullest potential, as if locked away in a cage. Our characters' gazes of longing outside of the campus windows denote their search for clarity, both within themselves and the world beyond the unescapable prison. The conflict lasts long after the final performance of the titular song, as Mizore and Nozomi lay their hearts out in a bittersweet confrontation.

This last stretch of the analysis will involve spoilers, so proceed with caution. 

!
Liz's twist revealing that the Blue Bird was Mizore instead is effective due to the duality of the metaphor. Repeat viewings would reveal that both girls are each other's Liz and Blue Bird. In both ways, one is inextricably tied to the other. There is no superiority or inferiority, only differences in perspective. The relationship between Mizore and Nozomi is one where both would benefit from mutual separation - to cut out the insecurities and unhealthy obsessions that drive them both. Mizore needed to learn how to make decisions for herself, while Nozomi's lesson was one of self-love and harnessing her own strengths. It is a simple message, but one compounded upon through Yamada's attention to detail and earnest expressiveness.
The final moments of Liz marks the antithesis of its beginning. Rather than show how the two are different, the attention is focused on how the girls have become similar. Only in living for themselves could our Blue Birds achieve true synchronicity and take to the skies.

!
(End of spoilers)


As they eventually leave the cage that bound them and step out of the school compound, the prefix in ""Disjoint"" is hastily scratched away. It's a powerful conclusion, one with a solemn undertones. But underneath the ballad lies an uplifting symphony, likened to the ""happy ending"" Nozomi cheekily foreshadows in Liz's opening. An experimental approach and expressive efficacy create a truly immersive experience. The heart of this film is deceptively simple, but allows a plethora of motifs to shine and break you apart piece-by-piece. Carried by masterful visual storytelling and detailed sound design, this heart-wrenching film represents Yamada's present magnum opus. Watch Liz and the Blue Bird. 10/10

What we shared was something special. But the both of us were blue birds, holding each other back from better futures. She deserved far more than what I could give her, and I had yet to experience what the world could offer me. In spite of - and because - of our love for each other, we had to let each other go.
Loving her was like biking with training wheels on. When she was there to support me, I felt comfort, security and balance. But I knew there was another way to go about my journey in life. Off came the training wheels, it was time to grow up. Since then I've only fallen. I've picked up scrapes, and I can't say that my ride has been better than it was when she was around. Because it hasn't. Thankfully, I've managed to make some progress. I've broadened my horizons and found some meaning outside typical interpersonal relationships. The COVID situation (and fear for my sanity) drove me to pursue personal interests and meeting online communities. Heck, both of these things are the reasons why I'm putting together a stream-of-consciousness rant about my Ex alongside a public review on an anime logging site, lol. If that isn't peak nerdy, I don't know what is. All jokes aside, it feels amazing that I've found a respectful community and friends who share common interest, which feels like something of a luxury to me. I'm also making strides in those IRL interactions, meeting all kinds of people in college.
There is no certainty when I stepped out of the cage. It's close to a happy ending, but there's so much I'm unsure of. The happiness I desire, until and unless it materializes, is and will remain a complete mystery to me. Sure, it's possible, as is the instantaneous heat death of the universe, or monkeys typing a word-for-word copy of a Shakespeare play. All these scenarios are probable, but none have ever occurred. People I know say there is hope for me yet, and the intangibility of their normal existence hangs over me regardless. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, but I can't pretend that I can see it. But on I strive, to find my best self in an unfamiliar world. On I push, in the faint hopes that the happiness found in her cage was just the beginning. On I fall, with the dream of one day finding out what it means to stretch out my wings-
And fly.

Special shoutout to @Lumpy for inspiring this review. I was toying around with the concept of a personal anecdote within a review, but initially conceived that plan for a different script. I only realised that approach would suit Liz when I read his now-privatised review on the show, so I'd like to thank him for the solid read.

I also want to thank each and everyone of you who read through the full review. It'll probably remain as one of the strangest things I'll ever post publicly, but this is the way I wanted to make my love for this show known.

If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other [reviews](https://anilist.co/user/AnimeDweeb/reviews) for seasons past and present. I also frequently post writeups under my list updates, so definitely take a peek if you'd like to see me mald over anime as they hit the airwaves. Peace"
16664,"Kaguya-hime no Monogatari, O que se leva da Vida



O texto contém spoilers, mesmo que estes não sejam de muita relevância no entendimento da obra, recomendo que tenha visto o anime antes, caso apenas queira uma recomendação... Veja o filme, eu garanto que não será igual a nada que você já tenha visto. 
Para a organização das imagens dentro do texto foram usadas as abas de spoilers, clique nelas para abrir as imagens, elas são parte importante da análise.

Introdução

Uma preguiça, como disse seu amigo Hayao Miyazaki, havia reacordado, 9 anos e 5 bilhões de Ienes, muito tempo e muito dinheiro dizem alguns, entretanto esse foi o necessário para criar a maior obra de animação da década de 2010, quiçá do século XXI. A obra mais cara de toda a história midiática japonesa, Kaguya-hime no monogatari, do diretor Isao Takahata, nunca chegou a se pagar, mesmo com seu grande sucesso de vendas. Entretanto, dinheiro é dinheiro, arte é arte, ela é feita daquilo que necessita, e o resultado foi de uma grandiosidade inigualável, e o que faz desse anime tal ícone é o que será abordado nesta análise.

Do Japão Feudal aos Tempos Modernos

Taketori Monogatari, também conhecida como Kaguya-hime no monogatari, é uma história folclórica datada do século X, a mais antiga prosa japonesa que se tem relato. Narrada de boca a boca e escrita em pergaminhos por todo o Japão, sua importância no país é tão grande que duas das possíveis fontes do nome do monte Fuji vem dela. Sua adaptação por Isao Takahata buscou respeitar o máximo possível deste legado, tentando cumprir a maior parte do roteiro fidedignamente. Entretanto, seu objetivo não era fazer uma cópia animada de uma história tão velha, mas sim adaptá-la, criar sua versão, para isso alterações se fizeram necessárias. Uma das coisa introduzidas por ele é a sua interpretação, no original o motivo de Kaguya ter vindo à terra é incerto, algumas variações dizem ter sido um pecado cometido no Reino da Lua, outras que teria sido por uma promessa antiga, porém, nenhuma delas é certa. O diretor então introduz sua versão, ela teria descido ao mundo dos humanos por querer ver suas belezas, por ter ouvido sobre elas de um outro deus que já havia estado lá. Outro ponto alterado é o desenvolvimento da protagonista, para que o drama em torno dela seja mais eficiente.
À parte destes aspectos e dos detalhes adicionados para trazer renovação e profundidade à adaptação, muito é feito pensando no legado desse conto para a cultura do país. Opta-se por manter diversos elementos de caracterização clássicos utilizando mesmo pinturas antigas na elaboração de cenas, em sua composição, coloração, design, entre outras. Como pode ser visto abaixo:

!
img600()

img600()

img300() img300()
img600()
!

Nota-se as referências diretas aos quadros e o uso de composição e coloração análogos aos clássicos, como o Yamato-e e o Ukyo-e. Resgatando, assim, a cultura nipônica tão defendida por muitos autores, principalmente pelo estúdio Ghibli, além disso, elas ajudam na contextualização da trama em seu período histórico.
O grande respeito pela cultura, entretanto, pode apresentar seus problemas. Adaptando fielmente um conto tão antigo acarretou problemas de roteiro, ter que lidar com os clichês presentes nele. Muitas das complicações, a fórmula de progressão, as mensagens, são bastante batidas e mesmo a própria releitura introduz novos, tornando ele o ponto mais fraco dessa construção.

Every Frame a Painting

Kaguya é sem dúvidas um marco visual para a animação. Seu estilo original chama atenção, principalmente por contrariar diversos outros muito difundidos, mesmo os utilizados dentro de seu estúdio. Quando perguntado sobre o assunto, Takahata diz que sempre quis utilizá-lo, principalmente depois de ter trabalhado com algo parecido em Tonari no Yamada-kun, com o artista Osamu Tanabe, que também é responsável pelo character design  aqui. Ele diz também que, embora já tenha sido utilizado em outros trabalhos de animação em célula, essa técnica de desenho nunca foi profundamente explorada e que ele iria fazê-lo.
A influência histórica foi, provavelmente, o ponto-chave no interesse por esse estilo. Ele se baseia é em uma tradição centenária no Japão. O Sumi-e, conhecido também como pintura caligráfica ou ink wash, em inglês, é uma vertente de arte nipônica, de origem chinesa, que tem como princípio base a caligrafia, utilizando-se de linhas bastante ostensivas em tinta preta, chamada de Sumi. Masterizado ao longo dos séculos, ele influenciou diversas outras escolas, mesmo através de países ocidentais.
A caligrafia é datada anteriormente à cristo, tornou-se como arte na China durante a dinastia Tang e, após a adoção do budismo, foi levada ao arquipélago japonês no século XIV. Desenvolvido lá durante os séculos seguintes, misturou-se culturas já existentes, e mesmo à outros de origem européia, criando outras escolas como o Nanga e o Shijo.
Suas filosofias seguem muito da tradição zen e o minimalismo. Coisas como: mais pode ser expresso com menos; o uso de cores não deve ser exagerado; a essência é demonstrada com poucos detalhes; balanço, claridade, harmonia e simplicidade.

!
img300() img300()
!

É comum em textos ver as características do Sumi-e presentes em Kaguya-hime serem confundidas com duas vertentes de arte ocidental, o minimalismo e o impressionismo. O minimalismo nasceu século XX, seu ideal era o de utilizar o mínimo necessário em seus trabalhos, porém, sem representar a realidade, simplesmente criar utilizando-se apenas do apelo estético, toda a interpretação seria feita pelo observador. Quanto ao impressionismo, ele surgiu no século XIX como uma forma de retratação do mundo que nos cerca sem o uso de linhas, com pinceladas fortes e evidentes, utilizando cores puras e tonalidades que representam bem iluminação, tentando passar uma abstração do real de maneira mais essencial do que havia sido feito anteriormente. 

!

img600()
!

As semelhanças entre os estilos são notáveis, entretanto, tão são as diferenças, cada um bebe de fontes diferentes. Mesmo que o impressionismo tente captar a visão do artista, ele faz isso através de composições complexas, de diversas cores e iluminação, além de não usar linhas. Ainda que o minimalismo use paletas reduzidas e composição o menos complexas possíveis, não é seu objetivo a representação do mundo real. Em Kaguya-hime a influência é nipônica, Isao Takahata, um grande nacionalista, representa muito da cultura japonesa em suas animações, seja na técnica ou no tema, é muito mais cabível comparar, então, sua obra às vertentes de seu próprio país. Portanto, é mais prudente usar de base as ideias do Sumi-e, e suas influências, para destrinchar o visual do longa, seus motivos e objetivos. Mesmo que este não represente a versão purista do estilo, mas sim conceitos mais generalistas dele. Por comparação ele está mais próximo de algumas pinturas das escolas Nanga e Shijo.

Nota-se, com isso, que existe aqui um grande resgate histórico no uso desse traço, porém ele também possui um grande apelo estético, trazendo grande identidade às composições, sendo essa uma das grandes motivações que levaram à sua utilização. Ele ajuda, ainda, a criar a atmosfera de conto clássico e o impacto em diversas situações, principalmente nas feições caricatas dos personagens. 
Ao animar esse traço surgem ainda outras características. Como por exemplo as “inconsistências”, que são consequência de um ideal do diretor. Para ele uma das coisas responsáveis pela falta de alma na animação moderna, é o polimento dos desenhos, o animador faz um trabalho melhor quando desenha com o coração, rapidamente, instintivamente. Mas ao fazer isso os quadros saem levemente diferentes dos anteriores, o que causa a sensação de tremido, que poderia se considerar como erro, mas aqui contribui para o aumento da dinâmica, à agregação de movimento. Esse desenhar com o espírito, essa liberdade criativa deu origem à cenas incríveis, as mais impactantes, em quesito de animação, de todo o longa. 

!
img600()
img600()
!

Ambas sakugas encarnam o papel máximo dessa ideia na obra, a sensação de impacto e movimento só é obtida por conta do efeito esboçado. Linhas guiadas pelo sentimento, impacto criado pelo contraste, ambos extraídos do Sumi-e. 	
Além dessa, outra conduta muito perceptível extraída dele foi o minimalismo,  presente grande maioria das cenas. Ambientes com poucos elementos e/ou vazios, usando de tonalidades frias e pouquíssimo saturadas, com nuance ao invés de contraste. São as duas formas principais pela qual isso é entregue, a composição do ambiente e a paleta, cada qual tem sua fonte de inspiração e motivação.
A simplicidade da mise en scène e as partes em branco vêm do conceito do uso do mínimo pelo máximo. Segundo ele é possível transmitir a essência das coisas apenas quando se usa a menor quantidade de elementos comunicativos para representá-lo. Isso se une à uma visão do Diretor, de que quando se retrata a realidade não é necessário descrevê-la em sua completude, por essa ser comum a todos, apenas indicações dela, e a menor quantidade possível, são o suficiente para trazê-la à mente do espectador, em seu íntimo. Em obras de fantasia, pelo contrário, a imagem só existe para o autor, por isso ele deve representá-la totalmente, pois a diegese é inerente à quem cria. Para chegar, dessa forma, ao âmago da coisa concreta, deve-se utilizar da experiência do interlocutor, evocando suas memórias através de mensagens inteligentes, estas que são mais ou menos efetivas dependendo da capacidade do artista.  Essa filosofia aliada, principalmente, à dublagem, aos trejeitos e à animação, trazem o realismo tão perseguido pelo autor. Outro papel desempenhado por ela é o de trazer o foco ao primeiro plano da cena, onde estão os personagens ou outros componentes de maior importância no momento. Como por exemplo a cena abaixo.

!
img600()
!

Ela está para libertar o pássaro da gaiola, apresentando o simbolismo, um tanto batido por sinal, do pássaro que representa a protagonista em busca da liberdade, e do desapego que ela demonstra pela riqueza. O shot é bastante “simples”. No segundo plano apenas o papel em branco, uma árvore, o telhado com uma lanterna pendurada e outro telhado de outro prédio, todos em tons acinzentados, com baixíssima saturação. No primeiro plano se encontra a personagem, a gaiola e o pássaro, em completo destaque. O que está ao fundo é o mundo, seu aspecto é comum à todos, entretanto o que está à frente é o momento, o sentimento, que é inerente à obra. 
A imagem acima destaca, também, um fator muito notável, o bom uso da paleta de cores. As cores frias e/ou pouco vibrantes, utilizadas para criar a atmosfera triste, e os fundos “incompletos”, são quebrados pelas cores mais fortes, principalmente as quentes, como o rosa e o vermelho. O resultado é a ampliação do efeito de realce do primeiro plano, chamando ainda mais atenção para o que é preciso. Além do mais, esteticamente, isso é muito inteligente, como quebra de constância na imagem. Para exemplificar a cena abaixo é interessante, embora isso seja utilizado durante boa parte do filme.

!
img600()

Ela ocorre durante o sonho da protagonista com seu antigo lar. Nela aparecem as cores frias de baixa saturação em quase toda a seu todo, dando o ar triste. No fundo incompleto e pouco detalhado há apenas a indicação de que a floresta continua. Vindo à frente está a menina, o componente mais chamativo, o rosa bastante avermelhado de sua roupa quebra a constância da gradação, como uma nota diferente e alta em uma música. Um tempero que agrega estética ao momento, mas que também realça a tristeza demonstrada na feição dela, por mostrá-la com tanta ênfase. Ainda mais à frente está o galho com botões, uma mensagem de que a floresta ainda não morreu, o botão marrom não é tão evidente quanto o rosa, mas ainda é visível pelo contraste de cores. Uma mensagem que não precisa de tanta atenção quanto os sentimentos da personagem.
Um trabalho muito diferente, embora de nível similar de qualidade, dos outros de Kazuo Oga, em geral. O diretor de arte é muito famoso pelos seus backgrounds no estúdio Ghibli, em animações como Tonari no Totoro, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, Mononoke-hime, entre outros. Neles se destacam a sua beleza, complexidade, naturalidade, paleta viva, com poucos contornos e valorização da cor em si. E então quase o seu oposto é feito em Kaguya-hime, backgrounds pouco detalhados, que apelam para a retratação parcial, paleta de baixa saturação e valorização dos contornos, para que se mesclem ao das pessoas e animais. Mesmo assim ele corresponde à sua fama, segundo Takahata, sem ele e Osamu Tanabe o longa jamais teria tamanha qualidade iconográfica. 
Para resumir quase todos os atributos visuais que tornam esse anime o que ele é, a cena seguinte é ideal.

!

Ela começa com um chão frio preenchendo a tela toda, nele uma peça de roupa branca. A câmera anda e então outra peça branca cai, mais uma, essa vermelha, e, em sequência, um arco-íris de roupas toma o chão acinzentado. Elas gritam na tela: “ela está se livrando de suas roupas caras”. A cena segue com Kaguya correndo na rua cinza esverdeada, a animação com seu traço esboçado transmite movimento, pressa, raiva e desespero, ela tira todas suas roupas até sobrar apenas a peça mais simples, quase toda branca, com apenas um pedaço rosa remanescente, este que é tão recorrente que já faz parte da personalidade dela. Ela se destaca na tela, indo em direção ao ponto de fuga do quadro, a lua, rogando por ela, deixando para trás sua colorida riqueza, de um mundo que ela não desejou.
	
Kaguya

Existem várias linguagens úteis a uma obra midiática, essas podem, então, muito bem ser empregadas na criação de um personagem, o artista capaz é aquele que sabe utilizar suas ferramentas, e tal é Isao Takahata. Ele os constrói através de elementos de texto, como fala, ação e dramatização, visuais, como character design, animação, cenário e fotografia, e sonoros, como dublagem, sonoplastia e música. Tornando, assim, seu elenco um dos pontos fortes nesta trama fraca. Tendo em vista que Kaguya é o pilar fundamental da narrativa, era, sem dúvidas, necessário melhorar sua caracterização em relação à original, o diretor levou isso além, trazendo-a até o espectador, tocando-o em seu íntimo. Um dos primeiros pontos que refletem nessa melhora é o seu desenvolvimento. 
Aparece em um broto de bambu uma boneca divina. Um velho senhor recolhe-a acreditando ser uma benção dos deuses. A boneca viva torna-se um bebê ao ser acordada e daí então segue se a progressão do tempo com o espectador acompanhando o crescimento dela, suas descobertas, alegrias e tristezas. O aspecto de contemplação nessa parte da trama é bastante ressaltado, a trilha sonora suave e alegre que combina instrumentos japoneses clássicos com ocidentais, ajuda a transmitir a sensação de paz e calmaria. Porém, mesmo em momentos belos os fundos brancos azulados dão o aspecto de tristeza e é durante uma cena feliz de brincadeira infantil que percebemos à que o filme veio. As crianças cantam a música Warabe Uta, a qual terá um tópico dedicado abaixo. Então Takenoko começa a cantar junto, entretanto canta uma letra diferente da música, com uma dublagem triste, uma letra igualmente, enquanto olha o horizonte cheio de vida. A dublagem aqui, e durante o resto, é responsável por muito da carga emocional. A dubladora, escolhida a dedo, conseguiu a vaga justamente pela sua melancolia na voz, dentre dezenas de candidatos, selecionada por um dos artistas mais rígidos neste quesito. Além dela, a dublagem, a atmosfera de tristeza implícita construída até aqui, junto com o enquadramento do ambiente e o silêncio, despejam as emoções do personagem e transformam o momento no principal eixo da personalidade da pequena, a tristeza. 
No segmento posterior a este o cortador encontra dentro de um bambu um pote de pepitas de ouro, dias depois de dentro de outro voam tecidos caros, ele interpreta isso como uma mensagem dos céus para que ele dê à sua filha o status de princesa, assim ele constrói uma mansão da cidade e eles se mudam para lá. A inocência da criança não a deixa perceber o que havia acabado de deixar para trás, mas aos poucos a tristeza toma conta de seu cotidiano. 
Aqui um ponto importante, o uso de dramatização como tentativa de construção forçada do personagem é uma técnica muito comum. O uso de plots exageradamente dramáticos e, usualmente, sem profundidade como tentativa de aproximação rápida com o espectador. Claro, isso não cabe aqui, essa não é uma dessas animações, ao contrário, o drama é, sim, parte integrante da trama e é construído parte à parte desde o começo, utilizando todas as suas linguagens para tal. Da criança sorridente à adolescente deprimida, a trajetória de Kaguya passa por diversos pontos, e a progressão da sua personalidade se dá por consequência de sua história, e não o oposto, ou seja, a história não é uma desculpa para sua personalidade final. Sendo assim o espectador é transportado para a vida curta de menina e acompanha-a em um caminho de tristeza. 
Obviamente não é só o roteiro e o texto que constróem-na tão bem, a linguagem corporal, carro chefe dos dois mestres do estúdio, representa um ponto fortíssimo. Diversos fatores contribuem para uma boa expressão corporal, mas é a mímese, a análise e reprodução da realidade que nos cerca, que é a origem da qualidade. Na análise de [Tonari no Totoro](https://anilist.co/review/4174) , no item “Do Especialista em Animação”, foi discorrido o mesmo que é válido em kaguya, ambos amigos de estúdio utilizam a mimese da gesticulação humana aliada à animação e, principalmente nesse caso, ao design. Uma imagem pode explanar muito bem isso, nesse caso uma série delas, um gif, embora neles não sejam possíveis capturam a incrível dublagem do cortador de bambus, que completa eximiamente o momento.

Música e Poesia

A trilha sonora com certeza é um de seus grandes pontos, suas melodias simples de ritmo lento são o silêncio musical ajuda na imersão no que a obra faz de melhor. Elas podem mesmo passar despercebidas em determinados momentos. Entretanto, existem duas canções que se destacam das outras, são elas Warabe Uta, com sua variação Tennyo Uta, e Inochi no Kyoku. Ambas compartilham de mensagens muito parecidas, mas são aplicadas em momentos diferentes. 
A primeira, Warabe Uta, é uma canção baseada em cantigas infantis cantadas em brincadeiras, escrita por Isao Takahata e Riko Sakaguchi, ela tem um estilo muito semelhante à abertura e ao encerramento de Tonari no Totoro, todavia aqui o objetivo é diferente, ao contrário da felicidade inocente, aqui o que paira no ar é a melancolia. A primeira vez em que esta música aparece é na cena citada, em que Takenoko canta com as crianças, ela continua Warabe no Uta com uma letra diferente, sua variação. Ela é cantada com a voz triste e profunda da dubladora, à capela. Como já dito, ela entrega à que veio o filme, em um momento de tristeza não dependente diretamente de complicações de roteiro, a partir daí ela é usada sempre que há lembranças do passado, para marcar o momento com um elemento que já foi associado à vivência no campo e à melancolia, um leitimotiv. Quanto à sua letra, ela é o segundo motivo pelo qual a música traz esse sentimento, e é nela que está inserida a reflexão. Podemos notar isso em seus versos:


>Warabe Uta

Maware maware maware yo mizu kuruma maware

>Gira, gira, gira
Roda de água, gira
Gire e chame o senhor sol
Gire e chame o senhor sol
Pássaros, insetos, bestas
Grama, árvores, flores
Traga a primavera, o verão, outono e inverno
Traga a primavera, o verão, outono e inverno

Gire e chame o senhor sol
Gire e chame o senhor sol
Pássaros, insetos, bestas
Grama, àrvores, flores
Flor, frutifique e morra
Nasça, cresça e morra

É bastante evidente, ainda mais conhecendo a história do autor, sobre o que fala a cantiga. Na primeira estrofe, os quatro primeiro versos trata do passar do tempo, da vida que corre, que gira, para todos, para qualquer criatura viva, pássaros, insetos, bestas, grama, árvores, flores, eles que representam a segunda mensagem, a beleza do mundo. Então nos dois últimos versos, conclui-se dizendo o que já era implícito, o tempo passa, você nasce, cresce e morre. A versão Tennyo Uta continua o pensamento introduzindo significado ligado à outra parte do plot também:

>Maware megure megure yo harukana toki yo
Megutte kokoro o yobikaese
Megutte kokoro o yobikaese
Tori mushi kemono kusa ki hana
Hito no nasake o hagukumite
Matsu to shiki kaba ima kaeri komu

>Vá girando, venha girando, girando
Ó tempo distante
Venha girando, chame meu coração
Venha girando, chame meu coração
Pássaros, insetos, bestas
Grama, àrvores, flores
Me ensinem como sentir
Se eu ouvir que você anseia por mim, eu retornarei para você

Esta estrofe adicional se refere à música alterada que a protagonista ouvia de outro deus que havia estado na Terra, porém, também se refere ao que vêm após a morte,, à saudade da beleza da existência terrena. Isso é reafirmado durante várias partes do filme, como música aparece novamente no tema de encerramento Inochi no Kyoku (Quando me lembro dessa vida). Sua letra abaixo:

Escrita e interpretada por Kazumi Nikaido, uma budista moradora de um templo em Kyoto. A filosofia da religião é bastante óbvia nas letras, assim como em várias partes do filme. A parte instrumental serve de base para algumas OSTs, com um princípio parecido com o usado em Warabe Uta, só que ao invés de introduzir, ela encerra o desenvolvimento. Os versos que, talvez, melhor representem as duas mensagens, são os presentes no quarta e nas duas últimas estrofes. Mesmo que a letra pareça romântica, um olhar atento e percebe-se sua ligação com a reflexão proposta pela adaptação. Ela encerra, de maneira tocante esta peça de arte.
Essas duas canções são a demonstração mais explícita do conceito: “viva a vida, ela é bela, porém curta”. A maneira com que a história original foi adaptada reforça essa interpretação, a vida de Kaguya passa mais rápido do que o normal, e seus momentos de felicidade são ainda mais, apenas sua infância valeu a pena, o resto de seus dias na terra foram devorados por um ideal social de felicidade , cercado por riquezas. A vida que queria experimentar na Terra foi engolida, pouco tempo de alegria e então apenas o sofrimento seguido de uma “morte” precoce, de volta à Lua. 
Pode-se dizer sim “mas essa é uma mensagem muito comum”, realmente, porém não executada dessa forma, com tantas bases de sustentação, tantas boas bases.

Flor, frutifique e morra

Paku-san com certeza foi uma que deu origem a um dos frutos mais ricos na história da mídia, seu último antes de uma morte triste aos seus 82 anos. Kaguya-hime no monogatari é uma obra incrível em diversos pontos, a carga emocional e estética são usados com a maestria de um gênio que se renovou até seus últimos dias. Intencional ou não, o que torna essa história trágica ainda mais triste é saber que o velho senhor fala sobre a beleza e a fugacidade do que viveu logo antes de deixar o enorme buraco, irreparável, no mundo da arte. Deixou para trás renovação dos métodos de animação e da cultura japonesa, seu legado, a semente deixada por esse fruto, cultivá-la é tarefa dos que estão por vir. No fim: Vou me lembrar, tenho certeza, quando eu lembro desta vida.

Wakare, Takahata-san (1935 - 2018)"
16706,"img()

Is the story of this show a masterpiece? No, but it’s very, very entertaining nonetheless. To summarize, this is the third and unfortunately likely last season of The World Only God Knows. The basic plot is that Keima Katsuragi was tricked into signing a contract to rid, “lost souls,” from attaching themselves to girls with empty/hurting hearts and to do so, he has to make girls fall in love with him and obtain a kiss in order to fill, “the emptiness of their hearts,” with love for him instead, pushing the loose soul out in the process. Now I won’t go into discussing the previous season’s worth of context, but Katsuragi goes from girl to girl helping them in various ways that show genuine care and respect for each girl in a way that I thought was quite touching. Each girls’ “arc” is tremendously good as well, some are better than others, but it’s guaranteed to tug at your heart strings a little bit. However, there was one important thing I left out: the girls forget Katsuragi existed in their lives once the spirit is removed, making them completely oblivious to his nerdy self afterwards.

So what makes the third season special? This time, six “Goddesses known as the Jupiter Sisters” put themselves in six of the girls Katsuragi has helped, which fully bring back their memories of him. Now you can imagine this causes quite a…predicament as multiple girls try to get Katsuragi at the same time. The resulting drama is beyond entertaining, I have never seen so much lore and depth in a harem show before watching this. Each and every episode leaves you wanting more until it reaches its grand finale at episode 12. Tragically, you’ll find out later that there are 40-50 odd chapters that are still left and will never be animated. Even more tragic, is that the manga is not even in English print, so you can’t support the creator even if you wanted to. If you can read Japanese, however, you can buy the whole series for very cheap and it is well worth the read.

Expanding on what I said previously without spoiling anything, this harem is unique in a way that you really are rooting for pretty much every girl in this show. There is no, “best girl,” “blue hair destined for second place girl,” or anything of that nature. Each character is developed so solidly that by the time you get to season 3, you already know most of these girls’ trauma, likes/dislikes, and their personality. It made me actually sad to know that in a story like this, there can only be one girl picked. I really wanted all of them to win, to get the happy ending they deserved, and have a nice epilogue with Katsuragi. In a sense, every girl is best girl in this show. There really aren’t any bad choices and who actually wins will leave you stunned at first, but not surprised once you think about it.

The visuals were pretty good in this show. There wasn’t any jarring CGI, the animation looks great for 2013, and the action scenes were pretty good.

The audio of this show is actually very interesting. The voice actress that played Kanon Nakagawa in the first season actually launched a successful idol career from this anime and you know what? The songs she has in this show actually slap.
Give it a listen if you don’t believe me, it’s the real deal I can assure you.
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyJJqPskHyg)

If you couldn’t tell already, I really enjoyed this show. The first season starts pretty slow, but it goes from 0-100 very quickly. Even if you aren’t a fan of harems, the MC has a knockoff PSP 3000, what is there not to like? What’s cooler than an anime with a PSP knockoff in it? Spoiler: !nothing is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)!"
21887,"There's always that one romantic comedy or drama that comes along every once and a while, taking itself so seriously that it approaches the point of absurdity. Fuuka is one of the latter, and dear merciful Christ is it absurd. Fuuka is a story about love, music, and fucking both of those things up so hard that they don't even look like the same things on the other end. All of your favorite characters from all of fiction are present, like, MAIN CHARACTER and BLUE-HAIRED HEROINE. In a surprising turn of events, they end up going to a concert or some shit together after meeting on the roof (original idea do not steal), where they walk around a statue looking for each (on opposite sides) for FIVE. WHOLE. MINUTES. Because of this life changing experience of statue searching, blue-haired Fuuka decides she loves MC, who's name I couldn't care to remember if you threatened my life, and that she OWNS him and MUST have his love. Of course instead of telling him this, she acts all pouty and sad for 12 episodes instead.

Fuuka leads everyone on by coming up with this stupid idea to start a band and play cover songs, to which everyone agrees is an amazing idea for no reason. Fuuka can sing because plot convenience, and MC decides that he'll learn to play bass because he's cursed with crippling beta-itis. They then gather your typical group of magically musically competant high-schoolers, such as SPORTS McDRUMMERGUY, RICHY PIANO-PANTS, and CEVANT GUITAR-GIRL. Guitar-Girl is seemingly a mute until she notices that she talks to MC on Twitter. This unbreakable bond that could stretch across universes and destroy galaxies cures her of her mute and stoic attitude, and this facet of her character is never explored again. Because of Twitter.

Everyone's rose-colored dreams of starting a band a destroyed by MC's celebrity childhood friend, SHIRAYUKI'S VA. She's hopelessly in love with MC and became a successful solo artist by only writing songs about she loves MC for no reason other than being the doomed-to-lose childhood friend trope. This creates all sorts of wacky situations for the band, like going to the beach and being mad for no reason, getting stoned to death on stage because of a misunderstanding, and generally having severe bouts of anime-romance induced autism. Oh, and at the end of it all Fuuka runs away from everything to become a solo artist because it's impossible for the heroine to be forward with her feelings despite being an incredibly forward personality in all other facets of their character so we'll have two more episodes I guess.

In an incredibly ballsy move, the show actually puts SHIRAYUKI'S VA and MC in a relationship, which is satisfying for all of 3 minutes until you realize that even SHIRAYUKI'S VA is just a hollow husk of nothingness that you've projected the motivations and charm of another character on for no reason other than that they had the same voice actress. MC then continues to sulk about how his beautiful celebrity girlfriend, reasonably successful band, and overall perfect highschool existence just isn't fucking good enough for him. He ends up dumping celebrity girlfriend because he realizes that he loves Fuuka because of plot convenience and no real character motivations other than that ""it was episode 12 and we needed a climax"".

I wrote this before the last episode aired and I don't give a flying fuck how it ended. Fuuka is everything wrong with anime romance drama rolled up and decorated with a nice little bow. They should show this shit to directors as an example of what to NEVER DO. The entire experience feels like if someone really not-talented watched White Album 2 and said ""Hey man I can do that I think"". Thankfully they had someone with real talent draw a couple of the character designs because even though they're generic as all fuck at least they are sort of pretty to look at as the rest of the plot burns down in a blazing fire of autism.

Leave this show in the dumpster fire it belongs in."
141902,"Film Red is the second most idiosyncratic One Piece movie, thanks to its overt reliance on musical performances and the spotlight focused on Uta, a new female character. It also has the benefit of bringing out Shanks, who is one of the most important yet mysterious characters in the original work, as an active participant. While this is not a canonical story, I have found a lot to enjoy this time around and wish to share my thoughts and feelings with some open-minded readers.

Of course, it is hard to ignore the commercial success of the movie's theatrical release, which proves Film Red has resonated with many thousands of people across Japan. However, I will warn those who are expecting more of the same that they may not always find it here. Thus I can at least respect, even in the midst of disagreement, those who felt this movie struck a discordant note.

Why are there such vocal viewer reactions, alternatively expressing their love and hate for the end product? It's because Film Red brings together a relatively unique mix of rock opera, character drama and all-star battle through a couple of daring artistic choices. Thematically speaking, this movie also implicitly challenges a few of the assumptions that are common among a certain percentage of the One Piece fanbase.

As you can easily imagine, that approach will not sit well with everyone. For me, Film Red doesn't seek to establish a new standard in terms of shonen battle spectacle, but it still reflects a key part of the emotional core of One Piece. There is plenty of merit in this.

From a certain perspective, one of the great virtues of Eiichiro Oda's manga masterpiece has to do with the value of found family and the clash between different ideals of justice in a world that can simultaneously be incredibly colorful and whimsy while also continuing to be fundamentally unfair and occasionally outright cruel. Despite all of the twists and turns of this latest cinematic narrative, I would say the movie remains true to an interpretation of this idea.

STORY: 7.5/10

In many fictional stories, the most admirable heroes are those who simply fight against absolute evil and win. In the case of One Piece, there are plenty of those situations and our hero Luffy usually has his heart in the right place, but for me some of the best parts of the original story focus on the struggle of those characters who combine virtues with flaws and imperfections. Even if their motivations are ambiguous or even misguided, I have always been more interested in the little stories of characters who, whether important or not, at least try to stand up against the world to fight for what they believe in. Sometimes they win, sometimes they fail.

Regardless of the merits or even the desirability of either side's beliefs, there can be a lot of poignancy in those moments. It doesn't matter if you're part of the Marines, Shichibukai or Yonko...your position doesn't necessarily mean all of your beliefs are right or wrong. Sure, we all know that One Piece is ultimately a Shonen Jump publication and this means there are certain ethical limits. I don't expect the grand tale of Luffy and his friends to end on an unhappy note, to be honest, but the story has occasionally reached towards exposing a darker underbelly than what its colorful surface suggests. In the long run, we trust those glimpses into a dark reality are only obstacles and a brighter future is waiting for our cast of characters.

On the other hand, there is also a degree of artistic value in the act of depicting what would happen in the One Piece world when the pressures are just too strong and you'd rather escape from reality...both for yourself and for the sake of others (or say, to meet the expectations and demands of others). In a way, that same sensation of tension and determination is part of what I can appreciate about Film Red's script.

Predictably enough, it isn't simple to make One Piece: Film Red fit into any specific part of the larger One Piece story. You would quickly find small and large inconsistencies upon looking at the chronology. 

Yet, speaking only for myself, I was able to watch the movie as a standalone project with ease. When we are dealing with an alternate non-canonical storyline, as almost all One Piece movies are, the screenwriter can afford to play rather fast and loose with the absence and presence of various characters, abilities or locations.

Is it perfectly written? No. Does it need to be? Nope. While the formal narrative is arguably the weakest link in Film Red, it has also incorporated quite a few of the themes of One Piece while bringing a certain amount of fresh air into the room. I happen to find the features and consequences of that decision to be worth appreciating in multiple ways.

In short, Eiichiro Oda himself supervised the creation of this movie and he was getting tired of creating ""legendary old men"". With a small number of honorable exceptions, most of the One Piece theatrical entries have fallen into a rather typical methodology: Luffy and the Straw Hats run into a new and seemingly all-powerful male foe, leading to a great battle where this enemy is inevitably defeated. Everyone can go home and be happy. The End.

That's all well and good, but at some point it's nice to add a little variety. Based on that premise, the story of Film Red is less of a straightforward pirate action adventure and more of a vehicle for the exploration of a new fictional character, Uta, through the use of musical expression. It would not be out of line to say that the term ""musical battle"" has been applied both literally and figuratively to this production with controversial yet arguably excellent results.

Specifically, Uta, the idol and songstress who is the undeniable center of this movie, represents a concrete departure from the norm.

Saying too much would be a spoiler, but the first half of Film Red is essentially built to introduce us to a set of mysteries. Mysteries with a degree of useful foreshadowing, as a matter of fact, although not everything will be immediately clear. To be sure, there are at least two big plot twists that aren't even remotely hinted at in the trailers. One of them is rather typical and can be found in plenty of other fictional works, yet it is still comparatively new within the context of the One Piece universe.

Unsurprisingly, resolving any mystery usually requires exposition. Around the midway point of the movie, the pace does tend to drag. This mystery-solving, so to speak, does provide a number of secondary characters with a chance to shine, but I agree it can feel rather heavy in the moment. That said, the musical sequences were able to revive my interest whenever it threatened to drop.

Now, strictly speaking, it would be incorrect to label Film Red as a complete musical. There's been some hyperbole about most of the movie being nothing other than songs in the old-school Disney fashion, which is objectively inaccurate.

However, I can find a grain of truth in that statement. The viewers' ability to enjoy this project will rely, to a considerable extent, on their willingness to open their hearts and minds to what the movie is trying to do. Frankly, this is always more of an emotional process than a purely logical one. If that fails, then the entire house of cards will crumble and you'll leave the theater bored and bitter. Not my personal case, yet I can understand why other folks might reach such a conclusion.

Once certain narrative keys have all been unlocked, Film Red's story pace speeds up during the second half and there is a large-scale battle waiting at the end. Yet this time, I would readily recognize that the outcome of the battle is the least interesting part. As spectacular as it is to see certain unexpected team-ups and so many powerful attacks being used...the real threat is not the external enemy, but an internal one. It is there that the Film Red script will play its final card and, for my money, the gamble was worth my investment. Naturally, this will vary depending on the viewer's own preference, tastes and capacity for empathy.

To put things in perspective here...any truly action-based movie like the mega-hit One Piece: Stampede would place far more attention on the battle choreography aspect. Yet Stampede, for all of its adrenaline, felt comparatively emotionally shallow. I dare to say that One Piece: Film Red is almost the exact opposite. For me, the relatively underwhelming combat was compensated by more of a theatrical and engaging approach to the drama.

CHARACTERS: 8/10

Oh boy. I'll only discuss a limited number of individuals in detail, because there's a large cast involved here and it would take too long. Ironically enough...they're a lot, but not near the level of Stampede's famously enormous list of participating pirates.

That said, I found even the secondary or tertiary characters to have a more convincing in-universe reason to show up. You still need a certain amount of key One Piece figures to really sell the scale of the threat. Quite a few get their own small moment too.

Is that fanservice? Sure, but celebrating existing characters is fine. When it serves a valid narrative objective it actually doesn't bother me. In a perfect world, I'd have liked to see the Straw Hats taking on a more formal leading role, yet one of the unique freedoms provided by the concept of a non-canonical One Piece movie is that the staff can afford to experiment. In other words, the camera can temporarily move away from them a little bit to serve other purposes. They'll continue getting more than enough development and a strong public profile in the main story, so there's no overwhelming urgency to feature them at this point.

Having said that, let's talk about the more central players.

Without being the deepest psychological examination ever, I think the storytelling's focus on the new character of Uta adds up to a fairly complex and potentially appealing characterization. From a bird's eye view, you could even draw a couple of contrasts with Nami's and Robin's arcs from way back in the day. All of which is part of why I'll honestly give Film Red a good amount of credit here.

Uta's motivations are tricky, because there's technically three of them, depending on what part of the movie you want to consider and how you interpret the meaning of these events. In this regard, her status as the daughter (!?) of Shanks provides a common starting point of understanding. Uta's background allows us to compare her with Luffy and his own aspirations. In practice, this achieves the goal of successfully introducing her to the existing One Piece world. The flashbacks are quite helpful as a method of humanization in this respect. Which is vital, given the twisted path the movie takes.

In a few words, there really isn't any other music-related character in One Piece with quite the same combination of positive and negative traits, especially not in the movies. She can go from genuinely funny and friendly to courageous, selfless, selfish, frustrating, annoying, pitiful, desperate and, yes, endearing. As a result, we can almost track Uta's emotional journey as communicated through the different songs. That's quite a novel approach for a One Piece project and, in and of itself, already makes her stand out. Furthermore, I recommend paying a bit of attention to her facial expressions.

I am not entirely surprised that people will either find a lot to love or a lot to hate in her, because both evaluations can be objectively supported. If we asked ten different people, we would get a significant split in terms of their judgments of Uta. Similarly, my own range of emotions towards her went through a lot of highs and lows...until the end, which left quite a lasting impression. With that in mind, I believe the creators of the film made the right decision to focus on Uta. Rather ambitious and even risky as an artistic decision, yes, but you'll never win big if you only ever dare to make entirely safe bets.

The other new individual of note is Gordon. Even though his screen presence in Film Red is significantly less than Uta's and his looks aren't anything special, I think Gordon was a surprisingly good fit for this story. While it's easy to dismiss him, especially without going into spoilers, there's a reason why ageless wisdom teaches us to avoid judging a person by his or her external appearance.

Next, there's the significant matter of Luffy. He is still Oda's eternal protagonist for the larger story of One Piece, by all rights and with all the benefits this position brings, but in this particular movie it's going to be a little different from the usual.

Luffy's still going to participate in battles and remains our nominal entry point into the situation. Yet, for once, his normal level of importance was held back by the nature of a standalone narrative focused on, gasp, someone else. Imagine that.

All the same, he still serves an interesting role in Film Red. In a sense, it's another way of putting him to the test compared to the usual type of enemies he has had to deal with.

You can also ask a number of questions as a result, not necessarily in the strict canonical sense but as general themes. What is Luffy's exact relationship to Uta? Does Luffy share her beliefs or does he maintain his own way of thinking? Can Luffy really solve every problem? What does Uta's story imply about Luffy's?

While it would require spoilers to address those points here, for me Luffy's role was still more of a positive than a negative.

Now I've finally come to discuss Shanks, who is the obvious elephant in the room.

Most viewers will be incredibly glad to see Shanks in Film Red. In fact, Shanks gets to do a lot more during this one movie than you might expect. More than what he's done in years, regardless of whether or not you're up to date with the manga. This inclusion might be debatable, because some other One Piece fans would prefer to keep Shanks strictly away from the spotlight until the original creator gives us all the details about him in a completely canonical work.

I can respect this way of thinking, despite not sharing it. Sure, there is also going to be some skepticism in light of the commercial nature of anime production. After all, Shanks was part of the promotional materials for the movie, but he isn't the protagonist. If you haven't paid any attention to the trailers, which make clear he isn't supposed to be the one central figure in this new story, that might be disappointing.

And yet, I would argue using Shanks in Film Red was a valid creative choice for two reasons.

First, because it's naturally cool to see Shanks as an active player in the action after so long. Why shouldn't we be hyped about that? They even found a creative solution to the ""impossible problem"" posed by Shanks being in a movie featuring Luffy.

Second, perhaps more importantly, because the movie does serve to tell us more about him. Both directly and indirectly.

There's his relationship with Uta, which has value in and of itself by developing Shanks as a father figure as well as by providing us with a curious method to reflect about the meaning of his relationship with Luffy. The way he reacts (or doesn't) to the events of this movie can show us more about his personality.

While almost the totality of the movie can never happen in the original storyline, I am confident that Oda made sure to supervise how Shanks would be depicted to guarantee he would be fully in-character here. Plus, as a bonus, we also get a couple of pieces of extra information about the past of Shanks that can add fuel to the fan theories about what's really going to happen with him.

ART AND ANIMATION: 8/10

Film Red was a very nice looking movie, for the most part. In particular, the musical performance scenes are a visual highlight for anyone who cares about this medium. Outside of the minor use of 3D with mixed results, I was pleased by the presentation, including quite a few nice storyboards. Great job!

Let's get this out of the way: yes, you can still find a number of less relevant sequences with pre-Wano arc levels of animation, particularly during a bunch of regular conversation scenes. It doesn't bother me, but I can see why those moments could take a few of the viewers out of the experience if they're used to the best parts of the TV series in terms of animation.

When the animators put their skills and resources at work, however, Film Red can be a feast for the eyes.

SOUND: 10/10

Perfect. No, seriously.

If you're going to make a movie where the use of music plays a central role in the storyline and one of the main characters is a singer, then the songs should be excellent. Otherwise, what would be the point of such an enterprise?

I'm glad to report that Film Red's creative staff made an impressive decision when they selected Ado to provide Uta's seven songs. She's great. Ado's collaborations with many famous artists cover a wide spectrum of emotional expression and musical genres, which bring a welcome variety to the sound of the movie and also feeds into Uta's characterization by reflecting her mental and emotional state.

They're used very well. I would say my favorites are ""Backlight"", ""New Genesis"", ""Tot Musica"" and ""Where The Wind Blows"".

Significantly, even the lyrics gain a different layer when you sit down to listen to them after watching the movie.

ENJOYMENT: 9/10

I like One Piece. Not as the most hardcore of fans, but enough of one to appreciate Oda's skillful storytelling and follow along with the storyline at my own pace.

At the same time, I think it's good to have movies where different aspects of the world of One Piece can be explored, even outside of strict canon. I welcome creators who try to do something new, even if it means taking a risk and not pleasing all of the audience.

The real goal of these movies isn't to satisfy every single person, which is almost impossible in this age, but to add new blood to the property and, at least in a manner of speaking, provide a path for new people to come in (and to make money, yes, but that is already evident to anyone reading this).

For me, Film Red has achieved the majority of what was required in this respect. As a work of entertainment, you don't necessarily need to be an expert on One Piece to appreciate this movie. In fact, I have heard of former One Piece fans in Japan who came back to see this film and had a good time. If at least some of them decide to pick up the manga or the anime, then this represents a net gain to the community.

Even so, there are specific things that will be more appealing to existing fans, especially those who are less interested in the result of a battle than in the emotional fallout. As mentioned elsewhere, this is less of a rollercoaster of action than a rollercoaster of emotions. If you are strictly logical and not particularly romantic (in the classic sense of the term, mind you), then Film Red may disappoint you.

In my personal case, I would like to invite anyone who found anything of interest in this review to give the movie a chance.

As much as I may love watching anime that deliberately challenges me as a viewer, whether thematically or intellectually, there occasionally comes a point where you want to leave that behind and focus your attention on something that just doesn’t do that. Challenging media is, for me at least, genuinely fun most of the time, but there is also something genuinely fun about allowing oneself to relax in the soothing placidness of something that strives to be warm in its tone and affect rather than brutish. Warmth, of course, is not synonymous with quality – goodness knows that one can still find a series trying to be fun incredibly dull instead.

Akebi’s Sailor Uniform was one series that aimed for that warm tone. The show caught my attention for several reasons, such as the simplicity of its plot and that studio CloverWorks was involved. It also reeled me in because it was, just like Winter 2021, one of three shows that were being produced by the studio. I couldn’t help but shudder at the thought of that. After all, hadn’t we already been through the rigmarole of this before, of not enough time being given to CloverWorks projects? We already knew of one series airing this season, Tokyo 24th Ward, that had this problem. So, even trying to maintain the sense that I should give the series the benefit of the doubt, I couldn’t help but beg that history not repeat itself.

New middle school student Komichi Akebi is excited to begin life at her new school, particularly because she gets to wear the school’s classic sailor uniform like her mother used to many years ago. After arriving and realizing that the school’s dress code has changed from sailor uniforms to blazers, the board decides to allow Akebi to keep her uniform, which makes the already-odd girl stand out even more. As the weeks roll by, Akebi will get to know all the various members of her class and try to make friends with them, as her personality will bring energy and life to virtually everything that she does.

The series itself is beautiful to look at, both from the perspective of animation and overall aesthetic. With a glistening sun and lush greenery to paint Akebi’s cozy little corner of the world, Akebi’s Sailor Uniform manages to already establish the warmth of its overall tone and setting before the first episode really gets going. It likewise serves as a solid introduction to Akebi herself, giving a visual indication of the personality and thirst for life and newness that she possesses. 

And Akebi’s personality is an infectious one; like many shows about starting life in a new place (whether that involves moving homes or simply moving from one stage of life to the next), her situation is one that is immediately identifiable. While the framework of her wanting to go to this specific school just to wear the sailor uniform is rather silly, it’s also a good window into Akebi’s way of being. She tends to be fueled more by almost-childlike enthusiasm towards the most ordinary things, taking each day as an opportunity to do or learn something new. For a character taking her baby steps into a new world, it makes her stand out as an endearing presence that, thankfully, does not cross into aggravating.

The soundtrack was another feature that stuck out, though not for the reasons one would normally expect; there is no bombast here, no larger-than-life tracks that produce grand, sweeping musical gestures. Most of the music, if anything, is rather inane or simplistic, opting for piano with a ragtime-esque feel. Given Akebi’s Sailor Uniform’s tone, this kind of laid-back, free and easy musical styling helps keep that comforting warmth alive and well. It wisely chooses only select moments when the soundtrack’s wings can stretch and take off, usually coming just before or during an episode or vignette’s most-tender moments. 

Since the series is largely made of smaller vignettes that may or may not tie into a larger episodic theme, the ability to enjoy the series is heavily dependent on its consistency. Akebi’s Sailor Uniform has a roster of characters where, even if one of their defining traits is not necessarily unique or inventive, the general tone of friendliness and camaraderie was apparent. From the perspective of drama, there is virtually nothing among the students that would or could lead to longstanding arguments or broken friendships. Rather, the problems the students have are, for the most part, surprisingly realistic because of their mundaneness. Even if television storytelling convention dictates that the problems will largely be solvable within twenty-four minutes at most, the series is less about solving the problems directly and more about setting the students either on a new path, or back on a path that they left behind. Akebi as the ball of energy serves both as the one who both puts the student’s perspective in focus and gives them the push to start.

Though it’s also true that the path the show pushes the characters to take can be a bit, to use a word, interesting. The series gained notoriety early in its run because of the prevalence of bare feet featured throughout the show. Having watched the series myself, I think the prevalence of feet has been comedically exaggerated to a fault, both in terms of appearances and the amount of time the show focuses on it. That does not mean that there aren’t a few moments where I wondered if a shot needed to linger on them for as long as they did or put as much detail into them as possible. But having said that, the number of times I got that impression was not even enough to call “a handful,” and the overarching warmth in the show was always enough to bring it back to its less off-putting territory. In this regard however, I do acknowledge that your mileage will vary on whether this is the case.

I’ve used the word “warm,” or some declension of it, throughout the course of this review, and that’s because it’s a series that always managed to be that way. It is not a series that promises any earth-shaking claims about the human condition, nor one that has darker undercurrents within. Even Akebi’s family life is free of this, as we come home nearly every episode to an adorable little sister and mother that, lovely as they are, are also not afraid to playfully rib or make fun of Akebi if the situation calls for it. Akebi’s Sailor Uniform sits comfortably in that starry, twinkling time where friends are made seemingly in an instant and there is no greater joy than being able to bask in the sunshine with them. Akebi and her friends cavorting around a mall was so pleasant to see, as well just enjoying the taste of one’s freshly-baked cookies. 

Akebi’s Sailor Uniform is a series where the wholesome warmth always shines through, even in some of its more head-tilting moments. Gorgeously animated and acoustically easy, the series adopts its more relaxed style and low stakes with charm. Not every student featured in the cast was particularly interesting, so the vignettes themselves can be a little inconsistent quality-wise. But even when it missed, it was still delightful. Every series that exists doesn’t need to be a lofty, turn-your-brain-inside-out venture that challenges our perceptions of the human experience, because experiencing something calm and sweet is just as important. As a detox for the pessimistic side of things, it happily did its job.

11285,"I think that the best anime (and perhaps just the best media, period), regardless of what they actually leave you with. Make you feel as though you've learned something profound--maybe even lifechanging--by watching them. The 2011 TV anime Black Rock Shooter is one such property. Combining an absurd amount of talent under one roof for its all-too-brief 8 episode run, BRS is a masterclass in welding theme to presentation.

While the literal central point of the plot isn't introduced until a bit later, the actual focus of Black Rock Shooter is emotion, and not just any amount or kind of emotion, very raw, very exaggerated emotion, and a lot of it (more seasoned anime fans than myself would be able to guess this simply by seeing Mari Okada's name in the credits as the scriptwriter). Most anime that have serious narrative arcs deal with emotions in some way, shape, or form, and they're usually fairly stylized, so this in of itself is not abnormal. What kind of is though, is the sheer unrepentant melodrama that Black Rock Shooter presents, and the degree to which it intertwines that with its themes. This is simultaneously the series' hook and I must imagine, the thing that drives the most people away from it. If you're not able to get a handle on the show's very intense emotional barrages it can be hard to sit through it at all, much less enjoy it. So this is a double-edged sword, but make no mistake, Black Rock Shooter absolutely would not work without it.

To put it plainly, a lot of shows have emotional torque, BRS has an emotional jackhammer. Negative emotions; sadness, despair, anguish, loneliness, are often conveyed through exaggerated, despairing facial expressions, pained--sometimes wrenched or even shrieked--voice acting, and a soundtrack that sometimes borders on the avant-garde, often forgoing simple ambience in favor of deliberately overwrought (or poundingly percussive) piano or string pieces or disorienting, hard-to-identify dissonance. There is also a lot of crying; lovingly-animated, beautiful crying. Chipper protagonist Mako, shy artistic Yomi, damaged, willfully hurtful Kagari, the enigmatic Yu, and ""school counselor"" Saya all let tears fall more than once. There are definitely shows sadder than Black Rock Shooter, but few shove their characters' emotional problems in your face with this much gusto. And all of this ties into an overarching theme of surrogate pain. The audience is subjected to this as much as the characters themselves are, and this is put front and center by the battles. 

About half of BRS takes place in a twisted, surreal gothic otherworld inhabited by alternate versions of the characters, who fight and die so that their human hosts don't have to suffer--though if they do die their hosts suffer amnesia, something that comes into play in the series' second half. The otherworld is beautifully designed, massive gears, chessboard patterns, colossal iron rubik's cubes, seas of lava, and metal skeletons give the place a look that rests somewhere on the same block as a heavy metal album cover, but feels fully lived-in despite how comparatively little information we're fed about it. The fight scenes, it must be said, are remarkable. CGI gets a bad reputation and it's often unfairly associated with budgetless schlock like the 2016 Berserk anime, but here it is used to incredible effect. The otherworld is done almost entirely in CGI and the combat here is well above par when compared to just about anything from the last decade. They're visceral too, the other selves' natures as literal stand-ins for emotional trauma seem all the more real when they're stabbing each other and technicolor blood goes spraying in four different directions. This is to say nothing of the surreal brutality of the weapon designs, which often evolve and twist in strange ways from scene to scene, sometimes changing shape entirely (such as when Strength's Dr. Octopus-esque bionic arms turn into a sort of railgun as she whales on Black Rock Shooter herself). And when they don't do that, they stretch the definition of ""weapon"" to its very limits, see Deadmaster's undead army, capped by a pair of gigantic, floating, glowing green skulls.

This is Black Rock Shooter's entire point, really. The violent ballet of fight scenes as code for human emotional struggle. The more Mato (and the other girls) avoid confronting their problems, the harder the other selves fight, and the more they risk losing their memories, and while the literal threat of induced amnesia is obviously not a real one, on a less concrete level, this applies very much to the real world too, it doesn't take a psych major to know that suppressing your emotions isn't very good for you. The theme is revisited repeatedly--most frequently through the in-universe children's book The Little Playful Bird--and through the abstraction rings crystal clear up until the finale. One of the very last scenes, where Mato just out and out squeezes Yomi and cries all over her, is emotionally cathartic in a way that a lot of media tries to be, but only rarely is the mark hit this well.

So is BRS ultimately just a very longwinded metaphor for the power of honesty and a good cry? Well, yes and no. Simple, resonant themes are worthless if they don't resonate. But it's hard, especially in 2017, to not feel for Strength whimpering that the real world is ""scary"", and in a cultural environment where more than ever we are encouraged to put on fronts and appear to be people we're not in order to appease others (let it be said that millennials are masters of code-switching), it's surprisingly poignant. Combine that with fight scenes that foreshadowed what Kill la Kill would do just a few years later and some of the best CGI the medium's ever seen, and it's genuinely difficult to not recommend Black Rock Shooter to anyone who can process its emotional extremeness."
170,"Before there was Kuroko there was Sakuragi. “Slam Dunk” is one of those iconic 90s series that didn’t just leave a lasting impression, it actively influenced a whole manner of people. Both the manga and anime helped spread basketball to a Japanese as well as Chinese audience leading to the NBA gaining popularity in East Asia. Its impact on the sports genre is undeniable. For the 50th anniversary of Weekly Shonen Jump they released a collage of their protagonists through the years and had Sakuragi in the front row with the likes of Goku and Luffy. But what is the secret to its success? The best place to start is with the story.

Hanamichi Sakuragi is a delinquent at Shohoku High School famous for two things: for his explosive temper and being rejected by a total of fifty girls throughout middle school. One day he meets a girl named Haruko Akagi and is immediately smitten while she is impressed by his tall, athletic build. When she suggests he try the basketball team he hurls himself at the opportunity to impress her. The problem, however, is he has a total lack of talent or knowledge of the sport. In spite of that he declares himself to be a basketball genius, something he will boast throughout the series. After she introduces him to the sport he meets the cool and gifted Kaede Rukawa. The two immediately clash due to their opposing personality types as well as the fact that he is the boy Haruko, as well as most of the female student body, is in love with resulting in a rivalry. As the story moves forward he meets Shohoku’s team captain, and Haruko’s older brother, Takenori Akagi and the other members. Together they work towards realizing Akagi’s dream of winning nationals while Sakuragi stakes steps towards becoming a true basketball genius.

“Slam Dunk” manages to be both a great sports anime as well as a great coming of age story. Sakuragi spends a great deal of time throughout the series struggling with basketball. This I feel is as it should be. He was a total novice who never heard of dribbling before, so naturally he won’t be a star player until he really educates himself and practices. Once he reaches a point where he is playing basketball for himself and not merely to impress Haruko it shows how far he has come as a person. And it isn’t just Sakuragi who has interesting things going on with his character. We have the history behind Shohoku’s team and their struggles. Seeing how Akagi worked so tirelessly to aim for the top despite coming up short through the years endeared the character and made his iconic quote “if you give up, the game’s already over” carry so much weight. The story of Mitsui going from an MVP to falling off due to an injury and coming back around to reentering the sport was one of the emotional highlights. There is an enjoyable friendship between Sakuragi and Ryota who shares quite a deal in common with him. Even a character like Rukawa who initially seems to be just the quiet, stoic type has some layers to his personality that keep him from being dull. He is not a great student, yet he is fully devoted to the sport. So much so that his play style is perceived by others as selfish and difficult to work with. And while Haruko is there as Sakuragi’s love interest and initial motivation, we also see her as a very intelligent and helpful girl whose advice is shown to be incredibly valuable. Not to mention Sakuragi’s delinquent friends like Yohei, Shohoku’s vice-captain Kogure, the characters from the rival teams like Uozumi and Sendoh, this is a cast filled with very well constructed and enjoyable people.

“Slam Dunk” at its core is the result of Takehiko Inoue’s own personal attachment to basketball. Like Sakuragi he joined his school’s basketball team growing up thinking it would lead to him being popular with girls. In time he found himself to be just enamored with the sport and this passion definitely carried over into the anime adaptation. Despite the limitations of TV animation in the early 90s there is a real sense of excitement in these episodes. Seeing the matches play out is thrilling, you actively are hooked and want to see if Shohoku will win. And when the time came for Sakuragi to really come into his own and pull off something impressive, something that nobody expected him to do, it leaves you feeling so in awe. I am not somebody who is very interested in sports personally and I went in not having more than a surface level understanding of basketball and its rules. What I found to be extremely beneficial was that as the story progresses the audience is gradually fed information about the sport and how it works. This is something we come to understand as Sakuragi does and it’s not done in a way that would feel tedious to someone with a preexisting knowledge. It’s woven into the episodes seamlessly and this is largely due to the fact that when making the manga Inoue understood that he needed to provide this information in order to win over the audience. Again at the time “Slam Dunk” was in circulation and airing on Japanese TV basketball was a rather unpopular sport, by informing the viewer and exciting them through the material it built popularity among Japanese youth. The feeling I get when I think back on the series is one that is humble. It’s a person saying “here is a sport that brought me great joy, would you like to see a story about it”. 

When I started “Slam Dunk” I only knew the basic outline of the story and in the end I feel what I was given far surpassed my own expectations. I felt as if it transported me back to the early 90s, it’s less of a case where it feels dated and more of this feeling that they captured time in a bottle. The characters, they drew me in. The story kept me entertained for all one hundred and one episodes. What I would consider to be something of a drawback though is the anime is not a complete adaptation. The manga ended just a few months after the anime did. Instead of creating a forced ending to the TV series they found a place to leave us off that, while still fulfilling, is not the way Inoue concluded his manga. When it was over I didn’t find this to be a major flaw as I liked where it stopped, but if you go in thinking you are getting the full story that the manga laid out I will tell you that is not the case. That being said I think there is still plenty of reason to watch the anime. The voice cast is fantastic, the music is great, the designs are highly appealing, and that passion Inoue filled his manga with is still present. It is that fire, that energetic love for basketball that is the key to its success. Watching it I was completely able to see why this series inspired so many people. In the words of Sakuragi himself, you’ll watch won’t you?"
131773,"""Wonder egg priority"" is an original anime which aired for 12 episodes in winter 2021. It was an unique show with unique animation which drew me in.

I would say for an original anime it was pretty good, but it couldn't be said the same for how it concluded.




It's about a bunch of 14 year olds who had lost someone important to them, and discover an ""egg"". And when the break the egg they go inside a parell world and save some (already dead)teenagers by clearing/ getting rid of their trauma. By doing this the person they had lost would come back to life.


But however, after I finished the 12 episodes and the special, I feel empty and disappointed. 

Especially by the way they concluded the story in the special episode.




It was lacklustre. The characters were barely moving. Things happening made no sense, and it felt rushed.

The script was written poorly. Many things weren't explained. Not to mention the first 20 minutes turned out to be an unneeded recap. The special episode was only 46 minutes overall and they wasted whole 20 minutes on recap.


1, How did Neiru disappear?? Unless Neiru and her sister were the same person she wouldn't disappear. They were just siblings so it made to sense for her to disappear, just because her sister is now alive.

Not to mention it only happened to Neiru and not to the other girls.


2, HOW THE HELL DID NEIRU'S SECRETARY HAVE THE VIDEO OF HER DREAM??


Correct me if I am wrong, but aren't eggs and parell worlds supposed to happen in dreams? If so then there is no way the secretary could record her dream.. unless they live in the future, which I don't think they do.

3, How did Neiru meet frill and why were they standing in some water-like place? 

Was it the Parel world? But it didn't seem like the usual place...

If it was the real world, wasn't Frill in the basement without anyway out of it?



And even though we get to know how Koito died, it felt very flat. Who did she threaten? Who was she waiting for? What does Sawaki sensei have to do with her death? 

And most importantly, who is Sawaki sensei really and what does he want?  He's perceived by the girls as a phedo , a genuine kind person and as an annoying teacher who wants ai to come to school. What is his true nature?

I wish the mystery surrounding him would have been closed too.

And this is completely my personal opinion but I wanted Ai to move on and start a new life. I didn't like that she was hung up in the past.




Overall-

Even though lacklustre and rushed, I am glad they concluded the story because for the past 3 months I was loosing sleep over this Koito and Sawaki mystery. 
Thank goodness they ended it.

It wasn't bad, just extremely mediocre"
21714,"“It is not what's there on the screen that disappoints me, but what's not there.” 

Although this quote is used in reference to the influx of computer generated imagery in film at the beginning of the 21st century, it perfectly summarizes how I feel about Flip Flappers.

What the audience is presented with is, at its best, a marvel of animation and a beautiful synergy between three main characters, but at its worst, a lacking overarching story that feels repetitive in and of itself. As the story forces itself to develop, it starts losing the magic of wonder and adventure that it proved that it was capable of perfecting in earlier episodes. The highlight of this series is the episodic, and fails to create conflict developed enough to justify straying away from it. 

The end result is a series that has extremely well-made scenes, writing, storyboarding and the elements that captivate fans of magical girl, adventure, and artsy anime, but too much of the rest of the series is dedicated to trying to be overly ambitious on stringing together an elaborate, scientific, yet godlike, supernatural conclusion.

To say that this series did not know what it wanted to do, or what it was doing, is a disservice to the production team behind it. They knew exactly what they wanted to do, and the audience can easily note where each piece is introduced and expanded upon in order to fulfill the studio’s vision, but this series fails to reach the level of sophistication that the team was looking for.

[Studio 3Hz](http://anilist.co/studio/6069/Studio3Hz) is still a new studio. They’ve only had two other series in total, one of which was an adaptation. I believe they aimed too high, too early. Flip Flappers could have easily been improved with a couple of rewrites, and both a heavier episodic focus or spending the time to think about how to better the story further are equally plausible scenarios that can drastically formulate a series where there is exclusively those moments that make the audience want to love it.


However, they are absolutely still impressive. I have nothing but respect for the people who worked on this show because Flip Flappers provides concrete evidence that they are capable. Polish is needed. But only polish, is needed. A new staff isn’t needed, a new animation style does not have to be invented, and I look forward to hearing about a new project.

I genuinely recommend this series to all fans of the genre that this series touches upon, but personally forewarn that as it develops, it may start to lose you. Despite episode 5 being possibly one of my favorites of all time, it lost me enough to the point where I had mixed feelings and where I had to question whether or not I actually loved, or even liked this series.


I wanted to love this series, and particularly in those specific episodes and scenes, I do. 

It brings agony that I can’t say that I always do."
20599,"A series I ended up enjoying much more than I thought I would, even with the four-year age gap between our main characters. Our main character Nike has that Orihime/Usagi design, looking mature beyond her surprisingly tender years. She was only 16 when her father negotiated the hands of one of his daughters (Which ended up being hers naturally) to the Sun king of the world.

You could be forgiven for mistaking her for a 23-year-old young woman. The Sun King, her significant other, on the other hand, resembles his actual age of about 12. No older than Naruto from part 1. It can be unsettling, at first, but the more you watch, the more you become entranced in their fun dynamics and that discomforting feeling of a 12-year-old and 16-year-old being engaged is washed away.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. 

(Oh, and for those wondering, despite Nike's name being spelt the same as the famous Nike brand, it's pronounced Nickkay)

The synopsis - We have our heroine, who ended up moving to a foreign land to help her poor country. The series showcases one of its strengths as Nike and her sisters end up hilariously deciding who should be the king’s bride with a game of rock, paper, scissors. As soon as I saw that scene, I knew I was in for a treat. There is a small, rather predictable bit of subversion here where the sisters fed Nike ridiculous ideas about the king being some big, hair-horned demon and if you’ve seen enough anime, you probably already knew that wasn’t going to be the case.  
Thankfully, the predictable subversion of an ugly prince turned dashing is only the tip of the iceberg. 

The series fulfils the feat many a show has failed before it in showing without telling. When Nike arrives in this new, foreign land, we see her attempting to buy food with what little money she has. A stand owner offers her what he considers a generous offer, but because she’s from a secluded country, it still looked very pricey to her. 
We then get a hilarious scene of the store clerk shooing her away because he doesn't wanna catch her “poorness”. Heh. 

Continuing this theme of showing and not telling, Nike’s naivety is depicted well when she believed the feigned kindness of a couple of thieves when she tried looking for a place to rest for the night for the long journey to the king's palace the next day. The thieves take her bag and dash off into the night and due to her emptied stomach, she wasn’t able to use her power to retrieve her belongings. 

Thankfully, for our heroine, two kind sisters offer her hospitality. Naturally, neither believe her at first that she’s a princess who was sent to their country to marry the king considering there’s only one king who rules the entire world. Her country’s borders were already closed long before the Sun King conquered the rest of the world. Think One Piece, for example. The World Government controls most of the world outside of Wano because Wano’s borders were closed off, thus the World Government couldn't take control of it. 

I had no issue with The World is Still Beautiful using the concept of a secluded country to bypass the Sun King's dominance. 
Nike’s wholesome interactions with the two sisters served its purpose well to lighten the tone after Nike’s rather miserable experience up to that point. She even gets back at the thugs who stole her bag when they mistook the older of the two sisters for her and made off with her for a hefty ransom. We get to see a small demonstration of Nike’s powers when she effortlessly manhandled the fodders, blowing them back with the wind before forcing them to chaperone her to the palace as punishment where she meets her fiancée, the Sun King, Orvinus Ifrikia Livius I, or just Livi for short.

Nike has a hilarious off-screen scruffle with Livi’s guards, much to the young king’s amusement.
The series’ biggest strength lies in Livi’s and Nike’s dynamics. The author pulled off all the stops in their arsenal making their relationship so dynamic, pleasant and just all-around fun and engaging, and for good reason. Livi and Nike aren’t the most unique characters, with Nike being your typical rambunctious, fish-out-of-water tomboy keen to explore the world and Livi being a tortured soul hiding his insecurity behind a cold, black-hearted façade. Alone, they’re serviceable at best, but together, their chemistry sparkles to create something magical.

Livi is even revealed to be delightful and flirty once he discovers Nike is someone with who he can let down his barriers around and just be himself. The sneaky little guy even steals a kiss from her which just made my heart swoon with emotion. They really excelled one another to new heights, and better yet, never overshadowed the other. I never got the impression Livi was overshadowing Nike or vice versa. Nike was strong-willed and more than capable of standing on her own two feet.

This leads me nicely onto another good point the series did exceptionally well, and that’s It didn’t fall into the pit hole of mistaking strong-willed for bitchy.
This is a common error popular series like Dragonball, Ranma One Half, and Naruto has already made, turning what should be determined girls into obnoxious bitches. It ultimately makes their interactions with the main characters so unpleasant and painful to sit through, particularly in the case of Ranma and Akane. It’s just not pleasant to see a toxic relationship. 
Thankfully, Nike and Livi never fall into this trap. They support one another, banter and genuinely act like a couple. They don’t pussyfoot around like other anime couples either. The trials and tribulations they go through only serve to heighten their relationship and bring them closer together. 

The antagonists never overstay their welcome.
Episode 6 is the best example of this and ends up becoming my favourite of the bunch. It introduces Nike’s rival character for Livi’s affections; a childhood friend of the latter, and rather than drag out the inevitable for episodes upon episodes, she simply questions Nike’s love for Livi, challenges her to a race for them and respectfully steps down when she loses. I absolutely love this! We didn’t get any elongated drama with the childhood friend coming between our heroes. Instead, she’s used in a single episode to strengthen their relationship. 
Even the misunderstanding between Nike and Livi’s uncle who attempted to make moves on Nike is resolved beautifully. Nike even uses her rain power to trap the two, Livi and his uncle, inside the grass house from the beautiful rain shower she was unleashing upon them so they would hash out their differences.  

Saving the best for last; the rain. It’s depicted beautifully, lending the series a Disney-esque magical feel, and as someone who grew up on stuff like Beauty and the Beast and The Swan Princess among many others, this was highly appreciated. The power to make it rain is a feat that’s been passed down among Nike’s people for generations and serves as Livi’s main incentive for wanting to marry one of the king’s (of that small secluded, island) daughters. Livi and Nike initially butted heads over this because Nike felt he was devaluing the rain ritual.
Specific conditions have to be met pertaining to Nike’s emotions in order for her to unleash the dazzling rain shower upon the land with a beautiful melody echoing across the landscape. Making the rain ritual a difficult thing to pull off was a great choice. It lent the series so much emotional weight and gave the scenes so much soul and heart. 
This was a touching and heart-warming ride that I can’t recommend enough. I'm highly surprised this is the first review of the series considering how good it is, in my opinion.

But leaving the jokes aside, what is ""The Dungeon of Black Company""?

Is an isekai adaptation of the [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/99802/The-Dungeon-of-Black-Company/) that goes for the same name, created and drawn by [Youhei Yasumura](https://anilist.co/staff/123076/Youhei-Yasumura). This adaptation was made by [SILVER LINK studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SilverLink) and directed by [Mirai Minato](https://anilist.co/staff/120531/Mirai-Minato), who has worked as a director in other anime series like [""BOFURI""](https://anilist.co/anime/106479/BOFURI-I-Dont-Want-to-Get-Hurt-so-Ill-Max-Out-My-Defense/)."" or [""the Great Jahy""](https://anilist.co/anime/132456/The-Great-Jahy-Will-Not-Be-Defeated/) betwen others.

Whats the main appeal of the anime / manga?

The parodies about toxic work enviroments, laboral explotation, greediness of mega corporations, loyalty to a company / brand and surprisingly innovation. Yeah lots of themes that could be used masterfully on a seinen, but are used in a more satirical silly manner by the author of this Isekai.

Ninomiya is one of those characters with a disgusting personality but what do you end up liking

SPOILERS AHEAD


Story:

Our main character Ninomiya, is a guy who invested in some real state goods and got really good results. With the money he got he decides to live the rest of his life in a deluxe pent house as a rich Hikikomori, forgetting about work and other mundane ocupations. But suddenly he gets Isekaied in a really surreal way, by a random portal that opens below him. he ends up working for the Raiza´ha corporation on a dungeon mine, where employes suffer for constant laboral explotation and are teached to be loyal / grateful to the company. there Ninomiya has to work his way out using all his cunning and dirty tricks at his disposal. Alongside he gets to know new partners or ""minions"" that will help him acomplish his goals.

img400(https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRlkMj5ABbjAsdxOf-HAKXsB6Em5gDqr86AvQ&usqp=CAU)

One of the main issues for many with the anime is how the story goes back and fourth with weird plot twists or deus ex machinas.

two examples:

The one time he travels to the dystopical future with Rin. In this future the earth is a wasteland dominated by the demon king, after Raiza´ha destroyed the dungeon´s ecosistem. it gets explained kind of why Ninomiya ends there with the pillars technology. But it surely a big wtf moment that felt kind of anti climatic for the episode and series. 

In the same arc when they find out that the ant that Ninomiya befriended was a general of the Demon King, like i know Ninomiya can get out of trouble most of the time with his trickery but was this necesary?

The tittle of the anime comes from the name that Ninomiya gives to his at the time illegal company ""The Black Dungeon Company"" which goal is to overthorwn  Raiza´ha and create a work enviroment where monsters and humanoids can work together without distinction.

So have that in mind, the story is more or less a mess the more the season goes on.

Scene where Ninomiya created the Black Dungeon Company
img400()

Overall the story is not a strong part of it, thankfully the series doesnt take himself seriusly the majority of the time making it possible to enjoy all the random things that the anime throws at the viewer. Ofc if you want a good story that has sense and a great character development arc, this anime is not what you are looking for. Is a simple silly story that parodies concepts of modern capitalism with a direct aproach.



Animation and Visuals:

The animation by SILVER LINK is a really average one. Dont get my wrong the anime is not horrible or gross to look at, but certentaly the animation could be 10 times better. Some of the characters movements are stiff and the 3d... Oh lord the 3d is as bad as you would expect for a average seasonal anime adaptation. 

The main cast
img400()

The series uses a lot of bright colors alognside heavy drawn lines and some peculiar eyes design, that move a bit out of the norm.

Meanwhile the animation is ok, is not the strong part of the anime by any means.

The music for other part is good most of the time and helps with the atmosphere of the sequences. The ending and the intro are really good ones!

Opening:

Shimi / By HOWL BE QUIET

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0j1VvtOh-E&list=PLN0oa9VCoViMRipR0KtPvZVB57UIT8zW-&index=36)

Ending:

World Is Mine / By Humbreaders

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRKLpHqwHjw&list=PLN0oa9VCoViMRipR0KtPvZVB57UIT8zW-&index=14)


Characters:

This is one of the strongest parts of the anime for me. I could get why some people might dislike the characters, they are really cartoonish stereotypes. But i think that makes the series able to keep a silly tone in which more serious and grounded characters could break the feeling.

Ninomiya: a decent MC that always has some trickery hidden and ready to go when needed, thats doesnt mean he always gets what he wants.A big part of the series moves alongside Ninomiya trying to fix one of his mistakes or getting out of bad situations. he´s not a hero by any means, he uses others and manipulates them in order to achive his goals. Although at the end he some times ends up making more good than evil.
img300()

Rin: she is a hungry monster ""majin"" that Ninomiya finds with Wanibe in the first episode of the series. She gets promised food in exchange of protecting Ninomiya and his allies. Most of the time she serves as comic relief, doing silly stuff and one shooting powerful enemies. She gets some character development during the season, passing for being that hungry op monster to a more caring character that worries about her friends and her sister.
img300()

Wanibe: he´s a lizardman, that contrary to belief is weak and more of a coward. He serves as the voice of reason in the group, normally pointing out the dumb stuff going on and arguing with Ninomiya about his dirty plans. he ends up helping Ninomiya most of the time and against his own will. He has a decent development from a coward and shy person to a more determinated and caring one at the end of the season.
img300()

Shia: she is an expert adventurer and one of the most skilled and devoted employes in Raiza´ha. She joins the group by force after being tricked by Ninomiya. She´s serves as another voice of reason inside the group, but she´s more vocal about it than Wanibe. She being a skilled adventurer serves as fighter alongside Rin. She starts to develop a crush for Ninomiya with a tsundere like stand and starts to care more about the group members towards the end episodes.
img300()

Ranga: the last main character. he gets introduced in the future arc as a more or less deus ex machina character. She dresses as a girl and has a femenine behaviour, but he´s in reality a boy. Leaving that weird stuff aside, he serves as magic support of the group helping Rin and Shia in combat. Its revealed that he´s in fact a decendant of Belza the actuall CEO of Raiza´ha , that made him suffer from social rejection and his fathers ending up dead.
img300()

Belza: She serves as the main antagonist of the series. She´s the CEO of Raiza´ha and has a selfish / careless personality. She doesnt care about the consequences of her actions and if something brings her more power and money she will go all out for it. One of her main goals is to be the ruler of society and be on top of everyone. She changes a bit at the end of the season.
img300()

Overall most of the characters are funny, simple and easy to understand. Most of them arent given much development, but this being a simple parody isekai makes it easier to forgive.



Comedy:

With this being a comedic parody this have to be good, right?

Well yes, at least for me. I had a really good time with the show, but for some people the humour might be dumb or cringe and i totally understand and respect that. Most of the comedy relies on the cartoonish / exagerated representation of modern laboral explotaiton that Raiza´ha put his workers on. The work is hard and unforgiving, the dungeon is dangerous and deadly at times, the miners have to praise the company and be thankfull to ""work"" there (be exploited).

it uses alongside that kind of unexpected moments that might be shocking or horrible, depending on your taste:

2 examples:

Wanibe being choked by a monster
img400()

Ranga gets.....
img400()

Another common one is Rin doing silly stuff or weird cartoonish / faces.
img240() img240()

Rin is capable of changing her body
img300()

Overall the humour is hit or miss, but for me was a decent hit and i enjoyed it.



World Building:

Another simple but interesting part of the series.

Everything is set in a modern world that reasembles the vibe of the early 90s, but that is filled with magic, dungeons and a more modern technology. There are still adventurers that go inside the dungeon to clean them and leave Raiza´ha mine the demonite, a mineral that grows inside the dungeons and can be used to craft multilple goods like equipment, electrodomestics, or just be sold.

Belza is the classical unscrupulous CEO, that just cares about gathering more power and money above all else
img400(https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTfcMwXsDWOIR0CbvPViXrqmFCSpe9Q9MREQ&usqp=CAU)

Most of people seem to dont care about Raiza´ha monopoly on the mineral extraction and how this affects the planet, in a similar manner how much of us dont mind using google for almost anything nowdays or oild companies that throw a shitton of dangerous stuff to the oceans and rivers. 



Themes:

Wasnt going to talk about this one because the series was a more comedical oriented anime with not much to learn from, but the last episode changed my mind.

The series around his entire lenght talks mainly about not giving up and being true to your beliefs. Ninomiya constantly fights against the odds and succeeds briefly, but then again another problem or issue arrives. Even with that he never gives up and tries to acomplish his goals with all the power to his reach. He ends up inspiring Rin to become a more caring person, Wanibe to be more secure and determinated, Shia to not be naive and over trust the company and to Ranga to be the one in charge of his life. 

Ninomiya knows that his beliefs might and will collide with the others, but he will still be true to them.

>""The true defeat will only be when they break my will"" Ninomiya



Ending:

!

We start the last episode with the results of Belza´s discovery. Ninomiya getting jailed and interrogated. 

img400()

After Shia comes to meet him at his cell and confeses that she was the one to blame for his incarceration, but Ninomiya answers it with a really decent monologue about his search of allienating himself from treats and why he does it. 

img400()

Belza thought she won, but at the shareholders meeting of Raiza´ha she´s giveng the role of director and surprinsigly Ninomiya gets to be the CEO. They achived that with a plan left by Ninomiya, this ends up with being Belza seemengly defeated and under the charge of Ninomiya.

After sometime Wanibe because Ninomiya´s recent behaviour / actions starts to belive that he wanted to return to Japan and left them. Ninomiya being a cuck doesnt get the misunderstandment and ends up revealing on a farewell party organized by the main cast, that he was going in fact to travel around the world to spread his influence.

img400()

Ninomiya goes back to the portal hidden on the mining camp, grabs the coin he lost in the first chapters, literally tells the coin to follow him and contemplate how he will conquest all the world

img400()
!



Conclusions:

The Dungeon of the Black Company is a fairly decent isekai that isnt free of issues and has a more or less subjetive appeal for his cartoonish parodies and humour.

The story goes all around the place with few moments that keep being relevant the more it goes on. The characters create a fun dynamic of a normally conflictive group, making up for some funny moments. 

The animation is ok for an seasonal anime adaptation, but could be far better. the comedy present is as i stipulated more or less subjetive, you can like it or hate it. In both cases you wont be wrong. One recomendation i have is that if you want to watch the series, lower your expectations of a good story with meaningful character development. 

The anime doesnt take himself seriusly and the parodies are most of the time exagerated versions of his irl counterparts. Turn off your brain and enjoy the funny mess that The Dungeon of the Black Company is.

It was a fun watch and i would totally be on board for a second season!

122052,"Dear lord, you have no idea how much I wanted to like this show. I really wanted to like this. I really did. More so than Demon Slayer, even. When Crunchyroll decided they wanted to try their hand at producing their own anime, a lot of people had mixed emotions, excitement and trepidation. Unfortunately, the latter wound up being more justified, as the majority of Crunchyroll's self-produced anime usually wound up being either mediocre (Tower of God and God of High School) or outright bad (Gibiate and Ex-Arm). The only one I was even remotely looking forward to was Fena: Pirate Princess, which promised to be a rip-roaring adventure series in the vein of stuff like Future Boy Conan and Mysterious Cities of Gold. So you'd think after the disasters that were their previous shows, that Crunchyroll would finally step up and make something that would actually be genuinely good, right? Well...at first, Fena seemed like it would go that way, but...it crashed and burned at the end. Not nearly as bad as, say, Wonder Egg Priority, but seriously, Fena: Pirate Princess as a whole is a massive disappointment on every level.

As a young girl, Fena Houtman was forced to watch as her family was slaughtered before her eyes. A friend of hers, Yukimaru, only managed to save her by sending her out to sea before her family's killers could pursue her. She winds up on an island called Shangri-La, and is forced to live in a brothel. The only thing she really remembers is her father's message: ""Go to Eden."" Years later, she's still there, and is considered at the age where she is expected to partake in sex work against her will. When an attempt to escape goes awry, a band of pirates manages to take her away from Shangri-La, Yukimaru being one of them. But her father's final message is still a mystery to her, and she and the pirates decide to try and find Eden in order to piece together Fena's lost memories and unlock the many secrets surrounding her life.

I wanted to be much more generous, especially with my rating for it, but the more I watched it and got closer to the finale, the more I began to realize that Fena, as a show, has really stupid writing. For one, it always seems to jump from one plot point to another without really bothering to either flesh them out or follow up on it. Fena's older retainers are taken hostage? Don't pay attention to them, we've got to find out who commissioned Fena's crystal! We find out who made the crystal? Oh, pish posh! We've got to find the coordinates for El Dorado! Wait, what's El Dorado? Who gives a shit! We need to have Fena be kidnapped by a group of female pirates and their crazy boss! A character's been sent to go after our group because they went against their main mission? Nope, we don't give a shit! Yukimaru needs to save Fena! What's this thing you call character development? You need to care that these characters are going from place to place even though they're being given no time to show what they're like outside of trying to save the world! Do you see what the problem is here? With the show being only 12 episodes long, it's given literally no time to really flesh out all the ideas it has or even follow up on them. It's like ten different writers are being called to write the script, but they can't seem to decide which ideas they want to focus on, so they just throw them all into a blender without considering if the end result will even work or not. As a result, the characters only act based on what's convenient to advance the plot and make really bizarre leaps in logic. Add to that, the story is just full of underutilized ideas, Deus Ex Machinas, and inconsequential philosophical bullcrap that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. This is a pretty clear case of too many cooks spoiling the soup.

As a result of this show's messy writing decisions, none of the characters are really all that interesting. The show tries to make us care for the band of pirates that Fena joins up with, but they're all so one-note and cliche that they feel more like props to move the story forward than three-dimensional people. We're never shown what their lives are like outside of the adventure they're on, save for a few short flashbacks that don't really do much of anything, and instead, the show makes the case that we, the audience, should care about them just because it says so, rather than, y'know, making the effort to make its own case for why we should. If you're going to make a rip-roaring adventure show, caring about the characters and their plight should be paramount, right?! Speaking of characters I can't bring myself to give a shit about, Yukimaru. Honestly, I never liked this guy. He always came off to me like an overly angsty emo edgelord who acts needlessly dickish towards Fena because the writers think it'll demean his masculinity if he doesn't. I honestly could not believe that this guy could ever have any friendly feelings towards Fena because of the way he treats her when he first appears. For one, he legitimately calls Fena a coward because she can't remember how to get to Eden, implying that she is somehow a bad person for her memories being blocked due to the trauma she experienced, even though there is absolutely nothing that says Fena did it out of malicious intent. The fuck?! Secondly, when Fena tries to learn how to use a weapon in order to help the pirates, Yukimaru shoots her down because he thinks she'll only cause trouble and says that she should just sit and do nothing. We're seriously supposed to like this guy?! Granted, the show seems to have realized how bad his first impression came across and tried to tone down his jackass behavior in the second half, thank God, but it still did nothing to really make me care about him as a person. Out of all the characters who never seemed to get any development at all, Tsubaki and the band of antagonistic female pirates are the more egregious examples, as we learn nothing about Tsubaki other than that he's often exasperated by everyone's antics, and...literally absolutely nothing about the female pirates. They just pursue the main group, kidnap Fena, with one lady being unnecessarily jealous of Fena for reasons that are literally out of her control, and getting killed when their ship gets hit with a cannon!...and just randomly coming back to life in the final episode with literally no explanation for how they even survived. WHAT?! Hello, show?! You cannot have your characters go through a situation that is guaranteed to kill them, and then just randomly bring them back to life with zero explanation whatsoever!!!

Personally though, Fena herself, the main character, is yet another victim of the show's bad writing decisions. At first, it seemed like she was going to be a plucky girl who'd join up with the pirates and learn to be more self-sufficient, kind of like Yona from Yona of the Dawn, or Shirayuki from Snow White With the Red Hair. After all, who doesn't like watching a character grow from being weak and helpless to stronger and more proactive, even if she decides to learn fighting skills or more practical skills like medicine or strategy? But here's the thing: Fena is never allowed to do anything on her own throughout the entire show. All she ever does is get kidnapped or have the plot explained to her, and the show seems to go out of its way to make sure Fena herself is never allowed any agency or autonomy. That time she led the pirates into the cave where the coordinates to El Dorado/Eden were? Fena didn't find out on her own, it's because a magic voice told her where to go to find it! And Fena never actively seeks answers out on her own. It's either always in her repressed memories, or someone else just hands them to her, and she always gets dragged around by the other characters, so she's literally little more than a prop. To me, it just felt like Fena was just there to be a macguffin damsel in distress, which is really sad, because she actually does have a personality and a lot of potential as a character that goes completely unutilized! If the show wanted to, they didn't have to necessarily make her some action girl who kicks ass and takes names by killing people. She could have just as easily become their captain or maybe become a tactician and led the pirates through her own efforts. Instead, she's just pushed around and only made to act whenever the story calls for it, and...if you ask me, it kind of reeks of sexism here. And no, the dumbass revelation in the final two episodes absolutely does not justify this at all, no matter how much it tries to.

In all honesty, the only good things Fena has going for it are the animation, done by Production IG, and to a lesser extent, the soundtrack. I say to a lesser extent because while I've always admired Yuki Kajiura's music, her work here doesn't sound as good as her previous stuff. It doesn't have a whole lot of oomph to it like her soundtracks for .Hack//Sign, Pandora Hearts, Madoka Magica, and Demon Slayer did, or even Sword Art Online, for that matter! Tl;dr, Fena is a show with a lot of potential that got squandered by trying to do way too much, and not enough with elements that could have worked had it actually gave a damn about them. Seriously, I could write a better version of this story! Fena is basically a knock-off of much better adventure shows, like Future Boy Conan, which was the first of its kind and laid the groundwork for the entire premise, and The Mysterious Cities of Gold, which is revered by all who saw it because of how much care and effort that was put into it, and is pretty much everything an adventure series should be. Fena tries to be like both shows, but completely lacking in the things that made the two I mentioned above so good, and there are reasons why those two anime are revered to this day.

And yet, having said all that...out of all the shows Crunchyroll has made, I have to begrudgingly say that this is actually the best one they've made. Tower of God and God of High School are just compressed adaptations of longer Korean webtoons, Gibiate was just a complete mess of a show that suffered from a lot of the same problems Fena did, I haven't seen Tonikawa, Onyx Equinox, or Spider Isekai, and I don't think I need to mention what an absolute trainwreck Ex-Arm turned out to be. But all in all, Fena: Pirate Princess is just a cheap cash grab that tries to emulate previous adventure anime while failing to execute any of its ideas in any meaningful ways. I'm just glad to finally be done with this and move on to something else. I'm gonna wait for High Guardian Spice to come out and see how that fares now that it's finally going to be released."
20627,"Seiken Tsukai no World Break has a very unique magical system and reincarnation theme. I have never seen any other anime that creates something similar to what Seiken Tsukai no World Break introduced. To understand this unique magical system, there will be some spoilers to this review.

(Picture Source: Amino Apps thru' Google Image Search)

First of all, students who attends a private school in this world are all people who used to be a hero or villain from their past live. While attending school in modern day Japan, these special students also inherited both their powers and memories from their past lives. Within the school, those with exceptional strength and control over their powers will be recommended to join a special squad created and under the orders of the school to protect and defend Japan from monsters that crossed through time and space. 

img()
(Picture Source: Amino Apps thru' Google Image Search)

Next is the magical system. Unlike many other anime where people simply chant, wave their wands, or even just snapping their fingers, Seiken Tsukai no World Break makes their characters perform spells in a very unique way and one that I have yet to see appear similarly in other anime. Reincarnated villains will need to write out their chants before the spell could work. 

Of course, in reality, the effectiveness of it is really questionable because the higher the level of the spell you wish to use in this world, the more you will need to write out. However, the magical system is quite unique, and it is applied only to reincarnated villains. I think it is a way to differentiate between the reincarnated heroes and villains in the series.

img()
(Picture Source: The Chuuni Corner thru' Google Image Search)

With a better understanding of the magic system and the world building, we could now take a look at my thoughts on this anime.

Our main protagonist of the story, Haimura Moroha, is definitely not your typical student with only one past life. The story focused a lot on Moroha's desire to protect the people he loved, not just from the time and spacing crossing monsters, but even from humans who threatened the safety of his loved ones. There was an arc where he single-handedly went up against the Russian leader for the reincarnated. 

However, the anime has some triggering factors that is understandably the reason for its lower popularity. The series has its usual harem genre revolving around Moroha and sexual-related advances but it is very subtle (the character who does it is just crazy about Moroha's butt for some reason).

(Third reason in the spoilers here but be warned that it may be uncomfortable for some of you)
!Of course, the triggering factor is mostly the incest relationship Moroha had with his sister in his past live which was carried forward to modern day. While there are arguments that they are no longer siblings in this age, it still puts quite a lot of people off that Moroha is still willing to pursue a romantic relationship with his reincarnated sister.!

img()
(Picture Source: The Chuuni Corner thru' Google Image Search)

Despite the negativity I mentioned, the series is still an enjoyable show for me. Thankfully, whatever I mentioned in the spoiler isn't very obvious in the show as Moroha seemingly favours the other; I would chalk it up to him feeling obligated to keep her happy and play along because of their relationship in their past life."

When i first saw this anime's picture i was attracted to the art style but when i watched it i learned that its much more than that. You see, this anime is unique by all means and it really saved me from getting bored this season since there isnt many new anime that arent isekai(really, this season is filled with them) so am going to explain why its so good in my opinion and what is bad about it, especially that this anime has succeeded in avoiding a lot of annoying aspects in other anime even famous ones

[[STORY] :](https://anilist.co/review/126047)
Summary of the story : 
Akira Shiroyanagi is an addicted gamer who get attacked in his way to school and pushed to the edge of the death, when he wakes up he finds himself with bunch of other people in a death game with multiple stagesmade by a girl who calls herself ""Mion"", granted with super natural abilities....everyone is trying to survive this deadly game

there isnt much to say about the story since all death game's story are similar but trust me the events that happens within the story and its characters is what makes it as good as it is

however, the story telling in this anime is so great and satisfying, it never leaves any element in the anime without well-directing it til it reaches the point thats going to either help the story in the future or fill some blanks to make the story feels rich and more enjoyable to watch

this anime has really managed it characters well and never left a character with nothing to do with the story and just stop showing, characters either be useful in the future or die....which is a great aspect that a lot of other anime miss especially ones with ton of characters where most of them are just abandoned

events in the anime are well distributed so you never feel that something happened too early or too late, also distributed in very understandable way rather than confusing, which is something that most other anime has succeed to accomplish but hey....its worth mentioning

the abilities in this show are veryyy uncommon to see even more than boku no hero quirks which is something that gives a fresh taste and make very interesting fights

While the character design feels lazy and generic, its actually so describing of the character itself...it just feels that the characters and their design is very suitable, you can tell each ones character just from the way they look and the clothes that they were

[[CHARACTERS] :](https://anilist.co/review/126047)

characters are the greatest aspect of making this anime my favorite this summer each one of them is somehow different from the other and am going to talk about them in the following form : i ll talk about the two main characters and the main evil character each one individually and the all the other side characters together in the same paragraph

Akira Shiroyanagi :
Without overstatement....this is one of the most unique protagonists you can ever find literally, which made it one of my favorites too, having a great intelligence is great but not that unique but you see....unlike most other anime protagonists....akira doesnt seem to give a fk about being the imaginary good guy who saves people and doesnt kill he's enemies, NO akira is a bit different.....he doesnt mind killing anyone he faces at all, also if it isnt going to help him.....he never put himself in danger and saves anybody (for me those 2 are really good thing becuz am tired of those anime protagonists who keep saying ""i will save you even if you are my enemy"" and ""i will save everyone"") infact akira will reach his goal whatever it takes like using people as tools to help him, although we dont know if he is actually interested in the other main character yuuri or just tricking her to trusting him and uses her as another tool(i hope its the first one tho). oh, did i mentioned that he is the only character i ever saw in a death game anime who doesnt really care about escaping the death game what he actually care about is fighting Mion again and making her regret giving him the ability she gave him, since we came to it now.......i myself watched anime for 7 years and never ever saw something that is even close to akira's ability, !your ability is whatever the other person thinks it is!, its just so genius
img220()

Yuuri Amagake :
The moment yuuri appeared in the show....i loved her a lot(not literally) whats not likeable about her? she looks beautiful, she has a Dark background(including suicide,parental carelessness,stalkers  and lawless childrens) and she is strong.....like seriously strong, now you might be thinking ""whats so special about that uh...Misaka(from railgun),Ereza(from fairy tail) and mikasa(from aot) are strong"" you probably dont get it do you?? by strong i mean really strong and useful, yes you heard that right the main female character of this show is useful, i know it sounds impossible but trust me its true...for those who didnt really watch a lot of anime.....80% of main females are useless af not even kiddint....just name her name any female main character they re all useless in most of episodes and they just get helped all the time every single one of them and i ll give you a lot of examples : nami(from one piece),sakura(from naruto),lucy(from fairy tail),uraraka(from boku no hero),asuna(from sword art online),nezuko(from kimitsu no yaiba).... they re all pretty useless pretending to be useful in few scenes but yuuri is different she is pretty pretty strong and doesnt cry for help every 5 seconds.....now you might be thinking that am overstating things but......dear reader have you ever seen a female main character kicking the ass of the final boss alone??? WELL, yuuri did that, also her being strong isnt the only thing that makes her usefull cause yuuri is the only one who can get the best out of akira's ability.....what a wonderful female main character right?
img220()

Mion :
There isnt much to say about this character because we lack information about her but there is somethings worth mentioning. This character is weirdly hateable to the point that makes you like her....not sure how to describe my feelings but....its something like that, this character is incredibly malicious and challenging in a way that makes every scene she is in meaningful to the story and fun to watch, i noticed a lot of people saying that her voice is annoying and they hate it a lot.....but to be honest.....they probably cant realize how suitable and important her voice is, am sorry but for me they are just kids like.....what did they expect a cute 12 years old girl's voice as an evil character??
img220(

Other Side-Characters :
well to be honest most of the allies characters are cliche in design and similar in character but they re always useful and remarkable and the best thing about them is that the story never give up on them, they always show and do something important from time to time, however i think this show has succeeded creating good evil character better than good ones(except for the 2 main characters) seriously.....evil characters in this show are very very hateable in a way that i like because i didnt really felt that i want the evil characters to die when am watching a show from a while but this anime reminded me what good evil characters looks like. The best thing about side characters is that characters like Kuroiwa,Shirasagi and Rin are as intelligent as Akira is, others like Ringo,Madoka and Kumagiri add a lot more spices to this anime.

[[ART/ANIMATION] :](https://anilist.co/review/126047)

This anime's classic art style in really high quality is just pure 10/10  nothing more to say about it, its just enduring

Sometimes you ll feel that the art is kinda wrack but thankfully it doesnt happen that often other than that it looks awesome and satisfying to watch,

animation is most of the times amazingly smooth and pretty acceptable. However there was some bad CG here and there lately which is something extremely bad and uncomfortable to watch but hey, some other big shows had very bad CG too like ""Attack on titan"" and ""Baki 2018"" but that didnt affect the quality of show that much and its still pretty watchable so why would it be a different case with this anime?? also despite the bad CG there was a lot of acceptable to really good CG or 3D rendered material in the show that was good and well blended in the background to the point where its hard to recognize its 3D from the first look(like 80% of images in this review)

[[MUSIC] :](https://anilist.co/review/126047)

actually pretty decent opening and osts they arent that good but not bad either
the only thing you should really do is GO LISTEN TO THE ENDING brooo its so fire and i found a lot who enjoy it even tho they arent fans of the show itself
img220()

[[OVERALL] :](https://anilist.co/review/126047)
i am really really enjoying this anime so far its been a while since i watched an anime that good these days are full of isekai shitty shows(dont get me wrong i dont say that all isekai are bad) and i feel eye to eye with the author even tho there is some bad things about it that i already mentioned they all are pretty ignorable for me aaand there is never a flawless anime right??
sadly there isnt too many people who cares about this anime which makes it pretty underrated for me like.....i saw much worse anime but they have more attention than this one. I think its not that they watch it but they dont like it...its more likely to be that they doesnt even try it because the genre of death games isnt liked that much from fans. For me this is the best new anime of this year just a little bit below ""Jujutsu Kaisen"", and just the fact that its underrated and its the only thing i could really watch this season made me raise up my ratings even more for this anime....and yeah, just give it a shot you probably wont regret

[[ENDING] :](https://anilist.co/review/126047)

am really grateful to whoever reaches this point of my review cant wait to hear your criticisms and am sorry if i messed up in this review because am not used to write text reviews, remember to give the show a shot

Honestly, it's not easy to concisely describe just how vivid the second season of School Idol Project is. A beautiful outburst of the soul. A melodic magic that lifts the heart. A lyrical expression full of emotions. These words are close enough to express how I feel but really, it's better if you listen to µ's (""Muse"") once more. Because as the saying goes:

""Where words fail, music speaks.""

Every journey will always have a start and an end; and within it, there will always be a story. The story of µ's began as a school-saving solution, and through the passing of time, their journey is reshaped into a sincerity that speaks of passionate wonders, of incredible friendship, and of valued memories. The second season is a continuation of that. With the third-years' graduation quickly drawing near, the end of µ's seems nigh, but it doesn't stop them from making sure their last experience is a meaningful one. The next destination is the second Love Live! contest, and they will make sure to give everything they can to reach that grand stage.

This is the culmination of their experience together as a school idol group.

img()

Most of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we're given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn't get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member's influence on one another. Whether it's to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.

It's this strong focus on µ's as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they're not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that—into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone.

Rivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of µ's to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it's proof that µ's has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.

img()

From the uplifting yet melancholic ""Snow Halation"" to the rosy ""Aishiteru Banzai!"", Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I'm sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it's the same adorable art that I've grown to love, and I don't think that needs to change.

When I reflect back on my journey with µ's and School Idol Project, I really couldn't have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I'm their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give µ's a listen.

Many music and memories are awaiting you.

139274,"Amazing action scenes. If only Sunrise stuck to serious shows instead of trying to make trashy characters and plot that ""appeal to current anime fans"".

I might enjoy this if I didn't have any expectations. But after the prologue and first episode, I was expecting yuri and intense gundam and I got neither.

Suletta and Miorine characters are very one-note and do not act logically. Not to mention Suletta can’t form a sentence. However, their characters are not enough for me to dislike the show. Although their friendship being filled with stupid comments, boring scenes, and queerbait is a big contributor to my dislike. An action show should not devote so much time to two characters, especially if all they talk about is plants and friendship bracelets.

Yes, I said ""queerbait"". I need to amend two of my previous statements on this topic:

>Gundam witch from mercury is starting to piss me off. They’re considering introducing romance between the girls but they just haven’t.

I don't think they were ever considering introducing romance. No character suggests that they have feelings for another, except for Guel having unclear platonic admiration for Suletta.

>I don't blame Sunrise for the queer ship. I think most of it came from the fanbase because the script never comes close to mentioning romance. The premise for the ship is that Suletta wins a duel that makes her the heir to the school and thus Miorine's fiance. Also Suletta gives her a friendship keychain toy.

Thinking back to the scene at the end of the first episode and the (supposed) allusions to Utena, I now blame Sunrise for the ship. While the ship has much less context than many non-canon ships, I don't doubt its existence. I am generally a huge fan of non-canon ships, especially homosexual, but their personalities and interaction are not shippable for me. Suletta expects Miorine to ask to be friends and is upset when Miorine ignores her. A logical character would ask Miorine if she wants to hang out and then try to find a different friend if Miorine is mean to her. Their conversations are repetitive and create drama where none exists. I prefer fun ships that have lively conversations (I usually point to Deku and Bakugo as an ideal generic ship, but that's a different anime).

I think the side cast is lacking much more than the main cast. There are zero characters with backstories or agendas. Everyone seems to be conspiring for no reason, with no explanation and no results. Many characters are briefly mentioned with promise of becoming interesting (like Elan, Shaddiq, Nika) and then completely forgotten about in future episodes. Gundam is known for amazing side characters that all have different purposes, even if they don't interact with the main character or contribute to the main storyline. Besides Suletta, Guel, and Elan, are there any other mecha pilots? Most of the cast seems to be classmates that haven't contributed individually. The only funny character is cotton candy pom pom hair since she insults the other characters for being stupid.

Each episode starts with a completely unrelated scene to where the last one left off and they are never tied together. Between the school for duels, friendly mecha startup, Earthian terrorists, and business power struggle, no plot point stands a chance of making sense since they explain each idea for at most 30 seconds at a time before moving back to slice-of-life depictions of dating, gardening, and dorm life. 

The show takes action scenes very flippantly since everyone is happy to fight without stating what they're trying to do. The duels usually have no consequences depending on who wins. And since there is only one main mecha fighter, you already know who is going to win. When people besides students get involved, they are never given an objective or plan. They just show up wanting to kill Miorine’s father, for no specific reason other than the implied reason that he’s powerful and anyone who defeats him will gain power. The lack of intention makes the top-tier animated scenes lose all impact. When they cut from showing the mechas to showing faces, they spend a conspicuously long time on the faces which usually have zero or one facial expressions and no meaningful dialogue.

The aciton animation is so awesome, especially in the last episode. But the mecha fight was mainly between the unnamed guards and the Earthian girl that never had a dedicated introduction.

!The end credit scene wasn't for me. I don't think it's funny to just splat blood while smiling. Although if they stopped trying to make it humorous, becoming a stone-cold killer could be a good way to add a second dimension to our notoriously one-note protagonist.!

- I think the mixed feelings and general confusion over this anime is demonstrated by the tags. About 80% do not apply and I have been watching as the mods have been taking off the yuri tag and then allowing it to be added again.
- The prologue is amazing. I think if the series had tied the atmosphere or plot elements from the prologue it would have been much better.
- I forgot to mention the commercial. As if they're trying to make the show a joke.
- The show's big moments fail to be cliffhangers since they don't foreshadow what could happen next. They move on to other characters without flow between events. I never know what characters/scenes are going to come back (spoiler: most don't).

To those of you who watched this show and now have a bad impression of Gundam:
img()

Does this show deserve the name ""Gundam""? Yes. Sunrise has consistently shown that any style and quality of anime can use the Gundam name as long as it has a mecha with similar design. Shows like Gundam Build Fighters (kids-focused isekai) and Turn A Gundam (dramatic, anachronistic, uplifting) are drastically different from original Gundam and the similarly war-focused spinoffs.

What is my favorite Gundam? Iron Blooded Orphans, another spinoff series unrelated to the original Gundam. And one that contains homosexuality for a moving 1 episode.

- New disclaimer: I am not a lesbian, but then again nothing about this production is lesbian either.
- New new disclaimer: I do think my homosexual identity gives me a bias. I am biased. I expect media to be straightforward about sexuality. I would feel better if they used words such as ""I like her"". I'm not sure if it's a reasonable expectation. My review is just a gut feeling, which I think anyone is entitled to. If you're lesbian (or not) you can disagree with me.
- I only ""dislike"" 2 anime that I have completed. The other is Darling in the FRANXX, which is a very similar show that I would recommend if you disagree with my review. The primary difference is the FRANXX actually has romance and a homosexual character (although I think most elements, even this, in FRANXX are done poorly).
- I am watching season 2. I'm still optimistic that some sort of plot or character development will exist. Hopefully even some yuri content is added.
- Please public message me to discuss the review."
97663,"So, Isekai, Monster Hunter, and early day Iron-Blooded Orphans, and combining all of these parts together, you get...a terribly mediocre show! That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, this show is a somewhat fun, mechanical, mess! An entertaining but very badly written Isekai show that had a ton of passion for the art of giant robots. That means despite not being very good (to the point where mediocre is giving it a bit too much credit), I can respect and enjoy it to some degree. So, why is it still mediocre, and what about all this really gets me to enjoy it aside from its spirit? Well, let’s find out, shall we?

There are...a ton of problems unfortunately with the narrative. For one, a ton of stuff is basically the narrator I explaining story beats or skipping stuff and saying what happened in between. It gives me Gundam Wing flashbacks and that is not ok. For a civilization about creating mechs to fend off beasts, knowing that they haven't made any remote innovation in the past century is rather disconcerting, especially when you consider the nature of a typical mecha show. When Ernesti (back then known as Kurata) dies in that original life, he just died without fanfare and we don't see what happened to him, let alone how he became reborn into this world. It also implies that he just basically hijacked the body of the boy he became; that's kinda fucked up. There are some real asspulls too, like how Ernesti used magic to pilot the Guair out of nowhere and how he was strong enough to pull the controls out despite other characters tugging on them quite hard just to move. I get that these run on magic, but again, this came out of nowhere.

There are other errors and dumb moments too, like when Kerhild had a chance to slay Edgar, whose Knight mech had been disabled, she (according to the visual damage since that was offscreen) simply slammed her sword into the cockpit and left instead of thrusting the sword through it to finish him. A potentially cool battle in episode 5 is skipped and given that there is some sort of war that gets ignited, the amount of time skips in development while nothing happens is disconcerting. I do like how they spend a lot of time on the building process and the camaraderie that comes of it though, even if they sorta still gloss over it. Not helping anything is the fact that Ernesti kinda dances near Gary Stu territory, nor is the fact that the pacing is a bit out of whack thanks to the obscene SAO level time skips.

That said, there are some moments that are actually pretty good, like with the king and his random duking it out for a flashy mech and showing that they're both the same basically, except one has withered a bit with age. I'm not going to really spoil too much here though despite the overall lukewarm opinion I have on the show. Even still, they can't save this pretty ravaged script that somehow gets crazier and more ludicrous in the second half. The final 5 episodes in particular are far too fast-paced given the contents within, and thus come off as disjointed that they introduce a bunch of holes and errors. I feel like they should've been their own cour to work at all, so that doesn't help matters either.

Ernesti is really OP. This kinda cuts both ways. It's nice to see that he takes his skills from his world to this one, so of course he’s knowledgeable about giant robots, but to know that with all this, he also becomes a top tier magic expert who innovates there too, is a stretch. He’s basically a spunky skid, and that's fun enough to see, but he does become unreasonably OP overall despite there being a good reason for some of what he can do. Unfortunately, he comes dangerously close to Gary Stu territory, always making so many advances with mainly his ideas and little outside input, having most of everything revolve around him (and I'll explain those ramifications in a bit), and being the only one to come up with crazy new  innovations, as well as some of the other aforementioned things. What’s saving him a bit is his enthusiasm and passion for robots, the fact that some of what he is capable of is understandable right out the get-go, and the fact that even his stuff notably needs work, leading to himself other people being able to modify his ideas. The fact that he is a mecha enthusiast gives me some bias towards him though. The dude has fucking orgasms over this shit.

I'm sure many of us can agree that Shirley from Code Geass is not a good character, right? I mean, she’s basically there to kiss up to the MC and always devote everything about her character to him, to some extent at least. Well, Adeltrud aka “Addy” is some next level shit! The only thing separating her from being Miyuki tier shit here is the fact they there is no incest love at all, but it is still a one-sided crush. Thankfully it sometimes gets played to admittedly humorous degrees but this is largely her character. 

This, in particular, brings us to that whole Gary Stu issue. You see, since so much of this show is focused on Ernesti, his energy, and how awesome he is, we don't really get to see the other characters shine, a common symptom of a Gary Stu character. I'm not even gonna try to list the characterizations of the other character for this reason. I'm just thankful they don't come off as horrendous character archetypes, and some that come close, like the old man rival engineer, do get somewhat subverted (that way he isn't just a senile and jealous old coot character, he’s one that eventually finds passion again, thanks to you know who) or otherwise have something to safe then from being just a bad archetype. Doesn't mean that the cast isn't bad, because it most certainly is, though again, biases to some characters like Ernesti, and the absolutely gorgeous Helvi, even though they're not actually good characters. Besides, I don't even wanna get started in the villain characters, especially the ones from the final arc, which are all terrible and generic. There are some attempts to show some character relationships but they all fall flat too, and when we are often missing useful characters, that's a problem too for an already bloated but lacking cast.

Studio 8-Bit was in charge of this show's creation and I must say, they did a good job in the visual department. It seems I'm lucky enough to only see the works of theirs that have CGI because theirs is actually not half bad. The Silhouette Knights do have choppy frame rates in episode 1 and there is a mecha dragon that suffers from bad CGI and frame rates too, and up close, most of these don't always look very good, but the coloring and way it's done here somewhat helps remedy that, and once the kinks are ironed out, they become fun to watch in battle, both in swarming an enemy or in one on one mech combat. Those sequences are insanely fast paced and done very well, especially when we see how they take advantage of the new equipment. They're based on knight armor so they definitely don't look as appealing or potentially iconic as say, a typical Gundam, but these designs are nice enough that I can see decent toy sales of them. Those swords look especially cool. The CGI demon beasts look even better, especially that giant beast that looks like a gigantic blue Avalugg. The giant magic rods don't look nearly as good, unfortunately. Still, the CGI, on the whole, is actually pretty decent, though most kept inconsistent and certainly not great.

The actual art is pretty nice too, not just for the characters (just look at the way they did Ernesti’s hair, that looks sick af) but especially for the magic. I especially love what they did with the eyes. The shading for the magic fire attacks looks splendid, really selling how much of a spectacle magic can be, even though it becomes a bit overused and therefore lose its luster. The animation is overall pretty decent too, even with a few minor errors like having one scene show 3 explosion dots towards the center and the moment afterwards having those dots much farther away, but it all looks good, especially coupled with the luckily very kinetic action. Sometimes we even see beasts in 2D and they look ok. Characters don't always blend well though, so that's a fault. Overall, this show looks nice. The reused animation is also very minor, so that's alright, I guess.

The music isn't as noteworthy, unfortunately. For one, I don't care for the OPs. I don't think they entirely fit the tone or setting here this series presents overall and they're ok at best songs on their own. The OST is pretty decent though. There are some decent if unmemorable tracks that often fit the scenarios well, especially in most of the action scenes.

The mecha battles were pretty fun for most part and so were the big battles against some of the demon beasts. This show's attitude towards mechs also greatly appealed to me. That being said, the crypt kind of annoyed me at times and on the whole, it wasn't as fun as it could've been thanks to that, especially in the final five episodes which left me woefully disappointed. I still had enough enjoyment with this one, more than I should have.

There are the makings of a good show here. Give it two cours and tidy up all the errors and the show would've been fine. I admire the spunk this show has and as a mecha nerd, this spoke to me somewhat, but it's inner workings are really on the fritz, like a loose Gunpla Kit. Shame since for a while, I probably would've recommended this series despite its faults but boy are they too many for me to safely recommend to anyone who isn't either highly interested in the concept of high fantasy crossing with mecha, a total mech nerd like myself, or really into overpowered protagonists. There are plenty of better mech shows with even better action, but this is at least one of the better Isekai shows I've seen, which speaks to the low quality of these kinds of shows."
98977,"Review #5 - Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta.

I currently have a love/hate relationship of melodramatic stories that involve highschool students and romance. There are some that I love, like Toradora or After the Rain. The drama in those shows are very impactful and make me feel for the characters. But their are some melodramas that just don't sit well with me at all, and I'm there watching the show feeling bored and annoyed. Either the drama feels forced, goes on for too long, its silly or its like something I've seen in many other shows before. This show that I'm talking about here, with only 6 episodes, was a chore to get through.

The characters are dull. They have very little personalty and are filled with every single cliche in the book. Miou Aida is the shy main female character, who doesn't talk much and has trouble expressing her feelings. She loves art, she's a talented painter but is having a hard time getting her feelings out their not only to her love interest but also with her paintings. Haruki Serizawa is the main male character who has dreams of becoming a film director. He's the character the more talkative type, a bit popular, more outgoing blah blah. He and Miou like each other, but their are instances where their feelings get in the way and its hard to be upfront with one another. Miou learns something about Harukis brother and she starts having panic attacks and feels like she can't talk to Haruki anymore, which leaves Haruki confused why she is avoiding him.

!When Miou was a little kid, she fell into a river and was drowning until someone jumped into the river to save her. Miou wishes she can meet the person who saved her life years ago, but later find out that this person is dead. She also later finds out that the person who saved her was Harukis brother who died I guess a few days after he saved her. He died of a cold....A COLD. A grown man dying of a cold ok then. Anyways, Miou feels like its all fer fault that he died and she is scared that Haruki would hate her or whatever so she avoids him. This whole thing just seems forced, unrealistic, and silly. The likelihood of these things happening is like slim to none. Having a crush, who's brother years ago saved your life at one point, and then dying from a cold(a grown ass man) a few days after saving you! 

In the spoiler above, I explained some key parts of the story and thought how unrealistic and silly the whole situation the characters were in. There are stages to these melodrama shows.

Stage 1 - Main female or male character notices someone attractive and he/she tries to get to know them.
Stage 2 - They become friends, talk about stuff, hang out with others, do fun things together
Stage 3 - One of them learns something about their love interest that he/she doesn't like. Or finds out that another person has a crush on their love interest, so they just try to avoid them completely like their is absolutely no way they can talk about it or fix the issue.
Stage 4 - They fix the issue after some side characters talks to one of them about it, they express their feelings after wasting so much time moping and doing nothing for some episodes and boom happily ever after.

In conclusion. It's a rinse and repeat with these generic highschool romance shows. I always feel like I'm watching the same show, even if the drama, whatever the characters are arguing about maybe different, the way everything goes down and how everything finishes is all the same. They feel uninspired, you can predict what will happen, and you end up not surprised by everything that went done once the credits roll. It's just so generic. Idk how many more of these shows with the exact style they're gonna keep making. Hopefully someday, it'll end.


Pros:
- Only 6 episodes 

Meh:
- Art/Animation is just ok, same with OST and OP

Cons:
- Characters are dull, cringe, and have copy/paste personalities of characters from other stories
- Story is uneventful, lazy, and silly"
20514,"Guess I can say that I feel like Psycho-Pass Movie was great as an action movie. But it was an action movie wearing a poor Holo of Psycho-Pass. Seemed to largely be in the same vein as Psycho-Pass 2 in that aspect. It greatly disappoints me, and makes me wonder if they will ever make another Psycho-Pass that stands up to that of the original.

Music, Art, Sound

All of these are just as amazing as you would expect to find in Psycho-Pass, and never once did I have any complaints. The music all fitted the universe just fine, and did a great job. Meanwhile the sound effects where hard hitting, and helped to give more power to action scenes. Art throughout the movie was great, with a ton of detail being put into what you saw. With the movie dedicating a number of scenes to showing off the designs and set pieces of the world. While a conversation was taking place, or a slow portion of the movie rolled around to give some breathing room.
Now I do want to mention the Voice Acting, and how I hated it. The English throughout the movie was horrendous, and seemed like they barely even tried. Definitely was something I would call engrish, and should have been easy to pull off. If you have a movie in which a large portion of the dialogue will be English, maybe you should find some English VA's who can do the part. 

Characters

With Psycho-Pass Movie, we don't get that many new characters who really matter. And instead spend a fair bit of time with an old friend in Kogami. 
-Kogami, who has kinda ended up as a religious type leader to a group of guerrillas, helping to support their cause and fight. A man who just wanted to find a peaceful place to settle down finds himself back in the action. It takes a fair bit of time to actually get around meeting him, but when it does it certainly has a decent impact.
-Akane meanwhile is pretty much the same as she was in Psycho-Pass 2. Nothing much changes with her character, still maintaining the same beliefs as before. We do end up with a decent scene early on with some nice character building, at least letting us see that she does in fact have a life and friends outside of work. Though I do question why a single woman has such a massive and empty apartment. 
-The Colonel Nicholas Wong, kinda ends up just being a generic evil guy. He wants to gain power and control, but we never really explore much with him. He doesn't seem to really have any moral compass of any type, and could be replaced by anybody really.
-I'm going to just group the mercenaries together, cause we never learn anything about them really. They get paid by the Colonel to do a job, and that it what they attempt to do. Spec Ops of some kind, ruthless in executing their plans and getting the job done. Though they also don't seem to be all that loyal to the Colonel, willing to change plans to suit them
-Chuan Han, or otherwise known as the Sibyl System in this movie. A man used as a figure head to get the Sibyl System in place, and is fully replaceable and unnecessary once that goal has been achieved. 

Story

A decent fast paced story, that asked a simple question really. How could the Sibyl System be introduced to a country in the middle of a civil war. And if it forcing the Sibyl System on the people to achieve peace, is worth giving up freedom. Or if the people should still be able to have a free democracy. By the end though, it feels as if the choice has already been made for the people. The Sibyl System is in place and staying, even if the people choose something different in the elections. 
Meanwhile, I question how the Sibyl System to capable of taking on such responsibilities at all by this point. It seems like the system has always been under pressure due to the amount of people it is supporting in Japan. Just seems like adding hundreds of thousands, or even millions of more people would have the system collapsing under the stress. 
But overall, the story does a good job for the time provided. It does a good job at introducing conflict, and giving the characters motivations. Even if I feel like the story didn't really progress the world or characters very much, but just kinda filled out the world."

Yeah yeah, we all heard the story. A genie in a lamp that grants you 3 wishes of your choice in return for...yeah nothing. How bout we changed that a little bit and make it easier than idk search for a gad damn lamp... Having a random house in a park with a random woman in it that of course grants wishes is, in truth, something different. And this is where our story begins.

Introduction
img320()

Ahh yes, the generic starting plot. You're the only one who found this amazing power, temple, house, artifact, etc, while others couldn't for some reason intensifies. Whelp yeah but not entirely. Kimhiro Watanuki, your average student, has a strange power that he’s able to see all kinds of spirits attached/following him or even others, either being good or bad spirits. Luckily or not, he ends up in a house where he meets Yuko, a strange woman of unknown age, learning that she can grant any wishes on the world...for a price of course. At first, he wasn’t convinced but since he was somewhat desperate to get rid of the spirits haunting him he makes a deal with Yuko to remain (not all the time tho) in that house as a housekeeper in order for his wish to be granted. Little did he know this thing won’t be as easy as it sounds as he will encounter supernatural events, other spirits and characters that will change his life there.

xxxHolic series presents us a detailed and well-made approach to Japanese folklore, with all kinds of spirits, legends, myths, etc. that show the impact they made on others and their actions. On the other hand, the people that come to the house in search of their deepest desires: revenge, being successful in everything regardless of other's warnings, lying of their problems just to get what they want, etc. In fact, only a few people can see this house, as Watanuki, but very few will come there with goodwill in terms of their wishes. Since everything they wish for has to be paied with something equivalent, not many will be able to accept it, falling in agony and sorrow.(some even have to pay with their own soul in order to have the wish granted for example)
There is a little bit of comedy, some supernatural and some drama if you get hooked up in this.

Characters

Kimihiro Watanuki
img320()

As I said previously, apart from being one of the few characters that can see the spirits along with him, most of the story will focus on him and his actions towards spirits and his friends. He’s a caring type but also a volatile one once he’s irritated or criticized by his friends. It’s someone that I personally find myself, but not to extremes. His wish to be granted and his payment will turn out eventually into something else, but as I want to avoid spoilers... it was inevitable?. Fun fact: he's also a side character in the Blood-C anime since still made by IG I guess.

Yuko Ichihara
img320()

Damn, if it was someone like her every time I make a wish I wouldn't mind at all. Jokes aside, don’t let the appearance fool you, cuz she has many other powers unknown, connections and she’s the wisest of all (kind of). Apart from that, she enjoys drinking and eating all kinds of food and alcoholic beverages with his little companion Mokona. Seriously, it’s unknown what is her age is but due to other interventions in Tsubasa Chronicles universe, you could say almost 100 years or even more.

Mokona Modoki (Larg)
img320()

The other twin creation of Yuko and Clow Reed from the Tsubasa universe. I’m not gonna dig too much in this: one went with Sakura (again same universe) and the other remained here to help Watanuki. There’s more to learn either by reading or watching Tsubasa Chronicles, but it’s not entirely necessary. Anyway apart from being a drinking buddy to everyone, communication with the other mokona and being a vacuum cleaner with UNLIMITED BLADE WOR...space storage. It’s not something that can affect the plot evolution too much since in some cases he can’t intervene over Watanuki’s decisions. It doesn't do much, but it’s honest work.

Doumeki and Himawari
img220() img220()

The few friends Watanuki has apart from those he will encounter. Domeki, the calm and serious-looking guy, he’s also the rival and opposite of Watanuki. Not speaking too much unless asking others about folklore, making some sarcasm and demanding out-of-season food for Watanuki to cook. As Kimihiro, he also has some hidden powers that will be discovered later. Himawari is the crush of Watanuki. She’s very intelligent, friendly and relaxed.

There are obviously more than them, but if I made u interested in some already, why don’t u find the others as well?

Animation
img320()
img320()

In this topic, let’s be honest, Production IG tried to adapt the manga s much as they could (naw don't blame them for those extremely LONG legs and arms, cuz that's the same in the manga). Unfortunately, the studio wouldn't just drop tons of effects and quality just for this particular show. Personally, some panels from the manga are just blissful and priceless, being a little hard to give us the same feeling in anime. (obvs credits for CLAMP and a job well done)

References

Hey, I don't mind references whatsoever, as long as they’re really well made. It’s nice to see they also included some of their previous works like GITS, but at the same time Kaiji’s face?:))Come on:) I couldn't find some images on net to show em but they are in the sure and u'll see them pretty soon anyway.

Manga and other universe connection
img320()

xxxHolic follows the route focusing on Watanuki, while Tsubasa Chronicles follows the route of Sakura and Shiaoryan, having also a mokona with them with slightly different abilities. No, it’s not entirely necessary to either watch or read the manga of Tsubasa to understand xxxHolic better. (unless you’re a CLAMP fan or interested in more). Yes, they do have some intersections along with the story but u won't miss ehem major spoilers bout xxxHolic in particular. So there u have it. I would however recommend the manga over anime for xxxHolic (as many other examples) cuz some parts are either skipped or modified in anime, but for the sake of it, watch the show if it’s easier.

Conclusion
img420()

xxxHolic it’s a show that kinda resembled me of the Monogatari Series, tho not at the same quality, complexity and characters (true, it’s another level ngl). But there is however a similarity between them like the spirits, long discussion, supernatural, characters, etc. Maybe there we’re some inspirations considering xxxHolic aired before Monogatari, but those are just my thoughts so far. Some didn’t see this adaption as a good one but I rather not judge other tastes since that what makes us different. There's also a netfli...live adaption on this one buuuut....wasn't that interested in it tho.

If I got ur interest somewhere, I’m really glad. In ur free time maybe this show could just fit in. It’s best enjoyed with either a beverage or a cup of tea, so stay safe and thanks for reading."

Season 5 of Bungou Stray Dogs continues to directly build upon the events of Season 4, though in a much less character driven way this time, which paved the way for a more fast paced, action packed season that also had many twists. That comes with the positive of keeping me at the edge of my seat in suspense for what was to come, but gave me less to think about after each episode ended, as it wasn’t as full of depth as the previous season was. It also did what few anime do nowadays, pass the current chapter of the manga to the point of having a finale episode that covered scenes not seen in the source material. Seeing the fact that no one knew what the end had in store was definitely an exciting time, and it was overall once again another thrilling season.

The plot builds upon the finale of Season 4 at the Sky Casino, and continues with the Detective Agency trying to clear their name, with the Hunting Dogs hot on their tail. Their goal was to capture Kamui, the leader of the Decay of Angels, but it turns out a familiar face is the one behind it all. The thing that impressed me the most with this season was that the stakes felt higher than ever before, with the fate of a lot of the characters genuinely uncertain, and with that uncertainty, it does a great job in creating that feeling where I was actually scared if a character would be killed.

The one thing that was the source of some frustration to me was the one of the villain’s ability, as it was so overpowered that no one could stop him. However, as these stories tend to go, it would seem like he would have to be defeated at one point, and I felt however way the protagonists ended up winning would be through a deus ex machina. That said, I really liked the villains, as they were very crafty (especially Fyodor), and twisted enough to make things very interesting to watch. The story might not always be written at a very high standard, but it gets the job done in an immensely entertaining way, despite the flaws.

Production wise, much like the previous seasons, it was very consistent, and the soundtrack continued to be solid, along with an excellent opening and ending song.

The focus on the characters was not that balanced this time around, with some characters being virtually absent for the entire season, but the cast of characters that were present were about as good as before, though this time around, it wasn’t as emotional as last season, which had numerous backstories that really fleshed out the characters. Like I mentioned before, it was more of an action packed season, along with a lot of mind games in the form of twists. It was great to see the return of Aya though, as she was a nice character that appeared in one of the OVAs before.

Overall, another extremely thrilling, enthralling roller coaster that had me looking forward to each subsequent episode, and while it was less emotional, with some notable negatives and some poor tonal shifts, it still got the job done. We likely won’t see another season since the anime has passed the recent manga chapter, but whenever a sequel happens, I’m sure I’ll be there yet again to witness it."
101972,"""The Founder of Diabolism"" is an anime I actually watched with my mother. There is also a chinese series about this anime -I'll just call it anime, don't judge- which is already completed. It is the first chinese anime I watched, I think. 

img220() Here a pic from the series.

Let's exorcist some demons from your minds, shall we? Eventhough it's a bit sarcastic when I say, that we should exorcist some demons xP. Anyways, I'll begin with my review now:


""The Founder of Diabolism"" is a very hard to explain anime... The story can be devided into the main story and the story about the past. While watching the anime, the timeline always changes back and forth which is very irritating at first. The only difference -at least it was the one which helped me the most- was the way how the main character Wuxian Wei tied his hair. Here some examples:

img220() his hair is tied in this picture. It is for the timeline which takes place ""now"".

img220() In this picture his hair is open. It means, we are in the past now.

The whole story starts in the present time and the setting is being told how an evil spirit takes over people. Wuxian is playing a character with madness. 

I personally think, it was really hard to get in the story because when I watched it, I didn't know what the hell the characters are talking about and what actually was going on. The time change factor was really confusing too. This could have been done much better. When I got used to it, the second problem was the names. It was really hard for me to remember the names of each person -I'm personally not good in remembering names too- that is why it was even harder for me to get into the story.

img220()


The characters in ""The Founder of Diabolism"" are really detailed and very interesting. As I watched the anime, the further it got, the more interesting it was for me to watch them. It is one of the less anime I actually watched in one go. 

Backgroundstories of the characters are being told in the time change to the past and you get a glimps, why the characters changed that much during the time and how they changed. I really liked the drawing style of the characters but one point I didn't really like is, that the characters are looking much alike. Especially the side characters are not as easy to say who is who. The similarity in clothes didn't make it easier. 

img220()


As I already said in 2, the characters are very much alike, but I think the art is very smooth and give the character a more noble touch. It was really enjoyable to watch them. Each move the character did, was like they are floating, very elegant.

img220(v)

I really liked the soundtracks of this anime too. The flute really suited the style of the anime and gave me a warm feeling. Also, this is my first anime where I listened to the opening very often because I like it. 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0I0nf2eoK8)

I really liked how the voice actors were chosen too. They performed the characters attributed very well and it really was fun to watch.


Besides of some issues I had, I really liked this anime. I'm currently waiting for the release of season 3. It is a nice peace of art the studio created. Big story behind the anime and nice voice actors. It made me laugh a lot too, but it had it's sad sides underlined as well. I loved the smoothness of this anime, that is why I will give a 9/10 for it. The 1 point I chose to throw away because it gave me a hard time to find into the story at first.

114840,"Ah yes, Paedophilia the anime.

It starts with the hero, Ryo, talking to the protagonist in a weird and creepy way, but she rejects him, pushes him away and say what everyone is thinking: ""what a fcking weirdo pls go away"".
At this point, everything is fine. The problem comes when his sister, Rio and him FORCES that poor girl into a relationship with a 10 year older salary man, who has a crush on her because is the first girl that rejects him. Remember that he just fcks any women he wants, but her.

Now, [spoilers]

He just pushes himself into the life of our heroine, Ichika with presents till he gets her phone number via Rio, after that, he calls her twice or three times a day, she just keeps telling gim to not do that, but he doesn't listen.

And then, a little ray of hope, the rivals appears:
A Ichika classmate gets friendly with her, and starts enclosing, being more friendly in a casual non-creepy way, you know, like every decent person. Then he starts realising that Ichika is his crush, but don't want to freak her out, so he just keeps his distance till they are more close.
Of course, the ""hero"" at this point just shows himself in a menacing way to scare a highschool boy away from his friend, a highschool girl.

On the other hand, we got Arie, Ryo's coworker who don't like him at first, but starts getting friendly with him, and realices that he is actually approachable, so, when she gets more closer and confident, confesses to him.

Both of this rivals, way more interesting than our heroes, gets rejected in just, 3 episodes of their debut.

By now, these rivals just dissapears from the anime, it doesn't matter anymore, because the conflic is that our heroes realice that a 10 year age gap is really huge and that suppose a problem, but anyhow they just overcomes that by ignoring that fact at the end of the episode.

We comes to an end, both best heroe's friends, Rio and the other one, are just irrelevant till the last chapter, when they just yell at them cheap nonsense about going out and face eachother because their relationship got serious.

But hey, remember that our heroine didn't like him at first? Well, she just start liking him without reason, really, there is no fcking reason, he is no ""good guy"", yes he teaches her some school things, and get presents and that, but ffs that is NOT being nice with someone, is being obsessed with someone. (I gues she just starts liking him as the stockholm syndrome exists).

So, no, this anime doesn't have a plot for almost half of the series, the conflict is fcking bland, the animation hurts to watch, the beautiful moments looks written by a 12 years old girl and the conclussion isn't surprising at all, not pleasant to watch, is just another moment.

This anime is infuriating, not beautiful. I'm glad if you did enjoy it, but damn, let's not forget that THAT isn't love, is just, obsession and sickness. Remember, 10 YEARS OLD GAP, THE GUY IS FCKNG 27YO AND THE GIRL IS 17YO, THE GIRL DISCUSS HER FEELINGS IN HER BEST FRIEND HOUSE EATING CHIPS AND THE GUY TALKS ABOUT THOSE PROBLEMS IN A FCKING BAR.

If you like this kind of romance, I recomend Koi wa Ameagari no You ni, yes there is a more age gap, but hey, is a ""romance"" in another way, just watch it and you'll understand how different they are."
154391,"An anime that could have been good but never amounted to anything


SPOILER ALERT! 




The anime starts off on the right foot, with a protagonist reincarnated into another world as a baby, and into the royal family no less, but it seems luck is not on his side as he is left in a forest to die. And here's a turning point, because it could have led to hundreds of very interesting things if, for example, the goddess hadn't given the protagonist 1002 points of magic and had accidentally given him just 2 instead. Furthermore, the fact that the demon girl (who we can see contributes little or nothing to the plot other than boobs and jokes about them) finds the child serves no purpose. Since minutes later, a guy shows up to take the child away.

And here's another turning point, he could have ended up in a humble family, where he would learn that life values are different from being locked up and that he has to help his sister and family get ahead, maybe becoming an adventurer and earning some money for the household, for example. But no. He is adopted by a wealthy noble family, with an overprotective mother, a moe sister who becomes an otaku, and a father who is pure filler.


img220()
This image represents the theme of the anime.



The story has NOTHING, look, I'll summarize it for you: The protagonist doesn't want to leave his room but because things happen to him as the protagonist, he is reluctantly forced to leave. His sister forces him to put on a stupid suit and since the protagonist has no personality, he does everything his 5-year-old sister tells him to do. (Let's remember that this guy is 30 years old) and that's it. That's all. Nothing throughout the episodes suggests that he has grown or overcome anything. Is there a problem? Have a solution in less than four minutes. My real mother tries to kill my sister? Well, I'll put a slavery collar on her, end of the problem. Don't have anyone to go with me? Well, the script lends me a conveniently docile blue dragon that quickly resolves that problem. That's the ""plot"" of this anime.

>Not to mention the protagonist's self-copy: Since he always wants to stay at home, he creates a copy of himself to do the things he doesn't want to do, but in the end, it only serves to double the disgust and boredom that this protagonist creates in the viewer, since the copy has the same flat personality as the original.

Let me quickly talk about magic. Basically, it's a quick excuse and an element that only serves to ""explain"" why the protagonist can: fly, use any element, heal people, create portals, barriers, increase his physical abilities, etc. In other words, a plot armor that gives the protagonist infinite weapons and defenses for any situation without the need for any development or growth of the protagonist. This makes any interaction predictable and boring.

Speaking of magic, nobody ever uses it correctly, as we only see it when it's cast against the protagonist. It seems like nobody uses magic for their daily lives. Maybe we see someone using a ""heal"" from time to time or some background attack, but they don't explain or put us in a real context of magic.

>The characters are flat. There is no growth in any of them, apart from the sister who goes from being a noble lady who fears her brother to being a otaku girl who loves her brother. Nobody has more growth. Everyone maintains their loyalties, their way of speaking and thinking, no matter how much time passes. Moreover, there's a 5-year jump in the anime, you know it because of two reasons:
1. The girl is now a little taller.
2. Well, there's no 2, that's it.

The personality of all the characters is EXACTLY the same. The girl hasn't changed at all, the wolf girl hasn't changed at all, the protagonist hasn't changed at all.
Oh, wait, I just thought of a character who has some more dimension, the king's son. He goes from being conceited to starting to realize that maybe he wasn't so perfect and that there are more powerful people. Thank you, a tertiary character who evolves a bit. Oh, his princess sister falls in love with the protagonist, because... because the script says so, of course.



>Graphic design: Simple but I don't give it much importance if they tell me an interesting story.
Music: Acceptable, nothing out of this world.
Script: As I say, a disaster of conveniences and stories that seem to be written by a teenager trying to put his fantasies together into a story.
Adaptation: Average, logically in the manga there is more detail and more moments to get to know something (not much more) about the characters.


PST: I'd rather not talk about chapter 10, it's as if all the shit they had accumulated was released all at once. The stepsister tells him she's going to be his second wife, a bit of hot springs, the princess (who is also his sister) falling in love with the main character... it's a series of catastrophic scenes one after the other.

117533,"The original Cells at Work was an enjoyable season, but it didn't really feel like being anything more than a good edutainment show. While it did accomplish that goal, its goal wasn't to push the boundary as to what the genre of edutainment could be. Code Black fully taps into that potential, being the truest representation of what edutainment show could be.

Code Black stands out from most edutainment shows in the fact that is in its story. Most edutainment shows don't exactly bother with establishing a well written story or characters. This is usually due to the fact that it isn't exactly part of creating educational value. The original Cells at Work didn't fall into this pitfall, by having an adequate enough story to tell. While it wasn't the best written thing in the world, it manages to develop its characters enough so that the first season's final arc felt like a great payoff. Code Black takes this idea of having a developed story, characters, and world in an edutainment show to an extreme that this genre has never really seen before.

The dark world of an unhealthy body that Code Black portrays consistently manages to be absolutely horrifying. While some may argue that the lower production value that LIDENFILMS provides takes away the show, I would actually argue that it works in the show's benefit, since it greatly bolsters the atmosphere of very scene. As a series, Code Black capitalizes on the fear of the loss of control. Every single episode presents a problem caused by the unhealthy body, and while the problem usually gets solved by the end, they are never without their consequences. The prevailing fear of death is always a factor in Code Black, which always exponentially heightens the tension of every situation. I was always on edge in every episode, because the show consistently does such a great job at building up its situations.

One of the main surprises that this series brought was in its plot and characters. The plot of Code Black isn't just okay like in the original series. Code Black's story passes good and goes straight into greatness. While there is a semi-episodic structure present throughout the series, nearly every single main character goes through a convincing character arc. The main Red Blood Cell's character is easily the highlight here. How his arc of learning how to adapt to his environment slowly develops throughout the series shows a level of mastery that I absolutely wasn't expecting. The characters of the Red Blood Cell friend, the White Blood Cell, and every other character that was dedicated to a singular episode have incredibly written too. Every high stakes scene has an extra layer of anxiety just due to the fact that I actually cared for them. This dedication to character development massively pays off in the second half, with some of the most shocking and heart-wrenching moments that caught be extremely off guard.

Code Black's consistent brilliance in how it weaves its themes together elevate it way more than being just a great series. The main mantra of the series that we should always keeping on working. Work. Work. Work. Work. The barrage of demands from the cells of a higher status make everything end up feeling hopeless at a certain point. However, something very important that this series does is to ask, why do we work? Why work under circumstances so increasingly harsh? Why work in a time when nothing seems all for nothing? Code Black answers that question in saying that we work to make things better. If we just give up at a certain point, then nothing will ever get better. The world will never shine brightly with glee ever again. Even when all seems hopeless, we can only gain hope again if we work. Even if we contribute very little, our work can still have impact. No matter how big or small we are, we can always just move on. Even if our chances have changed from a 0% to a 0.1%, we still at least have a chance.

Cells at Work Code Black may just seem like just a darker Cells at Work at first, it manages to be more than that. It is an amazing work of storytelling, world-building, and character development. By taking its time in establishing and developing every aspect of its story, it actually manages to teach way more than edutainment shows that don't even bother with plot development. Code Black is the absolute paragon of what an edutainment shows can be."
155963,"If you were to ask me why I watched this anime, it’s because I like gyarus. If you were to ask me why I watch any gyaru anime, it’s because I like gyarus.

This subgenre has become a product that exists only for its own sake, there is no further message attached to it, the gyaru is a holistic being that justifies its own existence. Thankfully, it seems that the people making these gyaru works have taken notice of this and are trying to turn the self-cannibalization of the niche into an opportunity to try new things. Dosanko Gal is not the most exemplary of this, similar dynamics have been tried before and manga like [Gal Gohan](https://anilist.co/manga/98112/Gal-Gohan/) does it better; but I’m sure in the recent sleuth of romance and SoL shows this one still feels rather refreshing. Layering on top of this an atlas style exploration of one of Japan’s most beautiful but most often overlooked areas results in a pleasant combination that has facilitated the wasting away of many an evening.

img100%()

While I can’t say that this show does anything for me – barring the gyarus of course – it still presents a few nuggets that I think are interesting enough to deserve a further look.

For starters, Hokkaido to me is a mythical place. Outside of various historical works I rarely get the chance to see it represented, and being made aware of the small quirks and obstacles that come with everyday life here I’ve grown even more fond of it. Unfortunately, this show doesn’t take the concept far enough, its more so a show with gyarus in Hokkaido rather than a show about Hokkaido gyarus, even the different slang and dialect seems to fall off later in the show or is otherwise tokenized. Maybe to my untrained eye the depth of details has escaped, but as it stands the exploration of Hokkaido here is not so different from what I'd get in a video from the most affable British youtuber.

In the point I made earlier about similar dynamics I was referring to this anime’s attempt at abandoning miscommunication induced drama. These kinds of shows abandon drama in nearly all forms anyway but this specific kind is one so often seen in romance stories that it has become cliché, it isn’t a bad device in and of itself but it has become very predictable. Fuyuki is a character that aims to reduce these frustrations, up until the final two episodes there is no moment made worse by a misunderstanding, there is no jumping to conclusions, and there is no irritation between the leads. On paper at least his sounds both wonderful and harrowing, I’m not sure there are many stories out there made better by removing intrigue, at the same time however I can’t say that this is purely a bad thing either. With no valleys, all your peaks start looking like plateaus. 

I realize that I may be a bit of a hypocrite, and that maybe I just enjoy the novelty of losing all the friction, but at the same time I haven’t seen enough of this “anti-trope” to know that for sure so until then I will keep welcoming these kinds of stories.

img100%()

As for why anyone should bother watching this anime, ask yourself if you like gyarus. I’m not kidding when I say how distilled this subgenre has become, this show doesn’t even attempt having a subtext, and while it tries to separate itself from the chaff by playing opposites to the exhausted cliches, until some larger shift happens in the story you won’t be getting much more than “just gyaru” out of its text. The depth is wafer thin and maybe that’s a deal breaker for you or maybe you just really like wafers."
99698,"But being a little late to the party has never stopped me before, and it won't stop me now. Ousama Game! It's a fucking joke! Horror anime? Garbage! GARBAGE!
 
...But not necessarily for the reasons you may be thinking. You can go ahead and close the review at this point if you wish. But for those who make the unfortunate decision to continue: let's begin the autopsy!
 


 
img440()
 
Ousama Game is… I think you either hate it, love it, or love to laugh at it. Personally, I think I’m definitely in the “love to laugh at it” camp. But there are several layers that you have to decipher or try and make sense of while you’re watching it.
 
- A) Is the studio animating this being serious?
- B) Was the original creator being serious?
- C) Were you supposed to find the deaths where people exploded into blood funny, and were you supposed to find the non-bloody deaths serious, emotional, and dramatic?
 
Some of these questions I still don’t know the answers to. Was this an insult to the horror genre as a whole? No. There’s the whole torture porn genre or the type of horror where whether it’s a beast, human, entity, or monster, there’s something out to kill our entire cast of characters and we the viewer are there to either watch either everyone die or one or a few rise to the challenge and survive.

The problem with Ousama Game isn't that it's edgy, that it's ridiculous, that it's fucking stupid, or that it goes too far. No, I think the problem is that not only is it not enough of any of these things, but it's just completely unfocused.
 
Honestly, I get way more of the feeling that more than a few people behind this show knew exactly what they were making than its fellow [Fall 2017 horror brethren](https://anilist.co/anime/100226/EVIL-OR-LIVE/). So criticizing it from that angle seems way more appealing than an actual full serious breakdown of all of the terrible writing...

I mean, it's teenagers getting messages on their cell phones telling them to do things or they'll die. You should almost immediately alter your expectations accordingly the moment the first teenager explodes into blood or drop the show.

...Yeah, it ended up being even worse than that. I'm glad that even back then one episode in I called it ""cheap trashy horror"" because that is definitely what Ousama Game is. But as I noted previously, it is bad trash horror.
 
Well right out of the gate, we are never shown a ""King."" It is this weird omniscient but invisible force and there is no reasoning behind any of the commands it doles out to the students beyond the original creator going ""well this is what happens next."" When there's no... no tangible and/or visible entity that is putting all these teenagers through hell, it's just... it's immediately lame.
 
 
 
Like imagine the Friday the 13th movies if you just remove Jason Voorhees entirely. Rather than Jason himself wandering around murdering campers, it's just like an invisible floating machete that just kills people indiscriminately.
 
...I'd totally watch a horror movie about a rampaging invisible machete, actually.
 
It's stupid. You gotta have a monster, you gotta have someone pulling the strings, you gotta have a TANGIBLE ENTITY. Which... Ousama Game itself basically admits and/or eventually realizes. Because while there is an antagonist through the whole show, they are essentially a fellow student who is being forced to play the Ousama Game. Still, the show literally ends after most of the other students are killed by disobeying the King with the actual antagonist just going around and directly causing other people's deaths...
 
img440()
 
...Eventually going so far to just pull out a random chainsaw. And it was at that moment where I (and I believe many others who watched this show) probably exclaimed WHY THE FUCK WASN'T THIS THE ENTIRE SHOW.
 
Like the end of the show or... maybe even that entire section of the show about the last command of the King was absolutely the best/most enjoyable part of the show. That was the sort of command I wanted the King to be giving out from the very start of the show.
 
img440()
 
""Get to the summit of this mountain in this amount of time, the person farthest behind will die every so many hours.""
 
That's weird and has the potential to be fun. You have the potential for just outright sabotage which of course eventually ends up happening, and you just have people dropping off from exhaustion. But instead, most of the commands the King gives are just...
 
""Have sex with this person. Why? Because I told you to. Do you want to explode in blood??? Then I guess you better do it.""
 
img440()
 
I really wanted there to be a King. Like a student who is just fucking systematically pushing their classmates into the very depths of insanity just because they could. But it really is just basically whatever goes. There's absolutely  no structure or consistency to the commands, and while there are rules to the Ousama Game they are fucking shaky at best.
 
img440()
 
But I'll of course get to that...
 


 
The thing is, in this anime, there are actually like four different Ousama Games. There's the one that's happening in the present which is its [own manga in itself](https://anilist.co/manga/77332/Ousama-Game-Shuukyoku/), there's [the one that the main male character went through](https://anilist.co/manga/54836/Ousama-Game/) which precedes the one that this is mainly adapting (publication-wise as well), there's the original game that was done before all of them via letters rather than cellphones which I guess got its [own spinoff manga](https://anilist.co/manga/85429/Kings-Game-Origin/) at some point when the second manga was still going and only ended a year before the anime aired, and finally I guess there's the fourth Ousama Game that the antagonist of the anime and the second manga went through which I guess the original writer can just write whenever he feels like making more money ([apparently it already exists in light novel form](http://ousama-game.wikia.com/wiki/King%27sGame:Visit)).
 
...The actual original Ousama Game is in fact actually I guess a series of trashy cell phone novels? I actually did not know that until starting this review that the three different manga are all different people adapting this [guy's](https://anilist.co/staff/108945/Nobuaki-Kanazawa) trash.
 
...So the question is, how do you even approach adapting this fucking mess? Do you start with the very first Ousama Game what with letters rather than cellphones? Or do you start with the first one that the main male character (which I guess either the original creator named after himself or he's using the main character's name as a pseudonym which if it's the latter, good on him because I wouldn't want to put my real name to this shit either) is in?
 
Well, the correct answer is... just do it all. Just rip off that band-aid in one fucking movement.
 
   
 
The main focus will of course be on adapting the Ousama Game with the subtitle that's literally just EXTREME but we'll also partially adapt some of the original Ousama Game that Nobuaki was in, with the various references of the other two Ousama Games left intact.
 
They could have totally just tried to do a full on adaptation of the original Ousama Game that seemed from what we saw of it, much more boring and actually apparently more about trying to find out who the fuck or what the fuck the King is. But thank Christ, they said ""nah, fuck that, let's just get to the chainsaw as soon as possible.""
 
img440()
 
Like the Nobuaki's past Ousama Game was apparently like five volumes long with twenty five chapters. The present Ousama Game is also five volumes long but with sixty chapters.
 
...I have not read any of the Ousama Game manga, but I can already picture it in my head. It's probably a hell of a lot longer. Like by the end of the first episode of the anime, we're already into the Ousama Game. The manga probably has all of this preamble shit and actually like tries to build up or introduce the class and that is... I don't want that. Nobody wants that.
 
img440()
 
...Granted, I guess the structure wouldn't be quite as fucked what with like the start of the present Ousama Game leading to a large section of flashbacks that show events of the original Ousama Game and then leading back into the present Ousama Game without actually showing the conclusion of the original Ousama Game until just about the end of the present Ousama Ga--
 
Look, either we have to deal with a plot structure that's fucked up beyond recognition, or we have to deal with more Ousama Game being animated. The point is, I'm glad they actively chose to abbreviate it.
 
...Also apparently, there's actually even more Ousama Games than I initially thought? Well, at least they focused on adapting the most over the top one. After all, how can you raise it any further past EXTREME??

Oh fuck off. Yeah sure, waste my time with the smaller fish when you could have animated the entire teenager populace of Japan literally exploding into blood.
 


 
Wouldn't it be great if we could just... exile the entire death game genre out of the horror/psychological/thriller genres and into its own... thing?
 
img()
 
It should just very quickly be noted that I think I would have reacted much worse to the rest of Ousama Game if I hadn't read another death game series before I finally got back to Ousama Game. I won't spend much time on this, but like if you're reading this review and you watched Ousama Game and thought it was one of the absolute worst/insufferable things you've experienced, let me recommend you to your next challenge.
 
[Ikenie Touhyou](https://anilist.co/manga/100164/Ikenie-Touhyou/). Imagine... imagine Ousama Game but without the gore. And to accompany the cell phone messages, there is this talking vindictive virtual mascot bee... thing?
 
img440()
 
It... it genuinely made me look upon Ousama Game in a completely new light. I guess the entire point of this section of the review is to just point out the genre that Ousama Game crawled out of is a gigantic trash fire and there's genuine value in the statement:
 
[""There are worse things out there.""](https://anilist.co/manga/101223/Tomogui-Kyoushitsu/)
 
I haven't even progressed into that one yet any further than the first chapter because I feel as if I'm still not mentally prepared. And also, I don't like cannibalism.
 
Also, I am not joking with this at all. The sole reason why I was even able to dust myself off and actually come back to finish Ousama Game after being like on episode three or four for MONTHS was because I read and suffered my way through this absolute gigantic piece of shit.
 
So of course I had to include a dedicated section for it in this review.
 
""...at least Ousama Game wasn't THIS bad... maybe I'll try it again and then never ever touch a death game anything ever again!""
 
img440()


 
Back to the main thread of this review...
 
I think one of the most frustrating things about Ousama Game is almost everything around the antagonist. Like the main male protagonist, she has already survived another Ousama Game but unlike the protagonist, she has came to a very different conclusion about how one should proceed in the Ousama Game.
 
 
 
The whole conflict between them is selflessness versus survival. Hope versus despair. One character will claim to be willing to do whatever is required to ensure she survives the Ousama Game. The other is willing to pay whatever price he needs to if it means ensuring the survival of the others around him. This could have genuinely interesting or entertaining, but the writing is just so fucking trash that the antagonist almost verbatim says something along the lines of ""Well, someone had to be the bad guy!"" towards the end of the show.
 
 
 
Like if the show had been more about the guy trying to desperately keep others alive despite already having the knowledge that only one person can survive an Ousama Game whereas the girl is just actively fucking sabotaging his efforts and outright killing people or causing their deaths? That would have been great!
 
I mean why didn't Natsuko just fucking smash literally all of her friend's fingers in the finger game to send the rest of the class into chaos if she wanted to actively bring the Ousama Game to a quicker end? Like if the rules are so poorly fleshed out that you can just smash another person's fingers and psychologically dominate them into voting the way you want, you would think she would have used this to actually actively thin out the numbers. But literally nobody dies/gets punished in the finger game.
 
img440()
 
Which wouldn't be too big of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that shortly after the finger game, it's revealed that when Natsuko had the guy who started going on about his dream of being a stylist right before smashing his hand's phone, she blocked the King on that guy's phone. It's established earlier through the flashback episodes of the first Ousama Game manga that if you block the king, it causes you to get punished and therefore killed.
 
 
 
...That's probably one of the lamest things I've ever witnessed in a horror anything. She had an opportunity to cause chaos and very likely at least cause the death of one other person. She did not take it. Instead, she kills a guy by blocking a number...? That was when Natsuko immediately became a joke and then I realized why the fuck was the entire class just bending to her every whim?
 
 
 
Like basically the only rules of Ousama Game are that you can't withdraw from it, you can't block the King, etc. Hell, the way the show ends basically demonstrates that OUTRIGHT MURDER is acceptable. Maybe... maybe take Natsuko's phone? Maybe restrain the actual insane person? Maybe realize she keeps saying that only one person can survive Ousama Game and she seems very keen on being that ONE PERSON NO MATTER WHAT SHE HAS TO DO?
 
 
 
Finally, when Natsuko is just running around the woods misdirecting other classmates to their deaths as they're trying to get the mountain or outright causing their deaths and when she brings a goddamned chainsaw into the situation... you're just left asking why didn't she do any of this sooner? There is actually absolutely nothing establishing that the ""mountain run"" command is going to be the last round of Ousama Game so did... Natsuko finally decide she had enough and it was time to wipe everyone else out?
 
 
 
Just using straight up fucking Looney Tunes tactics now.
 
It literally doesn't matter. Because time to actually give some kudos to the original creator, as he actually did the right thing and didn't shy away from having literally everyone end up dying. Unfortunately, it's kind of ruined by the fact that there are plenty of other Ousama Games...
 
""We found out the truth about the Ousama Game! It'll keep going on forever unless everyone who's played dies!""
 
img440()
 
Then they have their little chainsaw battle at the end, and both the hopeful protagonist and the despair inducing antagonist die knowing that they're free from having to suffer this fate for the rest of their lives, and nobody else has to go through it because of them.
 
But nope! Can't just end it there! Gotta keep making Ousama Game! More and more! MORE AND MORE! OUSAMA GAME: ANNIHILATION. OUSAMA GAME: APOCALYPSE. OUSAMA GAME: GALAXY.
 
I would pay money to see a sci-fi Ousama Game but like all the students are aliens. Just keep pushing it as far as you possibly can.
 
img440()
 


 
 
 
When I called Ousama Game unfocused, what I mean is that... there's like two different ""types"" of deaths utilized through the whole thing.
 
Oh and also worth noting, it becomes very blurred whether some deaths are just how these characters are actually about to just die on their own or actual punishments from the King because they still send out a message claiming that they're being punished.
 
 
 
Or... the punishment doesn't have to be death at all but those are so few in number that it may as well as just be Ousama Game itself deciding to just fuck with everybody.
 
""Haha! Time for the punishment! Hope the person who is getting punished didn't immediately kill themselves because the punishment for this one ISN'T death!
 
   
 
Like the ones that are supposed to be funny are the especially gory ones where characters just basically explode into blood.
 
But the true hilarious deaths are of course the ones that are treated as if like the intention behind them was to make you feel emotional for these characters who are dying. One of the deaths that caused me to laugh the hardest when two characters who we are very quickly shown that they love each other right before it happens, like their punishment is like death via heart attacks.
 
 
 
Completely bloodless, shouldn't be funny whatsoever, but I was laughing hysterically as these two characters were like trying to drag each other to the other so they could hold hands as they died. Reading that previous line word for word back to myself really... really paints myself in a bad light but I can't help that this trashy horror makes me laugh so much.
 
Also, that death is almost directly after when we're shown what like some of the other students in Ousama Game: Extreme are doing which just... it's a tonal nightmare. Like when it's doing that stupid emotional heart attack death, the series actively wants you to forget what series you're watching. Just a couple of scenes before that was THIS.
 
  
 
The gory deaths are funny sure, but this series is way funnier whenever it tries to be serious.
 
""I know we're doing like a finger game thing or whatever, but I really need to cut the main protagonist's hair because I dream of being a professional stylist one day, and I plan on breaking my fingers in this finger game and I know that I cannot cut hair without this hand!""
 
 
 
It's almost a parody. I know this shit is probably directly right from the source material, but I really think the people behind the anime knew.
 
 
 


 
  
 
...I genuinely really don't think it's quite as bad as it's made out to be, honestly. The writing is trash, the source material is trash, when thinking of this in terms of like an actual serious horror it's a complete joke, but.
 
In terms of over the top, cheap, trash horror...?
 
 
 
While at the very start it was kind of miserable, I did end up laughing quite a lot at this. Like the gore and the deaths in [Another](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another/) are a billion times better, but the overall tone of that series is way more serious which is what primarily prevented me from enjoying it because I was taking Another seriously and then... it disappointed me with how it turned out.
 
Ousama Game is pretty much a joke from the very start as I've already stated. There was no taking it seriously. But the King being like a goddamned virus rather than one of the students...?
 
img440()
 
Ugh. Ousama Game, while disappointing, was some pretty funny trash. I do remember being a lot more miserable in the first couple of episodes than the rest of the series, though.
 
...Possibly controversial, but I give it a 4.5 out of 10 or 45 out of 100. Again, it's trash, but I genuinely think as far as the anime goes, a bunch of it was intentional. Plus, it ends in a pretty gloriously trashy way what with that fucking chainsaw that I guess was just at the summit of the mountain waiting for them.
 
It's edgy, it's stupid, it's over the top... but if you're looking to watch something where the characters are there just to die... it fulfills that purpose! Also, if we're being honest, that [other ""horror"" show]() that aired along with it in the same season is enormously worse than Ousama Game. Come on."
127271,"Baited by the beautiful colours and music laid out upon my eyes and ears

Walking into the theatres for the first time, I thought this movie was going to be one that told the delicate story of a modern take on Beauty And The Beast with wonderful melodies and aesthetically pleasing anime backgrounds. I was right about the music and the animation but as for the story, I was dead wrong. Belle has a horrible storyline which feels like multiple different stories all just badly stitched together with yarn after a drunk night out.

First, a quick TLDR of the story from my perspective. Belle is VR Chat with the entire population of the earth in one server and the cops replaced with Xbox360 Call of Duty Modern Warfare doxxers who threaten to reveal your identity to the rest of the virtual world around you if you do not comply. Now, addressing the main storyline. Belle tells the story of Suzu, a girl who lost her mother and is trying to pursue a dream in music and singing but due to her trauma and anxiety issues, she could never sing. But once the online world is known as 'U' was introduced to her by her friend Hiro, her life changed forever. She could sing and she could be the person that she had always dreamed of being. 

This would've been one of the top anime movies in 2021 for me if the story was kept simple and straightforward but it, unfortunately, is not. The starting part of the movie introduces all the side characters, Luka, the madonna and queen in Suzu's school, Hiro, Suzu's best friend and social media manager, internet genius and brainiac. Chikami, a canoe loving enthusiast and Shinobu, Suzu's very hot and very quiet childhood friend who had apparently vowed to ""protect her"" and have Suzu getting the wrong idea of that statement thinking it's a proposal when they were six years old. As charming and great as these characters may seem, it is a sad thing that none of them truly matter to the story in the grand scheme of things. The main 'Beast' in this movie, also known as Ryuu, turns out the be a 14-year-old domestically abused child who had been lashing out his pain and sorrow in U through underground fights, and bouts with the Xbox Doxx Police.

All the way up till the second third of the movie, none of the side characters except for Hiro have been properly built up nor established in the movie yet. But as the movie moves forward from this point on it leads into the Beauty and The Beast side of things. Showing a wonderful depiction of the old Disney gem through beautiful animation and wonderfully atmospheric music was amazing and quite simply breathtaking. But we soon realise that the 14-year-old boy behind the beast apparently loves Suzu? Here is how it all went down and what happened. Nearing the end of the movie the whole gang comes together, aka all the side characters are suddenly in an elementary school classroom with a supercomputer VR setup all ready to go. They realise that the 14-year-old boy is being held in Tokyo and Suzu takes it upon herself to travel all the way to Tokyo from one end of Japan to the central area via the train. In a couple of hours, she makes it there and a barrage of huffs and puffs are played as she struggles to find where the boy lives. Eventually, the boy and his younger brother comes out to a street right outside of their home and hug Suzu. As they are sharing this moment under the rain, the boys' father comes out of their home and demands them to return home. However, Suzu stands firm and continues hugging the 14-year-old boy and his brother. The father eventually loses it and in a fit of rage, pulls Suzu by the face and scrapes her cheek. All of a sudden, Suzu stands up and stares into the father's eyes as he raises a fist in the air and screams a couple of times. Somehow someway, Suzu manages to scare the father into scurrying back into his home and then goes straight back to hugging ' The Beast' which mind you, confesses his love to her. Immediately after that, it cuts to a scene of Suzu returning home with a bandage on her face and the whole gang wearing the same exact clothes, welcoming her home. The movie ends with a long shot of the whole group walking home by a river while saying they should practice for the upcoming concert and they should all sing together and out of seemingly nowhere, Shinobu then reinserts himself into the main storyline and says ""You don't need me as a guardian for you anymore"" and smiles at Suzu. She then looks back into the horizon and starts singing. The End. 

None of the main issues was addressed, nobody knows what happened to the kid and his brother after that, Shinobu is just apparently okay with the whole situation despite knowing nothing up until this last arc of the movie and it all just feels so rushed and loosely put together.

It kills me to know that the only romantic interest or anything grabbing my attention was the adorable love between Luka and Chikami, that scene at the train station where they have a nice talk about whether they love each other to not is the only thing that made me feel like there was some sort of relevant story to follow through with.  

Final thoughts, this movie was a letdown and my expectations were demolished, trampled into the ground.
my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."
157397,"Note: I haven't read neither of the source materials yet, this review based solely on the context of the anime.

Well, this is a hard one to assess; I should be honest. ""Dreaming Boy Is A Realist"" offers you a seemingly simple yet smartly done trope that makes it stand out from the heap of SOL (slice of life) high school romance genre.

Usually, I'd refrain from writing a review for a series that hasn't been majorly impactful to me. Still, I feel like this story has something special mixed in that might resonate with the audience. What is it, you might wonder. Giving that special someone you sought to have a more intimate relationship with than just being friends is the special message of this series.

The characters may feel familiar because they are. An ordinary boy falls in love with that one girl who's ""out of his league,"" or so Wataru Sajou thinks. His earnest and frequent efforts to woo Aika Natsukawa had been going on from middle school to the first year of high school. He's a determined boy who's lacking a bit of self-esteem. But what he lacks in that department, he makes up for with his genuine aspiration to improve himself to be ""worthy"" of the one he loves. However, his blind and constant advances leave a bad taste in everyone's mouths, yet he does not listen to those disdainful comments from others until that one fateful day when he...

Dodges a football?

Yeah, it sounds a bit off-handed, but I think it can be classified as one of those ""what the hell am I doing?"" moments that you might have experienced in your life too. And strangely, it works. But why it works is largely dependent on one seemingly secondary yet charming character, Kei Ashida, a friend to both Aika and Wataru. She somehow sees Wataru's relatively good intentions and genuine admiration for Aika. She acts as a wise intermediary to both of them to help them navigate through their conflicted feelings. She honestly is a good character.

If I have to be honest, Aika initially comes off as an unpleasant character due to her rapid change in demeanor after Wataru distances himself from her. Her frustration at not receiving the attention she seemingly disliked leaves a bitter taste. Conversely, Wataru takes a serious step, a step that is undoubtedly painful for him by putting distance between Aika and himself. He thinks he's the reason she's not more popular than she is because of him and his antics, after Kei points this to him. He does this, recognizing he may have pushed too far with his advances. This poignant moment reflects the show's greatest strength – its portrayal of the bittersweet realization that change was needed, even if it meant shouldering the blame. It's genuinely heart-wrenching. I must admit, I was able to feel how caustic of a feeling that was, and it was really heartbreaking. I feel like that portrayal was by far the biggest feat of this show.

So, if you're still on the fence about whether to watch ""Dreaming Boy Is A Realist"" or not, here's the gist:

- It's an easy watch with an immersive storyline.
- Character art is decent, but the same cannot be said for animation and environment.
- Voice acting is pretty good; it was pleasant to experience.
- Although it's a pretty overused genre and trope, it offers a fresh insight into interpersonal relationships.
- It will not change your outlook on life or leave a lasting impact.

I hope reading this will help you make up your mind or you'll find something you missed while you watched the show.

153332,"Mushoku Tensei was a landmark in the isekai genre, with its rich world building and great character development, in addition to getting an anime adaptation with the highest production values you'll see in any modern anime not made by Production IG/Kyoto Animation or named Made in Abyss, all which serve as a testament of why I consider it the best isekai ever made. This review isn't about that show.

Tensei Kizoku no Isekai Boukenroku is a generic, insipid, ugly animated isekai in a flood of other equally completely uninspired isekai that just happened to have gone the full mile and decided to be a complete rip-off of Mushoku Tensei, and while I'm not like others who think copying the plot a pre-existing work automatically makes it bad (as basically any anime made after the 90s would be bad by this logic), this show is a prime example of the reason copycats got a reputation to begin with: it missed the point of what made the original interesting or good.

The series follows the all too familiar premise of a Japanese teen dying saving someone, so gods reward him by reincarnating him in a world of swords and magic, where they proceed to give him the most powerful blessings that effectively make him invincible, so he has to hide his strength from the world. This is automatically a bad start, as it gets rid of any sense of stakes, as the main character is so overpowered he can literally just swing his sword and even the most feared monsters fall without a fight, meaning that the series has no weight to its action which in turn just makes it a waste of time.

The series then proceeds to have every girl who MC-kun meets fall in love with him, even those much older and in a much higher social class than him, as the setting being a fantasy version of medieval Europe is purely aesthetic and has no bearing on anything, as the one and only reason it even is like that is to NOT explore said setting by making it something everyone is familiar with from other series. This deals heavy blows to two important aspects of storytelling, namely world building and characterization, as not only it makes the world empty by effectively having it be a coat of paint you can replace with any other and it changes nothing, but means all the characters are cardboard cutouts who only exist to shill to high heavens our already bland MC, who's clearly intended for self insert in a sort of power fantasy, as he really has not a single character trait beyond ""was a regular Japanese boy"" who are clearly supposed to see themselves in his place.

The animation is ugly, its plot is basically non-existent, its world building is empty, its characters are all plot devices - there's literally nothing here that makes this anime stand beyond its similarities to Mushoku Tensei, except that this does everything it shares with that show infinitely worse, as the author of this clearly only intended to ride the wave of million other isekai with no value beyond the kind of mindless entertainment that has overtaken the anime industry in the last 8 years, and I'm honestly already tired of these so called stories that don't actually want to tell a story, they just want to make a cheap cash, and I'd guarantee you that no matter how bad this show is, it'll sell, because this is the kind of safe trash that does nowadays.

Thank you for reading."
21256,"The science fiction series is based on the manga by Yuji Iwahara that is running in Monthly Big Gangan. But for the purpose of this post, I will focus solely on the anime series. It is centered around Earth in the future where a new form of energy “coils” has been  created using a newly discovered dimension called the “W dimension”. This 4th dimension has a seemingly endless amount of energy, which allows for the mega corporation/governing body, New Tesla, to erect 60 towers all over the world. As a result, the entire world that the viewer sees is using ” coils” in some capacity; robots, money, cars, phones and more are powered using these “coils”.

Of course with all this new technology, there are internal conflicts within company, New Tesla, and external conflicts that the two main characters of the show deal with. Kyoma Mabuchi is a war veteran working as a Collecter ( a person who apprehends illegal coils), who has sworn off the use of coils. The second character that is focused on is Mira Yurizaki, a robot created by the deceased Dr. Yurizaki who previously created the ” coil” system. These two partner up for the duration of series, with the main story goal of figuring out why Dr. Yurizaki wanted Mira to chase after the illegal coils.

The show itself is split into two halves, first (episodes 1-5) is the introduction to a variety of characters and world building. While the second half is (episodes 6-12) used to tie all of the individuals together in a climatic battle. While this may seem like a complex thing to do in only 12 30 minute episodes, the show is fairly obvious with hitting the viewer over the head with the theme of the show: loss,memories, and acceptance of choices.

Most of the major characters have lost someone or something, and by the end of the show have to deal with this issue. Kyoma lost his wife, Mira lost her creator Dr. Yurizaki, in turn Dr. Yurizaki lost his wife. Various enemies in the show have lost their work, research, or in one case altered a family members body because of a mistake. The show uses this to focus on the distraught and doubt that comes from choices made after the loss of something important.

Where the show perhaps loses itself, is in the idea that memories are a way to gain access to the “W dimension ” or that memories are the source of the 4th dimension. The explanation being that the “W” dimension is where all the of unchosen possibilities exist, and the the XYZ dimension is reality or chosen possibility……. Needless to say complete understanding of this plot point may require a second viewing of certain episodes.

With all that said, the show is a interesting watch and I recommend people check it out if they haven’t done so. As of this post it is airing in the United States on Toonami,and can be found on various streaming sites.

Quick Things of Interest
The Opening and Ending are both great.

There is a bit of fan service in episode 4 and 5, it’s not bad but not totally needed. Just be prepared if that is something that may annoy you.

Certain animated profiles of the characters in reaction shots were a treat. Really enjoyed the outlines of the characters."

RESUMEN PARA LOS CARACTERES

Bueno, Isekai Quartet no es algo que requiera mucho resumen, ya que mantiene en parte la premisa del original pero que resumiré igual.
Básicamente es una serie en donde colocan a los isekais que tengan temporadas o proyectos por confirmar para promocionarlos entre si, pero para que no sea tan descarado los juntan bajo la excusa de un botón que los teletransporta, algo sacado del sombrero pero mejor eso a algo super complicado. Esta segunda temporada continúa con la clase 2-A (creo) en donde están los personajes principales de: Konosuba, Re:zero, Overlord y Youjo Senki, sumándose ahora (y definitivamente) la clase 1-A que tiene a lo que sobró de las demás series y a Tate no yuusha, que SPOILER aparece poco; Acá los perosnajes tienen sus aventuras escolares y clichés con múltples chistes hacia sus series y un cameo de lo más espectacular en el penúltimo episodio.

Fin del resumen

OPINIÓN DE LA SERIE

Ciertamente uno sabe que esto es una vil publicidad, eso se notó sobretodo en la primera temporada, en donde a pesar de que juntaron a los personajes en un mismo lugar, no lograron generar una química entre los personajes de las distintas series (konosuba con konosuba, re:zero con re:zero y así) lo que causaba cierto rechazo o por lo menos no era lo que tu estabas buscando, que era ver el Isekai quartet. Bueno eso en esta segunda temporada cambia radicalmente y ahora se ve como ellos son parte del mismo curso y tienen situaciones entre ellos, ya no dependen de los chistes de cada serie, sino que ahora pueden crear los propios en base a la química que hay entre todos los integrantes del Quartet.
El hecho de que ahora pudiera ver a los protagonistas calzando en este ambiente escolar pero sin dejar sus personalidades e interactuando con otras series es algo que se siente orgánico (o sea, se siente bien o que calza, no se nos hace ajeno), lo que hace que esta sea mejor que su predecesora, logran crear ahora si que si el ISEKAI QUARTET, es una serie nueva, ya no es konosuba + overlord + los isekai, ahora son personajes que se separan de sus series y pertenecen a esta serie, porque, seamos honestos, JAMÁS veríamos como Ains se queda en un lugar porque si o que ninguno trate de escapar, o nunca Tanya sería lo mitad de buena que se muestra acá, es por lo que acabamos de decir, estas versiones de los personajes (salvo los de Konosuba, esos tienen tanta carisma que seguirían siendo ellos mismos hasta en Berzerk, algo así como gintama, que no viene al caso pero nunca debe faltar gintama en la vida) son solo parte exclusiva de esta serie y no son una copia pegada en este show.
Resumiendo, esta serie no es fantástica, ni perfecta ni un cambio radical a la industria o la forma de ver el mundo, pero nunca trata de serlo, es una serie que promociona a las otras series de una manera muy creativa, porque el que se lancen chistes entre ellos haciendo alusión a sus series te hacen querer ver las series para entenderlo, pero esta segunda temporada tiene un norte, ya identificó como funcionar y conoce a su publico, sabe lo que ve y lo que le gusta ver (ejemplo perfecto de esto es el cameo antes mencionado, que para quienes vimos la serie, fue un momento épico que sabremos que se repetirá), Isekai Quartet 2 es una serie muy chistosa y entretenida de ver para pasar el rato.

MVP
(Redoble de tambores)

Visha

Realmente la pongo porque en la temporada 1 la única que hablaba era Tanya, por lo que todos tuvieron muchos más momentos, como Visha que es un amor, literalmente es de esos personajes que te calientan el.... corazón (malpensad@s) y muestra mucho más esa faceta.
Ciertamente no es la mejor personaje, ni la que tuvo los mejores chistes, pero me cae bien y esta review es mía, así que si es la MVP es la MVP

Mejor remate o chiste

154459,"There’s almost always one random anime that will get some controversy no matter if for something that is minimal or stupid yet will become the center of criticisms about the show, and in this case the series that got this treatment was KimiZero. For some reason, the main girl made some people go crazy with part of her gimmick, which in this series is that she already had relationships with other boys in the past and even had sex with them. That’s all, and as it was proven in the past by series like HigeHiro where you could complain about basically anything like bad writing, bad animation, badly written characters, etc, but instead people ignore them and whine about a completely unrelated thing, as the main complain there was also that the girl in the cover wasn’t a virgin.

Some people will say that the writing of this series seems like it was made by an incel, and I have to disagree, after all, that kind of people are the most likely to complain that the girl had sex before. In fact, I can’t comprehend how such a simple series like a romcom got so misunderstood, the memo that you get from here is not that having multiple relationships and sex with literally anything is good, no, the series paints this in a negative light and Runa regrets it because it happened due to her bad decisions on how to make a significant relationship. The fact that this simple fact gets over so many people’s heads is surprising to me, as it is something very easy to pick up from so many episodes, the one in the festival in particular is extremely blatant about this. This series at least tries to make sense, as some people will have a sexual life earlier than others, and they might regret it later if it isn’t with someone that matters to them in the first place.

But now, is KimiZero a good series? Of course fucking not, as much as I want to side with the fans of this series, that simply isn’t possible for me. At the very least, I think this series is commendable for actually having the main girl who is super popular and beautiful interacting with boys, and having had relationships in the past, because in most romcoms God forbid that the main girl has ever interacted with any boy except the MC. The series obviously suffers from average romcom and light novel writing, nothing actually exciting happens, and when it does, it is written like a Mexican telenovela, like, do people think that the twin sister of a girl faking to be her is not something ridiculous? As it happens, the MC is also bland as hell and the relationship came to be in a completely unnatural way, it happened because Tanjiro asked Runa to become his girlfriend after he lost a bet with his friends and she simply accepts like it was nothing, no one in their sane mind would see this and think it isn’t forced, and even if some moments between Tanjiro and Runa were fine enough, it isn’t enough to see this series and think it was anything meaningful. I can stand the telenovela tier writing because I grew up watching a lot of them, so that’s why most romcoms are not something that bother me at all, and this one is not exception, this series is simply boring most of the time and not much more, it isn’t actively annoying, and it was a good enough joke when a character started talking about something they are very passionate about and the other was completely lost without understanding anything.

Nicole acting like a bitch towards Tanjiro was always something weird, she constantly told him that he shouldn’t do anything bad about Runa, when he looks so inoffensive and his personality is literally “I’m nice”, I can only wonder if she was doing the same for previous Runa boyfriends or if she saw Runa being hurt so many times she started being overprotective coincidentally with him, I want to believe the second one, especially because Runa seems to ignore a lot of her advices, but there’s nothing to tell me that she isn’t like this because the current guy is the protagonist and apparently she must annoy him. There’s also other romantic relationships happening in the background with Tanjiro’s friends and the other gyaru, but they go nowhere and fail miserably at it. And Maria is probably the side character that is most important, her deal is really weird, she is also in love with Tanjiro and he even confessed his love towards her in the past but she rejected him, so why is she seeking for his love now even after she rejected him before? Is it just to have more drama in the show, as it happens she is jealous of Runa, but at the same time wants to be more noticed by her because of their relationship? She acts like a bitch half of the series and then victimizes herself, she clearly has problems in her, and it all revolves around Runa and Tanjiro.

As it stands, KimiZero is basically just a generic romcom with more drama than it should have, but at the same time has a female MC that seems more plausible than other girls from other romcoms, thanks to her not being an untouchably pure virgin. I seriously cannot make an effort to be on either side of the conflict about the series, since I for one think that anyone can have any relationship with anyone they want, so I cannot agree with the haters, but I also disagree with the people saying this is a wholesome show, as nothing about it stands out as actually meaningful or even cute.

Thank you for reading."

Pseudo Harem” is a romantic comedy like many others, such as ‘Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible’, ‘Teasing Master Takagi-san’ and the more recent ‘The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses’. This type of romance is never intended to have a complicated story or events. This type of romance is above all based on following cute characters who already have a predisposition for each other.

First, we follow “Rin Nanakura” and “Eiji Kitahama” in their daily lives, as they both belong to the drama club.
What surprised me about these two characters was their individual characters. Sometimes, in this type of romance, you come to think that one of the characters arrived there by chance, and that the romance is a little unrealistic in relation to the character of each.
The two characters have excellent chemistry, and you can feel it from the first second of the first episode to the last second of the anime! 
The special aspect of the anime that “Rin Nanakura” plays different roles to please “Eiji Kitahama” was very original and done in a way that didn't make the relationship between the two characters unhealthy or weird at all, on the contrary it brought back a varied humor and a way of circulating the feelings that “Rin Nanakura” has for “Eiji Kitahama” that was really enjoyable.

And I also appreciate the fact that you didn't put the two characters in the same class, that you didn't fall into that easy scenario :)
And for perfectly handling the end of “Eiji Kitahama's” studies.

I like that the romance progresses over the episodes and doesn't drag on. The events and interactions really serve a purpose and don't just fill up the episodes.
 “Eiji Kitahama” is also an excellent male character, he's not a stupid guy who doesn't see his own feelings or those of ‘Rin Nanakura’, even if he doesn't necessarily show it openly during the series, we understand that he loves her without having to have those thoughts about him directly!
I also particularly like the fact that he's very attentive to “Rin Nanakura's” little sister - it's just a detail, but he really made me feel like a big brother to her.

Last episode : !The last episode was just unbelievable! It touched me so much, and fuck YES THE WEDDING PROPOSAL!!

In terms of animation, it's pretty simple, but it works well, so you don't need much for this kind of anime.
On the other hand, I'm terribly disappointed by the opening, which is really bad, with practically only still shots and no atmosphere!
It's a real shame, especially as it's very easy to make a really nice opening for this type of romance without going overboard.
I imagine the studio had to make do with the available budget, but frankly, they built the sets perfectly with the limited means available, and frankly, congratulations to you!

!As I love stories that don't go round in circles, THANK YOU for pairing them up in the middle of the anime, THANK YOU for not making us wait for a kiss, bravo for keeping things interesting after the declaration of love that could have made the anime boring.! I'm a fan of these short romances, which for me are the essence of a romance, no need for a love trio, no need for a blind main character, no need to see them fool around for 6 seasons before having a tiny advancement. No need for an ultra-popular girl who strips naked to please the masses. JUST THANK YOU for still creating this kind of work that takes you to the heart!

If you like the romances I mentioned at the beginning, you'll probably like this one!
This anime is just excellent, and above all, it's short! Here we have two complementary characters, who are really adorable, and who are really good for morale. It's funny, touching, and you'll get what you came for. A romance that doesn't last 30 years, and a romance with two partners who were meant to be together :)

Thank you for reading this review, I hope you enjoyed it, please feel free to share it with me or just leave me a message :)

102680,"How this anime started made me want to clear my browser history and wish I used a VPN.

Most shows have some form of underlying message to them, whether it be to better yourself, there's more to life than work, power comes at a price, follow your dreams, etc.  Whatever it may be you should be able to find some form of message, and if I'm being overly kind to this anime I would say it's 'you can still make friends', however this is portrayed in the weirdest/creepiest way imaginable.

Miyako is a shy university student that rarely leaves the house and doesn't have any friends.  Her younger sister Hinata invites her friends to their house to play and meet her older sister, whom she adores.  Miyako then has Hinata and her friends dress up in cosplay outfits that she made, takes photos of them modeling in the creepiest way, while obsessing over 1 girl in particular (Hana).  Miyako then buy their silence of what happened at their house by baking them all pastries.

If the message is 'you can still make friends' why is it gone about in this way, this is legitimately the behavior of a pedophile!

The humor of this anime is often overshadowed by these pedo undertones, the jokes are typically at the expense of Miyako, with the punchline being the police will be called on her for acting the way she does.

I know that droves of fans of this series are quick to defend Miyako, rushing in to say she's not a pedophile, that she never did anything with Hinata or her friends to be remotely considered one.  Let's do a little metal exercise, instead of this implied yuri relationship, let's swap Hinata's older sister Miyako's gender.  What if Hinata had an older brother instead, and he does the exact same thing with Hinata and her friends.  He has them dress up in cosplay outfits, photograph them all while obsessing over 1 younger girl in particular, then makes them all freshly baked pastries so they don't tell their parents what took place at their house.

The never ending Miyako debate aside, good luck finding a character arc, how the characters are written at the start is essentially how they are in the end.  Most casual viewers are led to believe there is some character development between those who are a stalker/obsessive and those who are being stalked/obsessed over.  When in reality the characters being stalked/obsessed over simply get used to their stalker, like some mild form of Stockholm syndrome and not genuine character growth.

So many questions are raised throughout the anime and essentially no message should be taken away by the viewer.
Why is Miyako so obsessed with Hana?

Why is it portrayed that it's ok to buy off Hinata and her friends with sweets?

What is Miyako doing with all these photos of Hana? She never mentioned it was for submitting them for her university studies.

Why is there an unmarked van outside my house now?!

Here's my takeaway.
Don't accept sweets from strangers.  Don't do anything a stranger asks that makes you feel uncomfortable.  If someone is stalking you get a restraining order.   If you have a child, look into getting a nanny cam."
101231,"I'll admit it, I'm a Shinkai fanboy. Though, its probably pretty obvious if you look at my scores and see my high scores for all of his movies. Something about his stories really strike a chord in me, even if he seemingly retells the same story over and over again. He could tell it probably a dozen more times and I'd still love them all. This is probably the biggest reason why I didn't dislike Flavors of Youth, despite it being a little bit lacking in the emotional investment department.

Half of every great anime, but especially anime movies, comes from the visuals and soundtrack. It's an extremely rare occurrence when an anime movie can falter in one or both of these categories and still be considered decent. In the case of Flavors of Youth, it doesn't disappoint in either. The visuals are top notch, as expected from CoMix Wave, from which we got Your Name and Garden of Words, two of the most beautiful anime of all time. Also, big shout out to the San Xian noodles in the first story, Sunny Breakfast. Even now, I'm thinking back on those bad boys and getting hungry. The soundtrack for Flavors of Youth is really good, if not a little reserved. You'll not find anything quite as evocative as ""Sparkle"" from Your Name or as powerfully emotional as ""A Rainy Morning"" from the Garden of Words, but I'll cut it some slack, because it's quite a task to measure up to those masterful works anyway. The ending song, WALK by Vickeblanka is easily my favorite song on the soundtrack. The more I listen to it, the more I deeply appreciate it. If those earlier songs are their movies standout song, then WALK is definitely Flavors of Youth's. 

Now I can talk about the stories, which is where the main issues lie. I've already alluded to the first story, Sunny Breakfast, a little bit. Character-wise, it's probably the weakest of the three, but that's to be expected. After all, its a story about one guy narrating his youth and how many of his most cherished memories were spent eating San Xian noodles with his loved ones. It's actually kind of beautiful in its own simplistic way. I've heard a lot that this is most people's least favorite story in Flavors of Youth, but it may just be my favorite. At least, favorite based on the story.
The second story, A Little Fashion Show, is probably the weakest in all aspects. I couldn't bring myself to like the characters very much and the story was really predictable. I'm not one to complain about simple stories, as is evidenced by my appreciation of the first story, but I'm a little less forgiving of the completely mundane story of A Little Fashion Show. It was just a mess of cliches with the message of....I'm really not sure actually. I guess you can say it was a coming of age story, but that just makes it sound even more generic and cliched.
The third story, Shanghai Love, is the story that is most Shinkai-esque. In fact, it kind of mirrors 5 Centimeters per Second perfectly until the ending. Personally, I really liked the story and characters outside of the main boy, Limo. I mean, that boy was basically a walking mistake, he deserved neither his best friend or best girl with his attitude. But that's a personal gripe, I suppose.

I feel like it's somewhat pointless to do a favorite character for this since there's only one character who got enough characterization to deserve the title, but oh well, I'll do it anyway.
Favorite Character: Mistuh- I mean Shao Yu
img()
Yeah...Not much to add here, she was the best character by default, since she got the most development and actually has a personality. Also, she's Chinese Mitsuha, so bonus points.

Despite me not loving Flavors of Youth, I'd still recommend it to anyone. It's so short and such a pure story that, even if you have gripes with it, you can still appreciate it for being what it is, a contemplation of short stories that each lean heavily on a different theme. The first on the cherished memories of eating with loved ones, the second on realizing that you must cherish your loved ones, and the third on communicating your feelings. Each of these themes are tackled really well, even if the surrounding story and characters aren't amazing. But if you have any appreciation for Mokoto Shinkai's work, then you'll probably enjoy the Flavors of Youth."
20853,"Mild spoilers, particularly for the end of season 1

How did this happen? Why did this happen? I know season 1 wasn't necessarily a masterpiece, but you could at least make the case that it had clear intentions, contrived as its methods tended to be. Here's it's a gigantic car crash at the beginning and end, occupied by a lot of nothing of note happening! What happened to all the big moments that season 1 was peppered with? What happened to letting characters sometimes have backstories or anything that could help them somewhat resemble actual characters rather than caricatures (not that the antagonists of the first season weren't caricatures anyway)? What happened to the wonky action scenes that often used actual movement and terrain to its advantage sometimes? How do you shit the bed this hard?

Oh wait, it's the second season of a mecha anime that already had some major scriptwriting issues that were bound to worsen as the series progressed. That explains everything! Geass R2 (ok that might be unfair cuz R2 ain't anywhere near as bad as this show), 00 Season 2, SEED Destiny, meet your new best friend as I proceded to beat the ever-living shit out of him! 

The first episode is literally just a baffling cop-out of the first season's ending. It's an actually incomprehensible middle finger and one of the worst first episodes I have ever witnessed. Both Inaho who got shot in the head at point-blank range and Asseylum who was shot by a VERS version of a shotgun in the head, are still alive with no major head or brain damage. Count Saazbum, despite being riddled with bullets, is alive, and Slaine takes both him and Princess Asseylum with him, and everyone just fucks off and rejoices, except Slaine who goes nuts throughout the course of the season. The finale of the first season was a horrendous cliffhanger that already relied on terrible melodrama and arbitrary sequences to sell itself, but actively undercutting everything it tried to accomplish is not at all a good way of trying to ""make up for it"". 

1 and 1/2 years later, Slaine has gone through the ranks of the VERS people, and with a now seemingly evil Asseylum leading, he feels that it is his turn to take charge and eliminate the humans of Earth to make it their new home. Inaho, and the rest of that military he was in, continue the battle, with little having being changed. The rest of the show until the finale is just Slaine rising through the ranks and Inaho taking down more VERS and keeping one prisoner to help him find Asseylum. Better than the first episode which has more plot holes that Saazbum had bullet holes, but a meandering mess where almost nothing of value happens. The finale just turns into this mush of obscene melodrama and rushed circumstance because they wanted to get the war over quickly and cut to everything and everyone having a mostly happy ending without the proper time necessary to devote itself to showing us a sense of proper reconstruction and consequences of the war's end. It's a baffling nightmare that makes me wish I was watching the final arc of Macross instead. 

Inaho and Slaine are the actual worst here, which is an accomplishment given how terrible Inaho was last season. Inaho continues to be a ridiculously overpowered tofu MC except with less arbitrary douchebaggery towards Slaine and more robo eyes because he really needed to cement himself as superhuman. Slaine is the ultimate angsty, melodramatic pile of shit who just screams blood, cries, and vows for vengeance without having any concrete character or even having his progression naturally link up with the first season in practice. There's so little to mention regarding any of the other characters either. There's nothing going for any of them outside of the camaraderie some of Slaine's lackey's towards the end of the series share. It's a neat gesture, but it's too little, too late. Everything else is just a black void that somehow trumps even the abysmal writing of the narrative.

Visually, the show suffers compared to its predecessor as well. The CGI was never good, but the mechs tended to be surrounded by large objects in the first season so they facilitated movement and covered up some of the faults that were present. Here, empty space everywhere, both on Earth and in space! That means we get to see the awful CG mechs in full glory, just hovering most of the time. The 2D artwork is still solid, however. Sadly, it's wasted on pretty mediocre character designs that don't tend to have too much movement during most of the action scenes because TROYCA's awful CG (maybe it was A-1 Pictures, I wouldn't be too surprised) needed do be dragged around all the time. There's significantly more actual animation when the characters are running around doing their own escort missions or hanging out than during the battles themselves. It's pretty, but that's all there is.

The dub was ultimately one of the only saving graces of the show, even with some of its star players such as Patrick Seitz gone. That said, the dub is once again overshadowed by the show's OST which comes with several new insert tracks and bombastic background tracks to marvel at. There aren't too many new additions and the new tracks aren't quite as good as ""No Differences"" from season 1, and perhaps this isn't one of Hiroyuki Sawano's best OSTs, but it's still one of the highlights of this miserable series. The opening, ""&Z"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki, is a stellar track that builds up a sense of tension and melancholy before launching into a bombastic sequence that hypes you up for each disastrous episode. The main ED, ""GENESIS"" by Eir Aoi isn't as great as what came before, especially when it goes from emotional to sorta plain in the chorus, but it's still a nice song to listen to. The penultimate episode's ending theme, ""Harmonious"" by Asseylum Vers Allusia starring Sora Amamiya, is a lot more emotionally resonant, really representing the emotional climax the penultimate episode wants to have. 

It's been several years since I've seen it, and I still remember how much of a disappointment Aldnoah.Zero was. After season 1 fell apart, season 2 decided to trample over any good will that was left before meandering for 10 episodes and then crashing and burning in spectacular fashion again. It's amazing to witness how easy it became to get disillusioned with this franchise by this season if the previous one didn't already do the trick. It's like witnessing a car crash and wondering if the people survived only for the wreckage to explode at the very end! It's amazing! I wouldn't say I despised this season, but it really was a gigantic misfire that imploded in on itself. This second season makes the first look like Turn A Gundam, and that comparison is honestly fitting if you've seen both A.Z and Gundam. If nothing else, it was entertaining to see the community react the way it did to this mess. Still, watching and talking about the show is honestly tiresome, and that right there speaks volumes of this dumpster fire more than its catastrophic first episode ever will."
3782,"The following review assumes familiarity with the reviewed material. Spoilers below.



To say that the second Kara no Kyoukai film--Murder Speculation Part A--is a bit confusing is an understatement. While the literal events that unfold aren't particularly difficult to parse, the characters enacting them have opaque and blurry motivations, which blunts any possible emotional impact and renders the entire narrative--down to its intended tone, confused and unclear.

Murder Speculation's three main characters are Shiki, a reclusive girl who is the possible heir to her family's fortune and unknown to most is a serial killer, SHIKI, her split personality who is more rebellious and punky, and Kokutou, a shy nerd who falls for Shiki. If these descriptions seem slight, well, we're not really given much insight into their personalities and none of them really grow outside of the fairly short descriptions I've given here. We get some backstory wherein SHIKI tries to explain that he (I am told SHIKI uses male pronouns, and am not about to debate the gender identity of a doubly-fictional person) is in charge of Shiki's ""repressed emotions"", and in a turn of phrase that I am only very slightly paraphrasing, and is so laughably clunky I desperately want to believe it's the result of a poor translation, says that the ""only emotion [Shiki] feels is murder.""

Kokutou of course finds out that Shiki is a murderess (fairly early on in fact), but it's here where the film takes a bizarre narrative turn. Rather than going to the police (he is rather close to an individual implied to be the lead investigator in the murder cases), he simply chooses not to believe her. Then, when he actually witnesses her murdering someone, chooses to stake out her house every night in a strange ploy to temper her murderous instincts (recall that the film frames Shiki's impulses as not being her own fault). Unbelievably, this actually works for quite some time, an entire fall and winter, in fact. Then, in the film's only genuine moment of suspense or action, Shiki attacks Kokutou, coming dangerously close to killing him. We're not really given much clue what happens after that. There is a timeskip near the end of the film to a few years later, where Shiki appears to be in a coma, but again the film fails to provide any reason for what occurs within it, and without proper background knowledge of the source material this entire development comes across as confusing. 

There is furthermore the issue of Kokutou's character. Whether he's supposed to scan as genuinely kind and endearing (which he very much does not) or as dangerously obsessed with a woman he barely knows to the point of his own detriment (which he sort of does) isn't really clear either. This isn't an inherent problem, and in a better-executed film could be a point of intriguing ambiguity, but it doesn't seem to even be on purpose here, and rather feels more like the film either simply forgot to provide us with some kind of emotional connection to this character, or was simply uninterested in doing so in the first place.

There are certainly positives, mainly aesthetic ones. Animation studio ufotable remain as capable with pen and paintbrush as ever, and their astounding backgrounds bring a haunting sense of eeriness to scenes that desperately need some kind of tonework and emotion. Furthermore, the subtle visual distinction between Shiki and SHIKI, which mostly comes down to body language and some very slight design alterations to make the latter look more androgynous, are a really nice touch, as is her floaty, wraithlike movement in her confrontation with Kokutou. The soundtrack is, of course, excellent, adding another notch to Yuki Kajiura's long belt. Unfortunately none of this can excuse the seriously lacking narrative.

So what we're left with again is a movie that down to its title and its short runtime (a minute short of an hour at 59 minutes), feels like and is indeed largely branded as the second episode of a series rather than a proper film, but the fact remains that while it is obviously a sequel to the first KnK film at least in terms of release order, the fact that its plot takes place earlier in the franchise's chronology and thus neither film provides any real narrative or emotional context for the other makes it fall flat on that axis too. It comes across as hollow. Well-made, certainly, but without any real care as to whether you understand it or not. To be generous, it scans as a ""for fans only"" affair. There is of course the possibility that later ""episodes"" will draw on what this one has laid out, but what that essentially means is that this particular film is, on its own, all buildup and no resolution."
158417,"I really wanted to like Go Go Loser Ranger. I thought the first three episodes were really good and was eagerly looking forward to seeing the payoffs from what it had setup. Instead it led into a six episode arc of introducing far too many characters, dumping their entire characterisation on the audience at that moment, and then expecting you to care about the fight the anime then stuck you in for the entire middle portion of the show. A fight in a car park, with constant repeating frames and boring visual design. The stark generic characters stood out even more in how utterly bland and cliche they were by trying to stand out against the visual equivalent of white noise. This sluggard pace middle arc drags the quality of the show immensely.

While I thought the show would pick up towards the end (and stuck with it due to thinking it could perhaps work itself out of what felt like an obligated shounen setup to embrace its own identity and play to its strengths) the final arc has two really good episodes that finally feel like the show realised what it should be about before ripping it away!with Peltrolta getting the kill on Blue Ranger, rather than letting D live up to his potential and his skillset of being a very smart, backstabbing SOB!.

D was the only character I truly liked watching in this show, and even then I felt  his characterisation was fumbled and odd. With the roster of side characters he was stuck with, he stood out as the only one the author had any intent of putting real development on. Special mention goes to the female characters who almost all seem to be some flavour of psychotic !shoutout to the brocon! or completely bland expies (Hisui design wise feels like someone did a GGLR design of Tatsumaki from OPM, she feels like a 'copy my homework' design,the same for Ranmaru who looks like the purple-head kid from My Hero Academia.)

Perhaps I put too much expectations on this show to live up to its own portrayal of itself as a 'The Boys' but for Super Sentai, but I don't think it lived up to those expectations or managed to deliver well on its aims well. It feels like it only embraced its tone correctly around Red Ranger, and even then he comes across as comically rather than psychotically villainous.

The standout of this show is that both the OP and ED are great, both visually and musically. If the show had possessed as much creative visual metaphor and design as in its OP/EDs it would have crafted a much better identity for itself rather than being a very generic and very dull action show with tedious characters and a plot that ground to a snail's pace. Otherwise, it's a very mediocre show with a great start that then slowly and deliberately meandered itself into dullness. A great premise, I just wish it was explored in a show better than this one."
113693,"Description : Une très bonne suite d'un isekai où une petite fille veut faire des livres.

Bonjour à tous
On se retrouve aujourd'hui pour faire le point sur cette anime : Honzuki S2.

img()

Pour commencer, Honzuki S2 est un bon anime en soit mais une très bonne suite de la saison 1 où l'on voit bien le développement de Main dans le temple et où l'on voit le développement des personnages du temple comme le Grand Prêtre ou comme l'ordre des chevalier.
Ce qui est pas mal non plus, c'est que l'on voit pas mal que Main arrive de plus en plus à contrôler sa magie et il y a un peu moins de passage ou elle est malade ou fiévreuse. On retrouve également les orphelins qui aident vraiment au développement de l'histoire et l'on voit bien Main qui fait tous sont possible pour les aider à améliorer leur vie quotidienne mais aussi à faire un livre avec des méthodes de plus en plus efficace mais qui nécessite de 
plus en plus de monde et d'outils.
Nous voyons également que la haine que les nobles ont pour les roturiers n'est pas prête à disparaître mais ce que j'aime bien également c'est que certains personnages de la série apporte de la nuance à ce propos, ce qui évite à l'anime d'être trop manichéen.
Ce que je trouve un peu dommage, c'est que l'on voit de moins en moins sa relation avec Lutz ou Benno, mais bon, je me dis que cette arc est vraiment consacré à sa position de vestale bleu et de directrice de l’orphelinat.

Conclusion :

Honzuki S2 est un bon anime et une bonne suite de la saison 1, je vous le conseille vivement car il rapporte de la fraîcheur. On se fait facilement prendre par l'histoire et de plus, ce que j'aime bien, c'est que l'on évolue en même temps que les différents personnages.
Ce que je veux dire, c'est que l'on se met très facilement dans la peau des personnages 
 principaux, et que l'on veut que Main réussisse à faire un livre le plus vite possible. Une autre raison pour laquelle je vous conseille cet anime c'est que, on y rigole de temps en temps, il
 y a un peu de comédie qui nous fait franchement du bien quand elle est bien dosé. Également, je trouve que les scènes de famille avec les parents et Tulli sont très bien faite et l'on ne souhaite que le bonheur de Main dans sa nouvelle vie.

152681,"Part 1
Step-Siblings
 
“I cannot fall in love with you. Because, after all, we were step-siblings.”
 
 
 
Romance is often unpredictable. You can be tainted for years unfazed by the romantic hints that are showered around you, but there can be that unexpected moment where you've met the person you deem to be a viable romantic partner. Initially, you are unsure of the things you feel and moments where you denied and ignored their existence in order to create a temporary peace with yourself and the people you had feelings with, but you cannot deny that the feeling inside your chest is slowly blossoming day by day until it eventually bursts. Normally, people would just confess to satisfy their feelings, but due to specific circumstances, they weren't able to. In this anime, we follow Yuuta Asamura (Kouhei Amasaki) and Saki Ayase (Yuki Nakashima), both high school students who were strangers to step-siblings overnight because their parents remarried. Initially, they've started their step-sibling relationship as nothing more than cautious, considerate, but rather distant. As time went by, they started to notice each other, which eventually led to them having unrequited feelings for each other. A classic falling in love story. However, there is an obvious obstacle that stopped them from taking a step forward, and that is the label of a “step sibling.”
 
Step-siblings are in an awkward situation. As the show implies, both of you are practically strangers at one point, forced to be siblings due to contractual and social reasons out of your control. There is a clear point in society that you should never have anything related to romance or intimacy with your siblings. Society condemned the act as undesirable, whether socially or scientifically, but what about step-siblings? On one hand, it would justify its act of intimacy in a scientific light since these characters are not biologically related but rather just contractually related. But the latter option is where it holds back. The morality of having romantic intentions with your stepsister can still be a taboo topic regarding its relation to having romantic intentions within the family. As the characters in the anime put it, it's inappropriate—or rather immoral—in the situation.
 
It would be an easy answer to say, “Just don't do it and find another person,” if you are looking from an outside perspective. But falling in love with a person is not a switch you can just turn off at ease. Love is complicated, even when it is morally forbidden. Many animes taking the step sibling trope would usually gloss over the bombshell and just play the romance as it is, either in a comedic light or an entirely ignorant take. With that being said, Days with My Stepsister presents this moral dilemma topic in a more realistic and down-to-earth way that really challenges a person’s perspective over this relationship, whether which side of the morality you side on. 
 
Following the social norms, or being selfish?
 
This anime obviously would not change your current perspective on romantic intentions among stepbrothers, nor would it change the status quo, but it would enlighten you to be open-minded about the silent screams of the characters’s hearts.

Part 2
A Blossoming Romance
 
 
 
One of the main takeaways, especially in Episode 1 of this anime, is that it is slow in many aspects. I would like to talk about how this series was directed, but I will save that for Part 3 of this review. For now, I would like to talk about the slow, progressive romance in the series. 
 
A slow romance story is something viewers mainly tick off. You invested your time following these characters, and there is very little development between them. A lot of romance anime have this issue lightening up around them and can make or break the overall series. However, this anime takes that “slow” romance as an advantage and an addition to its already sensitive topic. Like I mentioned in Part 1, these characters are having a dilemma about going forward with each other because of the status quo. It felt refreshing that the trope of being distant towards the person you are slowly developing romance with has a stronger impact and a sense of interpersonal threat. 
 
You are greeted with these characters, who are distant and awkward towards each other. It makes sense that they would, since they were caught off guard by the circumstances they were given. As the story went by, they started to notice each other, finding out little things and doing mundane tasks that can be an eye roller to some, but this was a significant moment between these characters, even if it was as simple as noticing how one speaks or having that odd comfort of just eating alone together in silence. 
 
Although this anime mostly leans on slice-of-life aspects, focusing mainly outside of the character’s home while also interacting with side characters that are significant in their own way, It kind of worked in some way, demonstrating their inner thoughts and the retrospection space of these characters. 

Part 3
Directing a Light Novel Adaptation
 
 
 
Light novel series are generally harder to adapt than manga series in terms of the directorial side. Since mangas already have visual cues, you can just add in-between scenes with a director’s flair. However, light novel adaptations are generally dialogue-driven, letting the director (Soudai Ueno) and the staff fill in the rest of the gaps, which is huge. It is generally not a huge problem since this is what adaptations are about. Just take time with the production and give those creative minds time, but we all know about the open secret in the anime industry that things get rushed more than they should have been. If the story is already strong, then it's fine, but it can be dragged down by its direction. 
 
One notable example I can give is Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten, which is a Winter 2023 anime from a light novel adaptation. The original source material is considered really good by the readers, but looking at reviews of the anime adaptation on AniList, for example, showed a rather significant amount of negative reviews. These reviews mainly pertain to how “boring” or “dull”. One main reason for it is how the adaptation was handled. The Light Novel was rather fast-paced but didn't involve that many visuals around the characters. So if you adapt a series that is mainly about that, you will result in an adaptation where their animation mostly revolves around moving lips and a bit of character movement here and there. The charm of the story is still there, but it is pushed down by its uninspiring animation. There are a lot of examples that support or oppose this argument,but the reason I have brought this up is that this anime adaptation might be a repeat of what I said above.
 
To see it through, I read the light novel and watched the anime simultaneously to see what could be a huge difference when it comes to its direction, and I would like to say that the anime has some highlights and bold choices that make the overall direction of this series stand out, but there are still things that hold it back.
 
For instance, I appreciate it that the anime took a more melancholic and silent approach with its adaptation, giving off those slowburn western indie festival film vibes that complimented well with the story they wanted to tell. The story acknowledges its taboo subjects and the overall nature and personality of the main characters in the series and incorporates it in subtly quiet shots with a bit of flair with its dialogue-focused sequences. The distinction between inner monologues and diary sequences alongside character interactions really helped the overall immersion of the series. This is best illustrated in the second half of Episode 8 where Saki and Yuuta are in the living room together, sharing a conversation and a bite of food. The silence in these scenes helped the gravity of the emotions characters felt, and I think it's quite a genius move to do so. However, the unique direction this anime took can be something that drags this series down. In comparison to the light novel and anime, the anime is pretty slow. I can already see a lot of reviews heavily leaning towards this, which can be detrimental for viewers who are not used to this kind of format. If you ask me, this direction definitely worked for me since this tone is also how I imagined it while reading the light novel. 
 
Despite what I have said above, there are some main points where it is detrimental to the series that even I, as a light novel reader, can find quite disappointing. One main factor around which the issues revolve is not understanding what these moments mean for these characters. In Episodes 2 and 3, there is a significant moment regarding Ayase, but the anime adaptation brushed the moment off and presented it as something that doesn't hold much importance. Another one is the side character of Shiroi Yomiuri (Minori Suzuki), where it's obvious for someone who reads the light novel and compares it to the series that this is not the same character in the light novel. This is especially true in Episode 5, where Shiroi is subtly portrayed as a losing heroine, whereas the light novel doesn't. These are the major inconsistencies that stand out to me, but there are many that have been sprinkled all around. 
 
Is this a passable light novel adaptation? I would say the tone nailed it, and I definitely enjoyed and connected to the somber tone it presented, but understanding these characters in specific moments unfortunately got lost in translation. 

Conclusion
 
 
 
Days with My Stepsister is one of the most unique romance anime out there that tackles a taboo subject and takes it in a more down-to-earth tone, complimented by its slower burn tone than counterparts would otherwise aim in the opposite direction. However, there are some moments that feel like you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle inside its unique directorial style. If you want to experience this story in full, I would highly recommend reading the Light Novels instead, since there are a lot of plot-significant details that are glossed over and/or recontextualized in the anime. If you are an anime watcher only, you might feel that sense of incompleteness from its mature storytelling that you unfortunately have to fill in the gaps on your own."
21033,"Have you ever heard of or watched the famous Twilight? It's a serious romance story between a human and a vampire. If there's an opposite version or vibe of it, I think this is the one, but seriously hilarious.

So this anime was part of my getaway animes since 2015. Jitsu wa Watashi wa or Actually I am is a supernatural romantic comedy show about a love story of a human and a vampire. I just found this anime somewhere on google, and seriously, I didn't regret a bit watching it. Heck, I watched this anime numerous times and I never get tired of it.

The story was somewhat cliched. It's a story of a timid, yet honest boy named, Kuromine Asahi. He was known as ""the leaky basket"" by his friends and classmates because he can't keep a single secret. He's 100 percent honest. Even his secret that he had a crush on the mysterious Shiragami Youko and he planned to confess to her. But all things didn't end well when he found out Youko's secret that she's a vampire. She had a condition to her pops that if some people found her secret, she was going to drop school. But Asahi can't keep a secret so he swore with all of his heart to protect it. And the funny thing is, his confession was a failure. Because he ended up being her friend, which isn't a bad thing.

Even though the premise was generic, the comedy and the humor sold me off. Especially when the other characters had unique personalities and characteristics. There's an alien, a perverted werewolf, a childhood friend wearing talking glasses, and a demon principal. All those women were a pain in the ass for Asahi because he couldn't keep a secret and how the heck is he supposed to keep it from everyone? Which the characters lead to a series of unfortunate events and how they would solve them. The funny thing about this show was the unexpected situations. And of course, the romance between the characters bloomed in their relationship with Asahi. I know Asahi will end up with Youko but I still ship him to Mikan or Nagisa. I haven't read the manga but the last episode was a cliffhanger and unsatisfying. 

The animation was decent. Surprisingly, it was animated by TMS Entertainment, known for its romantic comedy animes, especially shoujos like Fruits Basket. The art from the manga was not good but the animation style was improved. The expressions of the characters were solid, especially the humor expressions. It gave a good romantic vibe.

I like the music and I didn't know it was composed by Nijine or Akito Matsuda. Akito Matsuda is good at composing music from light-hearted romantic comedy and I like the variations of HOLOGRAM insert song. It was cute and sweet, as well as funny. The OP was decent but the ED was forgettable. Heck, I haven't heard the ED since the first I watched it.

The characters were solid. I like the uniqueness of the characters, especially Mikan. Although she always bullied him she kept her secret for a long time that she's in love with Asahi. She always supports his back. Other characters were good as well. I found Youko's speaking was a bit annoying, even her being air-headed. Asahi is a good character, as well as his development in how hard he tried in keeping secrets. The principal was kinda annoying though.

Overall, this show was hilariously funny. The show had its best parts and some boring parts. But despite its flaws, in the end, I still really enjoyed it. If you want a supernatural rom-com about vampires, I might recommend this show to you. This is so enjoyable than you ever know.

107956,"I’m going to start this review off with a warning; if you’re going to watch this anime, do NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT, read the light novel or look up spoilers for said light novel before or while you’re watching. If you do, it will probably ruin the experience. I found out about the anime I’m talking about before it started airing, and I was interested in watching it because of how cute and wholesome it seemed. However, the light novel spoilers got to me, but I still wanted to watch this anime, no matter what. With that, I made a deal with myself; if the anime doesn’t get that far or has an original ending, I will completely skip the light novels. Thus, I went ahead and watched it, and while the aforementioned light novel spoilers hindered my enjoyment, I’m kind of glad I did.

Lads, ladies, and non-binaries, here is my review of “Uchi no Ko no Tame Naraba, Ore wa Moshikashitara Maou mo Taoseru kamo Shirenai.”, known in English as “If It’s For My Daughter, I’d Even Defeat A Demon Lord”.

Uchi no Ko (as it shall henceforth be called) follows Dale, a skilled adventurer who one day encounters a little devil girl while on a job in the forest. It’s clear that things have been rough for the girl named Latina; her father and companion has died and left her alone, she is dressed in rags, and she has a broken horn, which, for devils, is the mark of a criminal. Dale, being the kindhearted guy he is, is unable to just leave her to die, so he takes her home and ends up becoming her adoptive father. It’s not long before Dale falls in love with being Latina’s parent, and he goes through the trials and tribulations of raising a child as well as constant heartbreak when his job tears the two apart. Meanwhile, as Latina grows up, she learns about the world around her, as well as herself.

Take Daikichi and Rin from “Usagi Drop”, age Daikichi down, and throw them into a fantasy setting; if you do that, you’d get Uchi no Ko in a nutshell. Just like that anime, it has a really simple slice-of-life story with little conflict. With that said, though, there is an arc in this series that I feel like goes on for too long. Sure, what is shown in this arc is most likely in the light novel (don’t quote me on that), and it captures the process of going to a faraway place accurately; still, I feel like the story arc could have wrapped up in an episode less than how long it went on for. Some of the content of this arc just felt like filler.

As for the characters.... Latina. Okay, moving on! No, seriously, Latina’s the star of the show here. One may think she’s too perfect, but there’s no denying how adorable she is, both inside and out; she also grew as a character, no matter how small her growth was, and I enjoyed seeing that. I also enjoyed Dale’s character; even though he doesn’t really visibly grow as much as a character, he has gotten quite a good number of laughs out of me. As for the other characters.... well, there’s really not much I can say about them. There are quite a few supporting characters who interested me but didn’t get that much screen time, and there were others that I just did not know how to feel about. coughMayacough I swear, though, if the supporting characters get most of their development in the light novels that go beyond the anime, I’m going to get mad!

Okay, so the characters aren’t this anime’s strong point, so what is? I’d say the voice acting and music. While the opening and ending themes, which are respectively “I’m with you” and “This is Yuusha, but Zannen?!” (which are each sung by Latina and Dale’s voice actors, Kanon Takao and Nobuhiko Okamoto), aren’t songs I’d replay over and over, they’re both catchy songs that fit the tone of the anime quite well. The voice acting was also pretty good, with a standout performance from Kanon Takao, the voice of Latina; she hasn’t had many roles yet, but with how adorable her voice is and how much it fit Latina, I’d say she has a bright future as a voice actress. I want to say that the animation studio behind this anime, Maho Film, has a bright future, as well; after all, as far as I can tell, this is their first project. Unfortunately, while the art is nice to look at, the animation is not always consistent; still, there’s always room for improvement!

Overall, Uchi no Ko has a number of noticeable flaws, but it’s hard to say that it’s not enjoyable. If you’re in the mood for some father-daughter bonding in a fantasy setting, this may be the anime for you. Yes, it’s all just some very wholesome father-daughter bonding, and nothing more than that.... DON’T LOOK UP THE LIGHT NOVEL SPOILERS."

Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!


Img() 

 I had to do at least one review of an Isekai and looking through my list I had many choices. I ponder and I decided in this because like the protagonist says a lot it is average. 
Img()
This is a surprising enjoyable Isekai it has it all, awkward humor, a lot of reference to other anime, and enjoyable cast. Let us get down to the review: 
  Summary:
Misato Kurihara is a smart loving anime Japanese character that has no friend I wonder why? She dives right in front of truck trying to save a little kid from their impending doom. She makes a request to god before she gets reincarnated, she wants to be just average in power level to live a normal life in her new life. I know the complete 180 of most other protagonists, but she will surprise how versilete she is. 

What it does right: 
•	Lots of other anime references.
•	The characters are interesting. 


What it does Wrong: 
•	Cringy at times.
•	Cliffhanger ending with little chance of a season 2 
•	Seems like some episode are filler. 
•	Copy and paste plots

  Final Thoughts   


This anime is average every aspect of it has already been explored or has been done better in other anime. It still is enjoyable fun if you can get pass some of the cringe moments. The characters are interesting, and there is an active translation of the light noble if you are interested in continuing mine adventure. I read a few pages and it is one that I will take a read later in the future. The animation and art are decent for an isekai, the soundtrack is not to my taste. Well what is there left to say but I do not recommend it for hardcore anime watchers it is simply not worth the investment. The appropriate time to watch this anime is either as background noise, or just looking for a chuckle. It is as they say a prefer taste. 


 Final score Is as average as the they come (6 out of 10)"
19703,"It always sounds so pretentious to say that a work is only made more perfect by its imperfections. At best it seems like a meaningless, sophomoric word game; at worst it seems like you're trying to make whatever you're talking about immune from criticism. But I can't say why I love Kyousougiga so much without doing that, so there you go.

I'll at least be specific: when I say ""imperfections"" I'm talking about the obscurity of how the story is laid out; the slight visual inconsistency (the final scenes of episode 4, for example, are animated by a different person than episode 7's climax, and Koto's design is quite noticeably different in each); the first 5 episodes' insularity and consequent lack of sense that the narrative is progressing; and the way all the pertinent facts are finally revealed in one massive, unwieldy monologue that suddenly telescopes the scale and is also almost too much to take in all at once.

The reason I appreciate all these things so much is mainly because of the show's setting. The Mirror Capital is full of anachronisms and looks like it's made of paper cutouts. We know from the outset that it's a drawing come to life, and it looks like it. This comes across as self-reflexive to an extent, but really what I get out of it is just that the Mirror Capital was deliberately constructed by someone. It's a world made by parents for their children.

That's plainly obvious in episode 3, when Inari takes Kurama around the capital and tries to give him the means to pursue his interests. It's not an original or uncommon idea that parents will try to build a world for their children both to protect them and to foster their interests. Nor is it surprising that eventually, children want to leave that world.

It probably wouldn't surprise anyone to observe that Kyousougiga is about kids trying to escape a world constructed by their father's egoism and fear. (I happen to really dig that kind of thing.) But Koto (the little one) really makes the difference for me. Her conception was itself an act of rebellion on Inari's part, but she ends up being the one to resolve the consequences of his rebellion. She doesn't go totally over to the other side, of course; she doesn't submit to the Shrine's high priest.

Even though Inari's rebellious bent is behind the show's entire conflict, it's the reason why Koto, Yakushimaru, Kurama, and Yase exist. And he does love them, even if his love is imperfect. When they try to escape from the Mirror Capital, they're not rising to some kind of greater reality; the Mirror Capital is as real as the other 12 spheres, in the end. They're reacting to Inari's imperfections, and they'll bring that with them wherever they go. Even if kids leave their parents' world, their perspectives can still be influenced by the contrast between their parents' world and the countless other worlds out there.

Inari gave all his kids specific purposes, and they don't betray those purposes. But they do own them and direct them all toward their own ends. It's what lets Kurama be a great governor and inventor, what lets Yase provide a home for all the bizarre monsters that live in the Mirror Capital, and what lets Koto fight back against the Shrine. It's also something Yakushimaru struggles to do, but he gets help from his siblings (and NOT from Inari).

The constant interplay of imperfections lets everyone in Kyousougiga constantly develop and embrace their lives. Even if Koto's design is more angular and exaggerated in episode 4 than episode 7, it serves the scene well; even though the first episodes are insular and without momentum, the way they contrast with the latter episodes speaks to how the characters' lives change after the Mirror Capital is opened; and even if Inari's big reveal at the end is awkward and mind-boggling, it's easy to see it for what it is: a ""dropping of the scales,"" when kids first have to really see their parents as fallible.

That's why one of my favorite scenes in the show is when a young Koto, crying in the middle of the night, finds out her dad can also cry. Her strength, and the way her strength ultimately comes to be what Inari really needs, comes not just from how he nurtured and taught her; it comes from how they were able to share something in their imperfections."
168374,"LoopNana aired in the Winter 2024-season as an adaption of the light novel by Touko Amekawa. It is a Shoujo series related to the booming Fantasy-Isekai/Iyashikei genre, but with a rather new premise. The animation series consists of the classic 12 episodes à 24 minutes and is animated by the studios [HORNETS](https://anilist.co/studio/6360/HORNETS) and [KAI](https://anilist.co/studio/6312/Studio-KAI), both being rather small and young studios but having some experience in the genre.

In case you want a short recommendation of whether the anime is worth to be seen, feel free to skip the ""Analysis"" chapter and directly jump to the ""Conclusion"". In my opinion, there are no big spoilers possible for this kind of series - of course I will elaborate the premise and have to cover the content of the first episode.






The protagonist Rishe Irmgard Weltzner is a noble lady trapped in a loop of dying and being reincarnated as her five year younger self. The starting point of each loop is the cancellation of her marriage with the crown prince of her home country, so she decides to not waste her life on marriage but professions herself in different careers. As she enters the 7th loop, however, she is determined to prevent the huge war which ended her life six times, yet. She catches the attention of Arnold Hein, the crown prince of a foreign empire who will start the aforementioned war and killed Rishe in the sixth loop. As he proposes to Rishe, she uses the closeness to this fascinating and goodlooking man for her plans. She puts everything she learned in her previous lives to action in order to survive this loop and to help the people around her.







The world of LoopNana is designed similar to all the other Isekai-related series out there and based on the european late medieval / early modern epoch. Aristocracy rules over peasants, merchants, and craftsmen; wars are fought by knights using swords; people travel on horses and carriages. We know this setting from series as [LasTame](https://anilist.co/anime/156040/Higeki-no-Genkyou-to-Naru-Saikyou-Gedou-Last-Boss-Joou-wa-Tami-no-Tame-ni-Tsukushimasu/), [Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu](https://anilist.co/anime/151847/Kanojo-ga-Koushakutei-ni-Itta-Riyuu/), or [Mushikaburi-hime](https://anilist.co/anime/144533/Mushikaburihime/). The only noteworthy difference to several similar series is that there are no fantasy-elements like magic, elves or demons apart from the reincarnation. As the series does not explain it at all, us viewers are left alon speculating.

The start of the time loop highly ressembles [AkuLast](https://anilist.co/anime/139820/Akuyaku-Reijou-nano-de-Last-Boss-wo-Kattemimashita/) which also reincarnates the protagonist into the prince cancelling the engagement. While [AkuLast](https://anilist.co/anime/139820/Akuyaku-Reijou-nano-de-Last-Boss-wo-Kattemimashita/) takes its protagonist from another modern world just like a classic Isekai, LoopNana equips Rishe with knowledge of the world by reincarnating her in her former self. Time looping is not a groundbreakingly new concept, yet it is a refreshingly alternative premise which allows Truck-kun to take some well-deserved vacation. Furthermore, it changes the dynamics of the encounters as Rishe already has a certain relationship to most of the main characters, while they have never actually met Rishe before.

Episode 1 shows Rishes previous lives in flashbacks, sketching the mechanics of this world and introducing a lot of characters which make their reappearance throughout the series. Thus, the viewer gets a thorough understanding of the world, as well as Rishe's skillset. After that however, the story totally lacks a plot and only illustrates the abilities of the characters.



The series illustrates Rishe as the picture-perfect protagonist overcoming every challenge with ease. She has a smile for everyone, cares about the poor and weak, and tries to violate the norm for young ladies whereever possible. She wraps her former teachers around her fingers by playing at their weak points or by selling herself as the version they would like her to be. This not only removes nearly all tension from the plot, neither does it leave any room for character development which is completed within the first episode. I guess a standalone season covering Rishes previous lives could really have potential on that matter, though. All in all, her character is too perfect to add some value to the story.

Arnold Hein matches Rishe in terms of expertise, as he is considered to be the strongest swordsman in the world. Furthermore, he is intelligent and capable to manage the official duties at his palace - the perfect requirements for him becoming the heir of his father who does not make a single appearance throughout the series. Yet, Arnold's character is far more interesting than Rishe's. He opposes charity unless there is an economical profit for the country involved, playing the heartless antagonist he has been throughout Rishe's previous lives. There are also some sadistic vibes every now and then. Still, he worries about Rishe when she puts herself in danger. This paradox illustrates some traumata overlaying the good heart of the prince, most probably caused by the hatred between him and his father, or the old wound shown as scars on his body. The mysteries revolving around Arnold's personality are a major driver of the series and keep the viewer engaged. Furtheremore, the main love interest being the villain adds a fresh touch to the series. Sadly, this is left completely open for future seasons to possibly come.

The remaining characters are basically just support characters required to make Rishe shine. This also accounts for the antagonists, which indeed is a pity as they had considerable potential for a real development. The series however decides to have Rishe convince them immediately such that they overcome their trauma, express their sorrow and be forgiven. No development, no real punishment, no depth. Moreover, their actions where quite foreseeable. Particularly, I already knew how Rishe would convince the last ""villain"" two episodes before the final.


I would like to wrap up the analysis by listing things absent in this anime. The first is the aforementioned aspect of reincarnation via time loop instead of being transported from another world. Viewers of [Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu](https://anilist.co/anime/151847/Kanojo-ga-Koushakutei-ni-Itta-Riyuu/) or [Mushikaburi-hime](https://anilist.co/anime/144533/Mushikaburihime/) will particularly notice the decently low level of romance between the main characters, where related Romance-animes regularly lay it on so thick you might get diabetes. As a main contrast to LasTame and several other related shows, LoopNana abstains from a harem of love interests of either genre, although Rishe's former teachers are all good-looking men. All in all, LoopNana employs all its features decently without overdoing, which makes it stand out among similar series.

The opening song ""Another Birthday"" by [Shunichi Toki](https://anilist.co/staff/123971/Shunichi-Toki) is very calm which normally is the directions endings would go for. The animation shows Rishe in younger years long before the actual plot of the anime, introducing her as the happy sunshine she also enacts throughout the episodes. The soothingly happy notes support the visuals nicely. Towards the end of the song, the rhythm picks up a faster pace, emphasizing the dynamics Arnold brougth into Rishe's life - or maybe the other way around.

The ending ""Kienai"" by [THE BINARY](https://anilist.co/staff/237907/THE-BINARY) takes up on this direction, showing drawings of an alternative life of Rishe and Arnold meeting as children and growing up happily together. Paired with a rather düster/traurig/longing music, this song seems to tell of Arnolds traumata and how everything could have worked out much more happy.

A really noteworthy aspect of this anime is the graphical design. While other Iyashikei often lack good animation, this series really does a nice job on the visuals. You should not expect fireworks such as in popular fighting animes, but in my opinion we get some very decent and flawless work here.






LoopNana illustrates a typical aristocracy world romance known from countless other series. The source of power for the protagonist and the role of the main love interest add a fresh touch to the dusty genre, although it is sad that none of them is really explored in this season. Especially the picture-perfect protagonist renders the whole storyline flat and dull. Still, the interaction with other characters, her violating the norms and getting scolded by the prince makes for a decent and enjoyable Other-World-Iyashikei. The visuals, particularly the animations, outshine those of similar series although being nothing spectacular compared with fighting based anime series. The main point the series has going for it, is that it uses all its means with measures, not overdoing it on sweet romance or explicitly including harem dynamics. 

Therefore, LoopNana is a series fans of light Iyashikeis should be able to enjoy. I particularly recommend it to anime fans not familiar with Other-World-Romance, who want a light but representative entry to the genre."

In a year full of massive disappointment, hidden gems, and wonderful surprises, Aquatope manages to push through it all with its sheer... normality. It's a breath of fresh air after having watched so many shows with countless gimmicks, unworkable concepts, and disappointing characters. Aquatope is nothing groundbreaking, but it's exactly what it needs to be, and makes no attempt to be anything more.

 img70%() 

First off, the cast is incredibly strong - each and every character strikes a perfect balance between uniqueness and relatability. It manages a fairly large group, between its two leads, several supporting cast members, and regularly reoccurring side characters. Despite this, none of the characters feel like they trounce another; each has their own purpose, their own personality, and bring their own skills and background to each scene. In terms of consistency, I'd go as far to say that Aquatope has the single strongest cast I've ever seen in a series, there's pretty much no bad characters here.

Even the characters who aren't immediately trying to be likeable or nice manage to find their way into my heart, because they're written so believably that you can begin to see their point of view. This is most obvious with a character like Chiyu, who is a single working mother and its easy to dismiss her rudeness once you find that out. But the same remains true for characters we never get backstories for, like Kaoru and the Assistant Director - both are excellent additions to the series that bolster the cast in ways it was previously lacking.

 img50%() 

Obviously Kukuru (and to a slightly lesser extent Fuuka) steals the show - she reminds me a lot of Akko, my favorite character of all time, as both are reckless, devoted, and slightly selfish. Where the two differ is in their actual competence - Kukuru is a legitimately capable character which makes seeing her fail all the more emotional. And she fails a lot. Throughout the show we watch her sink deeper and deeper, and its through true friendship and hard work that she manages to swim back to the surface.

That's the thing: Aquatope's message is fairly basic and cliché, but I think the fact that it takes such a realistic and grounded approach to it makes it feel unique and fresh. There are obviously moments of dream-like wonder unfolding on screen, but those moments are few and because they're so fleeting they're extra magical. At no point, however, does it feel like things are just easy for the main characters. This isn't a fantasy story where everything goes right all the time. Both Kukuru and Fuuka are extremely hard working individuals, but even then both have to face fairly tough hardships and struggles. But it's never overly dark. It's never gritty, it's never depressing, it's never brutal, it's never raw. So many realistic stories get flaunted as such despite being overly grim and gross - how many times have you seen someone say something was realistically just because it had gore and sex? That's not at all how life really is, that's not what realism has to be, and Aquatope is a perfect example of that.

I must admit, I was a bit worried when I found out the show was going to be two cour. Add in a time-skip and marketing that omits one of the main characters from the key art and PVs, and I was sure that the series would stumble and falter like so many others this year. However, that is not even remotely the case - Aquatope's second half in my opinion is the stronger of the two, finally challenging Kukuru and Fuuka instead of holding their hands to the inevitable tragedy.

 img70%() 

There are moments of happiness throughout the second cour, some cute and wholesome episodes full of carefree fun - but there's this lingering feeling that all of its going to crumble. It perfectly captures that feeling that I think many young people go through, or at the very least a feeling that I've been experiencing for the past couple years. Everything seems to be going well, I have lots of friends, I'm not broke or homeless, and for the most part I'm fairly happy. But there's that uncertainty of the future, there's this constant fear that everything could break away from one mistake, and I'm endlessly worried that my pretty little fish bowl will shatter, and I'll flounder and flail as I wash away.

But even then, I can't let myself drown. It's in those moments, where the shore looks so far away and you're fully ready to let yourself drift off to sea, that you truly discover who you are. Aquatope knows this, and over the course of its entire run builds up to it to show exactly how it happens, how everything can go wrong, and how everything can return. It isn't sugar coating it - life can suck, but if you stick with those you love, you can push through.

TL;DR: Aquatope is certainly not the best show to come out this year, but it's my favorite. I was expecting a fairly standard ""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"" show with some classic yuri bait, but it had none of that. Instead it was just a really solid depiction of young adult life. I'm sure I'll return to it at some point, and hopefully by then I'll have pushed through the waves to be my best self.

Also, there's only like 11 scenes with any jellyfish, so 0/100, worst show of 2021 and possibly ever."

Here we are with the fifth season of Danmachi, the performance in the last season was particularly impressive, aligning perfectly with the anime's title as Bell and Ryu fought together to survive in the deep floors. And yet in season 5 another waifu gets involved with no one other than the “Rabbit Foot” himself—Bell Cranel, who is voiced by the well-known and respected ""Harem King,"" Matsuoka Yoshitsugu Bell truly lived up to expectations, successfully adding another 'waifu' to his harem. This time, the long-foreshadowed characters—Syr, Freya, and Hörn, created an outburst. As we are going to review on Danmachi after finishing the series, let’s begin with an impression of Bell as the protagonist who leads the show.

To be frank, Bell is one of the main characters I am not particularly fond of, mainly because of his shyness and tendency to hesitate during moments of adversity. This is evident in certain situations, such as when everyone is under Freya’s enchantment. Instead of searching for clues or solutions, Bell falls into self-doubt and hesitation. At times, he even seems inclined to fully submit to Freya’s plan.

img()

It’s worth noting that the members of the Freya Familia are overwhelmingly powerful, yet Bell, at Level 4, spends time wallowing in despair and self-doubt while being badly beaten. While his behaviour and the harsh treatment he endured during training were somewhat unbearable to watch, it’s important to remember that he is still a young and developing character at his adolescence. 

Enough of the criticism. Bell, as a main character, undeniably has his own charisma. Despite his indecisive and naive personality as a teenager, which often makes him appear hypocritical (as Freya pointed out in their conversation in episode 9), he consistently demonstrates the courage to redeem himself and protect the people he cares about. 
After enduring the harsh treatment in the Freya Familia, he managed to stand tall and confront his opponent. Since then, the more courageous he became, the more satisfying it was to see him shout, 'Fire Bolt!' His straightforward and brave nature has saved others numerous times, helping him overcome obstacles and, most notably, picking up girls in the dungeon.

img()

Moving on to the main event of season 5. Basically, everything happens because Freya confessed to Bell with Syr's appearance, and Bell obviously rejected her. Once the relationship among Syr, Freya, and Horn was revealed, I couldn’t really catch how it all worked until I started googling and getting the answer from all the great anime fans on the internet. I know they literally just show what it is in the anime; maybe I am just stupid. 
But personally, I think that one of the aspects that define a good anime is the series composition. We all know that the original source of DanMachi is a light novel. Unlike in words, which can elaborate the story in detail and comprehensively, it is challenging to adapt the story into anime with a limited length of only 15 episodes without the viewer pondering. While this might be the best product JC Staff could deliver for DanMachi, I just hope that they are putting some real investment into One Punch Man Season 3.

Well, don’t get me wrong; I am not hating on the outcome. Instead, the performance was rather satisfying. Danmachi season 5 does have its own strength. For example, it has consistently presented brilliant animations that elevate each battle in the show. Also, I believe most of us who like watching Danmachi were drawn by something ""fascinating"" about it, and the production team clearly got the selling point.

img()

Besides that, the disclosure that Syr was actually a shared persona of Freya and Horn in disguise was genuinely shocking due to the stark contrast in their personalities. The episode where Syr confessed to Bell was brilliantly executed. However, it was both irritating and saddening to see Syr got rejected. To think that someone would reject a kawaii girl like this is kinda crazy. Despite Freya's use of her charm ability was too much, Bell perhaps deserved a taste of his own medicine for rejecting such a charming waifu. HAHAHA!

Alright, in terms of the plot, the question is, will Bell either end up being with somebody or a harem king as usual? As for who he will end up with, deep down, I really hope that girl will be Ryuu, like she was the one who has been fighting alongside Bell. Remember that awful survival in the deep floor of the dungeon in season 4? I mean, he really should pick the girl who has gone through thick and thin together, instead of picking Ais, who has yet to get any main screen time. Anyway, the author needs make it looks convincing if Bell will be ship with somebody in the end. 

So far, I think Bell’s feelings towards Ais are more like admiration rather than affection. Ryuu is merely my DanMachi waifu. Just look at the episode where Ryuu fights with that dark elf; she is so kawaii on and off the battle. A fine lady who can be soft or tough. She’s got to be the one, isn’t she? 

Up to this point, the animation of DanMachi season 5 was rather satisfying overall. Not to say that it’s the best because the few episodes towards the end, especially the War Game have seemed a bit rushed in my opinion. Maybe the adaptation could have been done better,  but the conclusion of the anime was quite convincing. At the end, Bell decided to continue picking up, and we have Syr back as well, which is the reason DanMachi season deserves the credit. I genuinely hope the anime adaptation will carry on till the end, and we could have another sequel in a short while"
18689,"Spoilers ahead! Apologies for the length, I’m a university student coming off of a semester filled with grueling written assignments, and I’ve been looking for something fun to distract myself with. In brief: watch this series if you’re willing to put the time into a long (nearly 200 episodes over 3 seasons + OVAs and extras) sports series. It’s incredible, and well worth it. 

I’ve divided my review into parts, but my rating for each category isn’t weighted the same in the final score. I might sound a little pretentious because, again, I’m mostly used to writing essays for people I really have to suck up to, so please take everything I say with a grain of salt. 
``




At its core, Ace of the Diamond is about competition — both between teams and within them. Sawamura Eijun, the series’ protagonist, fights tirelessly to become Seidou’s ace, and he’s confident that he wants it more than anyone else. On a competitive team like Seidou, however, this is no easy feat — especially with Furuya Satoru, a pitcher made of “pure baseball talent” in his year, blossoming right before the team’s eyes.

The story revolves around Eijun as he moves to West Tokyo to attend Seidou, makes his way up to the first-string team, and pitches in tournaments. It explores the nature of competition, companionship between teammates, and, in a very general sense, overcoming obstacles. All of these components are pretty standard for sports anime, but I think Ace of the Diamond hammers them down in a really effective, if long-winded manner. Part of this is due to the dormitory setting, giving lots of time for team bonding between games and practices, in addition to the overall likability of Sawamura Eijun as a protagonist. 
``




A boisterous first-year who exceeds expectations, respects his seniors, and puts his all into everything he does, Sawamura Eijun is an excellent protagonist. You’ll feel good when he succeeds, you’ll cheer for him when he’s down, and maybe you’ll cringe a little when he does something embarrassing. He’ll grab you by the heart and pull you into his corner once you’ve known him for about ten minutes, just like he did to Miyuki Kazuya and the rest of Seidou. I prefer him to a lot of protagonists in similar series because of his goofiness and kindness, but it’s his single-minded conviction that’s most inspiring. 



I almost don’t possess the words to describe Miyuki Kazuya. As Seidou’s catcher and the series’ deuteragonist, he takes up his fair share of screen time. At the same time, he’s also kind of elusive. With an endearingly shitty personality, an affinity for provoking his allies, and an unbridled love for baseball, he simultaneously embodies the series’ themes and provides great comic relief. You can’t help but want more from Miyuki, just as Eijun does every day during practice. 



If you love Eijun as much as I do, chances are, Furuya Satoru will frustrate you. Furuya, the tritagonist, seemingly always succeeds when Eijun struggles, which causes a lot of narrative tension in the earlier arcs. This tension can be frustrating to watch, particularly since Furuya does not have a very dynamic personality. His backstory, though sad, does not help his lack of discernible traits beyond liking polar bears and muttering “stamina roll” to himself. He’s definitely not the worst this series has to offer, but you’ll almost always root for Eijun when they go head-to-head. If you like him, though, more power to you!



This series has so many characters. A lot of the great ones are on Seidou’s starting roster, like Kuramochi Youichi, Kominato Ryousuke, Yuuki Tetsuya, Isashiki Jun, etc.. Chris and Kataoka, one of the team’s managers and coaches respectively, are also vivid and dynamic within the plot. Most of the backup players really aren’t anything to write home about, though, and it can be a bit awkward when the narrative seemingly focuses on them out of nowhere. 

As for characters on opposing teams, Narumiya Mei and the rest of Inashiro Industrial really stand out, as well as a handful of characters from Yakushi, but the series definitely focuses most on Seidou. Occasionally, the Seidou-focus will result in antagonists being reduced to one or two personality traits (i.e.: Tachi from Kiryu’s creepy smile, Todoroki Raichi’s strength and hunger). This in and of itself is not bad writing, but if you’re expecting something like KnB, this element might require a bit of an adjustment. 

I only viscerally hate three characters: Ochiai, the coach that’s brought in about three quarters of the way through the season, and the two reporters who spectate nearly every single one of Seidou’s official games. Unfortunately, those three have a lot of screen time between the three of them, which can make for some really frustrating episodes. 
``






The underscore is fantastic, by far the best execution I’ve witnessed in a sports anime. Between the catchy melodies, intense rhythms, and dynamic swells that fit corresponding scenes perfectly, it does not get much better than Daiya, period. As someone who usually hates the sound of guitars, this series made me love guitar. Normally, I’d recommend listening to the OST before watching the series to see if you like the style, but I actually think you’re missing out if you don’t hear the songs for the first time while watching the show. 

The composer also works well with leitmotifs. Their skill is particularly apparent with Eijun’s theme, Grow Stronger Day by Day — you’ll hear this tune/chord progression overlay in a number of other tracks in varying degrees of subtlety. The soundtrack does well to reinforce the series’ themes of hard work, determination, companionship, and defeat. 

The openings and endings, too, are very thoughtful and fitting for this series. For the first season, my favorite opening is the third one, Hashire! Mirai, but all of them are excellent. While the second and third endings are a tad brash volume-wise, the visuals are adorable. Endings 4-6 feature some of the voice actors singing in their characters’ voices — always fun to listen to — making for a really relaxing break from some of the tense matches. 
``






I wasn’t expecting much, and the result was unsurprising. There aren’t any notable women in the entire story. At the start, we meet Wakana (one of Eijun’s middle school teammates), Takashima Rei (the assistant coach who scouts Eijun), and Eijun’s mother. Of the three, Takashima definitely has the most presence in the story, but she’s mostly sidelined during practices in favor of Kataoka and, later in the season, Ochiai (Though she does seem to have more presence than Oota, the club president who’s obsessed with Kawakami). Wakana, Takashima, and Eijun’s mother are all understandably tied closely to Eijun’s arc early in the first season, resulting in them having no significant influence over the storyline. 

Aside from those three characters, I can only recall four girls: Seidou’s managers. I enjoy their dynamic with the team, but they all seem very stereotypical and one-note. The only significant screen time they get is during the endings, and even then, Eijun always steals the show. 

That being said, it’s very refreshing to watch a male-dominated sports anime where the women aren’t sexualized at all. I found this to be a huge problem in Kuroko no Basuke and parts of Haikyuu, so in that regard, I was actually pleasantly surprised.
``




The only things that ever got in the way of my enjoyment of Ace of the Diamond were a handful of characters, drawn-out recap sequences, and occasional moments of secondhand embarrassment on Eijun’s behalf. The pacing can be a bit tiring at times, particularly with so many suspenseful scenes placed back-to-back, but taking breaks or watching at 2x speed can be helpful for some of those episodes. 

In case it was not apparent by my walls of text, I adore this series. Please watch it if you like baseball or sports anime even the slightest amount. I know that 175+ episodes over three seasons sounds daunting, but it’s a ride well worth taking. 

Thank you for taking the time to read, and I hope you have a nice day :)"
21031,"I like to think that I've sat through some terrible anime in my time. Black Bullet, Comet Lucifer, Mayoiga, Another, you name it. I'm a 'NoDrop' watcher, so I've seen my fair share of shit shows. Never did I think that a show would come along that was so incredibly bad, so intellectually bankrupt, that it would completely redefine what I would consider a ""bad anime series"".

I'll spoil the score for you right now: Taboo Tattoo is a legitimate 0/10. It has zero merit as a piece of art, animated work, or general entertainment. I would have much rather gouged out my own eyes than watched this series, and given the choice I'd have reached for the nearest rusty spoon in an instant. This show has no idea where it's going, what it's doing, or what it wants to do. At first, I thought this show was going to this season's Bungou Stray Dogs, where the story is retarded but at least the character designs and fights were cool enough to keep me halfway interested, but the animation quality for Taboo Tattoo took a complete nosedive after episode 1, devolving into commonplace CG and slideshow-like animation from that point forward. I distinctly remember a scene where a walking character simply didn't have an animated walk cycle, and instead her drawing translated about the screen freely. The music and art are also incredibly generic and bad, especially for a studio like J.C. Staff who at the very least produces consistently endearing character designs.

With a show this bad, you'd think that it was trying to be some sort of parody, but it's not. The characters of the show are it's standout terrible feature, with all of them having contrived and ridiculously plot convenient super powers that manifest out of tattoos of all things. Our MC is literally named ""Justice"", and has the best super power that is activated for free by the nature of him being the biggest, most tired trope. We have childhood-friend-big-tits McGee who is overused for the short half of the series that she is alive for the purposes of otaku pandering fanservice shots and light novel powertrip fantasies. We have Rin Tohsaka look-alike Antagonist Hime, who is incredibly gay and not much else. Like, no, she's actually a lesbian and the occasional yuribait jokes (of which there are maybe 4 or 5 total) are the only thing that even got me to look up from my phone. There's also the best fucking character ever, Bluesy Fruesy, the American secret services agent that's been sent to Japan to oversee tattao collection. Bluesy. Fruesy. That is a characters fucking actual name.

This show is an absolute dumpster fire. It regularly set new lows for the entire medium every single fucking week. Avoid it like the plague. I sat through it so you don't have to. The worst about it is that MAL and AL won't let me rate it a 0 because the site doesn't support a rating that bad."
6573,"This was a horrible follow up to the astute Darker Than Black season one, but it doesn't mean it's bad right? Okay, put your pitchforks down and have a listen to what I have to say. I don't outright hate the second season, I even bought the special boxset because I was really excited to watch the show, regardless of what I thought beforehand. Honestly from the looks of the opening, I didn't know what kind of direction it was going to go for. But it's more Darker Than Black so it can only mean good things from here on in.

This time rather than focusing on Hei, the story revolves around a young Russian girl named Suou Pavlichenko. Suou somehow gets wrapped up in the contractor stuff and eventually runs into Hei who is now a fugitive. It's an interesting mix because Hei is put in a very different situation than the first season. Instead of being blanketed by the safety of Hei's fellow comrades and The Syndicate, he is left isolated with only a few tools to use at his disposal. Hei is struggling to collaborate with others for fear of losing everything he knows and loves once again. Now mind you Mao is still present, only this time in the form of a flying squirrel, but as far as his story goes there really isn't much progress done to the original cast. Suou, on the other hand, is someone new, through her eyes, the life of a young contractor is much different from that of Hei's. Rather than going all out to finish the mission, she actually has a conscience and acts very unreasonable, struggling to fully understand her power. While this may be thematic to her character, it comes across as annoying when she just doesn't take the same initiative of more experienced contractors.

Season one had at least twenty five plus episodes, including Gaiden, to flesh out all of its stories, but there were still some questions that needed to be answered. If you thought they we're going to be concluded here then you're wrong cause they're not going to be answered at all. The focus is mainly on this new protagonist and her development in being a contractor and while it may only be twelve episodes, it is enough Darker Than Black to serve its purpose in this case. The story takes it even further in including some of the characters of season one in season two, which is where I found my main issue. I kept getting this nagging feeling that ""Hey wouldn't it be nice if we got a season 2 featuring those characters again? Like in the first season"". I felt like Misaki's inclusion in season two was just a way to have some continuity tying it to the first season. While yes the story may be slightly more coherent, there is still the feeling that maybe this would've been one of the few cases where it could have been served as a ""spin-off"" rather than a full-on follow-up where I was expecting the same characters take on a new setting. There is a lot of Season two that have me slightly happy for more of Hei considering he begins to show signs of slight emotion in his overall state. Hei becomes a regressive house-hobo that barely even looks like the Hei we're familiar with from the first season, and I don't think many would find the treatment of his character particularly great. Gemini of the Meteor isn't really all that bad as I made it out to be rather it is a shell of its former self that is learning to move on much like the characters in the story. The main thing about the characters in the Darker Than Black universe is that many of them require more than one episode to get some extended backstories. Some get more development than others and that is great, but in this case, Hei gets little progression at all. As mentioned above, if this had have been labeled as a spin-off  I might've forgiven the fact they left Hei out of the spotlight, but instead this is the follow up to the first season. Suou has all the time she needs to really grow as a character, and although she may not be interesting at times, it is forgiven considering that this is a coming-of-age story that develops her personality quite a bit.

Given that this season gets such a bad rep, I can't help but remembering that I was, in fact, enjoying season two as it's own separate entity. It certainly doesn't live up to the first season and Gaiden, but it's something to distract you from all the generic stuff that keeps appearing nowadays. I sometimes like to jump back and forth on the hate bandwagon for disliking this season so much, and with somewhat good reason as a fan of season one. This was a disappointing follow up to the first, however, it was a solid spin-off at the most. If you want to see what this season all about, go right into it, there are lots of entertaining moments to keep you invested. Keep in mind that all of you're questions carried over from the first season may not be answered and that the characters you grew to love may not get the screen time you might think they deserve. While it might take some time to adjust, Gemini of the Meteor is a decent series that shouldn't be missed. It might've let me down, but I appreciate it fully knowing this might be the last effort to make a Darker than Black relevant again."
151379,"“Okaerinasaimase, Goshujinsama!”

Simple words, yet it’s charming to see that greeting when you go inside a café with full of cute maids. They were dressed in black uniforms, a white aprons on the outside, and most importantly, their smile. They will escort you to your seats and will serve your meals. They serve Parfaits, Karage, Salads, and Omurice with a special message from them, written in ketchup. Customers will feel very special while you’re inside the café.  When you exit the café, they will greet you again to see them next time. That’s the daily life of maid cafes and their masters. That’s why I pictured this show. A slice of life comedy anime full of cute maids and their daily lives. That’s where I’ve been mistaken.

WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK?

After witnessing the unexpected airing of Pairipi Koumei from Spring 2022 and its Chinese dance, PA Works is back with another of their anime originals. It’s been a long time since they made an anime original like Aquatope of the White Sand. This time, they released something different. Something less likely we’ve never seen before. I found myself getting trolled by this show because it isn’t what I’m expecting. I didn’t read the synopsis and see the trailer in the first place.

At the very beginning of the show, it seemed different. You may think that the story is not supposed to be like that. The show introduced the main character, that is yearning to experience the life of being a maid and decided to work in a maid café in Akiba. Nagomi decided to work in a café called, “Oinky Doinky Café”, where they wear a pinkish uniform, and some of them wear a headband of pig’s ears. She later experienced her first day of the job until that night. Ranko began to shoot other maids with a dual-wielding pistol in front of her and witnessed the corpses covered in their blood. I didn’t expect that to happen and made me curious about what the heck is going on. I had assumed this will be another CGDCT anime by PA Works but apparently, it’s a show where maids are considered yakuzas, and killing amongst them is a normal occurrence. I thought it was supposed to be a slice-of-life maid show but I made a mistake. The next thing that happened is I found myself enjoying this show.

The story is kind of a troll by making an idea about maids and maid cafes and turning them into some sort of bloodbath war. I’m not sure where to start, but I think all maid cafes are like running a ruthless business. Tons of slapping energy, action, and thriller slapped together into a show not just for comedy, but one-of-a-kind entertainment. I didn’t find myself bored every time I watch the ongoing episodes. What I like about the story are its uniqueness and creativity. The concept is interesting but shown in a subaverage way. Each episode has its own story when they found themselves fighting with other maid cafes for the sake of their café and lives. But when they all come in together, you’ll know that something will supposed to happen. Imagine a world where yakuza don't hang out in small offices, entertaining only people that owe them money, but instead, they run maid cafes... as cute maids. Sound ridiculous? That's because it is. That's also the plot of this show. In this world, maid cafes are part of syndicates, maids use knives, swords, and guns to kill their competition, and they do long stretch in prison. Yet somehow, they still attract and entertain otaku in their cafes. The comedy itself is very entertaining. I found myself laughing so much because of the execution of the punchline, where every maid got killed all of a sudden. The segments in this show are very witty like the boxing match, baseball match, poker match, rooftop scene, and many more. Although the story didn’t have complexity, it was engaging and most of all, full of violence.

What I like about the characters are they full of energy. Some of them were annoying but you couldn’t help but laugh. Their interactions are entertaining even sometimes also absurd. The characters are also fleshed out, and most of them are interesting. Panda can be somewhat the funniest character in the series, alongside Manager. I thought that she was just a mascot while she was a maid too. The manager is way too crazy for the situation. She is sometimes annoying because she always sells her staff to war to earn profits. Even though, she’s also an entertaining one. I like the character development of Nagomi because even though she was forced to join the war, she didn’t quit. She wanted to prove to other cafes that Oinky Doinky members are not pigs. Ranko is probably the best character in the series because she is full of violence. I thought that she was just the cold-hearted one, but she’s the one who loves Oinky Doinky the most. She values her co-workers, especially Nagomi’s determination to solve the conflicts without acts of violence.

The sounds are also good. It is well-suitable for most of the parts. Some parts sometimes look like a punchline because of the music, but they know how to put the music into some serious parts. The OP slaps hard and it sounded 90s electronic vibe. The lyrics are just the dialogue of a common maid to the customers, but the way they distorted and make it suspenseful is amazing. The dance at the end was good too and I didn’t expect that because of its nature. I didn’t listen to the ED that much but it sounded like the songs from Yakuza.

The animation and art style are also good as expected from PA Works. Although the quality isn’t that perfect, it’s pretty suited for the show. The style can be very weird but also mesh super well. The art direction is also presented and they took their sweet time to animate every scene even the violent ones. It seems that they ran out of budget when they produced Paripi Koumei. It’s not a high-caliber, but a good one.

Akiba Meido Sensou is certainly a strange show but certainly has left an impression on its viewers. I recommend it to those who want to be entertained and experience some strange violence. It’s not a masterpiece but it’s very creative. Chaotic, strange situations, insane, and stupidity in a good way, blended all in one show. Akiba Meido Sensou is definitely worth to see!

170695,"There's no shortage of OP MC fantasy shows out there. Even ignoring the entire Isekai sub-genre, your still left with shows like MASHLE, Tower of God, Solo Leveling, the list goes on. Point is, there's a lot of them, and standing out can be hard. Some do it with fantastic animation, good comedy, or compelling writing. Most though? Most fail spectacularly, and are forgotten to history, never spoken of again. Sadly, that seems to be exactly where I Parry Everything, originally created by Nabeshiki, directed by Dai Fukuyama and animated at OLM, appears to have landed. But you know what? I think it deserves better. I think this show, despite it's average visuals and standard narrative, deserves your attention. So if you take one thing away from this review, make sure it's this: I had more fun with I Parry Everything than almost anything else this season. Here's why.

Be warned, this review contains minor unmarked spoilers for I Parry Everything. It also contains major spoilers in some sections however these will be heavily marked to avoid accidents.

First up, seeing as this is an anime, lets talk animation. I Parry Everything isn't the best looking show this season, or any season really. So much of it is the lead awkwardly swinging a massive sword, screaming parry, and whatever he's hitting flying off in another direction. Characters sit static on the screen, conversations are mostly people just standing in a circle talking with hardly any interesting shot composition, and there usually isn't a lot of effects work. There are some exceptions to this, every now and then when something especially ridiculous happens, I Parry Everything kicks things up a strong notch. And sure, these happen more and more frequently the deeper in you get. But even then these are roughly 30-second highlights in a 23 minute episodes. Despite this however, I still found I Parry Everything fun to watch, and for one simple reason: Sincerity.

What's that quote about if you do something with enough sincerity, commit to something hard enough, then others will see and recognize it? That's sort of the vibe I get from I Parry Everything. Despite the generally middling animation, it felt like those working on it were actually having some fun, or at least didn't hate themselves while doing so. And that bled through the screen into my viewing experience. Yes, the guy is running across the screen screaming ""PARRY"" and a bunch of CGI swords are flying into the air. But then the shields go to. And the artillery. And entire freaking trains. At no point does I Parry Everything try to make itself seem serious, or dour. It commits to being stupid the entire way through, and that stupidity wraps back around to being a good time.

All in all, while I Parry Everything won't wow anyone, it's certainly fun and dials things up when it really needs to. While it would be nice for every little conflict to have some bonkers animation like Elusive Samurai, or for the conversations to be shot dynamically and with a clear purpose like Shoushimin, the simple truth is that like most anime, I Parry Everything doesn't need that to succeed. You don't need to be a generational work of animation to be fun to watch, to be worth sitting down for 23 minutes and having a good time. So long as the production doesn't get in the way of that, your probably fine. And I Parry Everything is well, well above that floor. So yeah, there's enough action for the people looking for that, but don't expect anything insane.

Speaking of fun, let's talk about something surprising about I Parry Everything, the narrative. I said it at the start, this is an OP MC fantasy show. The classic ""Powers everyone think are weak are actually really strong"". Hell it's even in the name, all the guy can really do is parry... well, anything. By all metrics it shouldn't be good, the premise reads like your average light novel slop. But where so many of those immediately jump to grand epics about slaying the Demon Lord, or becoming recognized by those around you, I Parry Everything is just about a dude who has no idea how strong he is getting roped into events grander than he knows. One minute he's lugging rocks, the next he's fighting a minotaur to save a princess. Except he doesn't know it's a minotaur, nor that she's a princess, and just wants to go home.

In a lot of ways, I Parry Everything is similar to One Punch Man. The lead has no real idea how strong they are, and they don't go seeking out these conflicts. Instead they get dragged into them by their friends and comrades, deal with the problem simply by existing, and then go home like nothing ever happened. Naturally a lot of the fun in these kinds of shows is in the reactions of the rest of the cast. While our lead may not understand what they accomplish, everyone else in this world does and are in awe of it. You can't see a man parry a train and not say ""Holy crap"". But where One Punch Man is a tad more comedy focused, caring more about the absurdity of it all, I Parry Everything is more concerned with having an dramatic story, for better and worse.

In some ways this is nice, I Parry Everything's escalation feels natural. Monster to bigger monster to experienced warrior, etc etc. Every single conflict feels connected, every ""monster of the week"" builds on this larger conflict, giving a sense of progression that I very much appreciated watching week to week. However while this is nice and ties each episode into the next, it's not a very complex story. The conflict is very straight forward, there's no intrigue, no real twists, and you know the outcome of every fight before they even begin due to the nature of our MC. There's nothing wrong with that really, straightforward stories can be a lot of fun when done right. But to accomplish that, you need something else to really draw the viewer in and engage them in the work. I Parry Everything does this with it's main character, Noor.

img()


To say Noor carries the show would be an understatement. He is the show. His good natured attitude and sincerity towards those around him, the way he approaches every situation directly, his earnest ignorance of everything happening around him, is the glue that holds I Parry Everything together. Watching an MC with an OP ability solo a dangerous Goblin Lord is one thing. Having him think that's the weakest form of Goblin, something that every beginning adventurer is supposed to be able to defeat, and never being corrected on it and refusing any sort of praise is another. He's just so... likeable, and makes every scene he's in good natured and fun. There's no needless drama, no love triangle crap, no angst. Just a good man helping people out who isn't afraid to do anything from cleaning latrines to fighting dragons.

That said, there is one thing I need to be clear on and lightly spoils the ending so I'll keep it locked up. For those that don't care, read on. Otherwise, just know that some may see Noor's ending as a bit of an anti-climax, though personally I think it fit the show perfectly.

!So like I said, I Parry Everything's ending could, to some, feel like a let down. The reason is because Noor never actually gets that recognition that is so common in other OP MC fantasy shows. He never becomes that ""Big Damn Hero"", and so you may feel the series was a waste of time, that you didn't get that payoff. Personally however, this is a plus. The payoff isn't in the world knowing how great he is and being recognized as a hero throughout the land by everyone around him. It's in that feeling of satisfaction of a job well done, in knowing you helped those around you, and that those who are close to you care. There is a bit of recognition for Noor at the end, but it's only amongst the main cast, so it still feels rather constrained.!

As for the rest of the cast, they really don't do much. There's Lynee, the princess, who is sort of our audience surrogate explaining the life of an adventurer to Noor and putting his feats into context for us. Then there's the various Sovereigns, masters of the various ""classes"" of this fantasy setting who largely serve to be ""wow'ed"" by Noors accomplishments, and occasionally give us backstory since they each tried to train him a little early on. There's also Rolo, the ""demon child"" we meet about halfway through for Noor to show how caring he can be. And... That's about it. Ostensibly there's a villain, but he's nothing more than your bog standard evil emperor, existing solely to start conflict and get defeated. There are no real arcs, none of them are much more than card board cutouts filling out the cast to make the world feel populated.

In that sense, I Parry Everything's cast is kind of weak. It lives and dies on a single character. But that single character, Noor, is a lot of fun, and his enthusiasm and earnestness breathes life into the otherwise static characters around him. I'll be frank, in a months time I'm not going to remember anyone other than Noor. But him I'm going to remember fondly until at least the end of the year, probably longer if I'm being honest. It's not often an OP MC sticks with me so strongly. That's something worthy of praise.

Next we come to the OST. Composed by [Tatsuhiko Saiki](https://anilist.co/staff/148507/Tatsuhiko-Saiki), this is sadly not yet publicly available, at least not as I could find it. That means I'm not going to be able to link any specific songs to support what I'm talking about. Add to that how I'm not the best person to ask about music, and you'll have to take what I say with a grain of salt. That said, I liked I Parry Everything's sound. It's very ""generic adventure"", but there's a liveliness to it that puts a spring in your step. Fast paced flutes and strings that reminded me of the old Fairy Tail [bagpipe theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIwmrk7LoDk). Not quite as unique, but the energy is still there, which is good considering just how often it's used and how repetitive I Parry Everything's OST is.

And that's really my biggest criticism of this OST, the repetitiveness. There were no tracks that sounded bad per se, nothing that took me out of the moment or ruined a scene. But by the time the anime finished, I could swear I'd heard every song 3, maybe 4 times. Again, not a big deal so long as the tracks work and are enjoyable. The Fairy Tail song I linked above plays in almost every episode of its show, but it's still a banger to listen to. It just means that you probably won't be buying this OST or streaming it anywhere, and that those looking for variety, or something unique like a [Mabanua](https://anilist.co/staff/123867/Mabanua) OST, won't find it here. I imagine audiophiles will find this show lacking. But if I'm being honest? Audiophiles probably wouldn't like the show to begin with, considering they'll be hearing ""PARRY"" every episode.

With that we come to the final, personal section of this review. This is where I try to give you look into my experience with a show, all the pretense of a review left behind. That means no-holds-barred spoiler territory, so only continue if you've seen the show or don't care about being spoiled for a show like this. If you choose not to read in, just know it's a lot more praise for Noor and the less tangible aspects of the show. So without further ado, in we go!

!Now I've said it multiple times before, but I need to say it again so you know what this section is about: I Parry Everything is perhaps the most sincere, earnest show I've watched this year. It's hard to feel bad while watching it. Every episode leaves that same warm fuzzy feeling I get from some of the best Slice of Life, but packaged in an OP MC Fantasy show skin. I get both the over the top action scenes as a guy runs around at the speed of sound parrying entire trains or cataclysmic laser beams into the air, and the feel-good moments like basically adopting an abused kid or giving them all the credit because of course it was them talking the dragon down that saved the day, not beating it into submission. It's a different kind of happy feeling than the hype of Deku beating up Shigaraki.

In that sense, I think I Parry Everything is actually very bingeable. Episodes go by fast, and with no complex plot there's no chance you get lost with what's happening. It's a continuous stream of good enough to actually decent action that culminates in an oddly satisfying flashback of all things. We get to see that, for all his ineptitude in the more advanced skills, the experts were still able to recognize what made Noor special. The same thing we came to recognize as the show went on. It's a nice little... ""Don't judge yourself by the standards of others"" sort of thing, and an interesting way to do a flashback ending I hadn't expected. Instead of trying to recontextualize the everything that happened, it just reinforced it. And I think that's part of what makes I Parry Everything work. It makes it clear what it's about, and doesn't diverge from it.!

img()


So yeah, all in all I Parry Everything surprised me. I went into this expecting another bottom-of-the-barrel OP MC fantasy show with about as much personality as a bland fish. But what I got was one of the most earnest, sincere fantasy shows of the year about a simple guy who doesn't know his own strength helping those around him. He's a classic gentle giant, only fighting when necessary and supporting anyone he can. No complicated plots, no world-saving quests or globe trotting adventures. Just a straightforward, good natured, simple fantasy show with some fun action and wholesome interactions. In a world filled with edgy light novel protagonists, ecchi loli-bait, and the same ""Awkward girl joins a band"" show we see every season, I Parry Everything is a breath of fresh air, if a simple one, and one I enjoyed a lot.

145,"Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou/Kare Kano/His & Her Circumstances is a romantic comedy slice of life anime originally written as a manga by Masami Tsuda. Which was then adapted by studio Gainax & directed by Hideaki Anno of Evangelion fame. Kare Kano is a rather divisive anime on MAL (and in general), it has vocally passionate fans, and strong haters who think it’s trash. I think you can guess which side I’m on looking at the score, but I might as well explain why I’m on the side that I am. This review may contain mild spoilers, read at your own risk.

Story & Characters (writing):

The story of Kare Kano revolves around Yukino Miyazawa & Armia Souichiro, two genius kids who put on a false persona to trick people into thinking they’re much better as people than they actually are. As Yukino & Arima get to know each other & start becoming more friendly, they start to open up & become more of themselves.

Much like the last anime I took a look at “Kimagure Orange Road”, Kare Kano’s story isn’t very complicated. But the way Kare Kano goes about writing its characters & scenarios is what turns the story into more than just 2 characters falling in love. As the story progresses, we get to see Yukino & Arima not only open themselves up more to people, but get more comfortable with just being themselves and becoming more laid back people in general. Much like Evangelion, Kare Kano dives into exploring human psychology & how these characters act & what makes them act the way they do. Personally though, I think Kare Kano does a much better job at explaining, showcasing, & working in the reasons & events as to why the characters act the way they do naturally than Evangelion does.

Kare Kano’s comedy isn’t my kind of comedy admittedly, there’s some good jokes & moments sprinkled in there, & I feel as though Kare Kano’s comedy isn’t too intrusive to the story & character development at hand, as Kare Kano knows to keep its comedy out of the darker scenes, but I don’t find myself laughing at too many of Kare Kano’s jokes. Still, it doesn’t ever become intrusive enough to piss me off or annoy me.

One aspect of Kare Kano that I absolutely will not excuse are the recaps. This was just a lazy money saving technique on the part of all involved at Gainax. There’s no reason I need a recap of what happened last episode everytime. One may argue “You can just skip them” but if it comes to that point, then it’s rubbish, plain and simple.

Onto the characters. Kare Kano has too many characters for me to list off, so I won’t go over every last one of them, as that would start delving into major spoiler territory, and I’d like to keep the spoilers to a minimum. In fact, I’m going to do something a little different from my KOR & Maison Ikkoku review, I’m going to lump our 2 leads & the side characters into a category & explain how the show writes them.

An overlying theme about Kare Kano is opening up & becoming yourself. Everyone goes through a mini-arc like that. While this brings up a point on how the side characters are used, & can be argued that this intrudes on the main characters journey, I’d argue it does, but also doesn’t. See, the series isn’t good at working its side characters into the story to help move it along naturally, & the side characters are given just enough screen time in order for this to happen. On the flip side though, this also creates layered individuals with their own character traits & stories to tell. It also helps Kare Kano’s world feel more alive & lived in at the same time. The side characters are a double edged sword, they bring goods, & bads to the series. I’d argue more good than bad though, at least they go beyond nothing more than repeated, tired jokes & caricatures like the side characters in something like Orange Road or Ranma ½ do.

Art & Sound (presentation):

The art is a bit of a mixed bag, unfortunately falling more on the lesser side. The backgrounds of Kare Kano look great, but the character art & animation leave a lot to be desired. What also doesn’t help the art is just how terrible Gainax was at managing its money, so the production of this show was an absolute mess, & at times shots & even full episodes (specifically the last 2) are nothing more than “Moving Manga Sequences” with barely any movement to it. The animation can look pretty good at times, but a lot of the time it’s pretty flat, if there’s one thing Evangelion definitely has over Kare Kano, it’s its animation. Kare Kano’s shots are often quite static with not much movement going on in them, although I think these shots do work a lot of the time, that’s only because this series has the strong writing that it would need to back that kind of shot up.

On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Shirou Sagisu returns from Evangelion to compose yet another piece for Hideaki Anno & his team over at Gainax. It’s very comparable to his score on Evangelion, particularly with how both Eva, & Kare Kano use a lot of classical music. There’s a great variety in pieces & they’re all used to great effect to fit the type of mood that a scene is going for. It’s a very dynamic soundtrack, and for that it gets massive props from me.

The voice acting is…… interesting to say the least. I think it’s neither outright bad, nor outright good, just, interesting. Kare Kano makes use of child actors to give a more natural feel to the dialogue, which works, but there have been better examples of this practice being used to great effect. One performance I really have to bring mention to is “Mayumi Shintari” as Tsubasa. I like her voice, but it doesn’t really fit. Overall, I'd give the voice acting a 5. There's goods & bads to it. It fits the series ok enough, but there isn't an absolutely outstanding performance attached here.

Final Thoughts/Overall

So that’s Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou. Is it a perfect series? No, not even remotely. It has pretty distinct flaws to it, especially in the production of this show. Without spoiling too much, Tsuda didn’t like how Hideaki Anno & his team over at Gainax adapted Kare Kano, so she and Anno were constantly having disagreements. At some point, Anno just became fed up & not only left Kare Kano, but left TV animation entirely. This in turn lead to the show taking a lot, and I mean A LOT of corner cutting techniques, one of the episodes was literally made with paper & popsicle sticks (though I quite like that episode). At the very least these episodes were able to keep the strong writing seen in the first 18 episodes, but even that can’t begin to excuse how terrible the production values in episodes 19-26 are. Not only that though, the art is pretty mediocre, the side characters can intrude, & the recaps are pure laziness. But with all that said, Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou is still my 2nd favorite anime of all time. It may not be better than Evangelion on a technical level, but I love it way more than Evangelion & consider Kare Kano to be when Hideaki Anno peaked. I love the characters of this anime, I love the story, I love the overarching theme, I love the cinematography, I love pretty much everything about Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou. In spite of Kare Kano’s massive flaws, I will always love it. So with that said, my final rating is going to be an enthusiastic 10/10. I know not everybody is going to feel the same way about this anime that I do, and that’s absolutely ok. But if you’re looking for a rom-com/slice-of-life, or are a massive fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion, then I highly implore you all to check out this work."

Onimai is a joy to watch, I don't often find myself smiling just from seeing great animation, this is one of the best production works I've seen in recent memory. It's a labour of love that is maligned by awful discourse surrounding its more ""problematic"" elements. I'm gonna be honest, I don't care about how potentially ""problematic"" this anime might be to some people. There seems to be this mob mentality that is compelled to brute force every element of an anime's identity in to a neat little box so that they can arbitrarily assign or dock points based on how problematic it'd be if this work was a 1:1 reflection of our reality. News flash, this isn't a work based in reality. That doesn't mean there aren't lessons to learn from Onimai. While Mahiro was originally a male neet, he is only around 16-17 years old when the story begins. This premise isn't some evil scheme to have the main character groom children under the guise of being a little girl. It's about a kid being given a second chance and reclaiming some structure in his life with the help of his sister. Even IF it were a story based around a full adult, the motivation behind this narrative wouldn't change. He isn't harbouring illicit thoughts about children or playing some long con to satisfy his male ego. This is a story of rehabilitation as his sister states.

While I wouldn't describe Onimai as an explicitly ""trans"" story, there's many examples throughout that people can identify with and attribute to some awakening to your true self. In episode 1, after being transformed, his sister makes him take a bath and wear a dress. There's a moment of pause at the realisation he likes how he looks in the mirror. Him being able to see himself as cute acts as a sort of reward and motivation to take better care of himself. It's easy to sink deeper in to self loathing and take less care of yourself when you're already feeling down, this scene is the first step towards reminding himself not only of how easy it is to simply do those basic self care things but also how much more comfortable you feel in your own skin afterwards. You see how much he enjoys this version of himself when he sheepishly tries to lean in to the role of the cute girl archetype, which he sees through his hobbies on a daily basis. He has to make excuses to his sister because he's embarrassed over how naturally these feminine behaviours come to him. 

img720()

We all know that moe is an integral part of the anime experience, people joke constantly about how much they identify as cute girls and will use pictures of them as banners, profile pictures, etc, to signal who their favourite character is, and what their favourite series are. This goes deeper for many people, who use these personalities as extensions of themselves, an avenue to feel closer to the character and allowing them to express themselves more honestly. Finding cute things cute is probably the biggest example of this phenomenon and is something men struggle with as it doesn't conform to the ""masculine ideal"". This otaku centric perspective is at the heart of what Onimai is about. It is a story about opening up and accepting that we're all different and can't fit in to any neat little box society wants to put us in. You shouldn't feel ashamed for your hobbies or tastes no matter how ""weird"" they appear. This is ultimately what contributes to Mahiro losing touch with society and and retreating in to his room. He feels like an outcast because he didn't have an envrionment that nurtured his personality.

img720()

This anime loves to flip common dynamics on its head. Post transformation, Mihari is the one acting in place of Miharo as the ""big brother"", taking Miharo outside and exercising. Miharo express an inferiority complex over how talented his sister is at everything but despite this difference in self ascribed worth, he admires her and feels like he can star in the role of ""little sister"". It's this genuine sibling bond that drives the entire show, without Mihari, Miharo would be trapped in his solitude and as we later find out, Mihari is only as successful as she is because she desired to be praised by her older brother and wears the same hair clip he gifted her all these years later. There's a simple but effective scene where Miharo comes to a halt underneath the bridge's shadow and Mihari leaves the light to join him resulting in a double entendre ""it hurts"", referring to both the sentimentality of the scene and the pain in his nipples. It acts as both a reflection of Miharo's mental state and a funny bit of comedy. This anime is really effective at sneaking in great character writing with its comedy, there's a recurring gag where Miharo interrogates Mihari over why she doesn't dress up more and entertain her femininity, which is rich coming from the guy who is just discovering what the female experience entails. It even has Mahiro ask his sister what it even means to be ""masculine"", (shouldn't he know?). The writing gets really empathetic with this in episode 2 when Mahiro experiences his first period and now has context for what women have to deal with on a monthly basis, among taking care of long hair and other things. This anime is constantly pushing in that direction of mutual understanding and acceptance even in scenes that many people will quickly dismiss over being ""gross"" or ""ecchi"" in nature.

img720()

When Miharo first meets Momiji, he mistakes her for a boy and hides behind her because of the perceived security they provide. The fact that Momiji isn't a boy reinforces the series' theme about non conforming identity. She contrasts the male > female perspective that Mahiro represents. Momiji feels more comfortable wearing pants than she does wearing skirts or frilly clothing and is self conscious over this preference. It surprises her when Mahiro refers to her as cute and she has a complex over her flat chest. Mahiro routinely is called ""cute"" and seen as more feminine from Momiji's own perspective, this explains why she's possessive and gets easily jealous when her friends interact with them, she sorta lives through Miharo vicariously as they're her more feminine ideal which compensates for her more boyish personality. This dynamic is why they're often paired together from here on out.

img720()

This anime makes a point of celebrating halloween, new years, valentine's day and his birthday, all occassions he comes to love because of his fresh perspective and opportunities. Episode 6 has one of my favourite scenes where Mahiro says goodbye to his new friends and is self conscious about invading their group dynamic. There's a very intentional pace to the scene when they're walking in another direction from him and they focus in on the methodical steps as if the wheels are turning, that they're reflecting on going out with friends and considering the possibilities that stem from these experiences. He's begun to look forward to and desire doing more social things. It's a pivotal moment in his development where his anxiety over intruding on their friend group is met with assurance that he belongs. I really appreciate the quiet moments this anime plants at opportune moments. Such as when When Mahiro returns home from school and regales how his day went before breaking out in to a content smile, when he feels indebted to all she does for him and looks after her when she's sick.They're paced well and emphasise the emotional core experience. 

img720()

Ultimately Onimai is a very comforting anime about cute girls doing cute things that has elements a younger generation can relate to. The fear and insecurity of sharing your hobbies and going outside, that it's ok to be who you are without worrying about appearances, and reintegrating with society. I feel that a lot of people dismiss this series out of spite, they don't want to try to even understand where it's coming from and try to meet it. It's very easy to take a couple scenes out of context and characterise the show as some perverse waste of time. You can twist and frame any work to fit your agenda. You won't hear critics bring up the sentimentality of a scene like when Mahiro shares a bath with his sister and the focus is on them reminiscing about their childhood, there's no lusting or ulterior motives. Onimai's conceit has explicitly always been about rehabilitation, the fact there's a couple ecchi scenes does not disprove this. The motive has never been to ogle at underage girls, it's all surface level observations about aesthetics and sensibilities. There is nothing sinister about this series, it's sincere and doesn't shy away from presenting itself firmly in the medium's more ""controversial"" elements. It's one thing if you don't enjoy this style, it's another to willfully misrepresent what a work is trying to achieve and regurgitate the same old talking points your favourite anituber said because it's the ""cool"" thing to do. 

Anime is (not) trash, YOU are."
150695,"With every anime season there’s a minimum of five terrible new fantasy anime to come along with it. Genre fatigue has been slowly setting in for years, and nearly every one of these glorified internet fanfics have been derided as “power fantasies” or “self-insert series” by people who actually care about the quality of the media they consume. Extremely bland peerless main characters plowing their way through any obstacle and hundreds of indistinguishable girls in increasingly trite fantasy realms seems to be the basic establishing formula for these series, most of which were written on novel websites made for the sole purpose of getting sheltered Japanese teenagers a chance to become a regular Nisio Isin (if he had zero literary credibility). Name any seasonal anime that sounds even marginally like what I described and it’ll probably have spawned from one of these places. They don’t even have to be isekai anymore, that’s the really tragic part. The cancer has been metastasizing into other genres. It’s basically an endless content farm for fledgling hacks who think originality is unoriginal, the ones who keep using the same exhausting story beats over and over because they genuinely can’t conceive of anything better. Beast Tamer happens to be one of the worst to rise from these kinds of places in recent memory; a series that falls onto the production line already pre-assembled, ready for mass consumption and unlikely to induce any kind wonder, awe, or intellectual stimulation of any kind. 

Seriously every episode gets progressively less and less separable from every other foray into the genre that by the time I reached episode 13 I couldn’t even remember the name of the show. Was I still watching Yūsha Pātī o Tsuihou Sareta Bīsuto Teimā, Saikyōshu no Nekomimi Shōjo to Deau or was I watching Shin no Nakama ja Nai to Yuusha no Party wo Oidasareta node, Henkyou de Slow Life suru Koto ni Shimashita? Or was Ningen Fushin no Boukensha-tachi ga Sekai wo Sukuu you desu? (Fucking Christ stop letting these people write their own titles. They’re longer than some chapters in their own novels.) Summarizing the plot of this show would take too much effort, when it deserves so little; basically this boring asshole named Rein gets booted from a party of annoying one-dimensional asshole adventurers who do nothing but bitch and moan about literally everything (everyone in-universe hates them too because this show lacks subtlety), since his incredibly useful and niche Beast Taming power isn’t strong enough to reach their specific standards (even though they recruited him in the first place, I’m not sure why it suddenly became a problem after what seemed to be years of companionship because the show doesn’t explain anything about any of the characters’ reasonings) and he goes from place to place using his talent to pick up chicks to add to his harem-party. They all happen to be unfathomably overpowered too, so they all team up to fight monster designs traced from a middle schooler’s How to Draw Manga book. Then they meet the boring asshole heroes again and predictably beat the fucking shit out of all of them in the least cathartic fight ever “animated”, I’m talking 5 FPS here, and after being defeated they offer Rein his position back like a bunch of NPCs and he predictably says no, because who would give up crushing monster girl pussy every day for a bunch of the writer’s high school bullies personified? They fight a demon at the end of something too. They have another Microsoft PowerPoint battle, Rein uses some dumb new power to save the day, they meet a new ghost girl, everyone still hates the asshole heroes, and nothing else happens to meaningfully change the status quo. If you think I’m oversimplifying it, you’d be wrong, because I’m actually making it sound even more complex than it actually is.

I can’t imagine why anyone would watch this kind of creatively bankrupt slop; I’m not even trying to sound pretentious here. I like Fairy Tail for God’s sake. I’m just dumbfounded. Getting through a single episode of this shit nearly put me to sleep, because within the first 2 minutes I had already predicted nothing engaging would happen for the rest of the episode. If an uncultured Philistine like me struggled to watch half an episode of this series without convincing that my life was critically lacking in some form of intimacy, I hate to imagine what would happen to the most prodigal media analyst if they tried engaging with this. They’d probably lose the will to live upon seeing how far anime has degraded as an artform. I might sound a little defeatist here but it’s hard not to when the medium you’ve loved for years has become almost unrecognizable, just a corporate-controlled springboard for mediocre writers to keep regurgitating the same content for years instead of trying to hone their talents. 90% of anime looks like this now, and even then not many other forms of media are faring well either. Art used to be about constantly challenging yourself to create something only you could make; but now it seems like anyone could make half the stuff you see on tv or in theaters. It’s not hard to imagine why so many people are even more depressed and unfulfilled than ever; all their routes of escapism are slowly becoming homogenized and boring, and art only exists to tick off boxes on a checklist to appeal to the stupidest kinds of people. I fucking hate Beast Tamer, I hate that it’s getting a second season, I hate “web novels”, I hate isekai, I hate what the anime industry has become. It’s just the same goddamn thing every month. If any aspiring writer picked up a pen one day and made something genuinely special, something that doesn’t fit into any preconceived molds and fills others with inspiration, one that an AI couldn’t replicate with minimal effort, it’ll render corporate-approved swill like Beast Tamer completely worthless. Please everyone, go out and write a story no one else can. Don’t let this be the future."
107490,"Oh hello there, are you perhaps looking for the perfect anime?

Then I have news for you, Machikado Mazoku is most definitely... not that. But it is very close!

Let's back off a little and go through this step by step. Machikado Mazoku (eng.: The Demon Girl Next Door) is a slice of life comedy created by Izumo Itou, serialized in the magazine Manga Time Kirara Carat . I am sure for a lot of people that name will already evoke certain ideas about the direction this work will take, but let's not get hasty. The anime adaptation was produced by J.C.Staff, famous for half the things you have probably watched if you are really into anime and also infamous for the other half of things you were warned about. While I, just as the average watcher, have my reservations towards this studio, I can say with full confidence that MachiMazo is not one of their more questionable adaptations.

Why would I lay my hand into the fire for this inocuous little comedy show? That is entirely because I am smitten with it to a dangerous degree! I will explain why in the following sections.

Story:
Yoshida Yuuko is just your average high-school girl living a normal life - and that is where you would already have lost me in the average generic summary. In truth nothing about Yuuko's life was normal even before the start of the story, but what follows is even more surreal. She wakes up one morning (after an odd dream involving a mysterious young girl) changed in peculiar ways. She has grown horns and a tail. Quickly it becomes clear that the blissfully unaware girl had been part of a family belonging to the Dark Clan, which had been defeated countless times by the Light Clan in the past. She is in fact a demon and has a great destiny to fulfill: Defeat a Magical Girl (the warriors of the Light Clan) and take her blood to undo a Seal that was put on her family for generations. The extent of that curse is interesting in itself, but for now all you need to know is that it keeps them slightly unfortunate and forces them to live with a monthly income of 400$(40000 Yen).

Yuuko is ready to fight for her family's finances, fortune and better future and sets out to find and defeat Magical Girls. However Yuuko is incredibly incompetent in both battle and at being evil. As fate would have it her first encounter with a Magical Girl also immediately complicates her plans, because the peach-colored girl called Chiyoda Momo saves her life from an early death via Truck-sama, the deliverer of Isekai protagoniss. 

The story centers around the conflict and blooming friendship between these two lovable characters and their daily antics in pursuit of their goals.

Characters:
Which naturally brings us to the greatest strength of this story: The cast.
This is not unusual for a CGDCT show of course, but MachiMazo's cast is certainly one of the stronger in recent memory.

First comes our protagonist, Yuuko, also affectionately called ""Shamiko"" by the rest of the cast (based on her demon title ""Shadow Mistress Yuuko""). Her personality and attitude are entirely unfit for a demon and that is perhaps the greatest thing about her. She has a big heart, is incredibly adorable and generally tries her hardest - to a reasonable extent. Born weak and generally not too smart, she constantly fails at her job to cause evil and defeat the much too strong Momo, but her fighting spirit and will to better herself can make anyone cheer for her. Thanks to her nice nature she is unable to commit any deeds that would make her a target of retaliation by her enemy and even seems to have greater morals than the Magical Girl herself at times.
Shamiko is easy to read and sway, but she also has her strengths. She is good at housework and compassionate and wants to be a great example to her little sister Ryo who adores her. She often overcompensates for her weakness with boasting and evil dialogue straight from a villainess out of a kids TV show, which only makes her reactions all the cuter. Her catchphrase is the rather tsundere sounding ""Don't think this means you've won!"" every time she messes up or loses.

But what would a protagonist be without an antagonist? Probably much the same in this case, as the Magical Girl (retired by her own words), Chiyoda Momo is far from a true enemy to Shamiko. Right away she realizes the absolute inferiority of her opponent and uses her wit to trick Shamiko into all kinds of ways to avoid battle. There is no denying that Momo seems to have a great interest in the klutzy demoness right from the very first episode and it only gets more obvious from there. Momo is what most would call a kuudere, calm and collected and with a rather quiet voice most of the time. But through interactions it soon becomes clear that she has her cute side and is very kind in her own way, although she does have a mischievous streak for teasing Shamiko and others (especially the Dark Clan's sealed Ancestor). There are many oddities about her and the mysterious past she hides gives off the same vibes as many more modern takes on Magical Girls, whose lives are not all peachy and sparkles (e.g. Lyrical Nanoha  or Madoka Magica).

They each bring out sides of each other that they would usually not openly show and as they get closer it seems that their rivalry is more akin to friendship (and perhaps even more? Hehe). 

The supporting cast also gives the show many additional flavors and keeps the world fleshed out and varied. Shamiko's family is a treat, with the somewhat ditzy, but ever positive mother and the extremely intelligent and adoring little sister. There are also Shamiko's classmates who are incredibly okay with pretty much any of the weird stuff that transpires in the city and keep teasing/cheering on Shamiko at every turn. 
One of the most prevalent side-characters however is the Dark Clan's sealed Ancestor, Lilith. She is an ancient demon from the Mesopotamian era who had been sealed in a demonic statue by the Light Clan and constantly prods Shamiko to fulfill her destiny. However, it soon turns out that she is not much more competent than Shamiko herself and becomes the butt of the joke a lot of the time. Even when you feel bad for her, she does bring the punishment on herself most of the time, so we can all laugh at her with a clean conscience! It is rather incredible how her basic statue design can show off so many emotions.

The town has far more odd characters that get introduced across the episodes and later on in the manga, but that is enough for this section already.

Animation: 
I know I have spent a lot of time on the characters section, but they are the heart of this show. The other aspects are not too important in comparison in my opinion. Now as I mentioned before J.C.Staff is somewhat diverse in their quality and I would be lying through my teeth if I said MachiMazo has great animation. But that is not to say it is bad either. Motions are exaggerated, character expressions are hilarious and the artstyle is just as cute as Izumo Itou's drawings in the manga. The color schemes are vibrant and give the world an incredible warmth and emotional width. There is the occasional off face, especially for background characters, but each focused shot and quick exchange always looks nice. There is not a whole lot of action in this anime, so there is also no need for mindblowing motion animation. They really put the effort in the few visual spectacles the show has, like the transformation sequences (which happen in incredibly fast time, but still last several seconds to the audience haha).
Overall it was competently done for the genre and material.

Voice-acting:
Do I even have to say anything? Konomi Kohara (Chika from Kaguya-sama Love is War), Akari Kito (Nezuko from the recent Kimetsu no Yaiba) and Minami Takahashi (Lucoa from Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid) are all voice acting legends and they bring their absolute A-game to this anime. That is also absolutely necessary, as the show has a lot (and I mean A LOT!) of dialogue. The pace of conversations is nothing to sneeze at and yet they deliver it believably, concise and emotionally all at the same time. There is not a single miscast character here and while Momo may sound a bit too quiet at times, her occasional outbursts are all the more effective for it. It is hard to believe that Akari Kito also voices chipper characters like Aru Honshou from Hitoribocchi after hearing this performance. Her range is massive.
Aside from the voice acting the sound design is also nice. The sound effects play well with the comedy and the music never overpowers the dialogue. Opening & Ending are a delight to the ears and sung by the cast itself (as seems to be tradition for CGDCT anime).

Listen for yourself (no spoilers):
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXHjkKwH4M)

Pacing:
When talking about the incredibly fast dialogue, pace is unavoidable. The anime boasts sadly only 12 episodes, but do they ever make the best of that alotted time! Even veteran sub readers will perhaps be forced to pause sometimes to read a quickfire sentence or the background expression and noises. The plot does never stagnate or stay still, it is a story that will always develop and keep the characters evolving. This anime does not fall in the usual trap of CGDCT shows where the setting and events only exist to facilitate the comedy. Instead the plot is very much there and the driving force behind the characters actions, while the comedy is mostly reactionary to these events that would even be entertaining on their own. 

There are emotional moments and even sometimes allusions ot darker things in the background (as the setting outside of a comedy would certainly be rather bleak), but they never linger too much or leave a bad aftertaste. The fast pace allows both for a fluid plot as well as a density that would put most drama shows to shame. One episode could be said to be worth two sometimes and that may even feel daunting for some viewers. I personally believe that this is a great way to have more content, but your milage may vary.

Conclusion:
Without a doubt in my mind Machikado Mazoku is one of the best recent anime in the genre, for its colorful and easily likeable characters, actually relevant plot and overall ever entertaining interactions. The anime naturally ends mid-story, so do not expect a real conclusion, but there is always hope for a season 2 (and the manga is being translated rather quickly). What is here however is faithful to the manga and endlessly entertaining. It is one of those rare Kirara stories that is just good in all aspects and cannot be overlooked.

And if I haven't already implied it enough, there is plenty of Yuri subtext between the main pair, so for whoever is into that, this series is basically a must. They will only grow closer after all"
146323,"The would be “Greatest Spy” ever Klaus got the job to teach 7 8 spies from incompetent girls in order to be called the “Greatest spy of all time”, completely ignoring the fact that being known as the greatest spy of all time would completely go against what spies do due to this show not understanding what a spy would do in the slightest.

To say the synopsis is right with the line “Too bad the team is filled with even more hopeless spies” is far too right. It’s ridiculous. Somehow this team of 7 8 girls is hopelessly pathetic at taking down the teacher and somehow always creates the same plan. Somehow this group managed to take down the even bigger badder spy who was always just a step ahead of the teacher.

Incompetence is funny to watch to a point, but when the show is nearly only composed of their incompetence it becomes truly infuriating to watch. It becomes even less funny when the spy teacher who is the biggest and bestest spy to ever spy can somehow clean windows faster than a team of 8 employing their talents to make it even faster, as if cleaning windows is something that can be made faster without employing more people to do it. He claims it was a part of his “spy training” fuck I wish I had spy training that made me clean up my entire house within an hour.

Do you know how children’s “imagine” games always leads to someone pulling out the “super shield that blocks everything” and after that you get the “super weapon that kills everything” and then it’s a bizarrely escalating scenario with more and more ridiculous things brought out? This is what every conflict in this show feels like “I am going to kill the spy teacher with spy things” and then the teacher goes “yes but i am more spy” and then they lose.

The girls are all quite 1 dimensional and most unmemorable. Which is not good for a wannabe “Cute Girls Doing Cute Things” -show when you compare it to shows with similar tags like Bocchi The Rock where the whole cast is extremely entertaining in their own way.
The teacher isn’t much better either. He is just perfect in every way imaginable and never loses even in trivial things. 

The show had a bit of plot at the start with the 1 guy, the big spy man who spies all the people couldn’t beat as he had faked his death and allied up with another nation, but he was killed within 3 episodes. Why wasn’t this written into a bigger whole? Like why not end the show with the girls beating this ultimate spy terminator after he kills their teacher?

This show is pathetic SoL slob without any of the entertaining characters to make the show actually good. Very sloppy writing when it does have it and even that was rushed inorder to make room for this show’s horrible “Cute girls doing cute things” moments."
11703,"Hello!!! I am Mashiro4Ever and this is my first Anilist review, so bear with me please. Also, I'm sure there will be spoilers along the way. Just a forewarning.


Code: Breaker begins with Sakura Sakurakouji traveling home from school on a public bus. She looks out the window and sees a boy surrounded by blue flames, which she finds odd and concerning, so she asks the bus driver to let her off. By the time she gets to the spot of the possible crime, however, there's little to no evidence of anything!!! Sakura is dumbfounded, and wonders if she imagined the whole thing. The next day, however, at school, a new transfer student shows up- one looking just like the boy Sakura saw last night!!! The transfer student goes by the name of Rei Oogami and he calls himself a ""trashman"" by trade. Sakura eventually gets Rei to spill that by ""trashman"" he means ""Code: Breaker"", or ""one who does not exist"". He has the special ability to create blue fire when his gloved hand is ungloved, and he uses that to kill the villains he's sent out to take care of. Sakura believes killing is going too far. So Sakura sees it as her duty to stop Rei, as well as the other Code: Breakers she meets along the way, from using their special powers for death and ultimate destruction.

The above is clearly just a taste of the plot (I don't want to give too much away) but I can tell you this regarding the Code: Breaker plot: it just continues to get better and better as the anime goes on. At first, you think you're stuck in a lame rom-com. Then you think ""at least it's not a rom-com, but it seems kinda stupid and shallow for a superhero show."" By about the midway point, the true significance of this anime starts to kick in. If you didn't stick around to episode seven plus, you're gonna miss the real nectar that is the best this anime has to offer. I learned a lot of life lessons from this anime and the mistakes made by the characters involved. I know how NOT to treat people doing MY work. 
I give the plot 8/10

The art for Code:Breaker was very impressive, but I personally feel like they saved their worst efforts for the anime itself. I was absolutely blown away with the looks of the opening and the closing. They were gorgeous!!! But then I got to the anime and... I dunno. Nothing about it looked special. It just looked... ordinary. Not good, not bad. Just... ordinary. I gave the art of the anime specifically a 7/10, though I could've gone lower. 
I give the art overall 9/10

The music for Code:Breaker was the best music I have heard in a non-music genre anime in a LOOONG time. It fit the mood and theme of the anime perfectly and it got me pumped up and excited to start watching. Isn't that the two primary jobs of a good score??? Seriously it's like the music and anime BELONGED together. The composer did an A+ job with this score.
I give the music 10/10

I made the subtlest of teases at the end of my Plot section towards how this section would go. I honestly felt like the characters were the weakest part of Code:Breaker. Sort of like the anime art, I felt at times like they were lacking something. Other times I wish they were. One character that sometimes annoyed me was Sakura Sakurakouji. The fact that she was ALWAYS high and mighty and preaching ""now why don't we just get along and not hurt each other???"" just felt so fake it made me want to vomit. Don't get me wrong; there were good characters. My favorite was No. 3, otherwise known as Yuuki Tenpouin. Yuuki has the special ability to use sound and, like me, is quite fond of cats!!! A couple other characters quite honestly, imo, should have had more screentime. Rui Hachiouji (aka No. 5) and Miyuki Kanda both were nice characters I'd like to have learned more about. I guess I don't get to.
I give the characters 7/10

My final category is entertainment. Through all the faults it had (and it did have faults) I still thoroughly enjoyed watching Code:Breaker. It does end finishing with the bare minimum effort, but it's not enough to ruin the anime. The previous 12 episodes were steadily improving throughout the series until episode 12 reaches an impressive peak. I'm surprised this only has a 63% average rating here on Anilist. This is MUCH better than that!!!
I give entertainment 9/10

Have you ever done the right thing, only to get no recognition for it??? That's the world you enter when you watch Code: Breaker. Code: Breakers are, most simply put, tools used by the government to take care of the more difficult jobs that the police or others might not be able to handle. Because Code: Breakers have special abilities, they can fight and defeat these tougher villains. But in return, they get... nothing. A vast majority of the populace doesn't know they exist, they get discarded like trash, they receive no payment as far as I could tell... they do the dirty work, and get nary a ""good job."" They deserve, however, a ""great job"".

Overall Rating: 8.6"
13271,"Hunter X Hunter: Phantom Rouge, também conhecido como Hunter X Hunter e o Fantasma Vermelho aqui no Brasil, acontece logo depois do final do arco do Kurapika e da trupe fantasma, consiste basicamente no membro no qual o Hisoka derrotou para se tornar membro das Aranhas, o antigo número 4, criando fantoches nos quais ele controla da forma que quiser, porém eles não tem olhos, sendo uma referência ao ditado que diz que os olhos são a janela da alma e, quando se utiliza os olhos da pessoa que foi clonada para a criação do fantoche, o mesmo tem uma força aumentada. É importante ressaltar que, Omokage, o vilão da então história e criador dos fantoches, é um colecionador de olhos com um objetivo, que logo direi. 

RESUMINDO A HISTÓRIA DO FILME.
 O filme começa com Kurapika ouvindo uma música e reconhecendo-a, logo então se encontrou com seu antigo amigo do clã Kuruta, Pairo, os dois conversaram até que Pairo, que estava com os olhos fechados até então, os abriu e roubou os olhos do Kurapika, ou seja, além de estar mais forte por possuir olhos, ele era no final um fantoche de Omokage. Kurapika se sente muito mal e logo é levado para o Hospital por Leorio que estava ao seu lado, Gon e Killua estão sendo Gon e Killua, discutindo num trem onde a comissária (?) responsável pelo vagão deles reclamava constantemente do barulho excessivo que eles estavam fazendo, ""há outros passageiros dormindo"" - Dizia Ela.
 Enfim, Gon e Killua finalmente chegaram ao hospital onde se encontraram com Leorio e Kurapika, eles conversaram, perguntaram o que aconteceu e o Leorio explicou a situação toda. Logo presenciamos talvez a melhor cena deste filme, o Kurapika, com a parte superior da cabeça enfaixada cobrindo o buraco onde ficavam seus olhos, senta na cama do hospital e diz ""eu vejo"". Pois bem, ele consegue enxergar através dos seus olhos mesmo a distância, igual a Sr. Cabeça de Batata fez em Toy Story 3, conseguindo ver uma paisagem e descrevendo onde ele estava, não me lembro ao certo como era a descrição do lugar, logo após transcreverem o que o Kurapika dizia, Gon e Killua saíram a busca do esconderijo do vilão separados marcando um ponto de encontro, passando por diversas cidades, até que em uma das cidades, Gon encontra um menino, Retz, ele estava trabalhando com uma marionete que ele mesmo fez, fazendo um showzinho para ganhar dinheiro e poder sobreviver, uma carroça desgovernada cheia de maçãs ia cair em cima de uma garotinha, até que Retz e Gon pulam pra salvar a garotinha e é lógico que o Gon segura todo o tranco da carroça com muita facilidade, Retz e Gon começam a conversar até que entardece, Killua chega à cidade e encontra Gon conversando com Retz sobre o tal esconderijo do vilão e se ele sabia onde aquela paisagem ficava, Retz afirma que sabe onde é e pode levar ele até lá. Gon o apresenta para Killua e ele fica todo viradinho no cíume, dizendo que não confiava em Retz, até que depois de um certo momento Killua empurra Retz e ele cai no chão, logo em seguida ele diz que Retz era na verdade uma menina. Retz se explicou dizendo que era difícil para uma menina viver sozinha e trabalhar nas cidades de forma segura, por isso que ela se diz ser um menino. 
 Resumindo bastante, depois de muita coisa meio off eles finalmente chegam ao suposto esconderijo e são surpreendidos por Illumi, no caso, Illumi marionete que traz más recordações ao Killua, visto que ele ainda não havia retirado a agulha de Nen, o Illumi marionete deixa o Killua em estado de choque e desce o cacete no Gon roubando os olhos dele, e por algum motivo ele fica incapacitado de usar Nen quando seus olhos são roubados. Killua fica sad emo depressor e-boy, andando pela cidade e pipipi popopo até que ele quase se deixou ser atropelado por um trem (?) sendo salvo por Gon que está com a cabeça enfaixada igual o Kurapika, eles tem uma D.R., Gon é viadinho com o Killua e logo ele volta ao normal. 
 Indo pro final que é a parte importante, os 4 protagonistas finalmente encontram o vilão do filme e ele está em uma espécie de teatro de marionetes/fantoches e os 4 terão de enfrentar os respectivos fantoches, tendo Illumi e a trupe fantasma inteira de fantoches (sem os olhos, claro), e Omokage explica o seu motivo, típica coisa de vilão mesmo, ele estava roubando olhos para dar para a sua pequena irmãzinha, Retz, que, por culpa dele, havia perdido os olhos, e isso deixa Gon boladão falando tipo ""Ain, a Retz não quer ser má grr grr"", até que a treta começa, depois de um tempo de treta chega a trupe original pra descer a lenha nos farsantes, um dos integrantes tinha uma faca lá fodona que mata a pessoa em 5 minutos ou algo assim, eles destruiram todas as marionetes, recuperaram os olhos, o teatro pega fogo e a Retz, com a faca que um dos integrantes deixou cair e assassina o próprio irmão, sendo queimada junto com todas as marionetes que por ele foram feitas. E foi assim que acabou o filme.


MOTIVOS PELOS QUAIS NÃO SE DEVE ASSISTIR ESSE FILME
1. A animação é algo que é bem bizarro, esse filme foi feito em sei lá, 2013 sendo o estilo divergente de todo anime, sendo bem menos trabalhado e estranho.

2. O filme é muito corrido, ele tem 1h30min de duração mas parece que faltou muita coisa. O filme tinha tudo pra dar certo, se não fosse um filme, ou então se fosse um filme de 2h no mínimo o que é algo surreal para um filme animado.

3. O filme tem muito potencial perdido e ele é extremamente decepcionante e ruim. O vilão é bem meh, o plot é previsível, da pra saber que Retz é irmão do Omokage bem tranquilamente.

4. O filme tenta ser igual HxH mas não tem a essência, ele tenta ter uma trilha sonora marcante que faça você chorar igual Departure mas ela é só genérica, sem vida e nem é bem utilizada.

5. Os eventos do filme não são cannon, visto que ele foi feito depois do anime já ter passado deste arco e não ser mencionado uma vez se quer no anime, ou seja, ele é totalmente desnecessário.

6. Não assista, guarde todas as suas boas recordações de HxH, que será bem mais vantajoso do que lembrar que a saga tem esse filme PODRE para estragar o seu legado."

I believe this is the greatest anime ever made, I'm serious. 
A quick summary on the show:

Hiiragi Utena LOVES magical girls, obsessed with them, so when mascot Venalita gives her the opportunity to become one, she gladly becomes one, only to realize she's the villain and not a hero, she then tortures and commits sexual acts with the Tres Magia, the good magical girls, while still loving them as a fan, and creates a group of magical girl villains to defeat the Tres Magia.

I enjoyed every second of this show and I seriously believe it is the best anime I've watched as of now.

Here are 10 Reasons why:

1- Voice acting
The voice acting is genuinely the best I've ever heard, Utena sent shivers down my spine when I heard her voice, It fits so well, other characters also have amazing voice actors but Utena's especially went hard.

2- Plot
Whole reason I watched the show, I've never seen much media go into the perspective of the villain much, it always felt like everything was handed to them but here we get to see the villain lose, work harder, and overcome adversity, it's a breath of fresh air from the usual villain that just has power and feels unstoppable, Utena became unstoppable.

3-Characters
The characters are vibrant, are vastly different from eachother, and yet compliment eachother perfectly. My best example would be Kaoruko and Kiwi, they are so similar in nature yet they absolutely hate eachother, an amazing dynamic I never got enough of.

4-Animation
Animation is surprisingly good, for an ecchi anime to have this good animation is uncommon, it's done well and the art style is eye candy to me, especially details in character design.

5- Lewding
The ""Lewding"" done in the show isn't overkill, it's the perfect amount, it doesn't feel forced or the center point of the show, it is balanced, I also appreciate that the creator didn't lewd Korisu (doing the bare minimum), and how he integrated the lewdness into the show rather than adding it as an extra.

6-Power System
Again, really surprised me. It's so simple and yet, so complex (also adds a little pop to the character design), the idea of using stars as a power system is such a genius idea, it's like a 1/5 star rating system, the more the better, simple as that, but he also made it so that outmatched characters can still win a fight, because power isn't everything, Utena vs Lord Enorme is a good example, Lord Enorme was MUCH stronger, yet Utena adapted and became a stronger person.

7-Comedy
It's funny, I like seeing the girls from the Tres Magia and Enormita meeting without realizing the practically had sex mere minutes ago, I also found it really funny that Sayos new form is literally just her hiding the fact that she's a pervert, and taking the attacks because she likes them.

8-BTS
We got actual peeks behind the scenes besides fighting, we saw the Tres Magia train, we saw some slice of life moments, we saw a lot that would normally not be included in such an anime and I appreciate it.

9-Likability
ANYONE can appreciate this anime, it's wonderful, you might like the characters, the animation, or maybe another aspect of the show, that way people can still love the anime in different ways from eachother while still having a common thing that brings a community to life.

10-Enjoyment Factor
Lastly, I enjoyed this show a lot, I always anticipated what would happen next, and always went WILD every episode, wether a character got stronger, or I got left on a cliff hanger, it was amazing, waiting a week between episodes only heightened my excitement, I would always say ""If only they released it all at once..."" because I wanted to continue watching it SO BADLY.

That is why MahoAko is the greatest anime ever made

To show you how much I mean it, here are some anime I gave a lower score:
JJK S1 and 2
Chainsaw Man
Demon Slayer
and every season of JJBA up til part 5 (haven't watched part 6)

I spent too much time on this, but that just proves how much I mean it.

sad it's over :("
101571,"The real world is a tumultuous place. The life of a worker can be rather stressful in the wrong situations. The people in your life can be unbearable little shitstains that make you wanna beat them until they beg for mercy. The days are long and arduous sometimes, and the work can just keep piling on until you back breaks. It becomes such a blessing we always have resources to help keep our sanity at bay. We all have hobbies; we all have friends. We all have a reason to keep going with the cycle of days that make up the majority of our lives.

Aggressive Retsuko is a commendable achievement. Its characters are so fully realized, fleshed out, and relatable that they are more human than most animated shows can even dream of. Their situations are as classic as they are comically relatable, and the way the show tells them is as genuine and endearing as it can get. Everyone except for that fucker Komiya gets some time to impress, even those whom we and Retsuko all saw as mind-numbing caricatures that embody everything we hate about peers and coworkers. Fenneko, Haida, Washimi, and so many others are a blast to watch, both in terms of seeing them interacting with each other and in witnessing their hobbies. Even if some moments are more out-there and convenient, what we are presented with is both entertaining, charming, and most of all, beneficial. Having such a fun cast to work with only seals the deal on making this uproarious piece of edutainment work.

More people need to see this show. As discouraging as it can be for someone to see what a pain the work life is, it's more than worth it for them to see what kind of wonderful environments, relationships, and hobbies await everyone. It also serves as surprising reassurance that everyone is just a person dealing with things their own way, and that we just have to find those who connect with us to make our daily lives worth it all. The best part is that the show does this without constantly spelling out what it’s teaching. Honestly, even with the coarse language and booze, this show should be fun for the whole family. The Sanryo merchandising and style that Fanworks worked with so expressively, adds a layer of accessibility to the show. The dub being a real treat extends that reach even further.

We watched The Simpsons and Transformers as children, so there is no excuse to not see this at any TV-consuming age."
4901,"Most of this review will be on the actual 5 episode OVA, while the last few paragraphs are my overall, cumulative feelings toward all of Black Lagoon. A 2-in-1 deal. 

As per usual, expect to see spoilers

Roberta's Blood Trail brings the series back to a close on another explosive, middle-fingers-in-the-air, emotional, dour gutpunch of an ending. I went in expecting it to be a bit more light-hearted, akin to the earlier episodes (seeing the word ""OVA"" to me implies it'll be like a bonus, side adventure or something), but that only proves I learned nothing from the series' final arc involving Yukio. I don't drink, but that arc was probably the most sobering experience I've had watching anime all year. 

Stone-cold maid Roberta is back, and on a sadistic rampage throughout Roanapur to avenge her masters. Though the pills sure as hell aren't making it any less safe than it already is. Garcia tries to deny it, but he finally sees the ugly, dirty side of her she's deathly afraid of showing a boy like him. Despite what your inside feelings tell you, you sometimes can't help but lash out in blind, almost delusional rage.                    

It could've been sunshine and rainbows for them, and even Yukio. Hell, at times, it certainly was. But alas, life is not known for being fair. And you can point it to your screwed up past making you the son of a bitch you are now. As much as Roberta prays, the idea of forgiveness is downright laughable by now. Even if you could just quit your decidedly fucked up lifestyle cold turkey, that simply wouldn't feel right. That simply wouldn't feel enough. Looking at Revy, you see a woman who already sold her soul, but her past (involving a grape scene that made my skin crawl, and eyes burn) seems to ensure she'd always turn out like this. It's the most obvious, least surprising thing ever, but that still doesn't make it any less tragic. As the show says, it's like things never change. And the only ones with a chance at escape are those stuck in the middle; those who were just thrown into this life, like some kids and a certain Japanese businessman we all know and love....

In the case of Rock, one notable criticism I have is his brush with the dark side here felt......a little too abrupt? Now, look: I'm not saying it comes out of left field or anything. As the series progressed, it's undeniably established that Rock is at a crossroads in his life. Going from a pencil-pushing, deadbeat, no-name office employee, to being thrown into the rough and rowdy criminal underworld that he grows to embrace, but still keeping his sanity & morals intact. Roanapur however is where your innocence goes to die. A bloody, gross, dirty death, no less. Being stuck for so long in a hell like that is bound to get you someday. But during the end of ""Oversaturation Kill Box,"" I felt that smirk came in a bit too abruptly for me to process it all. Like it was a switch someone flipped on. It wasn't a surprise and it fits perfectly within what BL is going for, but I wished there was more time to make it feel even more natural. Like if Rock starts plotting and gambling more, and before he knows it, he's already smirking like Revy and has a brief moment where he realizes how he's become. A more gradual buildup. You could say that still technically happens, except for the realization. And while expected, the giving-in felt a little toothless once the actual moment came. He's lamenting the situation in his car one minute, and during his call to Dutch, the switch gets flipped and Rock's bad side is in a display. Not unhinged, but it's clear to see. The pieces are all there, and the picture still comes out nice, but they needed to be moved into place better. In art, the how is a huge deal. 

I'll admit however, that I'm fixated on this because Rock's fate of giving in got a bit spoiled for me (blame Google), and because I found him to be a very compelling protagonist the more the series progressed. Either the series ended with him converting to the lifestyle completely, or keeps him in his twilight hell-to which it settles more on the latter.

 And for disclosure, that big ass paragraph alone should be proof of how much of an impression the guy left on me, and the new layers I find the more I think on it. Hell, an argument the abruptness was the point crossed my mind too (like it was an impulsive expression). To go off on a quick tangent, keep in mind my reviews tend to be my best first impressions. I try to block out any outside insight and opinions as much as possible until the review's finished. What you read is as unfiltered as my thoughts can get. And any possible insight and fuller, stronger understanding only truly comes from revisiting and ruminating the material more. I believe in trying to soak everything in on a deeper level, for better and/or for worse, and a part of me's always chasing that precious, pure, full knowledge you can't get in a day. -Tangent over.- 

Don't let this make you think where Rock ends up was a botchjob or something. Even in the final scene, he's as cold and melancholic as ever. Him taking a crack at his evil side still doesn't feel ""complete"" if you catch my drift. And again: hey, maybe that was the point. 

And so, the OVA closes off on Garcia & Roberta finally back together, (though part of me thought they were in the afterlife or something, idk), and Rock looking over the shithole city, contemplating his joke of a life in crime. Stuck in the middle of it all, as always. And being in the middle doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be fun. Looking into it, the ending wasn't as dour as I remembered it being, considering Garcia & Roberta's reunion. But at that point, the violence and nihilism got to me where at worst, it felt too little too late. Even that felt like the show was going to pull the rug from under me again, at some moment. Still, it fortunately didn't feel left-field either. Black Lagoon is at least understanding of the audience. It pins you down and harasses you, but you can tell through the dementedness and buck wild violence, that there's a tragedy behind it all. A sad, sobering look of ""yeah. We know. And we don't blame you, kid."" Even a part of Revy doesn't like to see Rock in the same light as them. Like he's the closest she has to a conscience or something-the one person she can't imagine living without. The person who annoys her, but also can never fully hate. The hope he won't end up like her.



Black Lagoon is all fun and games until it snaps you back to its reality of crime and corruption. It lures you in with being a fun, zero fks given action-adventure anime, but that notion gets almost as equally shattered, especially as the episodes wind down. Placing Rock as the P.O.V. character was a great move. Embodying the everyman, who sees the thrills and soulcrush of what being a pirate is. My face may have been a blank frown watching most of it, but my brain and heart was being assaulted. 

The action scenes are an utter spectacle, and ep. 16-18 is the show at its most heightened, insane, overloaded, jaw-droppingly ridiculous in terms of gunplay. And who am I to kid?: It rules. Tarantino would cream his pants if he watched it. The hardcore music mixed with some electronica matches the rough, but slightly stealthy tone of the series perfectly. And nearly every character has a distinct air to them, always brimming with personality. Twisted and sad as they are (except Benny, he's a cutie boi =) (Dutch too, I guess, in a way). 

Hard to recommend, and I can't promise you'll wanna rewatch it (take it from me), but emotionally draining as it can be, it's worth watching. If anything, so you can sober up, soak it all in, and reflect on your upbringing and feel blessed for (hopefully) not ending up like any of these characters. But also with a sense of guilt and heavy, depressing sympathy. ""Not for the faint of heart"" doesn't begin to cut it once you've finished it. At least, for me. 

Black Lagoon: if the F bomb was an anime. In all its various uses. 

The dub was incredible. It always makes me happy to see the Canadian VAs get more love. I still can't wrap my head around how Mike Adamthwaite can pull off a big, tough, deep yakuza swordsman voice, but then sound unrecognizable as a light-hearted blue lightning ninja. Man's got actual range. Also, two Madhouse anime where Brad Swaile voices the lead? Then again, Steve Blum's a lead in two Shinichiro Watanabe joints, so that's not really a surprise. [Insert the two nickels meme here]. Also Roberta is a talking dog from my childhood, that's surreal. 

(cough cough IwantRevytosteponme cough cough)

Song of the day: ""Yeah"" by Triple Fast Action.

124395,"Synopsis 

Season 2 of Uzaki chan wants to hang out is a slice of life/comedy anime based on a loner senpai and his junior wanting to hang out with him.... Yeah, that is it lol. Not actually we all know how this storyline goes, of course they begin to realize the feelings they have developed for each other. Now how will they react to it? 

Season 2 failure?

The 2nd season of Uzaki-chan wants to hang out was kind of a bust for me. Honestly, I loved the first season, but they steered off the path of what captured viewers to like this anime for the second season. This season focused on developing Uzaki and Sakurai relationship that it forgot the comedy in the anime. There are a bunch of cringe moments where jokes just fell flat and for a 12 episode, they pack too many situations in to make it feel like what is going on? For example, Sakurai, a college student who is a year from graduating, did not know he had a baby sister until he went home to visit his family. Not to mention the end where there was a tiny glimpse of progress when Sakurai held Uzaki’s hand and then it all goes down the drain with him saying “No not yet” We’ve still got lots of hanging out to do. These are college students, right? The one thing I did enjoy is Uzaki’s family, other than her mom we do see some moments we can enjoy with her little sister and her little brother and father. Uzaki’s family was pretty much the highlight of the anime.

Characters


 img220()

Let us begin with the characters, we see the progress of the main 2 characters realizing that they have feelings for each other. This is all the character progression there is and all that is needed really, but the new characters seemed to have replaced the old characters. We were used to seeing Ami and Itsuhito use their normal gimmicks to give Uzaki and Sakurai some realization of each other and their own feelings, but this was not the case this time. We saw more of Yanagi and Fujio take their place which didn't end as funny as it normally would be. We even see Uzaki’s brother Kiri get his own episode. There is not much to take from the anime characters; none of the side characters are relatable. Most of the scenario’s seemed to be thrown in there without a thought, Yes, I am looking at the Kiri episode. 

Animation & Music



Now as for the animation and music there is honestly nothing special about the animation. There is no amazing background or crazy graphics but again none is needed for this anime. The animation was completely fine however the music was awful. I hate the intro. I have skipped it every time after the first two episodes, the ending is no better. 

Conclusion

To conclude, this 2nd season has nothing on the 1st season. There were multiple reasons for this anime to fail this season. The main one is not being funny, the main reason season 1 was successful was because of the humor and wild and funny times Uzaki and Sakurai had together. Not to mention their friends Ami and Itsuhito always trying to set them up. I do appreciate that the main characters' families being introduced, but they did miss a critical point for Uzaki to meet with Sakurai parents. This is a manga adaptation after all but if they are waiting for the 3rd season for that point good luck!  I recommend this anime with a - Eh why am I watching this

Anime with a score of 60-70 receives a "" Eh why am I watching this""."
15227,"I would write something about its vivid portrayal of life in the early Shōwa era, obsessed with immersive, animated detail and focused on the mundane, but director Sunao Katabuchi has made his apparent approach explicit in an interview:

”[Manga artist] Ms. Kouno researched everything about that era and was able to create an accurate account of what life was like back then. This was necessary because what we have come to understand about that time has changed over the years. For the anime, we did the same type of research for the same reasons. It was very important for us to recreate what people looked like at the time.

""The important part of ‘In This Corner of the World’ was to portray everyday life. When we spoke to the elderly who lived during the war, they will tell us about the air raids and the hardest times. However, when it came to their everyday lives, they didn’t feel like that information had any value. Our generation hasn’t had the opportunity to talk with them about their everyday lives during the war. I felt that those experiences are invaluable.”

We observe war and the Japanese Empire’s last days through the lens of suburban civilian life. Hiroshima is within reach but just hidden from view over a mountain range. Battleships such as the iconic Yamato can be seen treading water in the bay. The boys are sent to war and, like the Yamato itself, never return. The girls pick up the pieces of their shattered families amidst the hastening tempo of air raids that presage the ultimate doom.

Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni is often criticized for its verbatim portrayal of its time period. Modern audiences expect modernity superimposed over their historical dramas as a way to right the wrongs of the past. But there’s no assertion of feminism or an explicit statement of the wrongs of the Japanese Empire (though I believe an implicit case for both is sufficiently made within the film's narrow scope). Instead, Kono Sekai is a time capsule unconcerned with our desire for historical power fantasies. Helplessness is the core of its experiential being, as it likely was.

Yes, the women do as they are told; wedded off to unfamiliar families, severed from dreams of what could have been. Though the film is hardly without moments of happiness and beauty, the war eventually encompasses all. They scrape by in loss of limb, loved ones, livelihoods and eventually the culturally provided rationale for all their sacrifices: the dream of the Japanese Empire.

Evangelion creator and nationalist Hideaki Anno, whose works portray the Japanese spirit overcoming American oppression (Shin Godzilla, Gunbuster), criticized the protagonist: “What a woman, doing nothing. I wanted to strangle her.”

Unfortunately, there’s no super-robot to climb into. No way to make history as we prefer it to be. No way to give meaning to loss. History just is.

”[Audiences] will be able to experience the world and society that once existed in a very raw way. I’d like to think that ‘In This Corner of the World’ is like a time machine where you can experience life and a culture of a different time.”"

Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road was an anime that I was interested in this season, but I didn't put too many expectations on it to be something big to avoid charging too much for a work that wasn't that impressive.
To my surprise, my experiences with the anime turned out to be much more positive than I expected, especially in how the work structures its proposal of “isekai protagonist killer”.
The anime has its problems, like any other work, but overall it was a very pleasant and fun experience to follow.
img490()
A fair, pure and strong anime.
img420()
To begin with, I find it interesting to say that the anime is not an “anti-isekai” as the synopsis proposal might make it seem.

In fact, Menou's object is to kill the summoned from another world, but at no time are they treated as villains per se. In fact, much of the time you realize that they too are a victim of that world's system.

This change of perspective is important because it shows how the author did not want to make a work to criticize the genre, but to try to give a new vision to this concept that has already been used until saying enough.

This also does not mean that the protagonist's actions are wrong or evil. In fact, that's exactly why I liked the anime.

The answer is not clear. There's no right or wrong. As much as there is injustice with those invoked, there is also justice on the part of Menou in protecting the world they live in.

img750()
It's cruel, but it has its reasons.
img420()

The first episode manages to compress this idea very well, presenting a “protagonist” who was taken out of his world and sentenced to death because of it, while trying to explain to you why these invoked have become taboo.

As unfair as it sounds to kill the boy without giving it a chance, there is evidence that keeping that kind of person alive causes a lot of problems for the world as a whole and that's why Menou's actions are not unfounded.

This moral duality is something that gives the anime a nice identity and makes you interested in the construction of the world of the work, since things are not limited to just people being invoked by chance.

There are conspiracies behind it, political interests and other events related to the coming of these people from Japan that complement this dynamic of not having a line that divides the moral well in the protagonist's actions.

img490()
It's not really a matter of just killing or leaving alive...
img420()

Another interesting thing about the isekai factor in the anime is the effects it had on the world of the work itself.

In addition to the various disasters that are mentioned by the protagonist, it is also nice to note at the beginning how there were also positive effects in the coming of the summoned ones, such as a “Japanetization” of the world.

These little things in the construction of the anime are interesting and show how the work tries to create something that goes beyond the standard clichés.

The only thing I would have liked to see a little more explanation for would be how the magic works.

I think this decoding/keywords scheme is really cool, but the anime doesn't delve into it and it's kind of superficial how it all works.

img620()
You can get some interesting spin-offs from there.
img420()
Now speaking of the protagonists, I really liked Menou as a whole.

In addition to being charismatic, she does what it takes and knows how to make rational decisions when necessary, which keeps the story going well.

The fighting style he uses is one of my favorites, so most of the battles managed to keep me well entertained due to having those illusion moves and a little bit of strategy involved in the combat.

As for Akari… Well, 70% of the time she's kind of annoying with those “Menoou-chan!”, but the other 30% makes up for it by delivering a really intriguing protagonist.

In addition to drastically changing his personality and adding some layers of drama with his backstory, the way he makes it clear he's manipulating the story behind the camera gives the anime a pretty cool new perspective.

I think it was one of the anime's plot twists that I liked the most, because I wouldn't have imagined that she would be so involved with the events of the story and was pulling strings from behind to follow the script she created.

img720()
It just looks silly.
img420()

In fact, generally speaking, the entire cast managed to be quite competent on their own.

Even if they don't stray too far from certain clichés, they manage to deliver good dramas and present some interesting stories.

The supporting characters have their dilemmas and personal problems, like Momo, and the villains are not that complete stereotype of evil either, having some motivations and serving precisely to reaffirm the dangers that those invoked can bring to the protagonist's world.

Ashuna is a big woman of p— and needs no comment for the way she's always getting straight to the point and solving everything, literally, in the fight, besides that the villain of the end managed to give me a sense of real danger with her immortality.

In other words, even though there are no major developments on the part of the characters, everyone who appears on the scene has their share of development and relevance to the script, not getting that face of stage decoration.

img740()
best character <3
img520()

As for the yuri romance factor that the work tries to sell, I would say it's ok.

Menou and Akari work in a certain way, but they didn't convince me much as a couple.

On the other hand, my shipp between Momo and Ashuna was maintained from start to finish.

The exchanges of barbs that the two have throughout the anime, in addition to being fun, give that feeling that something can come out of there.

If anything will really come out of all this, only the author can say, but from the experience of the anime, I would say that the focus here is not to have a novel itself or as a main factor in the development of the characters.

img740()
Best couple, or nearly so.
img520()

In short, Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road is an anime that positively surprised me for bringing a relatively original idea and executing it satisfactorily.
The characters are fun and the pace at which the story progresses, along with certain plot twists, make you interested in what will happen to the characters.
Some things could be better used, of course, but the work manages to deliver what it promises and close everything that was shown as far as possible.

117989,"This is my first time reviewing an anime so i'm gonna try my best.(≧∀≦)

So megami-ryou is a new ecchi anime that was airing recently, the summer of 2021, and I'm sure the only ecchi anime this season. So the plot is pretty simple to understand for me. There's a young middle school boy who his house got burnt to crisp. Then he got no place to stay and suddenly found out about a college girls dormitory, who apparently need a ""dorm mother"" and famously known for their weird household. Desperate to have a place to live, he joined the household without any people's concern and warmly welcomed by the girls.

I'm gonna went through my favourite characters. First we got Atena, who the newest member of the dormitory. She apparently spent her whole life surrounded by girls from school days to college, so he got some problems when facing men, where she got easily uncomfortable and even stuttered to speak. 
!she's also apparently the mc's main heroine, well, according to how the anime always showed some hints throughout the anime!  She's the kind of character who very lovely with the others, and probably the only one with normal thinking and hated when other girls do ecchi things to Koushi. And I think she's great. As the anime progress, she started to get comfortable with Kouchi and wanted a brother-sister relationship with him. The arc about her with Kouchi, where she's trying to blend in with men feel very wholesome. Then we have Frey-san, a cospay-fanatic sister who love doing ecchi stuff with Kouchi. She's might be my 3rd favourite girl. I find that she's very funny when interacting with other characters and felt kinda pale when she's off screen. The arcabout her and kouchi also very good, the conversation with him really has an impact on me and very well organized. Then we got Sutea. This one a little controversial actually, I've noticed that many people don't really like her because she's annoying and always spoil up the mood. And I think thats what made her fun. Her annoyance for me bring balance to the character and add up the humor element even more to the story. And plus, her relationship with Kouchi is very sweet and wholesome. Sutea actually can't handle other person's heat, so she has to avoid any contact with other person, other than Kouchi. The scene where Kouchi tried to maintain her heat was very adorable.

The pacing of this anime also is well organized. the total episodes is only 10 but they somehow managed to squeeze everything up and it didn't felt rush at all. We got some balance moments where mc's spent time with each characters and some of their past. Not to mention that the comedy is gold as well. I didn't watch that many ecchi anime but this one really hook me up not just because of the fan service [ ;) ] but the story and humor which actually really funny. Of course in ecchi anime there's a lot ""unnecessary"" timing of fanservice, but this one here is completely stable and well timed. the animation also really good, the artist drew the fanservice part really well and very detailed, so kudos to the animators for putting a lot of effort on it. I get that people get uncomfortable that the fact its involved minors, but you know, my opinion is as long as he happy, and have a very wholesome moments with others, then its alright. that's why I stated that its not for everyone. Some people actually get easily disturbed with it but as for me, its fine and alright.

Lastly, its an excellent wholesome anime for ecchi genre, with great and enjoyable characters, with adorable bonding. I rate it 9/10. And it doesn't have like a heavy plot or a twist or anything, so its good for someone who want to see some anime titties and something hilarious while relaxing."
21717,"This WILL have spoilers, but this show doesn't really have spoilers per se.
Let's start off by describing my experience with Fate and the Extraverse. This is also simple, and is as follows:
- Notes: Masterpiece.
- Fate/stay night VN: Close to a masterpiece. Some writing choices make this at least a 9.5 for me.
- FGO: Don't play it.
- Fate/Extra: Doesn't suck, but isn't good. Its execution is flawed, but the ideas are definitely there. Story average, characters and worldbuilding good. Gameplay horrible.

Make a note here, because unlike every other watcher, I've actually played what's necessary to understand what's going on in this anime from just the first two episodes, if not understand the entire show.

Simple and effective. The first episode is quite easy to follow. It's meant to throw us off into thinking this is a basic, normal Extra adaptation. There are multiple clues to stop us from thinking such, but for now, we'll ignore those. They aren't really important to understanding the plot but more like foreshadowing. It's a 1:1 mirror to the ""tutorial"" MC NPC in Fate/Extra that dies when you get rekt by the Automata while trying to leave the preliminary stratum.

The second episode is when the actual plot is shown to us. Straightforward. Hakunon, from the original Fate/Extra canon, failed. She lost to Twice Pieceman after rejecting his offer. Now Saver's Noble Phantasm, the Chakravartin, has killed/brought about the slow and inevitable demise of the Moon Cell, causing each strata to become a floor, and each hold a Floor Master. We now know this takes place at a ""bad end"" to the original Fate/Extra, so most should have stopped here because they wouldn't understand anything past this point. I honestly have no clue why people kept going, but Fate anime-onlies and seasonal watchers are crazy unpredictable people so its probably that.
This sequence of events, in itself, is enough to clue you in about a couple of things. Using our knowledge of Fate/Extra, you'd realize that in the first place if Hakunon reached Twice Pieceman, then every HGW participant should be dead. Because Twice Pieceman is the final participant/boss of the Extra HGW, so logically every other participant has already been eliminated. And from the first episode its obvious that they aren't. In fact, instead of different participants, these are the exact same people Hakunon should have killed. This is explained later, but you wouldn't even notice this without playing Extra.

That's pretty much the plot. It's not that complicated, though it requires that knowledge from Extra. The main issue I have with this, is that in basically every review of this show, people state that yes, they've played it, but the plot is still a complete mystery to them. They have not played it. These concepts are explained by the game itself, and the fact that you NEED to know what happens in Extra is evident in the first scene of the first episode. IT IMMEDIATELY BEGINS WITH THE END OF EXTRA. Aside from this fact, the title itself is a dead giveaway. Here's the definition of Encore in English:
> a repeated or additional performance of an item at the end of a concert, as called for by an audience.

A Last Encore would, evidently, mean that its the last performance. That would mean there was a performance before it. Because this is the last one, of course.
Let's try it with the French usage of the word. I don't really need a definition for this, but its basically just ""again,"" in most circumstances. A Last Encore would then mean trying again for the last time. This would mean there was an initial attempt that failed. In the midst of Isekai sentences that describe the plot entirely, this title is refreshing and actually represents the show.

In relation to criticism and analysis of the plot itself, it serves as a wagon for the characters to move on, and to develop Twice Pieceman as an antagonist because Extra just made him out to be big bad man for the most part. There really isn't much to tackle as the plot is hardly the main focus, as likewise in-game, so nothing outstanding. If I had to score it, it would probably be around a 6.5/10.

The shining highlight and Nasu's strength. Let's go back to episode one. Remember Hakunon dying and then Hakuno showing up in the preliminary stratum? Yes, this is a different Hakuno. He isn't what he seems to be, because of the weird events of the first episode.

> every HGW participant should be dead

Here we get to see Leo, Rin, and Shinji as returning characters... but as mentioned, they should be dead. Same with Hakuno, because Hakunon is also dead. And the exact same with every single Floor Master. This is very important. I'll be focusing mostly on Hakuno here because he's the MC and gets the most development but each Floor Master should not be shafted (I'm only doing so to attempt at conciseness). Each of them is changed, different, or better than their Extra counterparts. They each have their own unique quirks, their own unique Floor which complements their separate theme amazingly, improved by SHAFT animation, but we'll get to that part later. 

HAKUNO Kishinami (Extra art because it's raw)
img150()

The themes of the MC are really striking as well-written, and logically follow a sense of development. It goes from ""What it means to be alive,"" to ""Why should we keep living if so?"" and then lastly ""Even if I may not be human myself, are they worth saving?"" There is a thematic progression had here, and as he progresses each Floor, smoothly in such a way as not clearly describing it to the audience, but instead through the visual animation and the Floor Master. He's a unique character, and the Dead Face aspect just adds more to each of these themes. Is he really alive if he's just a bunch of hating souls? Why ascend, without a goal? Can he really save humanity if he serves to hate such?

His cleaner, less annoying relationship with Nero also ascends her character and their interactions for me. Nero serves as a sort of ""mentor-ish"" role to him, providing advice from her life as emperor and her experience in order to fuel his character growth. As this goes on, he starts warming up to her a lot more. He becomes more expressive toward her, instead of his constant deadpan delivery which is seen in the beginning.

Nero (Red Saber)
img220(/revision/latest?cb=20170913172522)
Is actually bearable. I know, I know. Impossible, right? But yes, they've done it. Unlike Extra, Nero serves a much bigger purpose in the overall narrative, mostly in helping Hakuno through his character struggles. Her dialogue is also much less annoying and preachy, putting the constant UmU aside (no Padoru posters). To the Nero haters, I'm a part of you, but just give her a chance here. Her fan-service is sometimes a bit... obnoxious. I wouldn't expect otherwise from any entry in the Extraverse as sex is a huge part for some reason (thanks CCC), so it just comes hand-in-hand. Oh yea, her backstory was an extremely nice touch. Her motivations became clearer, and it made her not feel like the complete caricature she was in Fate/Extra.

I wish I could spend more lines on each Floor Master, but it would take way too long and it's simply tiring. I would rather someone experience it themselves rather than describing how depressing Alice's Floor was, or just how much Leo had given up on his entire sense of self. For the score, I would give a 10/10 in this section.

It's SHAFT. They have a reputation.
Anyway, they're a vast improvement on whatever the fuck the copy-paste levels were in Extra. Each Floor is finely attuned to each Floor Master, bringing about visuals unlike I've ever seen from anime. They each represent a different part of the Floor Master, being a metaphor to such, unlike the original. Aside from the stunning backgrounds, THERE'S LIKE ZERO CGI. It's probably the happiest I've been watching modern-esque anime. And even more so then that, the amount of frames is fucking stunning. There were zero instances where I questioned the quality, in fact, this anime is basically what Apoc should have been. A consistently well-animated all across the board show, with each fight scene being as stunning as the last, instead of cramming all that effort in the last 5 episodes. It's very overblown, and over the top, just as a Fate anime should be. No ufotable CGI sparks here, or directionless Babylonia animation wank. 9/10.

The sound design is... good for what it is. There are specific tracks that sound more orchestra-based that I enjoy much more and think they are perfect for their use, but a lot of the electronic-sounding ones are extremely bad. The sound mixing is average, there's no wubs or anything of the sort this time around. The music complements what's happening, nothing bad there. Slightly above average, but not enough to blow me away or anything. 6.5/10.

It's very well-paced, keeping me glued to the screen the entire time I was watching. There are no points with stand-still exposition, it usually has a moving element in typical SHAFT fashion, in order to keep the viewer somewhat entertained visually while they are explaining some concepts/need to know info (for example, in the second episode when Rin explains Wizards). The Floors each take about 2 episodes each. They start off with introductions of the Floor and development of the Floor Master in the first episode, and then in the second, they apply that to Hakuno, the current plot, situation seamlessly. It sounds formulaic on paper, but its execution is fantastic. This is one of my favorites aspects of the show, how you can feel its video-gamey-ness but it constantly reminds you that it's trying to go beyond it and is, in fact, a very well made anime, one attuned to its finest strings. 9/10.
One common criticism I hear is that the Tamano floor was done off-screen, but the thing is, it would have broken the currently existing pacing. It was unnecessary and would have not done anything for Hakuno, which is why it was mentioned in the optional Drama CD.

So as you read this review, you may be wondering ""How is this only a 6/10 average while this guy seems to be having the time of his life?""
A normal question, and for those who are familiar with the franchise, a predictable answer. Type-Moon has no clue how to market, or what the fuck they are doing.

Marketing 

The real bad stuff. The first mistake was implying in any way that this is an adaptation of the PSP game Fate/Extra in its marketing. It's clearly not, because if it was, this would not be so confusing to some. Viewers came into the anime thinking it was because of the marketing, and came out extremely confused. Because its really not an adaptation of Extra, but more of a complementary piece that uses pre-established elements/concepts to create a semi-similar but extremely different narrative. So yes, when watching this seasonally, people weren't happy, dropped it, reviewed it like shit, etc etc. I won't put this as entirely their fault, BUT I will blame them for continuing to watch after lore was thrown around that they didn't understand and was never explained in the show (because it was in the game)

The second mistake was... making an anime for an old PSP game, without giving any access to it currently, aside from the manga adaptation (which is subpar anyways). This way, Last Encore would be the only modern entryway into the Extraverse, as Extella is more of a spin-off that uses a separate timeline and separate lore. So even more people wouldn't be aware of how to properly experience it. Type-Moon is horrible at this, its a trend honestly.

The reviews, ratings, and mass-spread ignorance

In order to put fuel on the dumpster fire that was the marketing, the reviewers did not make it any better. This was indeed badly reviewed, but also in extremely bad faith. Fate haters took the opportunity to do their thing as expected, but that isn't really relevant. What was, were the fake fans, which we will call ""fakers."" Taken from the top-rated review on MAL:

> Oh boy, Fate/Extra: Last Encore. I should say, right off the bat, that while I am a fan of the Fate universe... So I decided to give this a shot anyway. Why not? It has an alluring premise and takes place in an alternate timeline to Fate/stay night. In this timeline, mana have disappeared and Wizards are forced to use virtual space for magic. Similar to some of the other Fate series, a Holy Grail War is set up by a computer that pits 128 Masters in a tournament. The winner will be chosen with a wish to be granted by the Moon Cell Automaton, a mysterious computer of unimaginative powers. Main male protagonist Makuno Kishinami gets caught up into this battle for survival and is clueless on why he is involved. Luckily for him, he gets a servant called Saber. (do note for the sake of avoiding spoilers, I’ll just refer her as “Red Saber” from now on)

Has not played the video game. Gets the basic plot summary wrong...

> If you’re hoping some of your favorite Fate character to show up in this series, then prepare for disappointment. Only a small handful of characters like Rin, Sakura, and Shinji appear and most of their roles are downplayed to get over the main cast. Some of the characters from Fate/Grand Order game also shows up although their roles are so small that you’ll likely forget them incredibly easily. Most of the minor characters have their roles minimized and episodes’ resolutions feel rushed.

Proceeds to think Fate/Extra is connected to Fate/stay night...

> What bugs me though is how the main plot is executed with Hakuno and Red Saber as the main characters. Don’t me wrong. They are highly entertaining to watch at first but after a while, you may wonder if it’s worth investing time into them at all... But the series’ main story is not abominable. It’s actually much worse. For the majority of viewers, you’ll probably scratch your head on what the hell is going on. I know I did and feel like the series tries to do way too many things at once.

And inevitably, here are the consequences. Doesn't understand why this main character, why Red Saber, or why anything. Doesn't know why they should invest time in the characters. As stated above in my review, these are not the same people. So any player of the game would be extremely invested to find out WHY Hakuno is still alive after Hakunon died.
This and many other reviews keep providing uninformed opinions from an uneducated perspective of the franchise, by lying and saying they are ""fans."" This is a problem. You cannot criticize season 2 while at the same time saying you didn't watch season 1.

You just have to read the premeditated material. As said before, Extra real sucks. So don't play it. [Watch this silent playthrough instead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPGXcFekI6k&list=PLDKgbJ4iSaZtwBPC4G0EyTZAPAwm7c4E) Put on that 1.5x/2x speed and enjoy yourself. If you feel like you can actually like the combat/the game's structure, then feel free to play it. I could barely find fun in it, but hey, you do you. The ""WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE WATCHING LAST ENCORE"" videos are really bad. Horrible job at explaining anything. The wiki entries are doable, but you'll have to dedicate a fair amount of your time in order to fully grasp everything. High recommend to the playthrough still.

As for Notes so you can understand what is happening with the outside world/what Overcount 1999 (briefly mentioned in the show) is, [you can find the good translation on this Beast's Lair thread.](http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/archive/index.php/t-73.html) I prefer the image version available for download, as it mimics the original and its setup with the dictionary, but the text version works too. It's also just a damn good read, so I recommend it regardless. It isn't even related to Fate in a sense, in story terms.
You also don't need to play FSN, but I recommend it. I put that there so people don't think I'm one of the mindless drones that sees Saber and has an immediate angry reaction.

Don't play FGO.

9/10. My enjoyment is immeasurable and my day has been relit.

For those of you who've scrolled down and then disliked after seeing the score, you've done a great service in proving my point. Keep them coming."
139092,"Iruma-kun was an anime that worked very well as a wonderful “Saturday Morning Cartoon” type of show. Decent comedy, action, and the lovable characters shaped what were two solid seasons. While this season did have some decent moments, it ultimately got hampered by staying in the same setting for most of the season, surrounding the Harvest Festival, which felt a very long, drawn-out arc. It moves away from the school setting, which was where the charm for me was, and into a competition of sorts between the classes. The season jumps around between characters, and balances development out for them, but it forgets what the main enjoyment point was, which was seeing Iruma and his two best friends, Asmodeus and Clara, interact and have fun with each other. 

The animation and production overall was fine, as it was around the same quality as the first two seasons had. The big scenes looked good, and the meaningful ones were well executed. As for the OP a bit disappointing, and the ED was quite awful.

The biggest problem though, was that even though each character had their own developments, they didn’t feel very meaningful, rather, they felt quite shallow. Sure, each of them has their breakthroughs and good moments, but they were unfortunately quite forgettable. This might just be a me thing, but the characters that most people love most (Ameri, Clara, Asmodeus), just didn’t show up enough, and I just didn’t care about the other characters to really be invested in the story. One new character who I did enjoy watching was Bachiko, who was quite the funny mentor for Iruma, but I wish she got more screen time as well.

Ultimately, the season simply starts out too slow for me to care for what happened at the end of the arc, and I wanted it to be over. I did enjoy some of the season to an extent, but nowhere near the level I did for Season 1 and 2, which delivered entertainment at more of a consistent quality than this season, which felt comparatively boring.

Let’s face the facts though, Iruma-kun provides NHK with quite the return of funds, and unless something major changes, I doubt this will be the last season of the show. Is it a lack of passion from the staff? Just poor direction? Or something more? It just felt something was missing from this season. I’m not gonna lie, it felt a little lazy, with the constant recaps shown, and the dragging with the needless cliffhangers. I really hope that this season was a one-off, and Iruma-kun can get back to being the charming show it once was. Let’s hope the money didn’t get to their heads.

I will say this though. If you haven’t watched this season of Iruma-kun yet, a binge might function better and make you enjoy it more than how I watched this, which was in a weekly format. If a Season 4 is on the horizon, I hope it can get paced better, with more intrigue than this season provided."

We are witnessing the greatest romance anime of all time unfold right before our eyes.



Who could have thought Rent-a-Girlfriend could get any better? Well, I could have thought because I knew this season would be amazing just like the seasons that came before it. Rent-a-Girlfriend enters its most anticipated arc yet and delivers on all cylinders. Without further ado, let me rent your attention for this review.


The plot of this season immediately follows the events of the previous season. [Kazuya](https://anilist.co/character/128105/Kazuya-Kinoshita) is still doing his best to support [Chizuru](https://anilist.co/character/128106/Chizuru-Ichinose) and her dreams. We get to see the two of them grow closer as they work to make the movie together. The season hit us with some of the most amazing content up until this point. The standouts would be the movie production, [Sayuri](https://anilist.co/character/283247/Sayuri-Ichinose)’s untimely passing, and Chizuru turning to Kazuya for support.

During the production of the movie Kazuya and Chizuru start dropping the “fake” relationship act and start acting like true close friends. Chizuru is indebted to Kazuya for helping her realize her dream, while Kazuya is indebted to Chizuru for lifting him up when he was in a bad spot. This is building off the idea from season 2 that dreams really can become reality with the right people around you. The interactions between these two are truly heartwarming onset and offset of the movie's production. Chizuru’s dreams were just within her reach, but similar to real life, not all stories have happy endings.

Chizuru’s grandma’s passing was one of the most emotional moments in all of anime. Chizuru was so close to showing her that she had fulfilled her dream to become an actress. Chizuru already failed to show her grandfather and now was on the verge of failing to show her grandmother. Fortunately, Kazuya found a way to get the movie shown to Chizuru and her grandmother in the hospital.Although she could only watch the beginning, Kazuya had fulfilled Chizuru’s dream to show her grandmother herself starring in a movie. This was one of the most heartfelt ever to grace the screen and could bring anyone to tears.

After the passing of her grandmother, Chizuru tried her best to act as she was fine. Kazuya was genuinely worried about her well being. He wanted to cheer her up. To tie things back to how they met he decides to take her on a rental date. He does everything he can to create the best date possible for her and finally her emotions wavered. Kazuya lends her his shoulder to cry on. Kazuya is the emotional support Chizuru needed and he was willing to do anything possible to make her happy. 




We are all already familiar with the colorful cast of Rent-a-Girlfriend, but in season 3 a new character enters the fray. [Mini Yaemori](https://anilist.co/character/153703/Mini-Yaemori) takes the stage and she does not disappoint. The rest of the side cast take a step back in this season to let the main cast shine. We do get small moments here and there, but for the most part this season is about Kazuya, Chizuru, and a dash of Mini.

Kazuya goes through extreme lengths to produce the movie for Chizuru. He is set on making her dreams come true and he does absolutely that. Not only do we see him support her goals to become an actress, we also get to see him support her as a person. He is there for Chizuru during her best moments and her worst moments. Their relationship is taking a step into the next level.

Chizuru goes through a wide array of emotions in this season. She experiences the highs of being on a movie set as the main star for the first time and also the lows of losing her last living relative. We already learned the heavy burden she held in the previous season, but the burden she carried this season was even greater. Chizuru has always been a very strong person, but it is impossible to be strong 100 percent of the time. She finally breaks down crying in Kazuya’s arms. This made her feel much more human and real. This goes to show that it is okay to ask for help when you are in need.

Speaking of help, Mini has helped make this season very fun and enjoyable to watch. Everytime she graces the screen she always says or does something funny to lighten the heavy mood of this season. She adds a wonderful amount of comedy and even acts as a wingman for Kazuya. Unlike the other girls she isn’t remotely close to being a love interest which is refreshing. Mini is just a ray of sunshine that does what she wants.

It is unfortunate the other side characters did not get much screen time in this season, but sacrifices had to be made for the phenomenal plot of this season. We did get some [Sumi](https://anilist.co/character/144665/Sumi-Sakurasawa) content and a tease of [Mami](https://anilist.co/character/154224/Mami-Nanami) at the end, but that was about it. Looking forward to seeing Mami back in action next season! At the end of the day, the characters still remain among the best of the best in romance anime.




Shout out to [TMS Entertainment](https://anilist.co/studio/73/TMS-Entertainment) for making Rent-a-Girlfriend season 3 one of the best, if not the best, looking romance anime ever. The animation of season 3 manages to do the impossible by surpassing the quality of both of its predecessors. The high quality art and animation puts Rent-a-Girlfriend in a league of its own among romance anime. Rent-a-Girlfriend just continues its streak of just getting better and better.




The OST of Rent-a-Girlfriend season 3 is more of the same from the previous seasons. There are some new renditions of tracks from the previous OSTs which are a nice touch. Rent-a-Girlfirend already had one of the best OSTs in all of anime, but this just put it over the top. Season 3 continues to deliver each and every episode. The phenomenal use of this amazing OST elevates the already amazing plot of season 3.




Both [halca](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2xOEM6pRUsLhlx2PzaQuK2?si=74797b2eedcf417e) and [Amber’s](https://open.spotify.com/artist/02uHSOwZg81iN67YEBbc0O?si=14147c3fcca4405d) hit it out of the park with this season’s opening and ending. [Renai millimeter film (恋愛ミリフィルム)](https://open.spotify.com/track/19BFUoZ7NSxD1toOmGRh6L?si=9df3831621f04f49) by halca is a work of art. Hearing this song play alongside the already amazing visuals of the opening had me hooked before each and every episode. [End Roll (エンドロール)](https://open.spotify.com/track/55H19piKezaPeqrTDbjHcO?si=fb04c03144a84349) by Amber’s is also an amazing song that leaves you wanting more at the end of each episode. 




Season 3 of Rent-a-Girlfriend puts everything onto the table and delivers a modern day classic. We are witness to the greatest romance anime of all time. The pursuit of one's dreams, the sorrow of loss, and supporting those you care about were all perfectly displayed this season. Through the ups and downs of life it is important to remember that it is okay to ask for help. I need your help to give Rent-a-Girlfriend the respect it deserves.



To all the Peak Slayer and Rent-a-Girlfriend enjoyers, I love you :)

Mami = Best Girl!"
10163,"“Why hello there… I’ve been watching you for quite a while. You work so hard, balancing your responsibilities at work with your responsibilities at home… I can’t imagine having to deal with the crippling irony of spending so much time pulling overtime for extra money to support your children, only to have them complain that you’re not home enough to spend time with them. What’s that? Oh, right, I forgot. My name is Masakaki, and I’ve come here to offer you a wonderful opportunity. How would you like to have all the money you could ever need? You’d never need to work a day in your life again… Well, maybe a little, to keep up appearances. If you’d like to solve all of your problems and improve your quality of life once and for all, then come with me to the Financial District, a world where an ambitious soul such as yourself can earn as much money as you want with little effort… Oh, but of course, there’s a catch. You’ll have to succeed at the expense of your peers, putting your money up against theirs… And offering up your future as collateral. So, my new entrepreneur… What will it be?”

Now, if I were you, I would think twice before taking Masakaki’s offer, because this entrepreneurial El Dorado really isn’t what it seems at the outset. As a resident of the Financial district, a separate plane of reality whose influence on our plane is disturbingly obvious, you’ll be gambling with more than just your net worth, or even just your life. You’ll be given a small fortune right at the start, along with an asset… Your own personal battle monster to fight other entrepreneur’s battle monsters on your behalf. They’ll be the ones taking a Stand for you as you encounter a wide array of both entrepreneurs(called Entres for short) and their Assets as well. One such Entre is Yoga Kimimaro, a college student who works himself to the bone to support himself, paying for tuition and rent with his wages.He seems to have developed this weird idea that Assets are people too, and he has a hard time making decisions as he seems compelled to do the right thing, and yet he’s proven himself a force to be reckoned with. Will he be able to defend Japan against the District’s secret threat, or will this Entre receive his just desserts?

img660()

Today’s anime offering is brought to us by Tatsunoko Production, a company that’s somehow been around since the sixties without making much of an impact along the way. That’s probably an exaggeration, seeing how I’m not personally up to date on the history of Japanese pop culture, but with the exception of Speed Racer, Irresponsible Captain Tylor and the Gatchaman franchise, I haven’t heard of almost any of their properties. Maybe it’s all just too obscure for me, and for that reason I really can’t get a grasp on what their work tends to look like on average, but C is one of their more high-profile titles, even if it’s name makes it really frustrating to look up online. At the very least I’ve seen Gatchaman Crowds, so I feel like I do have some idea of what their modern works look like, and that’s a good comparison to make, as the visual aspects of Crowds were one of it’s major redeeming factors after it started to get bogged down by all of it’s deeper problems.

Much like Crowds, C tries out a blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation and art styles, The traditional animation is your standard fare… It’s a little above average, the animation is just smooth enough to please the eye with clever editing to act as a crutch whenever it can’t. There’s a lot of attention to detail in the characters’ movements, and while I couldn’t really point to any of it being flashy, it carries a very subtle level of quality. Tatsunoko clearly know how to utilize shadows, and they seem to have a gleeful time proving it with a lot of smart lighting choices. As for the 3D animation, it’s really going to come down to a matter of personal preference. I’ve heard some people say that CG animation in anime is really jarring, and it makes the characters look really creepy, but personally, I love it. I loved it in the dancing scenes in Love Live, and I especially love it here.

Specifically, the divide between 2D and 3D animation is drawn very deliberately, to highlight the differences between the real world and the financial district. When we see Masakaki talking to someone to entice them into signing over their futures, you can immediately tell that he’s not of this world due to the uncanny valley effect of his animation. It’s a little stilted, but that just adds to the effect. It’s also a little inconsistent, but not to a majorly noticeable or bothersome degree. There are some shots in the Financial district that look a little odd, but for the most part, the visual effects in this alternate world are stunning, like the slow pixelated dissolves and the digitized action sequences. Don’t get me wrong, the backgrounds and set pieces in the real world are highly detailed, but the interior of the District is immaculate and brimming with creative design, even though I personally didn’t see any big drops in quality to compensate for it. I haven’t seen very many shows that offered such a seemless blend of the two styles, which is pretty impressive considering this show came out in 2011.

The music, composed by Taku Iwasaki, is a bit hard to pin down, and from what I’ve heard, that’s pretty common for his work. That’s not to say C has a bad score, but it can get pretty distracting when you have techno effects in a track that also includes a greek choir. The worst part is probably when he tried to emulate his previous success with the soundtack to Gurren Lagann by including English rap tracks… Yes, actual English… But even though it doesn’t sound like it has any translation issues, it still sounds pretty bad. The opening, Matryoshka by Nico Touches the Walls, is a lot simpler and easy to listen to, although that doesn’t necessarily make it the best track in the series. Is’ a traditional J-rock track with beautiful visuals that depict not only the plot and characters of the series, but the importance of currency throughout the history of humanity and our culture. The closing theme, RPG by School food Punishment (Seriously, how do they come up with these band names?), is more true to form for the series, even though the visuals are a bit bland.

The English dub was produced by Funimation, and since it had a good writer on staff, the apt Monica rial, it’s a pretty damn strong one. Brina Palencia and Todd Haberkorn don’t have that much to do in the main roles of Yoga and Mashu, as they really don’t have to tweak their voices or anything strange like that, with the exception of all the voice effects for battle that they had to do. For the rest of the show, they keep to a grounded and subtle register, and it isn’t until the stakes are raised in the second half of the series that they really have to do anything dramatic, and of course, being seasoned veterans, they’re more than prepared for this. They’re likeable and speak naturally for the remainder, so I really don’t have any complaints about either of them. Far more impressive is J Michael Tatum, playing a veteran entre with a dark past motivating him to some mysterious goal. We get the standard Tatum performance, that sly, smooth voice that’s almost enchanting enough to make an exposition dump sound palatable, but there’s also a barely disguised sense of malice and righteous vengeance lying under the surface.

Much like Brina and Todd, Cherami Leigh doesn’t have much to do, but she’s still perfectly likeable as Yoga’s initial love interest, and while you won’t be expecting much from her, there are dark turns she has to take towards the end, and Cherami portrays it all flawlessly. Monica rial does her Monica Rial thing, and it is of course nice as usual, and Sonny Straight has a lot of fun sliding into the slithery shoes of Takedazaki, a bat-shit crazy information exchange broker. The star of the dub is… Well… Fuck, I really don’t want to talk about this guy again, but it’s Scott Freeman. I remember praising this actor before in Yamada’s first time(the DVD of which he actually autographed for me at a convention), and I’m sure I’ve mentioned him in some other reviews I don’t feel like looking up, but all of that was BEFORE he got arrested for possession of child porn, a charge he plead guilty to. It pains me to say this(but not as much as the fact that I actually shook his hand), but he put on an undeniably solid performance as the otherworldly Masakaki, playing him as a sort of joker-esque fop. Yeah, if you don’t want to have to face the moral dilemma of enjoying the work of a pedophile, stick to the sub. Otherwise, the dub is pretty awesome.

If you’ve heard of this anime, who’s full name is actually C: Money of Soul and Possibility Control(even though Edgy Digimon would have been easier to google), you’re probably aware that it doesn’t have the best reputation. That’s one of the reasons I was wary to try it out, until it was requested by a friend of mine in a roleplay group. Honestly, though, I thought it got off to a pretty good start. It doesn’t take long to realize that this is a concept anime, one that’s built around a central idea, and to it’s credit, that concept is pretty strong. In an alternate plane of existence, specially selected people are given fighting avatars and are able to take control of a secret economy that directly effects that of the real world by letting them both win and lose massive amounts of what might be the world’s most well-disguised counterfeit money. There are a lot of rules that go along with this game, as well as a lot of details, conditions and repercussions, and I had a lot of fun learning about all of it. If you’re going to explain a concept in a story, it’s best to have a cypher character to stand in for the audience, and this was done pretty well.

You can draw a lot of metaphors out of this concept, although I doubt very much of it was intentional. The stock market comparison isn’t a subtle one, but it’s still pretty smart and insightful with how it’s used. You could also draw out an allegory for the temptation of magical solutions over hard work, but if I’m being honest, Key the Metal Idol did this way better, and that was just in a single scene. If you were to REALLY stretch it, you could also draw some comparisons to bitcoin, but that would mostly be for fun, as I highly doubt they had that in mind. It’s not dripping with depth, but it has just enough substance to make the concept feel appealing, and of course all of the action and fight scenes don’t hurt either. The details we’re given about this world are given out at a nice, pleasant pace, even as the series goes to some darker places than you were expecting, and several of the assumptions you’d been making about this world and it’s rules turn out to be disturbingly incorrect. When you first get a glimpse of what happens when someone’s collateral future gets taken away from them is crushing to say the least.

Well, it SHOULD have been crushing, but the lack of impact you’ll feel over it is almost as disquieting as the lack of impact the characters feel about it. The major drawback from focusing so much time and story on the inner workings of the Financial district turned out to be a distinct lack of emotional resonance, part of which is the show’s underwhelming characterizations. The most obvious example of this is the main character Yoga, whose usage as a cypher never really evolves into anything else other than good-guy boy scout who wants to do the right thing. The only interesting element of his character is his frugality, as he takes every opportunity to save his money in order to invest in his future, but this element fades after only a few episodes. His asset is even worse, as she pretty much plays the egregious female role of love-interest-doggy, her entire character revolving around growing more trusting and bonded with Yoga over time, which is a common archetype in anime, but it’s particularly awful here.

Much like Asuna from SAO, whom I also compared to a dog, Mashu’s only defining characteristic is her relationship with a more important male character, but it’s even worse here because she also took a dose of magical girlfriend fluid to the arm. “Master, what is food? What is taste? What’s a kiss? Master, I think I love you!” Yeah, they tried to do a romantic sub-plot for these two, and it’s about as painful as the tsundere vibes between Rika and Renamon would have been if they’d been fully realized and not just hinted at. Yoga does nothing to earn Mashu’s feelings other than bring her a cup of instant noodles, because apparently it’s SO weird for Entres to be nice to their assets. Not only is the evidence for this really weak, but hey, not everyone has an Asset that looks like a half-naked teenage girl. Nobody’s flirting with their ogre and giant wolf Assets, but that doesn’t make you a hero for having a sexy demon to talk to. Oh, and I don’t want to spend much time on this, but the reveal involving her and Yoga’s Dad goes absolutely nowhere.

“Oh,” but I hear you say, “what about Soichiro Mikuni?” Well, what about him? Everything about him, from his motive to his plan, was fucking stupid. We’re given his backstory in the worst possible way, as he dumps a ton of exposition on us, talking to literally us to explain everything, which is lazy and unimaginative at best. I get that his father was being a dick, and that the nature of his dickishness COULD give somebody a cynical attitude towards the economy, but his story honestly feels weakened by the fact that his sister doesn’t actually die… She’s just in a coma, but Mikuni’s attitude is so vengeful it’s like he already lost her. You would think that with all the money he’s making in the district he’d be happy just to use it to keep her on life support and in the best conditions possible in hopes that she’d wake up someday, but no, that’s not what he’s doing at all. Get this: The last thing she said before going into her coma was that she wished this moment could last forever, so his idea is to destroy the future and stop time. Except no, that’s not how time works. Tomorrow is still tomorrow, and shouldn’t sacrificing decades of your future work against the idea of your sister waking up?

Okay, I don’t recall if that’s exactly if that’s how everything went down. I did finish this show way back in… Three fucking days ago. All things considered, I’m surprised I remember as much as I do. You can’t really blame me, though, as this anime goes completely off the rails about halfway through, raising it’s stakes to unbelievable levels that you will literally not believe. Yeah, someone losing their future might make their children disappear, or ruin their friends’ lives, but as an economical crisis begins to loom in the last few episodes, people begin dropping like flies, disappearing into digital nothingness. Their ties to the futures of different Entres pretty much turns them into vaporware. I found a lot of this hard to follow, so it might be my fault for not being smart enough to piece everything together… I’m no economics expert, after all, and a lot of the more important details about the Financial District are left intentionally vague, but there was something that happened towards the end that makes me think I’m not actually mistaken.

For a while, I was planning to look up a detailed explanation of how everything worked, how the ending was built up, what was happening with the money, etc. It couldn’t all be superfluous made-up bullshit, could it? But then I realized that yes, yes it fucking could. Not only do people and buildings start getting erased from reality, but also ENTIRE LAND MASSES. We see a few island countries getting erased from the map… Nothing that exists in our world, of course… But the logic of this is just mind-boggling. So the Financial District was able to alter the geography of the planet? How? Did it add water to fill in the voids left by the land it took? Did the sea levels change? Did the entire history of those land masses dating all the way back to Pangaea get rewritten? Did the prehistoric creatures that roamed them get erased from the fossil record, also erasing anything they evolved into? And hey, why not take away any land-locked countries? Didn’t want to stretch the suspension of disbelief too far?

C: Money of Soul and Possibility control is available from Funimation. You can watch it for free on their website, as well as for a decent price on Amazon as part of the S.A.V.E. collection.

I’d just like to take a moment to once again emphasize that this show did get off to a fairly good start. I could tell right from the beginning that it wasn’t destined for greatness, but it was at least interesting when it wasn’t trying to do anything other than provide a Digimon rip-off with a cool backdrop. Unfortunately, it’s ambition far outpaced it’s brain. It’s biggest problem is easily the fact that it wanted you to think, but it was way better off if you didn’t. The laws of cause and effect are thrown out the window in favor of increased stakes, and if that’s not bad enough, I haven’t seen a main character that was this disconnected from the tragedy they were supposed to prevent since Evangelion. It’s a nice enough looking show, and I did enjoy it for a little while, but at only 11 episodes, I feel like things could have been set up and developed to the point where I could have actually cared about it. As it is, it’s pretty bad, but it’s a unique enough idea that I can understand why people still remember it six years later. It’s just too bad that it lost control of the positive qualities it had. I give C: money of Soul and Possibility Control a 4/10."
18245,"When have we ever seen a love triangle played out correctly? I don't mean like those that are consider ""successful"" because your favorite couple in the triangle won in the end, but an actually good love triangle with a legitimate dynamic and reason to exist. White Album 2 (and yes it is a sequel, but it's a standalone sequel. White Album is not required.) is perhaps the first show to make me actually appreciate the fact that even a love triangle can be done correctly. I can't be the only one who groans audibly when I see the makings of a love triangle in any medium, not just anime. In my mind, it just speaks to lazy writing, because the writer is trying to stir up artificial drama or simply can't decide which couple should be the canon couple. White Album 2 completely subverts this expectation, but more on that in a little bit.

One thing that White Album 2 isn't going to be remembered for is its visuals. It's probably the most okay looking show I've ever seen, even a little bit underwhelming, yet, I can't seem to be upset about it. I think it's because of how little White Album 2 actually needs to lean on its visuals. Of course, if it was animated well and looked beautiful, my score might be even higher, but the fact that it's still in the 80s despite looking just okay is a mark to how good the rest of the show was and that's best illustrated in the soundtrack.

It seems somewhat redundant to praise an anime about music for having good music, because that should be a given right? Well, yes, but White Album 2's soundtrack is nothing short of phenomenal. It seems a little contradictory, but the opening and ending aren't really anything to write home about, in my opinion. The true strength of the music lies in the soundtrack, especially in the title track, White Album, which I'll just put right here:
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJRWaGxB8iw)
This song single handedly convinced me that this show was going to be worth watching. And indeed it was, as this song plays constantly, almost once an episode, but different versions here and there, making it unique and moving no matter when it plays. Of course, there are other inserts that are fantastic as well, but they're not as worthy of getting direct praise like White Album is.

Favorite Character: Kasuza Touma
img(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20170817173308)

I'm not really sure that I need to explain very much why she's my favorite character, White Album 2's narrative shows Touma in the better light in my opinion, but I was also a fan of her from the start so I don't know if I'm just letting my bias talk. There are definitely only three characters that matter in White Album 2 though, even though there are more, they serve essentially no purpose other than to have other people appear in the show. You're either a Touma fan or a Setsuna fan and that's basically what it boils down to. I couldn't help but feel bad for Haruki throughout the show too. He was just trying his best to encourage the two girls to overcome what problems they had while he had a crush on this girl who taught him guitar and then everything comes crashing down around him. It feels almost personal. We essentially feel what he does, the confusion and the desperation as he tries to keep the trio together, while knowing full well that it's not possible after the romantic feelings rise to the surface. Here is where I need to chime in with my ""fuck Setsuna"", because the entire drama is entirely her fault from start to finish, but I'll let you watch White Album 2 and come to the same conclusion.

There's not a lot of substance to White Album 2's story outside of the character drama, which suits it just fine. For only 13 episodes, it achieves what many shows cannot. That would be having a clear direction. White Album 2 had its story to tell and that's exactly what it did. Previously, I criticized Steins;Gate 0 for not having any focus, well, White Album 2 is the exact opposite of that. It focuses exclusively on the trio's relationship, and it's exactly what was needed. Anything else and White Album 2 wouldn't have worked like it did. I have to tip my hat to White Album 2 for not caving and trying to be far broader than it could handle, but simply just telling its story. I would recommend White Album 2 to almost anyone who's interested in romantic dramas and as something of a case study for how to do love triangles. I didn't really touch on it before, so I'll do it now: You have to have a winner chosen from the start when you make love triangles. That's not to say that you make it painfully obvious, but it was clear that Haruki loved Touma more from the way the narrative shaped around the two of them compared to him and Setsuna. It wasn't obvious that it would turn out the way it did, but it was clear the whole time that Haruki knew who he loved more. That's top notch writing if I've ever seen some. I wish that most serious harem shows would take notes."
97730,"I'm just going to say it outright; if anyone is going to remember this anime at all, it will be as Amagami SS's eccentric little sister. The ""eccentric"" part comes from the fact that the story presents some rather bizarre events and quotes, while the ""little sister"" part comes from not only the fact that it not only noticeably comes from the same universe, but a couple of the characters are actually younger siblings of Amagami SS characters! (Let's not forget the omnibus format both series share, too.) In fact, this connection with Amagami SS was why I selected this anime to be among those from the Winter 2017 anime that I watched in the first place; in spite of this decision, however, my expectations were actually quite low. Unfortunately, I was proven right.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my review of Amagami SS's eccentric little sister, ""Seiren"".

Seiren follows the romantic misadventures of Shoichi Kamita, a second-year high school boy. Similarly to Amagami SS, four episodes each cover the heroines that Shoichi ends up romancing, except the number of girls is halved this time. First, we've got Hikari Tsuneki, the cheerful ""idol"" of Shoichi's class with a secret job at a restaurant. Then, we've got Tooru Miyamae, a gamer girl who joins Shoichi and his friends in playing what I've come to think of as ""a deer version of Pokemon"". Finally, we've got Kyouko Tono, Shoichi's childhood friend who just joined the Home Economics Club. As time goes on in each of the girls' arcs, Shoichi becomes closer with either one of these girls and gradually falls in love with her....whether or not he actually has any chemistry with any of them.

What could I possibly mean by that last sentence? I mean exactly what I said; Shoichi does not have very strong chemistry with any of these girls. I mean, when you're creating an anime with this format, it's hard to build a strong connection between our protagonist with all of the girls he gets with, but there's bound to be at least one girl who has a believable relationship with him. Unfortuately, in Seiren, there is none of that; in the best case scenario, I would see Shoichi and the girl whose arc is ongoing as just friends, and that's pretty much it. Each of their stories suffer a bit because of this, too, and when an anime's story is taken down with two characters' chemistry, especially when it's done three times in the same series, we've got ourselves a bit of a problem. Although the story can surprise you with its bizarre ideas at times (for example, there is a character with a real thing for bunnies), it doesn't help too much.

Now, let's discuss the characters. I remember liking Junichi, the protagonist of Amagami SS, a lot, especially since he had what Shoichi didn't: a believable personality. Shoichi, on the other hand, is a rather boring main character with little personality; it's not as easy to root for this guy. The heroines aren't much help, either. While Hikari is definitely the most interesting of the bunch, it really didn't feel like she got a lot of development, so I couldn't get myself to like her. Tooru had potential, but as time went on, she seemed to become less and less of an interesting character; by the end of her arc, I had given up on her. As for Kyouko.... ugh, where do I even begin? Out of all of the heroines - no, out of all of the characters, period - she has to be the character, or at least one of the characters, with the least amount of personality, and I honestly felt that her relationship with Shoichi, as well as her entire arc, was the weakest. Out of the supporting cast, there are a few memorable characters, but most of them are pretty forgettable.

The animation, done by Studio Gokumi, wasn't terrible; sometimes, the movement of the characters was a bit awkward, but for the most part, it wasn't terrible. After all, a particular diamond in the rough from Seiren came from a beautifully-animated scene in episode 4; I won't say what it is because of spoilers, but anyone who has actually watched this series might know what I'm talking about. The voice acting wasn't too bad, either; for the most part, the voice actors played their roles well, although some weren't really as good. The opening and endings themes were also nice to listen to, albeit not songs to listen to over and over again.

Overall, Seiren was a below-average anime. I won't stop you if you're desperate to watch it, but if you're looking for an anime with an omnibus format where the protagonist ends up with more than one girl in more than one alternate universe, I'd prefer that you watch Amagami SS. I mean, let's be honest; it's more memorable than Seiren."
21584,"Whenever I think about Love Live I can think about my whole life so far : highs and lows, happiness and sadness, goals and failures, but most of all I realized one of the most important things in everyone's life, our friends. 
Most of the people when saying the word ""friend"" thinks about someone who likes and spends time with without getting bored, simply someone who fits his ideals or standards.
In my part Love Live made me rework on the actual meaning of this word, and I say ""someone who's there to help you and support you"" or even better ""a brother/sister you never had"". I mean it sounds strange because when we say ""you are my bro/sis"", we say that to a really close person and by saying that I don't want to impose ""my"" version of friend and brother/sister because everyone has his own way to see someone.

How did I come to this?
I don't want to bother you with things about me but I'll sum up everything by saying that I've been feeling ""really bad"" since 1 year because of things. One day I decided to watch Love Live just because there were funny memes and I thought it was funny and hey I made a complete review about School Idol Project so check out here : https://anilist.co/review/9599.
With Sunshine I really understood how valuable are my own friends and how valuable were the friends that are not with me anymore; so now let me tell you the fantastic story about Love Live! Sunshine!!

What I was expecting
I loved School Idol Project so I thought it could've been really hard for me to enjoy this show as the previous one. I was expecting something which could move my feelings and make me experience something really strong

Yes, I know what you are thinking or saying ""Eh but Sunshine is basically the same as School Idol Project with minor changes"" and yep, you're right, I didn't realize that at first watch but then I rewatched it and I saw how similar they both were. But here's something not everyone understood : Aqours were chasing their first dream, µ's, and by chasing they you easily end up on their own steps. You visit the same places, you stay in the same places and you end up in the place they wanted to save : the Akiba Dome. µ's just wanted to make the Love Live something big and important and as they were able to do this you MUST appreciate and enjoy what they left to you.
So yes, the storytelling is basically almost the same, with minor changes and different characters, but it has a whole different matter.

Everything starts with a stupid idea ""I want to be like them"" the first thought for Takami Chika, a normal girl who lives a normal life, is the same thought as many of ours, we all might have someone as a reference for life, I have one which is not with us anymore, and Takami Chika chose a simple idol group. ""They were normal girls doing unique things"", that was her second thought and that's relatable to everyone. We all are a simple person and we all can do unique things. I'm a simple person who can do unique things in what I love, for example I was a star in basketball; 
Chika didn't want to keep her dream just for her and she decided to share this to everyone. Alongside with Chika there's her best friend, Watanabe You, who was really happy to see her friend having a dream and so she decided to join her in this journey.
Then something comes in our life, the moment we feel insecure and we think that we are pointless just because we made some error that are in the past and we cannot focus on our present life, this feeling is Sakurauchi Riko, a girl who moved to Uchiura trying to find herself with this moving away. Riko failed in her biggest dream, that piano contest where she lost beacuse of the stress she had on and so she feels useless and cannot trust herself anymore.
Chika doesn't want this, she just met this girl one day before but she doesn't want to see someone like that. Riko joins, hoping to find what she lost.
As the main trio is born, three girls are attracted by something they never seen, an idol group with simple girls but who do what they love.
Kunikida Hanamaru sees that, Kurosawa Ruby sees that, Tsushima Yoshiko sees that. 3 different girls but so similar.
Hanamaru decided to isolate herself years ago because she was seen as something weird by the other, Ruby decided to isolate herself and being a friend only to Hanamaru because Ruby is scared by the others, Yoshiko decided to isolate herself because she thought the others seen her as something weird. They are so different yet so similar.
Ruby always wanted to be an idol and so Hanamaru helped her to get into Aqours, after that goal she left everything and turned back to her solitude but the girl who always helped now turned the favor back and made Hanamaru join Aqours, in order to find the light she has never seen.
Yoshiko is the type of person who almost hate herself because of her mindset of being trash to everyone's point of view, but once you see the other's real point of view everything changes. And by that, Yoshiko is now happy with the friends she never had.

As a new group is born and old one is suffering because of the past and cannot focus on the present and on what is really important : Matsuura Kanan, Kurosawa Dia and Ohara Mari really need a help. They were close friends but one mistake ended everything and so they ran away, trying to avoid eachother to not hurt the others anymore. Only the light of the memories can help to heal the wounds, and Aqours were the light. The wounds are healed and the 3 girls, who used to hate eachother, now are back toghether once again, trying to obtain what they left. Now they are all together trying to catch a dream like a Young Dreamer.

Aqours need to realize what they really want, in fact they never really tried to catch µ's. µ's were just an imagination of their dream.
After previous failures Chika asked herself what's their real purpose. The question is still there, episode after episode.
Meanwhile they were trying to figure out the purpose they had to face Saint Snow, the other main idol group. 
From enemies they became friends just by understanding the others' desire, as Saint Snow wanted to win the Love Live because it was the last time for Kazuno Sarah the Aqours wanted to win the Love Live to save their school, but is that all? We don't have the answer because it's hard to figure out what you want until you are on the point to lose it.
Once you are about to lose it, or when you lose it, you fully understand what you always wanted and Aqours existed with the only purpose to inspire the others and to cheer the Uranohoshi's girls. In order to cheer them they need to do the one last thing they asked to them : to make their School immortal, so they must win the Love Live because doing so the school will be for ever in the Love Live's story. 
Once you did it all you can finally have the answer, ""Why do I want this? How much am I willing to do that? At what cost?"". The cost was high and they did everything they could, they were willing to do anything : they tried so hard, they ashamed theirselves in front of the adults and the youngs, but they did what's called a Miracle Wave and made themselves unforgettable for ever; They wanted to do this because they wanted to shine for the first time in their life, such an egoist desire which made one of the greatest idol groups ever who led the story of one unknown school, forgotten. But thanks to the Love Live they shown to everyone how beautiful is their Water Blue New World

The three girls from the third year graduate and so they leave Aqours because after obtaining their dream they can finally focus on their adult life while leaving the others behind and waiting for them in that new world. Now there aren't anymore the older ones who were there to help you and so how do you react? You might be confused at first because now you are alone. 
The movie talks for itself : to know what to do when you'll be alone you need to understand yourself, you need to understand the others adn you must understand how is the world; as the mom bird leaves her sons they must learn how to act alone, and so you'll Believe Again in yourself. Once you get it you are now free and you can obtain everything you want and all of these will be forever a Wonderful Stories

Sunshine is a huge step up from School Idol Project to me. In all of SIP I like something like 2 songs in the anime because µ's voices weren't the best for me.
Aqours insted are what I always wanted : powerful songs, good bases, fantastic voices and a perfect coordinations for the lines, truly incredible to my ears.
Of course I cannot say too much about the music because it's subjective and you taste might be different from mine but it's impossible to deny that Aqours' songs are really fantastic

That was my love letter.
I will never be able to fully express what I feel to Love Live because it was such a wonderful experience which I'll never forget. It's incredible how an anime made me realize things that were so simple yet so important : always love who's near you because you'll never know what will happen in the future. 

Never forget who's always there for you

If you disagree with my score, which is understandable, I ask you to read the review, if didn't do that, otherwise it's not a problem. That was just my letter to Sunrise and Love Live with me thanking them.

I like the title of this series. ""The Garden of Sinners"", it's a beautiful and most downright accurate title for this series even though the translation of original title is quite different. (""Kara no Kyoukai"" actually translates to ""the Boundary of Emptiness"") cause in all the 7 films it follows a ""sinner"" in a garden of late 90s Urban Japan filled with murder and blood. And in all the 7 films I watched, this is my favourite movie in the franchise.
Firstly, I'll give a small intro to the franchise and watch order for it.

""Garden of Sinners"" or ""Kara no Kyoukai"" is a film series made by ufotable and written by Kinoku Nasu & TYPE-MOON. Since the movie follows a non-linear storytelling, it can be watched in two different orders.

""It's recommended to watch it in the release order, as the way the creators intended to watch it. Watching in chronological order for a rewatch would be good but not for a first time watch.""
Now, with that aside let's talk about this film; ever cry, never life (Remaining Sense of Pain).


The sinner we follow in this movie is ""Asagami Fujino"". Though I say sinner, she feels a lot like a victim than a sinner. The movie starts in quite the shocking way, as it starts with a rape scene. I was completely taken aback as for why a shocking introduction was made unlike the previous entries but it made sense as the movie progresses cause it really helped to the build the setup for the kind of movie you are going to watch.

Her sin is mindless murder, or to put it in the words of our protagonist ""Shiki"", massacre. It's shown how brutally she murdered the ones that raped her, which is a justifiable reason but she gradually started to enjoy 'twisting' people and butchering them which when she was confronted by shiki, says it's inhumane, making her a sinner.

The main cause of her sin is her ""inability to feel Pain"". She has an abnormal condition where she can't feel pain because her father, feared by her telekinetic abilities, numbs her sense of pain during her childhood, in order to seal off her powers but it just made things worse after her abuse. Later it was revealed that she had a terminal case of appendicitis, which causes an immense pain in her abdomen. Due to her lack of sense of pain, she couldn't grasp that life-threating situation she was in but this pain was triggered i.e., her insensibility of pain is gone when the gang who abused her was about to stab her. At this moment, all her remaining sense of pain caused by her growing appendicitis awakens her abilities that resulted in her twisting everyone of those gang members, into nothing but a mess of flesh & blood except one guy who manages to run away. But Fujino misunderstands her abdomen pain with getting stabbed, when she wasn't actually stabbed. And then she starts to wander around to find that one who escaped, in fear that he might expose her abnormal condition which she hid from others for her whole life.

Pain is one of the way we feel our existence. To not able to feel pain, is mostly like not able to live at all. Fujino hides her insensitivity to pain cause she wanted to look normal. Throughout the entire movie, we sympathize with Fujino for that lack of sense of pain, understands her instability & we don't feel morally obliged when she takes her revenge (some might even cheer for her) but the sad thing is at the end of story, where we see her being the most alive ever, was when she's in her absolute pain, both physically and psychologically. Her abdomen is slowly killing her off, while her guilt of mercilessly massacre and regret is starting to haunt her as she desires to feel, to live, to love and to stay. A very sad situation but wasn't delivered to the fullest because of the pacing problems.

Shiki & Fujino confrontation scenes are some tense moments in the movie but also some of the most interesting moments in the series. Shiki's family expects her to manifest her mystic powers unlike Fujino's family who feared & thought it was unnecessary in the modern world. They have opposite roots yet Shiki's says that, Fujino & her are like two feathers of the same bird. Shiki understands & sympathizes with Fujino's nature but finds it's unforgivable when she crossed the line between murder as an act of self-protection, to massacre, an act of killing just for fun because she stopped being human anymore and Shiki was once also in a similar position as Fujino. Shiki goes after Fujino when asked by Touko, because of a request from a certain client and this client happens to be Fujino's father. She had no slavation to begin with. What do you call something that isn't a human and aimlessly kills others with no salvation? A Monster. Even when the monster is only trying to feel alive & is longing for salvation, in it's own way.

""Remaining sense of Pain"" is a tragic story about willing to live while enduring the pain and my favourite in the whole franchise. Only demerit is that, it can feel like a mess at certain points, due to it's uneven pacing and storytelling method.

The ideologies it raises, beautiful art & animation combined with it's mystical soundtrack and interesting characters, outweighed it's pacing problems and uneven storytelling.

If it hurts you,
! You should've just said so!"

Millennium Actress is a spellbinding film. Satoshi Kon’s second cinematic masterpiece is a harrowing drama that plays with reality and fiction to tell an intricate tale full of powerful twists and turns. In many ways, it’s like a novel, sucking us into their world and forcing us to observe. More than that, it gives us the power to interact with the story in some way, as our interactions both suck us in further and become our only link to reality.

The film features a former star, Chiyoko Fujiwara, and her two interviewers, Genya Tachibana and Kyouji Ida. As they sit down and prepare for filming, our leading lady invites us and these two men into a life story so mesmerizing it takes on a life of its own, blending and camouflaging reality with the eight fictions that embodied her life as she starred in them. We along with these men are mere witnesses to the tale that unravels before us, as everyone is suddenly thrown from her true story to her work and back again, and both life and art begin to imitate one another. Everyone enveloped in her story act in different ways. Genya enacts some of the roles with her, fully immersing himself in her films as both an avid fan and loyal crew member of her works. Kyouji reacts with bewilderment, often taking shots at his superior and cohort, and remarking on the absurd situations behind his camera. The former becomes the immerser, the latter becomes the spectator. We, the audience, become both. We witness and take part in every scene, even those they only hear instead of enter. At the same time, there are moments where only they can interact with her, namely when an outside force disrupts her, including her own vulnerability.

You see, she is dying. On top of that, she is mournful. Her life and stardom were built on a promise that could never come true. An injured man showed her a key, one she would bestow upon herself after having found it in the ground soon after. The man lived, for a time, but she would never see him again. All he left behind are a key and a painting, the latter of which she only knew about years later. Not even a glimpse at his face was left for her. Her career, which was ever so reminiscent of the life she led as a result, was predicated on a childlike fantasy, one where she would meet him again and proclaim her love for him. Only late in life, divorced from industry, does she recognize this. It wasn't the man's death that taught her this, for the man who killed him told the person who would interview her, and he kept it a secret until the very end. Instead, it was reality that did this to her. The old, spiritual hag that cursed her to wander in one of her roles, and the excitement and questioning from other children, were what killed the child that propelled her through the industry for so long. The old and jealous misled her constantly, and the young teased her just as much. After eight movies, once both had gotten to her, she knew she was done. Perhaps the films she starred in embodied her life too well.

It isn't just the narrative that pulls us into this picture. Satoshi Kon's masterful cinematography and the powerful, blistering chaos he instructed the team at Studio Madhouse to emphasize in every scene immersed us even further. Minor details add a sense of urgency to every scene, and hint at what's truly going on, creating a tremendous sense of rewatch value. Considering the film's gorgeous use of sepia tone in its backstory, which not only evolves with the narrative, but was actually done manually, add further layers to this rich tale. Susumu Hirasawa's electrifying score added further weight to this sense of depth and rewatcability, and I can't even begin to do either of these two factors enough justice. Every single one of these factors intersects into this whirlwind spinning us and Chiyoko's interviewers around, forcing us to act and react upon every new twist and turn thrown our way. It's immersion as powerful and intricate as the tale itself. Only towards the end does our puzzle fully reveal itself. Only at the end do we know what happened at the final scene of Chiyoko's last film, one that Genya is forced to pause and rewind so he can meet her and learn of her life's story. Only then does Chiyoko's life end, understanding that the fantasy that kickstarted and embodied her life didn't really matter after all. The physical and metaphorical key was only there to unlock her purpose, not some ending where she and her love lived happily ever after.

4282,"Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen (Paradox Paradigm) review

""Araya what do you seek?""
""True Wisdom""
""Araya where do you seek it?""
""Only within myself""
""Araya where are you trying to reach?""
""That's obvious. To the end of this paradox spiral of a world.""

The fifth installment of the Kara no Kyoukai series takes an different approach compared to it's earlier chapters. This time not only the movie is longer (almost 2h), it has changes in it's direction and storytelling. Using gimmicks that show us just how talented the staff at ufotable truly is.

Before delving deeper into the review i wanted to point out that i have read all Kara no Kyoukai novels. I already knew what i was getting myself into and that this movie would adapt in my opinion the best chapter in the whole franchise. 

This movie takes place roughly around two months after the event of Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan fuukei (Overlooking View). It is split into two arcs (Shiki's and Mikiya's) that take place around the same time. 

Shiki's arc begins with a boy named Tomoe Enjou, who is saved from a group thugs by Ryougi Shiki. He claims to have committed parricide, she then allows him to use her residence as a hideout. Few days later Tomoe is shaken to discover that his mother is alive, even though he is convinced that he killed her. Then they go the newly constructed Ogawa apartment complex where he committed the murder to uncover the truth.

Mikiya's arc begins with him investigating a tip that his associate Touko Aozaki receives regarding the murder at the Ogawa apartment complex. Mikiya takes interest in Tomoe Enjou and decides to investigate him further. Which makes him discover the disturbing and cruel truth about that unique apartament complex.

Each entry in Kara no Kyoukai always had a small cast, but this time the amount of important characters is noticeably bigger. The main characters are given their own spotlight which makes them not one-dimensional. The returning trio: Ryougi Shiki, Kokutou Mikiya and Aozaki Touko. As well the newly introduced Tomoe Enjou. This chapter's antagonist is Araya Souren who was apparently an colleague/associate of Touko. Sadly i can't go into full depth as to why he's an amazing villain since it I would have to go into the spoiler territory, but his characterization and motives make  him a great character. I mean he's voiced by Kirei (Fate/Stay Night) so you already know what to expect.

The music in Kara no Kyoukai is phenomenal. It is arranged by none other than Yuki Kajiura so you already know that you're in a feast. I instantly bought the full soundtrack. I consider it not only to be one the best works by her, but i could even argue it's one of the best in any anime i've seen. As well the ending song ""sprinter"" by Kalafina is so epic that it enhances the experience even more.

From the technical standpoint Kara no Kyoukai 5 doesn't disappoint. From the amazing studio ufotable it is no shock that the movie looks amazing and that the animation is consistent and for it's time still looks better than most of the stuff coming out nowadays.

At the beginning of the review i said that the movie uses gimmicks that shows just how amazing at film making is the director. Kara no Kyoukai 5 felt different compared to it's earlier installments due to it's visual presentation/techniques.The director wanted to convey the feeling of paranoia and spiral-like effect. To give a drier and more mundane feel, film grain was added alongside giving the film a more orange hue, the camera was pulled back to create greater distance with the viewer, as well repetition of the scenes and changing the order of the events.

Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujen Rasen is a movie which i deeply love and for any nasuverse fan it was an amazing gift. From it's direction to storytelling and characterization. I consider it to be the best adaptation of any nasuverse work to date.

6500,"There's something that's just so hypnotic about this show, whenever I watch it I enter this weird cozy yet hyped mood where I feel like nothing in the world exists other than me and this stupid ass show,.

Maybe it's because of the crazy mix of all these different genres and ideas in it such as action, superpowers, sofcore porn, comedy, romance, religion, high school, adventure, alchemy, magic, boob sucking, gothic loli and gothic loli sucking boobs.

It has all of that and more yet it still says absolutely NOTHING about any of them. Instead they're used to make this show as absolutely batshit insane as possible to the point where there's literally not a single dull moment in the whole show. It's the definition of joy and fun, whether those feelings come from seeing the many hype fight scenes or just a boobs shot. 

Not every show should be a deep commentary on our human society or some shit, sometimes you need to just chill the fuck up and enjoy a ride like this, and I'm not saying ""turn your brain off to enjoy this"" that's just stupid. I'm saying that you should probably see it how the creators intended it to be seen, and a lot of people just don't know what this shit is all about.

It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously, there's little to know exposition, I think some things are just left unexplained because that would take too long and it'll drag down the show's fact pacing that make it so fun to watch, villains are as cheesy and evil (and sometimes hot) as they can be, the fanservice is EVERYWHERE, there's always at least a pair of boobs that's bouncing around on screen for no reason at all sometimes, and they all look damn good, all the fanservice looks good and it's actually legitimately sexy in this show (it's weird how uncommon that is in this medium that's all about fetishes) 

As much as as the fanservice is unjustifiable, the show still presents it with ZERO shame and that's just fucking great, it means that the guys who made it know know exactly what this show is and don't try to make it more than that but instead focus on what they should focus on, and they ended up with this awesome self aware fanservice ""trash"" that is way more fun to watch than probably any other piece of media.

Should be clear by now but in case someone doesn't bother to read all of the shit up there:

If you're easily offended by fanservice or want to get more than just enjoyment out of it then get da frick outta here stupiiiiid, this ain't for u 

If you want an extremely fun show that just doesn't give a fuck then go ahead, there's no better choice. I think it's one of the most underappreciated shows ever.

Unveiling what’s hidden beyond the resident’s door and rearranging the contents and the clutter in an attempt to convey what comprises man (as a social creature) and their behavior in the face of life’s inevitable challenges collectively spread throughout functional entities in an attempt to give us an orb of knowledge focused on relationship and identity as a utility meant to be wielded for the neverending path to growth is what Kokoro Connect wishes to impart. Each and every phenomenon is geared to entertain the antagonist, Heartseed, by throwing the club members into an array of supernatural messes which gives them license to basically each other’s lives and we, the viewers, privy to the sensitive sides of high schoolers. As a result the characters were quite literally forced to confront their most pressing issues, many highly private, in front of everyone else. Everyone pulls through in the end and comes out a more fortified version of themselves as overcoming obstacles usually does.

But what if what doesn’t kill us just hasn’t killed us yet?

To feel weakness is painful enough, but showing it, especially having it dragged into the spotlight against one’s will, is debilitating. People are so immersed in putting on an act as if life is all starlight while burying the ashes of failures and disappointments that being vulnerable, which deviates from the norm, takes courage. At the same time, there are those who are empathetic enough to absorb the curse of pain just by being aware that everyone is going through something–ample reason to try their best to not be a burden by breaking the hard-earned air of lightheartedness through sharing a problem and asking for help. Leaked miasma will only serve to dampen the stage. Being out of script will only offend the creators. So keep your guard up as high as your smile, most especially in front of the people who care about you. Don’t be sad when loving eyes are there, keep that shit for when you’re alone. It’s out of their hands. It’s not their duty to help you.

Especially if the person is you.

Has the guilt sunk in yet? Playing the part of a human being under society’s rules so badly it’s laughable, not having Herculean endurance to keep up the act, inching closer to surrender from the boulders on our shoulders, is not something that should be seen from us–we are locked doors with gilded exteriors for a reason. Our expense is life’s profit–it is the truth of the universe. Such is the inner workings of a people pleaser tragically programmed to view life without self-love, without care for the self who lives the given life.

Michi Random was everything I ever wanted from Kokoro Connect. From the start, Iori’s friction of her identity resonated with me strongest and I was disappointed that it never had any magnification until the curtain call of the season. Whereas everyone stands on firm feet on the ground due to their confidence, nay, absence of issues on their identity, Iori floats through everyday life like a phantom with an empty husk. Certainty in one’s own agency ultimately dictates our confidence in survival. Iori does not have that, which is why Inaba remarked from the very first phenomenon that she is the most threatened by all of this. Why, she eventually and inevitably broke down like a robot low on fuel, resembled Heartseed’s emotionless demeanor, and became dead exhausted in this special. Let’s recount how each phenomenon affected Iori.

1. Body Swapping: A degree of worry of the club members learning of her family situation. Confronted with self-disappointment after not being able to see through Yui’s fear of men when all she is certain of is her ability to read people. Shared her trauma to Taichi against her will yet put her trust in him with an agreed promise which he broke right after. Heard that she’d die instantly right after the glimpse of hope she’s seen after all these years due to a play on fate orchestrated by Heartseed.
2. Unleashing of Desires: Extreme caution from the possibility that her true thoughts would be seen. With what we know of her by the end of Michi Random, I’ve come to believe that Iori has exercised colossal discipline to prevent that from happening. From my memory, I don’t recall any seriously negative outbursts from her, an exception from everyone. Her admonishing of Inaba discounting their friendship together seemed to imply that Iori indeed possessed genuine love for their bond. With that in mind, Iori has exploited a weak spot of the second phenomenon by overriding desire with self-control (something which Aoki believes to be possible), which must have taken great pains.
3. Time Regression: Relived the point in time where she had to carry the whole family because of her abusive father. Faced her fragility by involving the club with her family problems. Declined the chance to redo her life even if all she ever thought of it was a big mistake on her part. Casted doubts about her relationship with Taichi.

For a people-pleasing person with a cracking sense of identity who’s had to keep her chin up like everyone amidst the troubles they’ve been through, it comes as no surprise that Iori completely “changed” after knowing that they’re encountering another phenomenon, especially one that snatches their inner thoughts for others to know, now without control unlike the unleashing of desires. An infiltration to the mind, selective at that. Closer and closer everyone will come to know just how exhausted Iori is and what she truly feels, and how Iori is actually a prisoner of her own hazy self.

Therefore I find it within the realm of reason (inside the sphere of fiction which takes emotional reactions to the next level) every action Iori undertook. Take off the mask and just not exert effort in upholding the cheery and agreeable atmosphere everyone loves and deserves. Be true to one’s own frustrations no matter the thorns it leaves after every footstep. Be tired, set boundaries, be contrary to what’s “fake”. Be annoyed that your friends can’t see past your act and constantly question your credibility; be annoyed that the ones whom you’ve shared your trauma with can’t even understand your behavior–here I note Taichi and Inaba constantly telling her “This isn’t you, where is the Iori we all know?” when God knows that Iori explicitly shared to her the foundational explanations. In that manner, I felt that the group is liable for further igniting Iori’s explosion just because of shoving into her face (minus the emotion transmission) that how she’s acting is as if she’s not Iori, not even leaving that out when put into spoken words.

But, well, it’s true. She doesn’t know how to act like the Iori that is not a caterer of people’s needs. And it isn’t the group’s fault that she’s been pushed to the brink, it’s Heartseed’s for involving them in his social experiment for plain entertainment (awful motives for someone unexplained btw). She’s already afraid of losing herself from the first phenomenon alone; she thought she could also face life head-on after seeing everyone do the same over the course of the season, especially at the end when she felt for herself the power of true friendship. But then it’s happening once again, it’s whittling against her once again, the onslaught persists and she has no control over her own person once again. The extreme circumstances are stretching Iori’s sense of identity thin when life has given her more than she could take at a set period. What all of this has come to is Iori being further taken away from her rights as the writer of her own story when it’s recently just been a higher being’s indulgence which blurs her originality.

Problems do not go away that easily. They linger like bacteria despite the strongest solution. The diamond trust built up within the group can sometimes have the opposite effect, wracking up guilt in Iori’s own helplessness instead. Taichi’s alright, Aoki’s alright, Inaba’s alright, even Yui is seeing a miraculous recovery from a phobia. Only Iori had something left clearly unsolved, something so simple and overlooked until Inaba made it visible: that her life is her life, and she can do anything she wants with it. What this ultimately means is that,

Nagase Iori is the author of her story.

She recoils at the thought of something so simple. Truth is not easy to register even when it comes right at you and even if it benefits you, when you’re used to subjecting yourself to the whims of others, it’s hard to accede to the thought of freedom, kind of like a case of Stockholm Syndrome. And a simple, tiny truth against a towering, lifelong plight? It’s something unheard of! (And here I note Inaba’s body switch conclusion where problems become trivial when shared.) Despite that, she made a decision to heed her friend’s words and held onto perhaps the only thing that was certain was hers even before her rebirth: Iori’s connection with the Cultural Research Club members. Through this, Iori can finally be conscious of her innate ability to write out her own character as she fits and make it something genuine for her identity. To fill any missing space, allow time to be a companion in weaving any suitable origins or developments.

And it’s beautiful that in the end, Iori’s movements follow her lively personality, which shows that deep inside she isn’t a cynic nor was she ever a mere fabrication and an actress that fulfills the wishes of her surroundings, echoing Taichi’s words on the bridge telling her that all that she’s showing is indeed a part of her real self.

Kokoro Connect: Michi Random wraps up the series with a human being’s discovery of who she truly is: a person, one who can carve her own future and write her own tale with the support of the people to whom she shares mutual love with, people which, take note, are not perfect in the slightest. Together they have bested Heartseed’s ploys and colored their school year with 15 years' worth of growth.

With a talented set of voice actors, the series has been brought to life with brimming emotions that actualize the essence of the intense drama. How it all played out was perfectly fine to me for I see consistency in Iori’s character writing which isn’t really perplexing at all, along with the rest of the cast. Speaking of, bar Inaba, they remain like bland supporting characters due to the difference of treatment they had from the two girls. Not even Taichi was blessed with dimensional characterization. As for my comment on Kokoro Connect’s aesthetics lacking compelling attractiveness in the 13-episode package, I found no repeated problems in this OVA as they appropriately conducted facial expressions, atmospheric weight, pacing, and sound with appealing intelligibility.

For an encompassing statement, since reviews practically need one by convention, Kokoro Connect: Michi Random was a powerful presentation heeding the tense atmosphere of severed bonds and the pains of reuniting with one’s self and others, exhibiting the meaning of friendship anime-style, although not fully carrying the wisdom of past phenomena, yet directed with substance nonetheless.

In the end, what does Kokoro Connect comment on humans? That we are creatures helpless against life’s challenges when faced on our own. Manifestations of our shadows can and perhaps should be permitted proper disclosure to the people we wholly trust as it is proven that they can understand, simple as that. Lest we break down and explode due to testing our capacity, it’s healthier for everyone involved to just release it. We only have one life after all, better make use of it taking up space with authenticity–for how could it be called living in reality when we’re not living real?--and mind for what’s relevant that needs to be imparted whether that be lessons of trust, kindness, an ear or an eye or a voice, or a virtuous promise.

So cherish your bonds, write your own story, and then you will see that hearts connect naturally.

3470,"Nostalgic. I remember when my three older sisters watched this anime on our local TV, in their teenage years. I was 6 or 7 years old back then and we enjoyed it. For them, that anime was so romantic. Even though I'm an adult now, I still found these romantic feelings for this show still lingering inside my heart. High school was probably the best year that happened to me.

Special A is another romantic comedy shoujo anime in my collection. This anime seems old because it was released in 2008. But this is one of those underrated romantic gems that everyone can enjoy. I didn't understand why my older sisters loved this but now I knew why. It may be a typical shoujo romance anime, but this is ridiculously romantic and fun.

The premise is about the two childhood friends and Hikari, the main protagonist/heroine wants to beat Takishima Kei because he's the first one who beat her. Even after many years, she attends a prestigious high school and joined the Special A-Class, to beat Takishima. But, she always loses to him in academics and athletics. She always carried the name of ""Miss Second Place"", the name labeled by Takishima. Thus, their everyday lives begin with their co-members of the SA class. 

The story is light-hearted and funny, as expected from a shoujo demographic. It's not that different from other romantic shows, but this is unique in its ways. Some parts were episodic but it's connected to the central story and development of the characters. The slapstick humor among the members of the SA class is great, especially the shenanigans of the characters. It never fails me to smile many times when I watched it and I never got tired of it. It showed the side stories about the characters and it was pretty good. 

The chemistry between Kei and Hikari was cute and funny. It's like a love story between a tsundere and a numbskull, and the formula mixture of the romance and its type of comedy made the show more enjoyable. Many parts were cliched but I couldn't help but smile because of it. It's not perfect but it's so unique and special.

The characters were hilariously cute. I liked the chemistry between Kei and Hikari, and Akira and Tadashi. The other characters were likable and funny. Aside from that, the development of the characters was good. Kei found his happiness around him, especially in his harboring feelings for Hikari. He was a cold prince but throughout the series, he learned how to become sweet and protective of others. Hikari was a numbskull but she learned her new true feelings for Kei and her friends. Akira overcame her trauma by finding new friends, and her relationship with Tadashi. Even the other characters, found their true happiness and formed strong bonds within the SA class.

The animation was good, as expected from the collaboration of AIC and Gonzo. It's not that kind of superb like the modern ones because it was released back then. It's perfectly good for the series and I liked it. Especially when the romantic or heartwarming scenes come, the animation turned into like a painting or whatever. Overall, the designs were good and the animation was good also.

The sound was so heartwarming. It's sad when I couldn't get the soundtrack but it fits every scene. It reminds me of every retro romance anime and it couldn't get out of my mind. The music in every scene resonated inside me and made my heart fluffy. The OPs and EDs were good also, as well as the voice actings. Jun Fukuyama did a great job on how to portray a cold yet sweet prince. 

Overall, it was great and fun to watch. I enjoyed this anime, despite it being just 24 episodes. I wished the anime was longer but the manga was worth it. Some parts were boring but I'll let that one slide. If you want a great romance and hilarious anime, this is for you. The anime was so romantic and it will capture your heart, by the time you watch this."
329,"Planetes is an uncommon find in science fiction anime, where the focus isn't on warfare, aliens or mecha with a setting of outer space, but rather where the focus is on outer space itself and how it affects the people inhabiting it. This isn't a dismissal of those common elements of sci fi anime, I love those things, but from the get-go Planetes really stands out as being unique. However, it isn't a great anime simply  because its different, its great for a whole host of other reasons  as well as being different.

 (As a side note, I haven't read the manga so I won't address how accurate an adaptation it is, nor do I know what exactly is different about it, but from what I understand the anime deviates a fair amount.)

 Story 9/10
The setting of Planetes is the near future of 2075, after humanity has taken its first steps into outer space and some years after a tragic disaster involving space debris. As a result, 'space garbageman' became a career.

The main characters of Planetes are Ai Tanabe and Hachirota 'Hachimaki' Hoshino, two employees of Technora, a debris collection company. Aside from the main two, Planetes has a fairly large cast. Most notable are other members of the cleanup crew Fee and Yuri, Technora control support Claire and Hachimaki's friend/rival Hakim. As the names would suggest, the cast is very diverse in nationality and background and for quite a few characters it plays a big role in their development. For others, characterization is informed by other plot and story elements and the show does a great job of developing many of them, despite the sheer number.

  img500()

The best part of Planetes though isn't the characters, but the world building. For the first half of the series episodes consist of mainly stand-alone stories that the crew encounter about different aspects of space life, such as living in low gravity, being away from Earth or being part of humanity's rapid space development. These stories are all pretty interesting and are sometimes upbeat and comedic, sometimes sad and sometimes both. Through the slice-of-life-esque stories it simultaneously sets the foundation for what's to come in the latter half and provides a comprehensive look at the most feasible future setting I've come across in the medium, adding information piece by piece to slowly reveal its world's current state of affairs. Following a lot of the story from Tanabe's perspective allows a bunch of details about the technology and how it works to be explained naturally without feeling like infodumps and details like space radiation, proper vernier usage and why the suits use cameras instead of the usual transparent visors really help to make the world feel real.

Around the halfway mark, things begin to take a turn story-wise as the episodic format shifts pretty suddenly into a more linear storyline that focuses heavily on Hachimaki's character and a more serious plot. It also has a significantly heavier tone than the optimistic first half, perhaps due to the switch in character perspective. I found this to be pretty jarring at first but as the story progressed I found that, while the change was sudden, it was definitely not unprecedented as many story points resurfaced after previously appearing in some form or another. I'm still unsure how I feel about the change; by the end I enjoyed it and thought the drama was well handled for the most part, but I did definitely miss the feel of the first half.

Even though they aren't the main thematic element, Planetes tackles a lot of ideas that aren't often tread upon in anime such as poverty, economy, terrorism, the value of life and aspirations and the cost of humanity leaving Earth and for that I commend it. It also interestingly suggests that exploring space might be bad for the human race. This especially took me off guard as I was expecting it to glorify the new frontier and capture the feeling of excitement of wanting to explore space (which it does do, fantastically). But then it also shows the bad side, how space development affects Earth and it's inhabitants and the fact that humans weren't built for such a harsh environment. It creates a very interesting and unique dynamic of juggling the desire to explore space with the desire to not destroy yourself and the Earth.

  img500()

I found the ending to be pretty good. Everything wraps up in a way that makes sense, there are some really memorable scenes (Tanabe especially has some really great scenes near to the end) and the romantic subplot reaches a surprisingly solid conclusion.

Overall, I'd say Planetes' story is the biggest draw to it as it combines good, enjoyable characters and interactions with an interesting story and a whole load of interesting concepts and ideas and then wraps it all up nicely leaving pretty much no loose ends.

 Visuals 8/10
Unfortunately, Planetes is a bit hit-or-miss concerning the animation. For most of it, Sunrise did a good job with some really nice character animation. Other times, animation quality can be pretty sub par. Sometimes a character will float through zero-g dynamically with their clothes reacting correctly, while other times a static image of a person will slide lifelessly across the frame. There is also some awful off-model scenes, though these are pretty rare. It's not the worst out there and its not often, but the inconsistency definitely detracts from the overall visuals.

  webm(https://a.pomf.cat/exmtaw.webm)
  Sunrise Smooth

On the upside, the character design hits a nice balance between being 'cartoony' and 'realistic' and it manages to never feel out of place, even with the wide variety in tone. Mechanical design is fantastic, everything looks believable and fitting in its setting and are often explained well. Yuriko Chiba's character designs are also fairly unique and it gives the show a recognizable look and easily distinguishable characters. The only issue I have with character design is how late 90s/early 00s everyone looks. While it makes sense considering when it was made, it does date the series a bit and is especially strange considering it's future setting. Similarly, as with most early 2000s anime the show has not aged particularly well unfortunately.

 Sound 8/10
Sound design in Planetes is really great, with the silence of space often being used really effectively. All the sound effects of the suits and the ships are great and the soundtrack is fitting, with some really good tension building tracks and a lot of pieces that help emphasize the emptiness of space.

The opening for the series is absolutely fantastic. Aptly named 'Dive in the Sky', it perfectly captures the feel of wanting to explore space. The visuals are mostly character portraits interspersed with highlights of humanity's quest to reach space and coupled with the music it makes a perfect way to set the tone for the series. 

The Japanese dub for the series is top-notch, all the voices fit the characters and are easily distinguishable. Tanabe and Hachimaki in particular have a lot of character in their voices; Hachimaki sounds unrefined and kind of dumb and Tanabe's VA really gets across the naivete of her character. The English dub unfortunately isn't as good, with a really horrible casting for Hachimaki. Where he should sound strong or tough he often sounds whiny and the voice just isn't a good fit for the character, which is a shame since the rest of the English cast do a pretty good job, especially Fee and Yuri.

 Overall
Planetes creates a great world with a great story, some great looking animation and sound design. Occasionally it stumbles a bit in each category but its never enough to ruin the experience and the show itself is unique and memorable enough to make up for it."
10029,"In many ways, Goro Miyazaki's career is actually far more interesting that his father's, if perhaps less influential. You see, Goro actually graduated with a degree in Landscape Agriculture, and never wanted to get into animation or directing, and yet due to the massive influence of Hayao Miyazaki, he was convinced to get into the career. He was reluctant as hell, and (supposedly) this shows in his first movie, the Tales of Earthsea. Now, he actually does direct TV anime for Polygon, and appears to truly shine in doing that. So Poppy Hill poses itself as something very unique, as a bridge between being persuaded (with an awful lot of effort) to direct anime, to actually approaching the medium willingly. Though, Hayao Miyazaki did write the script and you can really tell.

The OST is something I'd like to focus on here, as it was both wonderful to listen to and pretty thematically brilliant in regards to the setting and story. The soundtrack is comprised of two major styles of music. The first is smooth jazz, and the second is 20s(?) style French music. The anime is set just before the Tokyo Olympics and this is important in this sense, as it represents Japan finding its place in the world post-Meiji. Jazz does a wonderful job at portraying this as the anime is about retaining the past with the historic Latin Quarter Club House - it is a perfect contrast between finding a new place and moving forward while also retaining what brought Japan to this point, and it further draws parallels with Umi's character arc in the movie.

On a base level the narrative is nothing special. It is simply following Umi Matsuzaki as she discovers the community centred around the utterly neglected Latin Quarter in her school. This perhaps isn't what is important as the movie focused greatly on the characters, primarily Umi and Shun Kazama. Their dynamic is cute as hell and their arcs are both depressed and uplifting, there is a surprising amount of ""melodrama"" made to feel oddly believable, likely due to how grounded the entire movie is. !The reveal that Shun may be Umi's sibling was devastating for them, and also for me to some degree. Umi's unbending feelings and her struggles to reject them was particularly believable and I feel it portrayed this in a way that a teenager who had just come to this revelation might do.!

Ultimately this misfortune is overcome, and the misunderstanding is dealt with wonderfully. Yet again, we are treated to something quite realistic here, as it was a major misunderstanding that made complete sense. !The Success of the students! and the positivity of the film as a whole was a wonderful experience, coupled with the sense of nostalgia that the visuals and OST created this created a feeling of comfort and perhaps belief in people and hard work.

I do have a few nitpicks however. The first would be the beginning of the movie being somewhat boring. This should be expected really, as this quite literally a Slice of Life in the sense that it's just some people living their life - the major conflict in the movie is pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things after all. This did make the movie somewhat difficult to get into, but once it got going there was much to appreciate. The second issue I had was incredibly minor, but it was the misplacement of a certain scene. !Seeing Umi's father's ship sink! in the middle of the meeting really broke the pace of the scene, and was a sequence that should have been shown earlier when Umi explained what had happened to Shun.

From Up On Poppy Hill produced an incredibly nostalgic narrative and setting that made me feel like I myself was involved in the drama and conflict. The combination of OST and beautifully crafted characters made for deep investment in a standard conflict, giving one of the most heart warming experiences I've had in a movie in a long while."

-title card at the very end of the series.

For a series that technically starts with a bus hijacking, you could be forgiven from assuming from its first episode that PUNCH LINE is a fun, loose, FLCL-inspired romp about a teenage boy who gains superpowers upon seeing panties, and is knocked out of his body and into the past as a ghost to right some great evil or another. It's kind of a weird premise but at first blush, a bit of an aping, and nothing on-the-surface special. This is half true, but there's a lot more to PUNCH LINE than merely a pastiche of one of the greatest anime ever made. There's a lot to PUNCH LINE in general, really. How else would you describe a series that starts as a fanservice-laden action-comedy, digs into a rabbit hole of conspiracy paranoia and time travel loops, and then dovetails into an excellent superhero show in its final two episodes? 

Really if PUNCH LINE has a major flaw it's actually that it tries to do too much in its short runtime (just the standard single-cour twelve episodes. No more, no less), and its many moving parts lead to a bit of clash. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here, what exactly is PUNCH LINE? The simple answer is that it's a MAPPA-made (Yuri on Ice!!, Kakegurui, Teekyuu) animation that seems to have kind of arisen from nowhere. Directed by Yutaka Uemura, a man whose credits in the industry are sparse (and since PUNCH LINE ended, have included only the adaptations of the utterly noxious Tanya The Evil franchise), and written by Kotaro Uchokishi, an unknown within the anime industry but responsible for a good deal of video game writing outside of it (most famously, he is the writer behind Nine Hours Nine Persons Nine Doors), there is precious little to be found online, at least in English, as far as what prompted PUNCH LINE being made, so its origin is something of a minor mystery. My own best guess is that it may have been put forward to ride the wave of renewed interest in Daicon-lineage anime prompted by the success of Kill la Kill (not unlike the contemporary Rolling Girls), but a guess it remains.

Regardless of the why, the what of PUNCH LINE can be cleanly separated into the story's two major acts. In the first, Yuta--our protagonist--is knocked out of his body, and into the past, after essentially going super saiyan and overpowering a terrorist during a bus hijacking. How did he power up like this? Well, he saw one of his fellow passenger's panties. 

img880()
yes that is really why this happens



Again, you could be forgiven for thinking that this show is exactly as screwball as it seems on the surface, but this actually does go somewhere. The first six episodes of the series revolve around Yuta's ghost attempting to avert the end of the world, to be caused by an Illuminati-like organization called the Qmay Group, who wish to destroy the planet via asteroid strike, and start human society anew. Thus, the first half of the series is a blend of Yuta trying to solve the mystery of how this is going to happen in the first place and thus try to stop it (with the ""help"" of a snarky cat spirit Chiranosuke), and some character development for the remainder of the cast. Going over every in and out of the residents of Korai House--where Yuta lives, and now, haunts--would take a lot of time, but in brief, these characters are; Mikatan, an idol who moonlights as the magical girl Strange Juice, Meika, her manager both in idol and hero life (who turns out to be a robot in the first of many, many plot twists), Ito, a shut-in with a pet bear cub who was bullied out of her school after she was seen being driven home by a teacher, and Rabura; an unlucky-in-love fake medium with a gyaru look about her. Lastly there is Kenji, a mysterious super sentai-style masked superhero with powers similar to Mikatan's, but he is something of a special case. 

img880()
oh and Ito dies at one point. Don't worry, it sticks for about ten minutes.



Each of these characters gets enough fleshing out, often via flashbacks interlaced with narratives in the here and now, that when the shit hits the fan in the series' second act, you genuinely worry for all of their safety. Yuta, notably, observes these narratives but due to his nature as a spectre, is not really a part of them. This, as it turns out, is by design, as it's also in this second act that the plot starts to tie itself into knots, for both good and bad. The very, very broad stroke is that Kenji turns out to be Yuta from the future, and at the end of the sixth episode, Yuta actually fails to prevent the end of the world, and with the help of ""Kenji"", he goes back in time once again. Everything resets to the beginning of the series, and Yuta--now in possession of his body once again--makes a second pass at staving off the end of humanity, this time in an active and present way, and despite the pesterings of Chiranosuke, who tries to insist that he repeat his past actions almost exactly.

This doubling back on the narrative lets PUNCH LINE pull off an interesting trick. Things that seemingly made no sense the first time around are given additional context on the second, and it's here that the show starts foregrounding the mystery element (even as the comedy remains a constant throughout most of the episodes). We're introduced to the idea of uberfication (the super mode that several characters have), the virus that causes it, the motives of the Qmay Group, secret lab facilities and body-swapping. Yuta is even revealed to ""biologically"" be a girl (rather: his male soul has been swapped into a woman's body, it's complicated. As an aside, the show should be praised here for not making this into the subject of much jest or angst. The only person who really gives him any shit about it is Meika, who comes around eventually. It's no progressive masterpiece, but this is the sort of thing it's very easy to get wrong). This style of storytelling--revelation on top of revelation and twist on top of twist--is undeniably not to everyone's taste, but the rapid clip makes every episode count--PUNCH LINE has zero filler--and by the time the show is in its 11th hour (starting in the 11th episode natch), you're seriously rooting for the characters. Here, PUNCH LINE flips again, into a straight-ahead superhero show. The residents of Korai House become Justice Punch, and each plays a part in taking down a joint attack on the house by the US Army, The JSDF, and a battalion of supersoldiers called W's, all controlled by The Qmay Group. There's a real super robot feel especially to Ito's scenes, where she pilots a squat mecha created by Meika, her piloting ability hilariously being attributed to her skill at mecha sim video games.

img880()
more shows should have a side character kick ass in an orange robot in the penultimate episode




The ending is maybe a touch predictable. There is a heroic sacrifice--Yuta, or at least an incarnation of him, dies. To save the main villain no less--but life goes on for the surviving members, and Rabura, now somewhat inexplicably a genuine medium, is able to commune with his spirit.

PUNCH LINE's story, both in a literal and meta sense, could've ended there. Spectacularly though, this bizarre, underrated lovechild of FLCL and Zero Escape has managed to spawn a tiny franchise of its own. There is a sequel manga--unknown in the west, but apparently a direct continuation of the story from the anime, and, by sheer coincidence and mere days before I sat down to watch the show, a visual novel. Available, officially, in English, on the PlayStation 4, courtesy of translation company P-Qube. PUNCH LINE is far from a perfect anime--the humor in particular is very much a hit or miss sort of thing and will depend largely on how much humor you can still wring from panty gags, but there is a clear and apparent amount of love poured into every frame of it, and even though its ambition to be everything to all viewers outstrips what it actually pulls off, that's not really a knock against it in this case. If more anime aimed this high, PUNCH LINE would maybe be merely average, but most do not. To be sure, it's not exactly thought-provoking. But as far as anime that aim to hit you in the gut in just about every way possible, and succeed at just that, and for the sheer effort, PUNCH LINE deserves a watch. That it manages to be as good as it is is just icing on the cake."

Disclaimer: spoilers ahead


Before the show was even announced, I was an avid follower of manga, always staying up to date as it's frankly done pretty well as a deadpan comedy manga. Because of this, I had high hopes that this adaption would be promising as the jokes would land so much better in animation rather than reading it in the manga.

Note: I have not read any of the LN yet, so my takes are going off of the manga/anime


Episode 1: A misguided trick

Already from the very first episode we see an ambitious choice of starting the show with a bait and switch of the main character, where the show follows Alicia instead of Yumiella, even committing with an entirely fake OP. 

While I do not mind these types of jokes/openings, I feel like they went too far with this. Devoting half the episode to this switch and bait was too much and honestly the bait introductions were too boring and honestly didn't even add that much. I would've been happier if they either took the time to shorten the fluff of the bait down or even just get rid of it entirely.



The Plot:

Now, why would I spend an entire section dedicated to the first half of the first episode?
That's because the entire series plot is honestly, not that unique. However, I believe the series makes up for this completely with it's funny deadpan comedy. 

The first few episodes were pretty decent, however, things began to take a shift in the worse as the episodes went on. The episodes started focusing more on the plot aspect of the series and skipped out on jokes such as !Spin to the cat in episode 4
img520()! and !The princess carry running around the school which would've happened in episode 8
img520()!

While I can see how these jokes may not be necessary at all in terms of the plot, when you remove these jokes the show ends up just turning into a generic overpowered MC fantasy anime. Another egregious example of this is !The missing offal soup joke at the start of episode 9
img520()
What is the point of putting this entire soup ordering sequence if you don't even bother to put the punchline in? This is just cutting out the joke - which is that the spy thought that offal soup was an odd choice and thought ""don't girls normally prefer cake?"" - for the sake of cutting the joke out. It wouldn't have even taken any extra animation unlike the previous examples!



In summary: the adaption of this series is misguided in what makes the series fun to read. Instead of focusing on the getting the jokes right, which would be the main attraction of this series, it instead cuts jokes out in order to make time for the plot. Because of this, we are left with a choppy feeling generic anime which makes me feel disappointed every time a funny joke gets skipped and replaced with uninteresting dialogue.

While there is nothing too wrong about this anime, it leaves much to be desired with how the show anime played out. Personally, I'd recommend just picking the manga up instead of watching the show as it executes the jokes much better than the anime."
10213,"I love Majikoi. The vn has to be among one my absolute favourites alongside the Grisaia trilogy and any game made by Eushully (sadly none of those will ever get an anime adaption). Anyways, the anime for Majikoi was just... disappointing. They really failed to capture much of the art style of the visual novel, nor did they attempt to follow the story really. Someone told me the anime is set somewhere between the first game and Majikoi S, the well-regarded sequel. I suppose that allows for some creative liberty, but the anime fails to capture any of what makes the games so good. For example, yes, the main character, Yamato, is a bit of a pervert, but the anime just takes it to the extreme and has him straight up unzip his paints in front of one of the female characters. This never would happen in the game. Indeed, Yamato may make some snide comments about some of the friends he has, but he is constantly fending off the advances of Shiina and having to deal with Momoyo's... shall we say, direct form of tough love. Overall, it was disappointment. If you truly want to enjoy the Majikoi franchise to the fullest extent, play both the games. They're both long, feature tons of hilarious and touching moments. You'll really learn to appreciate the backstory for characters like Wanko (one of the character's nickname), Shiina, Yukie, Chris and Momoyo. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is hilarious. You'll be laughing basically the whole game long. And if you enjoy it, be sure to check out it's very well received sequel Majikoi S, as well as the 'A' series, which is a series of fan discs for the games and feature more routes. (The games literally read Majikoi A-1, Majikoi A-2). In summary, I would say, don't bother watching the anime for Majikoi. Save yourself the trouble and play the games instead. If you do end up watching the anime, prepare to cringe a lot. 

I reviewed how great the adaption of Little Busters! was a few weeks ago, so I figured since I play a lot of visual novels, might as well start rating their anime adaption. So far, it's 1 great adaption and one that is very disappointing. I do not know which anime adaption of a visual novel I will review or when I even have the time to write them, but I hope my reviews are informative and give an honest reflection of how good the anime adaption of the given visual novel is. I think I'll return to reviewing more games by Key, including Re:Write, Air, Kanon (both series) and eventually Clannad. I think going by studio is much more useful for those reading reviews since it allows them to get a general understanding of how I compare the anime adaptions of visual novels created by a specific developer. Until next time.

98657,"- This review is being written under a subjective lens and mainly enjoyment. 

- The amount of spoilers will be as minimal as possible to none.  I don’t talk more about the plot points except in spoiler text.  There are some image spoilers but it's all out of context lol.

- If you come to expect opinions from a very critical sense, sorry, but I’m not your guy as we may have different tastes.  

- I’ll try my best to explain what are the things that worked for me and what doesn’t in this review.  Then you’ll hopefully be able to understand my point of view and maybe come to your own conclusion about what this will be like for you.

I preface because a lot of people online come to expect reviews to fit a mold of what they want which isn’t always realistic.  For me, I just like to talk about anime I enjoy. And so this review is about such things. Sorry if this ain't what you're looking for.

Love is Like a Cocktail or ""Osake wa Fūfu ni Natte kara"" is a 13 episode TV anime short series released in Fall 2017.  It was animated by Creators in Pack Studio and based on the manga of the same name.

The total length of the show is about 36 minutes long which is like 1.5 episodes of regular-sized TV anime.  The structure is also mainly episodic in nature.

This show doesn't aim to become anything special other than light entertainment and that's okay.  To me, this show benefits from its 3 minute structure as the stories and characters are very simplistic in nature.  Despite all of this, it's done well for what it has.

It's that type of show you put on before and after watching another anime.  A nice palette cleanser or what another would say, a nice chocolate.  You munch on it for a little bit, feel satisfied or feel okay about it then move on.

Would you like it? It depends on your preferences in respect to Romance, Comedy, Slice of Life, and Characterization.  Check it out anyways if those aren't your thing since it's really short.

I would set low/neutral expectations when going into it.  This is the type of show that I would see people put between 4 - 7 depending on how much they can tolerate what most may consider pretty average.

Personally, I recommend taking a bite out of the first 2 episodes of the show for a taste.  From there, you can get a sense of sticking on-board with the show or not.

As for my experience, I found this to be an 8/10.  It was very entertaining despite how light it was.  Rating was landing around a 7 but the final episodes pushed it to an 8 as I enjoyed the characters.

img1080()

If you would like to understand more about the rating and reasonings, read the sections below.




I think the common mistake with ratings is that we all tend to judge and associate each review rating on our own personal scale.  When people see an average anime - they see that as a 5, some see that as a 6 and others as a 7.  As you all know, we all have different tastes hence different rating scales.  Hence why I’ll post my scale below.

My Personal Ratings Scale (Anime):

4 and below = I would've dropped this show already but made myself suffer through it for some reason. Regardless, this is the drop zone generally.
5 = This was really meh and I wouldn't take the time to rewatch.
6 = This was meh and I wouldn't watch it again unless I was forced to.
7 = It was okay and acceptable, it was good entertainment and you enjoyed the ride.

8 = This was a great story and you enjoyed the show/movie but it wasn't considered one of the best experiences. Just a great time overall!

9 = If you watched this show/movie for the first time, you'll love this a lot. It ain't life-changing but god damn you'll have one of the best experiences.
10 = This show resonated with me so hard - chills and intense emotional catharsis. 

img1080()




Got recommended the show by a Zoom saying that I'll like it which he was correct.

I tend to like Romantic Comedies from all genres/demographics so long as I'm amused.  Also, slice of lifes are my jam.  So, this was a no-brainer in respect to my preferences.

Before making this review, I saw the TV version and I’ve only watched the TV in Japanese Audio, English subtitles.




Now the review.  I’ll be talking about the anime in the following categories:

1) Story / Plot / Characters

The story revolves around an adult couple navigating their life and relationships.  Plot is very formulaic in introduction, setup, and resolution.  It's all episodic in nature.

For the lack of huge character conflicts, it instead becomes a very light character study about who these people are and their lives.

Personally, the character backgrounds are quite unique and so it definitely feels genuinely fresh to witness.  I expected generic backgrounds but there was some genuine thought put behind in making all of these people.  They follow some tropes but it's not so cookie cutter that it's offensive in nature.  In the end, I liked these characters despite the short run-time.

I also will now aim to become a professional house-husband in the future.

img1080()

2) Visuals / Animation

It's serviceable for delivering the story and characters.  Nothing hugely stands out good or bad but it doesn't always have to.  It was fine and good on the eyes.

3) Audio / Soundtrack / Voice Acting

Audio was serviceable as well as soundtrack.  ED song was quite cool and the short snippet fits the short credits sequence as well as transitioning out.

I think the voice acting was well-done as they sold the characters.  Props to all of them.  To me, some of it was above-average in certain scenes.  For most, it's probably really average but that's fine too.

4) Overall

I recommend trying this out briefly for like 2 episodes.  Put it on if you want some filler/down-time after doing something.

As you can tell from the above, the story and characters are what will make or break this show for you.

There's really nothing much to talk about unless I go into spoiler territory.  I do say that I hope you like drinking alcohol because it does make it more understandable to see the appeal of the featured drinks in the show.  If you're a huge connoisseur of drinking alcohol then you probably will have a more informed opinion of the accuracy of these drinks.



In conclusion, hopefully you learned something useful from the review.  Thanks for reading. :)

144092,"This was truly an unexpected gem of the Winter season. It was a surprisingly funny, yet emotional and epic anime for sure. It takes a while to really pick up, but once it does, it never looks back. Studio C2C have been quietly doing a great job with some of their recent works, such as Majo no Tabitabi, Tensei shitara Ken Deshita, and now this anime, which showcased some very impressive and sharpened animation and fight scenes that could make some of the elite studios quiver in their boots just a little bit. I think this show nails tonal shifts very well, and it kind of reminds me of Golden Kamuy, where one scene they could be making the lewdest of lewd jokes, but the next scene, people are being murdered. It’s really quite something.

The story isn’t very special, as it’s about a Handyman called Saitou, reincarnated into another world where unlike in his original world, the people treat him with much more respect, and he feels more needed. He uses his handyman skills to help out his party with lock-picking, opening treasure chests, a lot of practical things.

The first few episodes are very comedy-based, with somewhat disconnected skits to introduce the characters, and while some of the jokes hit real good, it was definitely the weakest part of the series. It shifts into a more plot-based story after that, and boy, it really got good after that. It went through a full 180, but it worked out in the end with some very meaningful and emotional backstories, along with some solid character writing in the process. It doesn’t hold back in any way, whether it’s the jokes, the action, or even the gore.

The cast is quite the goofy bunch, but they’re a very solid cast of characters. Apart from Saitou, we have an old magician who forgets his spells every so often called Morlock, a healing fairy called Lafanpan, and a strong Knight in Raelza. Their interactions can be comedy gold, but can also be very emotional. They’re a very tight knit party who clearly care about each other, and form great friendships and relationships that made for great dynamics. The side characters and antagonists also were decent, as each character had a certain degree of depth, some more than others, and it’s always a breath of fresh air when the villains have a backstory of their own instead of just being evil for the sake of being evil.

The animation is good overall, but when the plot gets serious, the animation goes up to another level. Some of the fight scenes were very well animated, and got me on the edge of my seat with how epic they were. The OST also accompanies the atmospheres very nicely, although the OP and ED weren’t all that great.

Overall, this show encompasses goofy and epic all in one package, and if there was one isekai besides MagiRevo that I would recommend people to check out, it would be this one. Genuinely, one of the better shows of the season, and it came as a very pleasant surprise. Do give this one a chance."
