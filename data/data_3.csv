10029,"In many ways, Goro Miyazaki's career is actually far more interesting that his father's, if perhaps less influential. You see, Goro actually graduated with a degree in Landscape Agriculture, and never wanted to get into animation or directing, and yet due to the massive influence of Hayao Miyazaki, he was convinced to get into the career. He was reluctant as hell, and (supposedly) this shows in his first movie, the Tales of Earthsea. Now, he actually does direct TV anime for Polygon, and appears to truly shine in doing that. So Poppy Hill poses itself as something very unique, as a bridge between being persuaded (with an awful lot of effort) to direct anime, to actually approaching the medium willingly. Though, Hayao Miyazaki did write the script and you can really tell.

The OST is something I'd like to focus on here, as it was both wonderful to listen to and pretty thematically brilliant in regards to the setting and story. The soundtrack is comprised of two major styles of music. The first is smooth jazz, and the second is 20s(?) style French music. The anime is set just before the Tokyo Olympics and this is important in this sense, as it represents Japan finding its place in the world post-Meiji. Jazz does a wonderful job at portraying this as the anime is about retaining the past with the historic Latin Quarter Club House - it is a perfect contrast between finding a new place and moving forward while also retaining what brought Japan to this point, and it further draws parallels with Umi's character arc in the movie.

On a base level the narrative is nothing special. It is simply following Umi Matsuzaki as she discovers the community centred around the utterly neglected Latin Quarter in her school. This perhaps isn't what is important as the movie focused greatly on the characters, primarily Umi and Shun Kazama. Their dynamic is cute as hell and their arcs are both depressed and uplifting, there is a surprising amount of ""melodrama"" made to feel oddly believable, likely due to how grounded the entire movie is. !The reveal that Shun may be Umi's sibling was devastating for them, and also for me to some degree. Umi's unbending feelings and her struggles to reject them was particularly believable and I feel it portrayed this in a way that a teenager who had just come to this revelation might do.!

Ultimately this misfortune is overcome, and the misunderstanding is dealt with wonderfully. Yet again, we are treated to something quite realistic here, as it was a major misunderstanding that made complete sense. !The Success of the students! and the positivity of the film as a whole was a wonderful experience, coupled with the sense of nostalgia that the visuals and OST created this created a feeling of comfort and perhaps belief in people and hard work.

I do have a few nitpicks however. The first would be the beginning of the movie being somewhat boring. This should be expected really, as this quite literally a Slice of Life in the sense that it's just some people living their life - the major conflict in the movie is pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things after all. This did make the movie somewhat difficult to get into, but once it got going there was much to appreciate. The second issue I had was incredibly minor, but it was the misplacement of a certain scene. !Seeing Umi's father's ship sink! in the middle of the meeting really broke the pace of the scene, and was a sequence that should have been shown earlier when Umi explained what had happened to Shun.

From Up On Poppy Hill produced an incredibly nostalgic narrative and setting that made me feel like I myself was involved in the drama and conflict. The combination of OST and beautifully crafted characters made for deep investment in a standard conflict, giving one of the most heart warming experiences I've had in a movie in a long while."

-title card at the very end of the series.

For a series that technically starts with a bus hijacking, you could be forgiven from assuming from its first episode that PUNCH LINE is a fun, loose, FLCL-inspired romp about a teenage boy who gains superpowers upon seeing panties, and is knocked out of his body and into the past as a ghost to right some great evil or another. It's kind of a weird premise but at first blush, a bit of an aping, and nothing on-the-surface special. This is half true, but there's a lot more to PUNCH LINE than merely a pastiche of one of the greatest anime ever made. There's a lot to PUNCH LINE in general, really. How else would you describe a series that starts as a fanservice-laden action-comedy, digs into a rabbit hole of conspiracy paranoia and time travel loops, and then dovetails into an excellent superhero show in its final two episodes? 

Really if PUNCH LINE has a major flaw it's actually that it tries to do too much in its short runtime (just the standard single-cour twelve episodes. No more, no less), and its many moving parts lead to a bit of clash. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here, what exactly is PUNCH LINE? The simple answer is that it's a MAPPA-made (Yuri on Ice!!, Kakegurui, Teekyuu) animation that seems to have kind of arisen from nowhere. Directed by Yutaka Uemura, a man whose credits in the industry are sparse (and since PUNCH LINE ended, have included only the adaptations of the utterly noxious Tanya The Evil franchise), and written by Kotaro Uchokishi, an unknown within the anime industry but responsible for a good deal of video game writing outside of it (most famously, he is the writer behind Nine Hours Nine Persons Nine Doors), there is precious little to be found online, at least in English, as far as what prompted PUNCH LINE being made, so its origin is something of a minor mystery. My own best guess is that it may have been put forward to ride the wave of renewed interest in Daicon-lineage anime prompted by the success of Kill la Kill (not unlike the contemporary Rolling Girls), but a guess it remains.

Regardless of the why, the what of PUNCH LINE can be cleanly separated into the story's two major acts. In the first, Yuta--our protagonist--is knocked out of his body, and into the past, after essentially going super saiyan and overpowering a terrorist during a bus hijacking. How did he power up like this? Well, he saw one of his fellow passenger's panties. 

img880()
yes that is really why this happens



Again, you could be forgiven for thinking that this show is exactly as screwball as it seems on the surface, but this actually does go somewhere. The first six episodes of the series revolve around Yuta's ghost attempting to avert the end of the world, to be caused by an Illuminati-like organization called the Qmay Group, who wish to destroy the planet via asteroid strike, and start human society anew. Thus, the first half of the series is a blend of Yuta trying to solve the mystery of how this is going to happen in the first place and thus try to stop it (with the ""help"" of a snarky cat spirit Chiranosuke), and some character development for the remainder of the cast. Going over every in and out of the residents of Korai House--where Yuta lives, and now, haunts--would take a lot of time, but in brief, these characters are; Mikatan, an idol who moonlights as the magical girl Strange Juice, Meika, her manager both in idol and hero life (who turns out to be a robot in the first of many, many plot twists), Ito, a shut-in with a pet bear cub who was bullied out of her school after she was seen being driven home by a teacher, and Rabura; an unlucky-in-love fake medium with a gyaru look about her. Lastly there is Kenji, a mysterious super sentai-style masked superhero with powers similar to Mikatan's, but he is something of a special case. 

img880()
oh and Ito dies at one point. Don't worry, it sticks for about ten minutes.



Each of these characters gets enough fleshing out, often via flashbacks interlaced with narratives in the here and now, that when the shit hits the fan in the series' second act, you genuinely worry for all of their safety. Yuta, notably, observes these narratives but due to his nature as a spectre, is not really a part of them. This, as it turns out, is by design, as it's also in this second act that the plot starts to tie itself into knots, for both good and bad. The very, very broad stroke is that Kenji turns out to be Yuta from the future, and at the end of the sixth episode, Yuta actually fails to prevent the end of the world, and with the help of ""Kenji"", he goes back in time once again. Everything resets to the beginning of the series, and Yuta--now in possession of his body once again--makes a second pass at staving off the end of humanity, this time in an active and present way, and despite the pesterings of Chiranosuke, who tries to insist that he repeat his past actions almost exactly.

This doubling back on the narrative lets PUNCH LINE pull off an interesting trick. Things that seemingly made no sense the first time around are given additional context on the second, and it's here that the show starts foregrounding the mystery element (even as the comedy remains a constant throughout most of the episodes). We're introduced to the idea of uberfication (the super mode that several characters have), the virus that causes it, the motives of the Qmay Group, secret lab facilities and body-swapping. Yuta is even revealed to ""biologically"" be a girl (rather: his male soul has been swapped into a woman's body, it's complicated. As an aside, the show should be praised here for not making this into the subject of much jest or angst. The only person who really gives him any shit about it is Meika, who comes around eventually. It's no progressive masterpiece, but this is the sort of thing it's very easy to get wrong). This style of storytelling--revelation on top of revelation and twist on top of twist--is undeniably not to everyone's taste, but the rapid clip makes every episode count--PUNCH LINE has zero filler--and by the time the show is in its 11th hour (starting in the 11th episode natch), you're seriously rooting for the characters. Here, PUNCH LINE flips again, into a straight-ahead superhero show. The residents of Korai House become Justice Punch, and each plays a part in taking down a joint attack on the house by the US Army, The JSDF, and a battalion of supersoldiers called W's, all controlled by The Qmay Group. There's a real super robot feel especially to Ito's scenes, where she pilots a squat mecha created by Meika, her piloting ability hilariously being attributed to her skill at mecha sim video games.

img880()
more shows should have a side character kick ass in an orange robot in the penultimate episode




The ending is maybe a touch predictable. There is a heroic sacrifice--Yuta, or at least an incarnation of him, dies. To save the main villain no less--but life goes on for the surviving members, and Rabura, now somewhat inexplicably a genuine medium, is able to commune with his spirit.

PUNCH LINE's story, both in a literal and meta sense, could've ended there. Spectacularly though, this bizarre, underrated lovechild of FLCL and Zero Escape has managed to spawn a tiny franchise of its own. There is a sequel manga--unknown in the west, but apparently a direct continuation of the story from the anime, and, by sheer coincidence and mere days before I sat down to watch the show, a visual novel. Available, officially, in English, on the PlayStation 4, courtesy of translation company P-Qube. PUNCH LINE is far from a perfect anime--the humor in particular is very much a hit or miss sort of thing and will depend largely on how much humor you can still wring from panty gags, but there is a clear and apparent amount of love poured into every frame of it, and even though its ambition to be everything to all viewers outstrips what it actually pulls off, that's not really a knock against it in this case. If more anime aimed this high, PUNCH LINE would maybe be merely average, but most do not. To be sure, it's not exactly thought-provoking. But as far as anime that aim to hit you in the gut in just about every way possible, and succeed at just that, and for the sheer effort, PUNCH LINE deserves a watch. That it manages to be as good as it is is just icing on the cake."

Disclaimer: spoilers ahead


Before the show was even announced, I was an avid follower of manga, always staying up to date as it's frankly done pretty well as a deadpan comedy manga. Because of this, I had high hopes that this adaption would be promising as the jokes would land so much better in animation rather than reading it in the manga.

Note: I have not read any of the LN yet, so my takes are going off of the manga/anime


Episode 1: A misguided trick

Already from the very first episode we see an ambitious choice of starting the show with a bait and switch of the main character, where the show follows Alicia instead of Yumiella, even committing with an entirely fake OP. 

While I do not mind these types of jokes/openings, I feel like they went too far with this. Devoting half the episode to this switch and bait was too much and honestly the bait introductions were too boring and honestly didn't even add that much. I would've been happier if they either took the time to shorten the fluff of the bait down or even just get rid of it entirely.



The Plot:

Now, why would I spend an entire section dedicated to the first half of the first episode?
That's because the entire series plot is honestly, not that unique. However, I believe the series makes up for this completely with it's funny deadpan comedy. 

The first few episodes were pretty decent, however, things began to take a shift in the worse as the episodes went on. The episodes started focusing more on the plot aspect of the series and skipped out on jokes such as !Spin to the cat in episode 4
img520()! and !The princess carry running around the school which would've happened in episode 8
img520()!

While I can see how these jokes may not be necessary at all in terms of the plot, when you remove these jokes the show ends up just turning into a generic overpowered MC fantasy anime. Another egregious example of this is !The missing offal soup joke at the start of episode 9
img520()
What is the point of putting this entire soup ordering sequence if you don't even bother to put the punchline in? This is just cutting out the joke - which is that the spy thought that offal soup was an odd choice and thought ""don't girls normally prefer cake?"" - for the sake of cutting the joke out. It wouldn't have even taken any extra animation unlike the previous examples!



In summary: the adaption of this series is misguided in what makes the series fun to read. Instead of focusing on the getting the jokes right, which would be the main attraction of this series, it instead cuts jokes out in order to make time for the plot. Because of this, we are left with a choppy feeling generic anime which makes me feel disappointed every time a funny joke gets skipped and replaced with uninteresting dialogue.

While there is nothing too wrong about this anime, it leaves much to be desired with how the show anime played out. Personally, I'd recommend just picking the manga up instead of watching the show as it executes the jokes much better than the anime."
10213,"I love Majikoi. The vn has to be among one my absolute favourites alongside the Grisaia trilogy and any game made by Eushully (sadly none of those will ever get an anime adaption). Anyways, the anime for Majikoi was just... disappointing. They really failed to capture much of the art style of the visual novel, nor did they attempt to follow the story really. Someone told me the anime is set somewhere between the first game and Majikoi S, the well-regarded sequel. I suppose that allows for some creative liberty, but the anime fails to capture any of what makes the games so good. For example, yes, the main character, Yamato, is a bit of a pervert, but the anime just takes it to the extreme and has him straight up unzip his paints in front of one of the female characters. This never would happen in the game. Indeed, Yamato may make some snide comments about some of the friends he has, but he is constantly fending off the advances of Shiina and having to deal with Momoyo's... shall we say, direct form of tough love. Overall, it was disappointment. If you truly want to enjoy the Majikoi franchise to the fullest extent, play both the games. They're both long, feature tons of hilarious and touching moments. You'll really learn to appreciate the backstory for characters like Wanko (one of the character's nickname), Shiina, Yukie, Chris and Momoyo. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is hilarious. You'll be laughing basically the whole game long. And if you enjoy it, be sure to check out it's very well received sequel Majikoi S, as well as the 'A' series, which is a series of fan discs for the games and feature more routes. (The games literally read Majikoi A-1, Majikoi A-2). In summary, I would say, don't bother watching the anime for Majikoi. Save yourself the trouble and play the games instead. If you do end up watching the anime, prepare to cringe a lot. 

I reviewed how great the adaption of Little Busters! was a few weeks ago, so I figured since I play a lot of visual novels, might as well start rating their anime adaption. So far, it's 1 great adaption and one that is very disappointing. I do not know which anime adaption of a visual novel I will review or when I even have the time to write them, but I hope my reviews are informative and give an honest reflection of how good the anime adaption of the given visual novel is. I think I'll return to reviewing more games by Key, including Re:Write, Air, Kanon (both series) and eventually Clannad. I think going by studio is much more useful for those reading reviews since it allows them to get a general understanding of how I compare the anime adaptions of visual novels created by a specific developer. Until next time.

98657,"- This review is being written under a subjective lens and mainly enjoyment. 

- The amount of spoilers will be as minimal as possible to none.  I don’t talk more about the plot points except in spoiler text.  There are some image spoilers but it's all out of context lol.

- If you come to expect opinions from a very critical sense, sorry, but I’m not your guy as we may have different tastes.  

- I’ll try my best to explain what are the things that worked for me and what doesn’t in this review.  Then you’ll hopefully be able to understand my point of view and maybe come to your own conclusion about what this will be like for you.

I preface because a lot of people online come to expect reviews to fit a mold of what they want which isn’t always realistic.  For me, I just like to talk about anime I enjoy. And so this review is about such things. Sorry if this ain't what you're looking for.

Love is Like a Cocktail or ""Osake wa Fūfu ni Natte kara"" is a 13 episode TV anime short series released in Fall 2017.  It was animated by Creators in Pack Studio and based on the manga of the same name.

The total length of the show is about 36 minutes long which is like 1.5 episodes of regular-sized TV anime.  The structure is also mainly episodic in nature.

This show doesn't aim to become anything special other than light entertainment and that's okay.  To me, this show benefits from its 3 minute structure as the stories and characters are very simplistic in nature.  Despite all of this, it's done well for what it has.

It's that type of show you put on before and after watching another anime.  A nice palette cleanser or what another would say, a nice chocolate.  You munch on it for a little bit, feel satisfied or feel okay about it then move on.

Would you like it? It depends on your preferences in respect to Romance, Comedy, Slice of Life, and Characterization.  Check it out anyways if those aren't your thing since it's really short.

I would set low/neutral expectations when going into it.  This is the type of show that I would see people put between 4 - 7 depending on how much they can tolerate what most may consider pretty average.

Personally, I recommend taking a bite out of the first 2 episodes of the show for a taste.  From there, you can get a sense of sticking on-board with the show or not.

As for my experience, I found this to be an 8/10.  It was very entertaining despite how light it was.  Rating was landing around a 7 but the final episodes pushed it to an 8 as I enjoyed the characters.

img1080()

If you would like to understand more about the rating and reasonings, read the sections below.




I think the common mistake with ratings is that we all tend to judge and associate each review rating on our own personal scale.  When people see an average anime - they see that as a 5, some see that as a 6 and others as a 7.  As you all know, we all have different tastes hence different rating scales.  Hence why I’ll post my scale below.

My Personal Ratings Scale (Anime):

4 and below = I would've dropped this show already but made myself suffer through it for some reason. Regardless, this is the drop zone generally.
5 = This was really meh and I wouldn't take the time to rewatch.
6 = This was meh and I wouldn't watch it again unless I was forced to.
7 = It was okay and acceptable, it was good entertainment and you enjoyed the ride.

8 = This was a great story and you enjoyed the show/movie but it wasn't considered one of the best experiences. Just a great time overall!

9 = If you watched this show/movie for the first time, you'll love this a lot. It ain't life-changing but god damn you'll have one of the best experiences.
10 = This show resonated with me so hard - chills and intense emotional catharsis. 

img1080()




Got recommended the show by a Zoom saying that I'll like it which he was correct.

I tend to like Romantic Comedies from all genres/demographics so long as I'm amused.  Also, slice of lifes are my jam.  So, this was a no-brainer in respect to my preferences.

Before making this review, I saw the TV version and I’ve only watched the TV in Japanese Audio, English subtitles.




Now the review.  I’ll be talking about the anime in the following categories:

1) Story / Plot / Characters

The story revolves around an adult couple navigating their life and relationships.  Plot is very formulaic in introduction, setup, and resolution.  It's all episodic in nature.

For the lack of huge character conflicts, it instead becomes a very light character study about who these people are and their lives.

Personally, the character backgrounds are quite unique and so it definitely feels genuinely fresh to witness.  I expected generic backgrounds but there was some genuine thought put behind in making all of these people.  They follow some tropes but it's not so cookie cutter that it's offensive in nature.  In the end, I liked these characters despite the short run-time.

I also will now aim to become a professional house-husband in the future.

img1080()

2) Visuals / Animation

It's serviceable for delivering the story and characters.  Nothing hugely stands out good or bad but it doesn't always have to.  It was fine and good on the eyes.

3) Audio / Soundtrack / Voice Acting

Audio was serviceable as well as soundtrack.  ED song was quite cool and the short snippet fits the short credits sequence as well as transitioning out.

I think the voice acting was well-done as they sold the characters.  Props to all of them.  To me, some of it was above-average in certain scenes.  For most, it's probably really average but that's fine too.

4) Overall

I recommend trying this out briefly for like 2 episodes.  Put it on if you want some filler/down-time after doing something.

As you can tell from the above, the story and characters are what will make or break this show for you.

There's really nothing much to talk about unless I go into spoiler territory.  I do say that I hope you like drinking alcohol because it does make it more understandable to see the appeal of the featured drinks in the show.  If you're a huge connoisseur of drinking alcohol then you probably will have a more informed opinion of the accuracy of these drinks.



In conclusion, hopefully you learned something useful from the review.  Thanks for reading. :)

144092,"This was truly an unexpected gem of the Winter season. It was a surprisingly funny, yet emotional and epic anime for sure. It takes a while to really pick up, but once it does, it never looks back. Studio C2C have been quietly doing a great job with some of their recent works, such as Majo no Tabitabi, Tensei shitara Ken Deshita, and now this anime, which showcased some very impressive and sharpened animation and fight scenes that could make some of the elite studios quiver in their boots just a little bit. I think this show nails tonal shifts very well, and it kind of reminds me of Golden Kamuy, where one scene they could be making the lewdest of lewd jokes, but the next scene, people are being murdered. It’s really quite something.

The story isn’t very special, as it’s about a Handyman called Saitou, reincarnated into another world where unlike in his original world, the people treat him with much more respect, and he feels more needed. He uses his handyman skills to help out his party with lock-picking, opening treasure chests, a lot of practical things.

The first few episodes are very comedy-based, with somewhat disconnected skits to introduce the characters, and while some of the jokes hit real good, it was definitely the weakest part of the series. It shifts into a more plot-based story after that, and boy, it really got good after that. It went through a full 180, but it worked out in the end with some very meaningful and emotional backstories, along with some solid character writing in the process. It doesn’t hold back in any way, whether it’s the jokes, the action, or even the gore.

The cast is quite the goofy bunch, but they’re a very solid cast of characters. Apart from Saitou, we have an old magician who forgets his spells every so often called Morlock, a healing fairy called Lafanpan, and a strong Knight in Raelza. Their interactions can be comedy gold, but can also be very emotional. They’re a very tight knit party who clearly care about each other, and form great friendships and relationships that made for great dynamics. The side characters and antagonists also were decent, as each character had a certain degree of depth, some more than others, and it’s always a breath of fresh air when the villains have a backstory of their own instead of just being evil for the sake of being evil.

The animation is good overall, but when the plot gets serious, the animation goes up to another level. Some of the fight scenes were very well animated, and got me on the edge of my seat with how epic they were. The OST also accompanies the atmospheres very nicely, although the OP and ED weren’t all that great.

Overall, this show encompasses goofy and epic all in one package, and if there was one isekai besides MagiRevo that I would recommend people to check out, it would be this one. Genuinely, one of the better shows of the season, and it came as a very pleasant surprise. Do give this one a chance."
4087,"This review is about Michiko to Hatchin, which is an original anime that came out in 2008 from studio Manglobe, which is one of the studios I really like even though they are kind of inactive anymore and also animated some other (in my opinion) great shows like Ergo Proxy and Samurai Champloo.

 I know most reviews lately are for seasonal and airing anime but I wanted to show off what’s good about this ‘older’ anime so that  I can potentially remind/present people an anime that they hopefully can enjoy as much as me. This review contains almost no spoilers, excluding some things that set the plot in the first couple episodes of the anime.


First let's address the elephant in the room, that I set up for myself even in the title of this review. Michiko to Hatchin is set in a fictional country named Diamandra, which has noticeable cultural influences from Brazil. I will be making a lot of parallels between the two in this review, hoping to not offend anyone that is actually from Brazil. 
The biggest difference between Brazil and Diamandra lies in the names of the characters, who use a mix of Japanese and Latin (or other non Japanese) parts to create some unique and charming names (i.e Michiko Malandro, Atsuko Jackson, Hiroshi Morenos). 
The whole soundtrack is in Portuguese (we will touch upon that in more detail later) so it’s safe to assume that’s the natural spoken tongue of the main characters in the show, while we hear them talk in Japanese (or other languages it’s dubbed into, specifically gonna mention the English one later)


I am not gonna get too much into it since this is a review and you can find the synopsis anywhere, including the very page this review will be posted on. Basically an ex-convict girl, Michiko Malandro, decides to locate and bring Hachin, a girl that is living with her abusive foster parents back to her actual father which was her ex boyfriend. The two join forces and go through a lot a surreal and action packed adventure towards their shared goal, while developing a bond with one another.


Continuing from my last point, a big part of what makes this show great are the character interactions. Michiko and Hatchin share a realistic bond that resembles a mother and daughter figure but is not quite there. Both of them are still very sassy and independent, which makes sense since they only know each other for a little while. 
I could compare their relationship to something like the relationships between the characters in Cowboy Bebop which are of hidden admiration and care between a shadow of pride. Michiko cares about Hatchin and vice versa but wouldn’t sacrifice everything as easily as a real caring mother would, which is also supported by the nature of the way both of them grew up. 
They grew up with a lot of hardships which makes them not trust or get too attached to other people easily. Michiko grew up as a troublemaker, which ranged from small crimes to getting actually convicted and Hatchin has been living with a family that barely loves and abuses her on a daily basis. 

There are a lot of cool strong independent and sexy women in this anime if you are a fan of that as much as I am. The main girl of this anime ,Michiko Malandro, is actually both my favorite female character and waifu, since I think she is both a good character, really attractive and around my actual age.


I wanna state here that my music knowledge is sub-par at best so take some stuff in this part with a grain of salt. The OST, which is also co-written by Cowboy Bebop’s Shinichiro Watanabe, is in Portuguese, which further complements the anime’s aesthetic of South America and most specifically Brazil. It’s mostly upbeat and funky, including the opening song, which is a primarily musical piece that fits a show that is primarily here to make you have fun. I would even call it a bit jazz-y (if that is a real word), since it resembles the opening song of Great Pretender or Cowboy Bebop’s ‘Tank!’ a lot. Most of the other songs are upbeat but some are different to fit specific sad or emotional moments in the show.
Here are some samples from both claims:
The opening song:
Youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQf-NkWz7Yo)
A less upbeat melancholic track from the OST:
Youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Oor9WBk0c)


The visuals are very colorful and ‘funky’ too, as you can probably see from the opening I already posted if you clicked on it already. A lot of vibrant colors like red, yellow, green etc are used to make this a funky trip and seem more exotic. Considering the setting and purpose of this anime, I don’t think it’s unjustified to use a coloration like that. 
I am not an expert of how traditional poor Brazilian neighborhoods (so called Favelas) look like, but from what I have seen through the internet and asked a few Brazilian people online, they don’t stray far from the actual thing. 
The characters are drawn in a more realistic way than more anime, while still being unique and recognizable and putting their own spin on it. In conclusions the visuals are not groundbreaking or eye opening but they fit the anime a lot in my opinion


Here are some examples of background art and character art:

There is no source material since it’s an original anime. An English dub of the anime exists, which I also watched apart from the original version, and can say that I found very charming and fitting for this anime, not that I had any issue with just watching the original. So it’s just up to personal preference. If I had to pick some shows that share a lot of elements with Michiko to Hatchin, I  would pick Great Pretender, Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon and the fellow Manglobe show Samurai Champloo, a lot of which were already mentioned in this review. 


Michiko to Hatchin is not an anime for everyone, as a lot of others. It’s not complex or high on production value enough to please the hardest of anime fans looking for that. But it’s a fun trip through a setting different than you are used to, accompanied with a lot of gun focused action and mostly lovable characters. I can certainly say, it’s one of my personal favorites and I chose to make this review to bring more awareness about it. You can message me for more details or to discuss about the show, since I am very active on this site (at the time that this was posted)"

>I wouldn't mind you being an undead forever. Just stay here forever and spend your life as an adventurer. - Lorraine Vivie (translated) 

!This is a story of Rentt Faina a 'stuck in life' adult who has a dream of being a mithril class adventurer, born with no talents for years until a turn of event brought him to a presence of mythical creature in secret dungeon, and hence he met his demise. Then he got resurrected as a skeleton that needed no sleep and hunger, and began a journey to make his way towards race evolution. Helped by dear friend Lorraine, he had place to live while hiding his identity.!

It might not be the best entertainment rush you're willing to waste time for, and also because everyone values different things in a film. Nonetheless, if you are the kind of idealist who is looking for sincere piece of work, then this may give you one as long as you can tolerate the unpopular parts. Aside from the interesting journey to vampire evolution, this show has intelligible characters that you'll grow fond of. Its slow pacing was also compensated by the way it fits the story just right on-time. 

I know many have thought this as a generic boorish show (generic fantasy setting usually has this stereotype), let alone comprehend that this thing even has 'soul'. I think so too if it's judged from the overall score, regardless to me it passes the first very thing any work of story should have: 
- Respectable characters (It's always nice to see an upright MC, or heroine) 
- Logical (it's a fantasy but the assumptions and events are reasoned nicely)
- Focused plot (some trying too hard to entertain which backfires, this one stays within its scope)
- Balanced pacing (a focused plot usually balance in pacing, this show is just done in time and points are delivered)
- Interesting/worthwhile goal (staying for final vampire evolution ? I'm in)
- Hardly predictable in microscale (this show is still on the 'mild' side but not lazy, it got some moves)

What could be improved ? 

Story wise, a bit of minor adjustments like a more active villain roles might give it trajectory boost, a bit of comedy, then a meticulous cleanup on any potential cringe (unintended one) moment could elevate it's classy delivery; which I think is a suitable style for this show. It could also learn one or two from Mushoku Tensei about grossness which add realistic imperfection to the story (Mushoku Tensei is a bit too much, so take just a grain). Then comes the plot, depending on what you mean by good plot is probably a series of turns that provide unexpected surprise and dynamism to the process. Unfortunately this one won't give you much that, reason is that the premise was locked from the start but not the progression itself. As a result the story progressed sensibly in which often it allows unique scenarios to arise. Nevertheless, It did still have a proper structure, although it seems not to forced the sensible plot for the sake the predefined outcome, this way you can enjoy the process naturally. (Check episode where he encounters mysterious magic item collector)

Animation quality was rushed, sometimes it breaks the acceptable biology and proportion, but on average it didn't go as far to the point it broke the flow of engagement. I'm not an expert on the matters, and many great technicalities are all over the industry which they can look into. Unless it's not about budget reasons, my advice is to go far with the animation quality because it could gives utmost positive impression which in turn makes people stay longer.

Soundtracks are great, the opening song is unique, while the ending is in the heartwarming one thanks to this talented musician [Mao Abe](https://youtu.be/KLRt-nsWXfE?si=7e1Rhqidfrz2Ea8). The rest of BGMs are nice as well, it tries to differentiate itself and fits in perfectly. It even got flamenco style as one of their instruments, I remember Bleach uses that heavily. 

Characters aspect is probably the thing that actually drew me in, Rentt, Lorraine, Sheila, blacksmith guy, and the newbies are all crafted mindfully. They were perceptive and often displays complex human behavior like word restraint, inner judgment, and the ability to play subtlety with sarcasm (Lorraine Sheila intense moment depicted this when Lorraine challenged her intention). Did I say this anime has the best characters of all time? not that far, we've got many champions like Steins Gate which I think is one of greatest pieces of 2010s generation could ask for. In terms of spectrum, that stays above this one by a considerable gap, and so much great masterpieces out there we could learn from.

Final Verdict

It's kind of 'lame' show that won't flushes your brain with dopamine and adrenaline, but oxytocin for sure."
122434,"Speaking in very broad terms, film and television can be divided into two categories. On one end of the spectrum you have “art house” projects, which will typically focus on complex symbolism, themes and characters at the expense of broader appeal; contrasting that are the “blockbusters”, designed first and foremost to be straightforward, comprehendible and (most importantly) entertaining. With a manga illustrated by the creator of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, a story from the same mind who brought the world Interspecies Reviewers, and an anime produced by MAPPA, it’s no surprise that The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace falls more on the “popcorn-flick” side of things – almost to a comical extreme. There isn’t a unifying message or theme at the center of the story, the characters are one-note and undergo zero development, and everything is as straightforward as it gets, with no hidden “deeper meaning” anywhere. However, in spite of these factors (which would normally be major deficits) I think that Idaten is a blast from start to finish, exemplifying how to make a show that can’t be called anything but “dumb fun”. 

When demons threatened humanity, a race of metaphysical battle-gods were willed into existence to save the world (the Idaten). To end the fighting all but one of these gods, Rin, would sacrifice themselves to seal away the demon threat, bringing some peace to the world. Fast forward 800 years and humans may now be fighting one another, but Rin and the other gods – Hayato, Ysley, Paula and Prontea – aren’t interested in stopping anything less than an extinction level event. With no demons to worry about, the Idaten are able to spend all their time doing whatever they please, and life is generally good. That idyllic lifestyle is shattered, however, when a new strain of demons view this inaction as weakness, and preemptively try to wipe them out. On the surface this isn’t an awful plan, but it falls apart when the ridiculous gap in power between the gods and the demons becomes apparent; in the blink of an eye Idaten becomes the anime version of watching what happens when the schoolyard bully goes after a wasp nest with a baseball bat.


The demons might not have thought this one through

In order to keep the plot engaging Idaten places a heavy emphasis on two factors: tone and pacing. The bright, poppy colors and cartoonish character design are very shounen-esque, but the show establishes the fact it is going to go to some really dark places right away. A story and visuals that belong in a shounen being intertwined with sex, degeneracy and stylized gore is a really engaging dichotomy, and creates a unique, over-the-top atmosphere that at times almost becomes a parody. This is also what allows Idaten to have near perfect pacing, as the show literally does things like fast forward through exposition heavy segments. On the surface this may seem like a strange, unjustifiable creative decision, but because of the very “tongue in cheek” tone of the show it feels so natural, serving as both a comedic bit while at the same time being a tool to prevent the show from dragging. 


Concerned your worldbuilding is dry? Have you considered... telling it twice as fast?

This tone also is what saves the characters. Earlier I described them as one-note, and they are. Every time Rin and Hayato are onscreen I know they’re going to want to fight something, and every time Ysley and Prontea are onscreen I know there’s going to be more in the way of dialogue and worldbuilding. Even the demons, as comically evil and fun to watch as they are, fall victim to this. Their standout is without a doubt Miku, a genius when it comes to planning who, like the Idaten, is focused solely on one thing – in her case that just happens to be having sex. Yes, the characters are shallow, crass, amoral and genuinely awful. The thing is though, everything about this show is wildly over-the-top, and in that setting having incredibly powerful characters with awful personalities hyperfixate on just one trait is a recipe for hilarity, even if it’s not deep whatsoever. 


What on earth could she be taking that pixelated object into the bathroom for?

Idaten may be a seinen, however that’s clearly not so it can explore more complex, adult themes. The reality is that this show is a seinen for the same reason Deadpool’s target demographic is adults. Sex, blood and gore are all mainstays of the show, with drugs, war crimes and general degeneracy occasionally rearing their heads as well. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – honestly an R-rated version of a battle shounen (a battle seinen?) will be a breath of fresh air for many. But there are moments where being an exercise in excess may get a little too… excessive. 

I do feel a need to touch briefly on how the tone of Idaten is established: at the end of the first episode there’s a rape. Sexual assault is an incredibly sensitive topic, and I know for a lot of people this alone will be enough to turn them off of a show completely. As weird as it sounds, however, I don’t actually know how this scene could have been done in a better way. From a creative standpoint this has purpose regarding the narrative and in establishing tone, and there isn’t another way to easily do both in such a memorable fashion. It’s also portrayed in a deliberately grotesque, very eerie style that is profoundly uncomfortable for the viewer (fitting given the subject material), and it’s not glamorized whatsoever. It’s not gratuitous, however people should be aware of the fact that it is waiting at the end of episode one – and really of the heavy focus the show has on sex in general.



On a brighter note, I would be remiss if I didn’t also talk about the insanely good production values behind Idaten. MAPPA is a top notch studio (even if working conditions there might not be), but I was still blown away by the OST and animation of the show. The ending is done by Nanawo Akari, and it’s a pretty fun jpop/rap song. Accompany that with some fast paced, fun insert music for the fights and you’ve got the foundation of a pretty good soundtrack. The opening, however, was a real jaw dropper. Done by Tatsuya Kitani, as a song being judged on its own merits it’s great, definitely leaning into more of a rock anthem kind of sound and earning a spot on my playlist. But this opening has one of the best animated sequences of any opening I’ve seen – it’s honestly so good I could watch it with the sound muted and still be impressed, and I never skipped it once in eleven episodes. 


Fever Dream: The Opening

The visuals of Idaten are consistently that good. The most striking thing about them is the very atypical palette, as the focus is on incredibly bright colors that provide a lot of pop. It definitely feels strange initially, but after an episode or two of adjusting all of the ways that the show utilizes the cartoonish visuals begins to become apparent. If you look past the colors and at the action, you’ll find that it’s hectic but very well choreographed, The emphasis here is definitely on hand to hand fighting with ridiculous speed and power, but since the fights are always just between a couple of characters and tend to be over quickly they’re very easy to follow. While there were a few times when I felt like the visuals were “busy”, and that there was no way for me to take in everything on screen, I do think it’s safe to say that the uniqueness of the art style is a pretty big draw for the show.



Members of various fandoms have a tendency to read too deeply into something they’re passionate about. To many, “quality” and “depth” have been conflated to the point where they are inseparable. In spite of its issues, such as a general irreverence for sensitive topics and ending on a cliffhanger so massive even Alex Honnold would get nervous, The Idaten Deities Know Only Peace is a refutation of that thesis, as viewers can't even pretend it's deep. Shallow, stupid, offensive, crass and a plethora of other adjectives I’m too lazy to write out could easily describe this show – but that doesn’t mean it isn't fun, and it certainly doesn't mean it can't be one of my favorite shows in recent memory."
101239,"Ahiru no Sora is a coming of age story about how easy it is to live an uncomfortably aimless life, with a cast that struggles with how listless living such a life makes them due to their isolation from living a youthful life, social problems and their own apathy, with the series emphasizing the importance of breaking out of that apathy and struggling to find a passion in order to at least move forward, regardless of the excruciating difficulty that would follow. Basketball is the vehicle used to drive these characters forward and plays an important role in these characters finding a way to be reborn, but what the series emphasizes is a need for introspection in order to do something you truly love and can push you forward enough to give you a purpose in life, regardless of the mistakes one might do or the pain that lies further down the road. It handles all this with an exceptional amount of nuance and subtlety, never genuinely shoving these themes down the viewer's throat and instead expects the audience to pick up on hints given throughout much of the first act of the series - covering around the first 33 episodes. This in and of itself is a problem; in sharp contrast to series like Haikyuu and Kuroko, which act more as hypebeasts trying to drag viewers in with gorgeous visuals and adrenaline pumping matches, whereas viewers watching Ahiru no Sora will be treated to lengthy comedy sequences as well as slice of life segments involving the main cast, which due to being very slow paced and often with mixed comedic timing don't endear the show to a wider audience.

While in and of itself neither lengthy comedy sequences nor slice of life segments need to necessarily be a problem, the show ruins this with its dragged out, stretched pacing - a quick distinction from its manga counterpart, where dialogue often flowed naturally and games happened at a quick enough pace to not be dragged out. This made stretches of the show often a drag to watch, and while the slice of life segments don't suffer much from this, the comedy and games proper often do - this is probably why critical reception to the show was considerably worse than much of its recent long-running contemporaries like Haikyuu, Ace of Diamond or Kuroko, which all are comparatively high budget adaptations created by Production IG. By comparison, Ahiru no Sora was done by Diomedea studio, a studio with a prominent reputation for low budget production values and pacing issues with many adaptations they've done; while parts of the series are wonderfully directed, these parts come in-between stretches of very strangely paced episodes. On the flipside, the soundtracks is pretty great, with many standout tracks salvaging many games, and a particular mention needing to go to the various OPs/EDs in the series, with the fourth opening and third ending being my personal favorites. That said, none of the OPs or EDs are particularly bad and all of them are fantastic, which isn't something that can be said for every series with a multitude of OPs/EDs like this one.

Sora's character arc about his complex for his height is greatly expanded on over the course of the series; much about his character seems typical for the standard sports lead, but the distinction is in Sora's nuance. Sora often recklessly challenges delinquents - something used for comic relief - but this disguises a character often insecure about his own height and masculinity in a sport where both are associated with being a better player, with this being contrasted with his mom's upbringing of him which turned that very short stature into a strength instead of a weakness. This largely is what drives Sora forward as a character despite his poor treatment both by his would-be classmates and general student body, with his perseverance standing out in the ocean of apathy that is his school and driving the group of delinquents that largely comprise the rest of the team. However, his character arc is more about how he often defines himself by his mom's upbringing - and how this in return leaves him helpless to find guidance for himself, whose role Madoka fills up as the series continues, acting as the closest thing in the cast to an emotional voice of reason. A combination of his dynamic with Madoka as well as his own desire for independence mean that by the end of the series and after a fair few twists and turns, Sora has begun the steps to attaining his own self-defined independence, with his willingness to turn a certain lie into the truth and take responsibility for his own actions being a driving force.

Momoharu and Chiaki act as another contrast in this regard both to Sora as well as each other, with Chiaki's more extrospective personality concealing a cynical yet realist mind on the team and chances for success, while Momoharu acts introspectively yet concealing a certain hot-bloodedness that drives him to improve further. The two are brothers, growing up taking inspiration from iconic sports manga only to have that idealism crushed when facing odds that are against them, leading to Chiaki being disinterested due to associating his love for the sport with his odds for victory, and Momoharu slowly following by drowning in his own apathy, being discriminated against due to his appearance as well as attitude. Both brothers grow gradually over the course of the series, with Chiaki slowly understanding that he needs to broaden his horizons and reach for the stars rather than simply ground himself in seemingly objective expectations, while Momoharu's impulsiveness leads him to make several mistakes that lead to him slowly taking his passion for basketball seriously and discovering a love for the sport that has seemingly long been lost. Much of their characterization in this adaptation happens in the second half of the anime, but much of their negative traits (overplayed and emphasized as they are) fade the longer the series goes on.

Tobi acts as the closest thing the series has to a veteran player, being cocky and highly individualistic - which betrays a deep resentment of not just his school but most people around him in general, driven by a cynicism of being judged both due to his appearance as well as his estrangement from his broken family life, with his sister acting as the closest thing he has to a bond. He's cocky, arrogant and full of himself, yet these same negative traits conceal a jaded person whose life experiences have driven him to apathy to the point where he'd shun people away. And yet through his experiences joining the team, he realizes that there are players who have undergone troubling experiences yet come out smiling on the other side and being better than he is, pushing him not only to remain loyal to the team but often acting more and more selflessly the longer the series goes on. Much of Tobi's characterization is gradual yet consistent, with his negative traits not detracting from his likability as a character; it's beyond refreshing in a cast filled of delinquents to have a character that only very slowly defrosts over time, and Tobi - partially due to his growing dynamic with Sora but also his immediately sympathetic reason for both playing the sport and remaining loyal to the team - is my favorite character in the series, and I can't wait for more of his progression over the course of the manga.

Kaname is the final central character introduced over the course of the series, with his character arc acting as a foil to Sora's - being one where instead of being discriminated for his shortiness as is the case with Sora, instead being constantly pushed into a sport he grows to apparently dislike due to his height, with his teammates constantly ridiculing him for his low stamina and poor health. His character arc is partially about rediscovering his love for basketball independently of the very factors that pushed him to fall out of love with it, with the cast encouraging him to play to his strengths and be more assertive about his interests while also being conscious about his health. Also relevant is Kaname's subplot with a side character, and how he uses as a motivation his feelings for her in order to drive him forward to improve as a player and win games - making him increasingly become a more prominent player as the series goes on despite his physical weaknesses. Kaname's interactions with Sora are worthy of note due to the contrast between both characters, but there's a surprising amount of nuance and even a thematic point made in the series that what one of them possess the other lacks and vice versa, which grants credence to their friendship as well as their dynamic on the court.

Various side characters are also worthy of note; Sora's mom is a moral support who I loved from the moment she showed up on screen, acting as a kind yet firm voice to guide Sora forward despite her own health. Nanao is an unbelievably likable character whose main flaw is her self-centeredness in taking responsibility for the team's failings when she's the de facto manager upon herself, and yet grows stronger as she realizes that regardless of her tactical prowess, there's only so much she can do alone. Madoka's dynamic with Sora is my favorite in the series, with her acting increasingly as moral support yet due to her own awkwardness in approaching sensitive subjects - a weakness that backfires on her later on in the series - is often easily dismissed in-setting as shallow, when her introspective nature reveals she's anything but that; she bonds with Sora's family, growing ever closer to Sora as she understands his weaknesses and strengths, and grows to become a personal crutch to him as the series goes on due to her own caring for him, even if her consideration for his feelings often stand in the way (even if understandable in-context) from further emotional intimacy. Much of my favorite slice of life segments came from Madoka's interactions with Sora, with their dynamic growing naturally over the course of the series. Many, many characters can be laid out here; Shinichi, Chiba, Fuwa, Satsuki and Yozan all being noteworthy characters that grow over the course of the series.

Ahiru no Sora is a really damn good sports series that has gone under the radar due to various issues I mentioned earlier and understandably so; unfortunately, this means that the manga remains the optimal version to experience Ahiru no Sora's story. What is being adapted, however, is still really good, just marred by all these production problems for those that are willing to give this series a fair chance and are unwilling to read manga for the optimal experience. There's much to love about this series, and considering material that comes later on, I certainly hope for a season 2 to come somewhere down the line, albeit admittedly I certainly wouldn't mind a considerably better production.

Nonetheless, I highly recommend this series and especially in manga format for those that are looking for a damn good sport series, and I don't speak that kind of praise lightly.

Thank you very much for reading."

Phantom – Requiem of the Phantom.
An Anime noir with an interesting look into life of assassins, that gets completely deviated by the end, and really makes you wonder if this was worth the time.

The story sets in America, and revolves around two characters named Ein, a well named assassin who’s feared as the mighty “Phantom” and Zwei, a Japanese high-schooler who was brainwashed and forced to join an underground organization, as they try to survive, living a life forced upon them by a man named “Scythe Master” under an underworld organization called “Inferno”. As the Anime progresses, you’ll get to know their lives through the eyes of a brain washed person, while having an internal struggle to fit in the world he was forced to live. But that might change over time.

-	The Setting: For an Anime following an assassin, it does a very good job to capture that environment. Mysterious hideouts, a massive building for an underground organization, the shopping Mall from the eyes of an assassin and etc.
- The Main Characters : The characters aren't exceptionally great or well written, but they are written good enough to keep you entertained. ""Zwei"" and ""Ein"", two memory whipped people, who are feared as the ""Phantom"" in the underworld, have an interesting chemistry between them.
- The Music : The creepy opening theme, the slow burn sad music during the first half or the badass [SuperStar](https://youtu.be/vEUGla7QRQc) soundtrack during the second half, the music doesn't let down and elevates the scene or moment it's being used.

- Time Skips & Tone Shifts : The Anime can be divided into two parts. The first half focusses on the main characters, while the later half is where the world building happens. What started as a insightful look on assassins changes into an political crime drama between gangs. While it isn't bad, the mood and tone of the shows changes which can/might disappoint a few people.
- Plot holes in later half : I started to think at a certain point in later half if the writer had changed cause some things doesn't make sense and feels illogical. After time skips, some characters doesn't even seemed aged well, while a certain cute little girl changed into a busty woman in only 2 years, which makes no sense considering the remaining cast. While you might be thinking, ""It's Anime so logic doesn't apply"", this Anime wants audience to know that the setting is very similar to real life. It reflects even in the characters, from design to dialogue, they don't feel like the usual Anime fluff but as mature characters from a mature show. It really breaks the immersion the Anime built up so far, which makes it very unnecessary.
- The Ending : See, this is the case which proves that the ending can make/break an Anime or show. Even if the show had a great beginning and middle, if it doesn't land the ending, it can make it a very mediocre one. That's exactly case here. The Ending tries to make you feel something, but it comes of the otherway, i.e, mediocre. What should've been good closure after everything the characters went through, ends up like a train wreck, that makes you feel everything is just.... pointless. I just couldn't care about it anymore.

Summary
Phantom - Requiem of the Phantom is a mature Anime noir with hit-crime/assassination, with good character development, only for it to destroy that, with it's very bad ending. What could've been a 8 or a 9/10 ends up being 5 or 6/10.
It'll disappoint you, as much as you enjoy it."
12679,"For some reason, I have very good luck discovering gems like this through screencapped memes. I'm surprised I've never heard of this anime until very recently.

Joshiraku is the pinnacle of anime comedy. I wouldn't be surprised if non-anime fans could find this show very enjoyable as well. Throughout every episode, comedic momentum is maintained quite well. There are no dull moments, and the contents of the show don't pander to any particular viewerbase. Instead, Joshiraku is overflowing past the brim with destruction of the fourth wall, and pokes fun at many stereotypical anime cliches spanning every genre. Joshiraku somehow manages to be something incredibly unique to the anime scene, while not doing anything much more complex than making fun of every other genre.

The one and only negative thing I can say about the show is that many jokes rely on the intricacies of kanji, and only native Japanese speakers or someone very fluent in the language would understand them. Just beginning to study the language, I can understand the gist of some of these jokes, but definitely not enough to fully appreciate them. But again, while there are many occurrences of these jokes, the majority of the comedy would be appreciated by anyone, Japanese speaking or not.

Digging deeper, the story is nonexistent. Period. This isn't a bad thing; Joshiraku doesn't need to rely on a story to be interesting. There's not much else to say about this.

The art is clean, smooth, and palatable for a lack of a better word. There's no girls with neon pink hair and breasts the size of pumpkins to deter normies or attract hentai fans. Backdrops are well-made and cozy as well.

The music is simply fantastic. I can confidently say this is the only anime I've never skipped an OP/ED on. They're catchy as hell, absolute bangers. 10/10

The characters feel unique and have good synergy with each other. Obviously they need to have the most effort put into making them out of anything else in the anime, as it's a comedy that does not rely on any story whatsoever. In short, the writers did good.

Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable anime. Would love a second season, but as it is said in the ending, all things inevitably end, and media such as shows or anime are often better ended sooner than later."

Introduction:
Because of the minimal dialog in Angel's Egg, much of the film's intended meaning is portrayed through visuals and symbols. Because of the surreal nature of the film (and no official explanation by its creators), it is open to multiple or even conflicting interpretations, as one can see below. Many or all of the symbols in Angel's Egg can be related to religion, specifically Christianity. Mamoru Oshii also directed Patlabor, Ghost in the Shell, and myriads of other works that contain Christian themes and references. He claimed to be a Christian himself and trained in seminary for priesthood in his youth, but is rumored to have renounced the religion before working on Angel's Egg.
In Japan, Angel Egg (tenshi no tamago) refers to a typical tachiguishi dinner, a stand-and-eat practice Oshii is fond of and he has explored in his 1987 debut live-action feature Akai Megane, before developing it as the central theme of his 2006 animation movie Tachiguishi-Retsuden.
However, for this film Oshii apparently adapted the idea of an egg to fit the parable of the sower and the seed, and other teachings of Yeshua-Jesus. 
img220()
The egg
(1)1st interpretation: The egg can be seen as symbolizing the young girl's innocence. It is something which she protects and holds on to, but is ultimately stolen.
(2)2nd interpretation: Another interpretation states that the egg is the ""spiritual seed"" planted in a human soul via the Gospel of Jesus Christ - a special kind of meme which tries to take root in a person's soul. It is something she protects amidst a dark world, but it is eventually ""reaped"" by the Christ-like character after she had journeyed with and entrusted him. Eventually, she reaches ""spiritual maturity"" while passionately pursuing the path of Christ, and thus bears fruit ""many times what was sown"", as the parable goes. This was indicated by the production of many eggs from her mouth (her spiritual ""fecundity"" or ""witness""). The small egg represents a ""quanta"", if you will, of the Gospel that was planted in her soul when she heard or saw something revelatory concerning God's Salvation. This must have happened before the portrayed story began. The egg was brought to life as a result of being ""wooed"" by the Christ-man, and then once it was fully released, she charged directly after the Christ on the ""narrow path"" (Matthew 7:13,14)to spiritual maturity. The metaphor is equivalent to a maturing plant producing heads of grain, but Oshii adapted Yeshua's parable to the production of eggs instead of seeds, possibly in order to merge it with the metaphor of the dove and the ark as expounded below.

The Big Eggs on Tree Stalks

Near the end of the film, we see organic tree-like structures holding giant eggs with unborn birds inside. These likely represent the spiritual being awaiting the realization of its true form in the afterlife- where each of these saints are ""glorified"", attaining angelic forms(flying birds being symbolic of Angels), as supported in the very end by: (1)the appearance of the giant eggs after her own small one had been cultivated by the Christ-figure. (2)the girl's angelic appearance as part of the Godhead (the giant eye-like thing).
The root-like growths holding the eggs were foreshadowed earlier by the Yeshua character as (paraphrased)""a great tree, sapping the ground to grow and reach up, as if to grasp... something."". The tree/egg combination, along with the Christ character's explanation of the tree of life, portrays it to be a symbol of true Christianity and its spiritual implications. He gives us the sense that the tree/eggs are the final stage of an evolving line of energy, matter, and eventually living things: initially emanating out from pure Spirit(Giant Eye descending), yet over the eons striving to return to the source... to finally ""grasp the hand that feeds it"", as it were. The eggs, we see, were located at the tops of the tree trunks, holding the unborn chicks. Each of the giant eggs probably represented a human soul which would be preserved through the Last Judgmenton the Noah's Ark of Christ (meaning Yeshua is a sort of spiritual ark for souls), and so become glorified as part of the Godhead, as we see in the end. In other words, the giant eggs represent the second to last step of the ultimate aim of life, the universe, and everything: dead(sleeping) saints awaiting their ultimate glorification. The very last step being the actual glorification or realization of the saints and assumption to the Godhead, as we saw in the end where the Godhead(giant floating eye) was populated by the permanent(eternal) presence of the saints, with our little girl among them.
img220()
The man
The man in Angel's Egg physically portrays a Christ-like figure. In the beginning he is seen standing on a chess board, facing the giant Eye (presumably representing the Godhead, especially God the Father capacity, since it was sending him out). He arrives in the girls life on a bizarre procession of mechanistic/organic(and phallic?!) machines, which most probably represent ancient Judaism, in reference to Matthew 11:12, where the ""Kingdom of God"" is forcefully advanced by the Law and the prophets. This explains the war-like (battle tanks) and distinctly male appearance of the machines.
He carries a cross on his back and wears bandages on his hands, both of which are strongly reminiscent of Christian mythos.
(1)1st interpretation: In this particular movie this figure is shown in a clearly negative light, first telling the girl that he would protect her and eventually stealing away from her the egg which she cherishes so lovingly. Following this line of interpretation, some have taken The Angel's Egg to represent Oshi's own fallout with Christianity.
(2)2nd interpretation: A different interpretation sees the figure in a very positive light: as being her companion and protector in a violent, illusory world, and bringing to fruition what she couldn't have done on her own. He uses the crucifix to do this, in reference to Matthew 16:24 He actually explains his motives for breaking the egg: Without opening it, one may never realize the potential of whats inside. He overcame her selfish tendency to keep the egg(gospel seed) hidden, by wooing her companionship and trust. This is probably an allusion to ""walking in Christ"" or ""living by the Spirit of Christ"".

The Fishermen and Fish

(1)1st interpretation: Fishermen and fish are popular, reoccurring symbols in Christian mythology.
(2)2nd interpretation: Another interpretation notes that in this particular case, the shifty fish shadows are those of the lobe-finned or Sarcopterygii genera, which are almost entirely extinct as a group. Thus, the shadows can be interpreted as shades of once-living things, but now dissipating from nature- becoming extinct. To apply the spiritual metaphor, the shadows most likely represent ephemeral and even demonic forms. It fits well with the concept of demonic illusions, because it is believed that demons are ""fallen"" angels. (""fallen"", as in cut off from and thus dissipating from God's creation, yet finding some sustenance and rest in the propagation of idolatry in humanity). see Mathew 12:43-45) Supporting this idea, these mirages are zealously pursued by the spearmen, yet never tangibly grasped or attained, and thus no ultimate fulfillment is found, and no innate hunger is sated. The spears are sharp projections attached to ropes. This most likely symbolizes the human spirit(will and conscience) projecting itself onto its environment, trying to form soul-attachments and identities in ephemeral things- passions, pleasures, fears, vices, addictions, fetishes, idolatry, etc.
In contrast, the fish enshrined in the Gothic church was colorful and vibrant, and the girl radiated white in its presence. Where the lobed-finned shadows probably represent the adoption of shifty goals and ephemeral pursuits which are all moving towards extinction, the colorful fish probably represents the Body of Christ- living; thriving; growing; adapting; and steadily surviving.

The Water
The water is a subtle yet strong underlying Typology (theology) present throughout the film. In the beginning, God descends into an ""ocean"" and the waters emanate out from the impact in waves, signifying the beginning of creation, where Jesus Christ the Logos (the white-haired man) is sent out to perfect the creation, ""glorifying God"" by gathering in human souls(in reference to Isaiah 55:11), as we see in the film. The water most likely symbolizes Spirit, specifically the Holy Spirit. Initially the girl collects small amounts of it and stores it away (the best she can do on her own), but in a foreshadowing moment early in the film, while starring into a pond she imagines herself to be fully immersed (after which the man shows up). In the end, the water floods everything, and she herself is drowned in it while pursuing the man- symbolizing Baptism with the Holy Spirit while chasing the path of Yeshua.
img220()
The Ark
Near the beginning of the film we see the shadow of an ark, which presumably the girl frequented. As the very last twist, we see the ark again at the end- this time slowly panning out. This is yet another example of Typology (theology), in which the story of the Ark, regardless of its historical details, is taken as a narrative allegory. Oshii probably borrowed the idea from the epistle of 1 Peter 3:20-22 regarding the moment of salvation, where the ark represents the preservation of the human spirit(will and conscience) amidst a spiritual ""flood"" or baptism of the rest of the mind, while demonic influences are purged.img220()
As the angle pans out in the last scene, we see a meta-ark, which also probably represents the salvation work of Christ on a larger scale. The entirety of the ""remnant"" of human souls is preserved through the Last Judgment by devoting itself to God through Christ, but not just a remnant of humanity, but also, a reconciliation of the entire universe is implied here. An idea likely inspired by Paul's epistle to the Romans in which he describes the ultimate goal of existence. Chapter 8:18-27.
img220()
The Dove
Drawing from the theme of all the 2nd interpretations above- while the ark represents Christ as a preservation of the remnant of human souls (and the universe reconciled through them in a mysterious fashion- (Romans 8:18-27)), the dove must represent all the souls of humanity, sent out by God into human bodies, but in the process of free will and sinful nature, alienate themselves from ""Him"" by sin. According to what is implied in this film, this severs a person's connection from Eternal Life in God-(the birds forgetting their origins, dying, and becoming fossilized). In the largest dialog section, the Yeshua character presents a variation of Genesis 8, in which the bird forgot where it came from, and probably died in the waters somewhere. He then makes an equivalence between the forgetful bird and humanity(including himself, as ""the son of man""). Shortly afterwards, they find the bird dead amongst the fossils, which symbolizes concepts found in Ephesians 2:1-3 i.e. ""spiritual death"" because of relational estrangement from God. This idea is supported further when the girl declares to have the bird alive and growing in the egg, which the Yeshua character treats with some skepticism because, as we see later, it was only a half-truth that she had the bird, since the egg was only the seed of the knowledge of salvation planted in her, and it only became a real bird after it was brought to fruition by Christ. Thus, the bird represents the human spirit initially created by God (dove sent out from ark), fallen in sin (bird forgets God and fossilizes),but then reconciled again to God through the Son (he uses the crucifix to cultivate what was sown, and later the giant tree/eggs emerge).
img220()
The Girl
The girl, of course, represents a spiritually immature person- but possibly also an actual child, since in the end she appears as part of the Godhead in a child-like form rather than in an adult form as are many of the other statues. She holds the egg in a way which looks like she's pregnant, which follows with the analogies above in which the gospel seed grows inside of a person, taking root in their soul, eventually ""birthing"" fruit, several times what was sown.(Mathew 13:23)

In conclusion
While there may be a few more allegories to draw from the film, we have provided tentative interpretations of the main themes above. It is interesting to note that the deeper nature of the film has eluded the usual anime fan-base since its release. Due to the exceedingly esoteric nature of the spiritual allegories presented, having them explained by someone familiar with Christian theology still puts the viewer in a difficult position."
528,"Despite being a huge fan of Pokemon as a kid, I did not watch much of the Pokemon TV show. I watched all of Diamond and Pearl while it was airing, but that was it. I didn’t watch the original series, not Advanced Generation, and basically I fell off the entire franchise just a few episodes into Best Wishes. However, before that point, while I wasn’t keeping up with the TV show, I was absolutely keeping up with the movies. I saw every Pokemon movie up through Arceus and the Jewel of Life, and that was how I stayed up to date on what the current Pokemon status quo was. I don’t remember every detail from all those movies- it’s a lot of movies, after all- but I have fond memories of all of them. They were consistently my favorite part of Pokemon, moreso than the TV show, even moreso than the games. The Pokemon movies were Pokemon to me, and my memories of them are the standard upon which I judge the entire franchise.

But there’s no telling what will happen to those memories as I'm re-watching them. It’s been over a decade, after all, and I first watched them as a kid without much discerning taste. The Pokemon movies define my memories of the franchise, but are they gonna hold up upon revisitation? Will the epic tales they tell stand the test of time and prove themselves as enduring, worthwhile additions to this megolithic franchise? Or will they reveal themselves as little more than cheap cash grabs, pandering to the lowest common denominator in order to score a few more fistfuls of dollars from eager tykes and their parents’ open wallets? And am I even gonna be able to see them with fresh eyes when my nostalgia goggles are so tight around my experiences with them? There’s only one way to find out: re-watch them in tandem with watching the show and discover what they leave me with now that I'm 22 with a far more discerning critical eye. It’s gonna be a weird, wild experience, but I’ve never backed down from a challenge before, and I don’t intend to start now. So let’s dive right into the first Pokemon movie, conveniently titled Pokemon: The First Movie, to see where this grand tradition started, and see if it still holds up after all this time.

Mewtwo Strikes Back is one of those movies that pretty much everyone remembers watching as a kid. I won’t spoil anything major in case some of you reading it haven’t seen it yet, but it tells the tale of Mewtwo, the first ever Pokemon clone. He was cloned from the DNA of the legendary first Pokemon Mew, created as a lab experiment by Team Rocket to be the strongest Pokemon ever, capable of conquering anyone and anything with his psychic powers. But Team Rocket made an incalculable mistake in their quest to create the strongest Pokemon: they actually succeeded. Mewtwo is an unbeatable powerhouse who no one can control, and he’s none too happy at finding out that the purpose of his creation was to be a slave to humanity. He goes full Frankenstein’s Monster and rebels against his creators, setting off on his own with a heart full of rage and a burning desire to forge a new meaning for his existence, even if it means crushing the entire world under his unstoppable heel. Meanwhile, Ash and company are enjoying their adventures as always when an unexpected invitation embroils them in Mewtwo’s cataclysmic plans. Can they stop the mad Pokemon from destroying the world, or have the scars of his creation sunk in too deep to accept anything less than Armageddon?

Just by that description, I think you can get a sense of what made this movie leave such a lasting impact on the generation of kids who first experienced it. Pokemon has gone big in the past, but this is the first time the scope of its narrative has truly become massive. Mewtwo’s tale isn’t just another exciting romp or just another badass showdown; it’s a full-on epic tragedy, steeped in dark portent and an undercurrent of mythic awe that makes you feel like you’re watching a legend come to life before your eyes. The stage feels grander, the emotions rawer, the ultimate meaning far more ancient and everlasting. Mewtwo himself is a far more mature character than you might expect, driven to evil deeds not out of pettiness or inherent cruelty, but because of deep existential trauma that’s crippled his ability to grow as a sentient being. His entire purpose for existing in the first place was to be a tool for other’s to wield; he was born without meaning, and he projects that self-hatred onto the world around him as he rages against what he sees as the unchangeable evil of humans and Pokemon. In a lot of ways, I think Mewtwo Strikes Back was many of our first introductions to the idea that fiction would ask difficult questions of us. It could present us with villains who had to be stopped but demanded out sympathy all the same. It could present us with philosophical conundrums on the meaning of life, how we’re born versus who we choose to be. Sure, it’s not exactly Aristotle, but the epic scope and depth of the film’s ideas in contrast with its kid-friendly presentation make for the rare film that can ask make six-year-olds to step out of their comfort zones and face grander, less comfortable ideas than they might be used to.

Of course, if you remember anything from this film as an adult today, it’s sure to be the opening and ending sequences. The film’s middle stretch gets a little draggy as it puts all the pieces in place for the final showdown; there’s a lot of people and Pokemon involved, and even Team Rocket gets a b-story as they sneak around Mewtwo’s fortress to give the audience a tour of the inner machinery driving his plan. Also, this franchise has not yet lost its unfortunate affinity for cheesy 90s pop ballads in place of emotional heft. It still all looks very nice, as OLM flexes their movie budget to bring the Pokemon world to life like never before. The character animation on humans and Pokemon alike is fluid and satisfying, with plenty of nuanced little details that speak to their personalities. There’s an obvious effort to animate everyone in frame, not just the most important characters, background characters react to events in the foreground, Pokemon scuffle and play along the sidelines, and it goes a long way to selling the reality of this world. The cinematography gets an upgrade as well, with plenty of sweeping landscape shots that show off the well-realized background art and let you sink into the majesty of the environments. And good god, is it great seeing the Pokemon battles realized with the full potential of animation. The action is fast and furious, everyone’s pulling out a dozen different moves, and the impact of every blow rings across the screen. This is the first time the Pokemon fights have felt as organic and explosive as they deserve to, like we’re watching two sentient beings try to triumph over each other instead of just video game characters exchanging turn-based blows. It’s not exactly Ghibli, but it’s polished to a damn fine mirror shine all the same.

But that opening and ending. Sweet buttery Christ, that opening and ending. There’s a reason those two sequences have lingered in our collective cultural consciousness for upwards of two decades now; they are truly jaw-dropping. The prologue details Mewtwo’s creation, subjugation and liberation with the gravitas befitting a Shakesperian anti-hero; it pushes the franchise’s usual light-hearted good nature to the side in favor of pure mythic weight. And watching the evolution of Mewtwo’s consciousness as he becomes consumed by the darkness of his situation makes for one of the most gripping, awe-inspiring supervillain origin stories ever made. And a lot of credit needs to go to Mewtwo’s voice actor for pulling that off, because he sells the fuck out of this character’s tragic rage (honestly, the entire dub cast is in top form here). By the time he’s left his captors behind and sworn revenge on the world that’s wronged him, you’re left utterly spellbound; you just witnessed the birth of a vengeful god in a franchise about making cute plush critters battle each other. And without spoiling the ending, yeah, we all make fun of how cheesy and contrived that resolution is, but as it’s just letting that last battle play out, the weight and exhaustion and pain growing and growing and Pikachu taking a stand and Ash charging into the fray and the horrible wordless silence that settles in right before everything is set right again… Fuck, man. I’m not even ashamed to admit it still made me cry over a decade later. That’s the mark of something truly special; even though it’s a kid’s movie, it (mostly) lets its darkness be honest, uncompromising, and true.

So yeah, as amazed as I am to say it, Pokemon: The First Movie still holds up. It’s not perfect, and it does drag in the places between when it gets to really flex its more epic ideas, but your childhood self wasn’t wrong to find as much value in it as you did. It’s a shockingly resonant piece of epic fiction that pushes Pokemon to the next level and grounds it in something darker, grander, and more awe-inspiring than it’s even been capable of before. It’s a kid’s film through and through, but it’s the most colossal kid’s film I can possibly imagine that still appeals to such young sensibilities. Time and time again, Pokemon has proven itself to be more than just a money-printing machine; there’s a reason we keep coming back to these characters and their stories so many years later. And Mewtwo Strikes Back, while flawed, is proof that this franchise is capable of some truly incredible things."
108478,"In 1995, the movie Ghost in the Shell presented us with a visual dramatization about the borderline between human consciousness and artificial intelligence. We met Major Motoko Kusanagi, a sentient cyborg who has a personality and goes through similar feelings to us (“I feel fear, anxiety, isolation and darkness”), such as when being alive seems like an absurd phenomenon no different of a dream.

The film puts a question mark about what it means to be a human being and its relationship with reality, but mainly from an existencial point of view. We may ask if whether a person’s “essence” can be transferred to a cyber state, but these differences are essentially semantic/conceptual. We already live in a time where artificial intelligence is absorbed and normalized in all aspects of our everyday lives, and the rest is only a matter of progress.

No Guns Life (2019) is a Japanese animated series set in a mega-metropolis of the future where humans who have cybernetic implants are common and referred to as “Extended”. In the universe of the series, life is grim and dark. After a war, many Extended are former soldiers who resort to crime to resist. A mega-corporation (Berühren Corporation) who controls the city by developing these cyber extensions without restrictions. All others adapt to their needs. Thus, the series questions on the body as an instrument and swings between these principle of interaction in biology: symbiosis, parasitism, commensalism. For Berühren Corporation, everyone is replaceable.

The protagonist is Juuzou, an Extended Private Detective who solves problems caused by others Extended. His head is a revolver. In all characters we observe the format and conception of the cyber extension is a development of an intention. The implant is the determining element that gives the body advantages and without it, it is no longer a cog in the machine and becomes worthless.

Juuzo’s life takes a turn when an Extended renegade asks him to protect a boy named Tetsurō from the Berühren Corporation who wants to capture him. Juuzou sees that the boy has been the subject of many experiments: the tendons of his arms and legs, as well as the vocal cords severed, making him unable to move or speak for himself. Juuzou has a partner named Mary, a young woman who performs back-alley maintenance on Extended in a mafia-controlled immigrant district, one of the few places out of the Berühren corporation control.

The look of film-noir, intriguing jazz music, with a cyberpunk setting along with hard boiled literature influences, No Guns Life portrays what transhumanism could be like. In the character Juzzo, a mercenary detective whose head is a revolver deals with a direct conception of his purpose. In the character Tetsurō, a boy who has been experimented since childhood and whose greatest atrocities are made to justify progress in discovering innovative technology deployments. We are currently experiencing an early stage of transhumanism: plastic surgery, animal cloning, sex reassignment as well as the first steps of DNA manipulation. With the current advances in biotechnology, it is inevitable that humans will eventually upgrade the species. Filled with Extendeds, the series gives a perspective about the human being as an instrument, as a tool.

Utility has always created an identity problem, even without the mechatronic part. From the beginning, the human being created the concept of God to justify his actions, explained in reverse in the book of Genesis, “God made man in His image and likeness.” Man’s wills derive directly from his biological tools, and are now more broad than ever. And we have other innate biological tools that allow for many capabilities and skills, such as the brain, arms, legs that make us creators, builders, etc. What makes the difference is the conception of the world as will.

“My words are like an illusion, but I will not stop believing,
as this is the only proof that I am not a tool.”

139820,"The Otomoe Villainess genre has been picking up steam lately with multiple series receiving adaptations. 

For those unaware, the genre often features a girl being reincarnated as the villainess of a dating-sim game, often set in a magical medieval world. The protagonist, having knowledge of the game's entire story, must then find a way to prevent her oncoming demise, usually through some sort of romantic endeavor.

You might already be familiar with [My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!](https://anilist.co/anime/104647/My-Next-Life-as-a-Villainess-All-Routes-Lead-to-Doom/), otherwise known as Hamefura. While that was the first Otome show to really enter the mainstream, as a comedy first and foremost, it's quite different from what this show has to offer.

This show wastes absolutely no time getting to the action.

Our protagonist is reincarnated as the villainess, Aileen, right as the game reaches its climax. Publicly dumped at a ball by her fiancee Cedric in favor of the game's protagonist Lilia, Aileen realizes that she's speeding towards her demise. 

Aileen knows that she's destined to her doom at the hands of Claude, the outcast demon prince who's the brother of Cedric. In order to avoid her death, she decides not to prepare for her fight with Claude, but instead to marry him. She also must overcome Cedric and Lilia, who stand to block her at every turn.

Claude, as a half-demon, was outcast from the royal family and now presides over all demons. The lasting effects of a prior demon/human conflict ultimately damaged the relationship between the two, and there's an uneasy peace that permeates throughout.


The show splits itself into 3 distinct arcs, with each of them covering the plot different games in the fictional otome series. Each of these arcs could be an entire show in their own right, with their own central conflict and a batch of characters added to the cast. As a result, the story moves at a brisk pace, keeping it fresh and engaging every week. There's not a single filler episode, and there's barely any downtime either.

At times, the pace can be a little too fast. There's some elements that are handwaved, and quite a few characters remain underdeveloped. For some shows, this could result in something feeling directionless, or having underwhelming climaxes. In this case, it results in an extremely focused story which never strays too far on any tangents. 

This show constantly has a sense of urgency, and Aileen is constantly forced to tackle new scenarios. There's a few twists and turns as the show progresses; however, the brisk pace leaves little room for nuance or anything extremely original. While this could be problematic for other shows, here, the strong cast elevate the otherwise average writing.


Aileen is a fantastic protagonist who ultimately turns the series from something average into something special. 

Hamefura, the otome mentioned earler, struggled a little because its protagonist, Catarina Claes, lost all of her villainess edge post-reincarnation. Of course, as a comedy, it had a different purpose than this show, but knowing her helps viewers appreciate Aileen even more.

Catarina feels like someone overwrote the villainess original personality. In contrast, Aileen truly feels like someone was reincarnated into the  villainess personality. 

She's bold, brash, cunning, and independent. She keeps the sharp edge of a villainess while channeling that energy to help herself and others. Things don't come to her; she goes out an makes things happen herself. Every time she's knocked down, she gets back up and keeps moving forward. She's a protagonist who you can't help but cheer for. On top of that, Aileen is also sensitive, and she shows a cuter side when teased by Claude. 

[Rie Takahashi](https://anilist.co/staff/119331/Rie-Takahashi) does a fantastic job in this role, and she truly elevates Aileen to being an amazing protagonist with her exceptional range.

Claude  is an interesting main love interest for Aileen. One would expect the final boss of the otome game to be more antagonistic; however, Claude shows kindness to Aileen. He pairs extremely well with her, and is also bold and cunning in his own right. The two have a delightful chemistry and bounce off of each other well. 

Without spoiling, its hard to talk about Cedric and Lilia. [Kana Hanazawa](https://anilist.co/staff/95185/Kana-Hanazawa) does a great job a changing Lilia's personality with the flip of a switch. She goes from cute to evil without hesitation, and this helps make her an antagonist that you'll enjoy disliking.

The rest of the characters serve their roles well. Although there's not much depth to the supporting cast, this doesn't hurt the story at all. By constantly adding new characters with every arc, the shallowness of the individuals is balanced out just by the sheer volume of the group.

The art of the series isn't anything incredibly special, but it also doesn't get in the way of enjoying the series. It's not a show that you'll remember for having outstanding animation, but it's not a show you'll remember for having awful animation either. The background soundtrack is equally mundane, and there's nothing that gets in the way.

The OP's visuals are ok and get the job done, but the song stands out as something special.

youtube(https://youtu.be/eWPySWPBOtk)

The song is sung by Rie Takahashi, but it's not labeled as a character song by Aileen. Sometimes, characters songs can feel off if the seiyuu is forced to sing a style that doesn't match their solo work. The staff producing the song are the same people who work on her solo music, and as a result, the song fits like a glove for her. There's even slight additions to the OP, reflecting each distinct arc of the series. The song feels right in place with her other songs like this one, which might as well be the OP anyways. Rie Takahashi's solo music is absolutely worth checking out if you're a fan of this OP.

youtube(https://youtu.be/8mQ0WYwgpnE)

The ED, by Nomick, is equally as fantastic and was a great way to cap off each episode.

youtube(https://youtu.be/EAC2kBMAhbw)



I'm the Villainess, So I'm Taming the Final Boss is an excellent entry point for newcomers to the otome villainess genre. It's a little rough around the edges, but it makes up for that by having a focused plot and very strong main cast. While it's not a show that will go down as one of the greats, it's one that was pretty good all around. If you missed it as it was airing, the brisk pace will make it an easy and enjoyable binge."
8129,"TW // This review mentions sexual assault. It also contains spoilers.

There is a lot to like about Princess Jellyfish, a staple of the josei genre. The premise, character development, and art style are all very unique for an anime with such a short run. The OP and ED slap (LOVE IS COMING BAAAAAACK!). But most importantly, Princess Jellyfish addresses a number of topics that have been deemed taboo for anime. The characters deal with their problems and newfound discoveries in awkward ways, but I believe this awkwardness is part of its merit. If I had to use one word to describe this series, it would be “human.”

Princess Jellyfish follows Kurashita Tsukimi, an 18-year-old girl who has moved to Tokyo to become an illustrator. Ever since she was little, she has had a special interest in jellyfish, and connects them to her fond memories of her deceased mother. Tsukimi lives in a boarding house with four other otaku girls, whose interests range from traditional Japanese fashion and dolls to attractive old men (no joke). Due to their experiences as outsiders in society, the women rely on each other and vow to keep men out of their domicile.

One night, Tsukimi has a chance encounter with a beautiful young woman who helps her adopt a pet jellyfish. However, the next day, she finds out that this woman is not a woman at all - but a crossdressing young man named Kuranosuke. How can she keep up this friendship without the other otaku girls finding out she has let a man in? And will this friendship possibly develop into something more? These are the questions explored by the series.

I am an anime viewer who thrives on good character development. And despite only having 11 episodes, Princess Jellyfish does a fantastic job. I related heavily to Tsukimi and her experiences as a social outcast with hopes of being more outgoing. As her relationship with Kuranosuke develops, she has an internal dialogue with her deceased mother, saying, “Mom, why do you think he goes to so much trouble for us?...For some reason, a moment ago my heart felt so heavy and painful, and now it’s suddenly lighter…Somehow, I’m starting to feel so light-hearted.” As Tsukimi and Kuranosuke become closer and open up to each other, we see them both start to heal from what they fear most in the world. Their story is a triumph for everyone who feels like they will never find their person or their place in the world.

The other major aspect I loved about this anime was its way of addressing taboo subjects. For example, Kuranosuke is a crossdresser who identifies as male. He crossdresses because he loves fashion and feeling pretty. While some of the terms used may be outdated, the treatment of the issue of gender expression is very honest and pleasing to me as a trans viewer. Other issues explored in the story include age gaps and sexual assault. Shu, Kuranosuke’s older brother, is a 30-year-old man who works in the local government. He has sexual trauma that arose out of him seeing his father cheating on his mother when he was a child. When he meets Tsukimi through Kuranosuke, he feels a connection to her and wants to comfort her when the world gets her down. Shu never does anything inappropriate with Tsukimi, but the series does deal delicately with how he traverses a relationship with a person he feels strongly towards, in a non-romantic and non-sexual way. Additionally, a woman in the series who is working to push a remodeling project in the city blackmails Shu to make him do what she wants. She drugs him and takes him home, taking a picture to make it look like they had sex, even though they did not. When Shu realizes what has happened, he is dazed and shocked. As he arrives home, Kuranosuke says unknowingly, “You look like a soap opera heroine who just got molested.” As Kuranosuke races off, Shu quietly says to himself, “So that’s it…I guess I was molested.” This moment broke my heart. This is another example of how the series deals with a difficult topic in a very honest and sincere way.

I think this show’s main flaw is its length. The manga has 93 chapters, while the anime has only 11 episodes. This leaves a lot of the main conflicts unresolved. Tsukimi and Kuranosuke’s “will they, won’t they” relationship is left on a cliffhanger. However, the loose ends not being tied up is a good way to advertise the manga, since these characters are so addictive.

Overall, Princess Jellyfish is just like its main character: imperfect, but incredibly engaging and heartwarming. Love really IS coming back!

REVIEWER’S NOTE: I am not fluent in Japanese, so I cannot attest to how current or appropriate the terms used for crossdressers are in the original audio. However, the captions I read had some words such as “transvestite,” which may be outdated to some."
166710,"SPOILERS WARNING - PLOT POINTS FROM LAST EPISODES DISCUSSED

Having been a fan of DC, Marvel and comic book superheroes and villains way before ever scratching the surface of anime, I came into the Suicide Squad Isekai with high hopes. Even if more recent movies in DC and Marvel were extremely weak, I always found that animation stood a step above, untainted. And upon hearing that one of the most memorable anti-hero/villain groups was getting the love from a Japanese animation studio, (even if in-house DC), I was willing to give this a good try. I wasn't going to take any early opinions as my viewpoint of it, but judge it as a whole. And what did it bring? Nothing but disappointment.

I know that some people will immediately say, ""but why didn't you drop it?"" - and simply answered, if you want to properly review something, I find that a complete experience is necessary, to avoid any dispute ""that it got better at the end."" It did not. And look no further then the core team, that resembles their Western counterparts in name only. Harley was enjoyable, but not as Harley Quinn, but as a typical tsundere character in any run-of-the-mill anime. Is that a bad thing? No. But when you are bringing titular, well-established characters to a new medium, assume that your audience are people who are already acquainted with the character. Especially with one Harleen Quinzel, which has been adapted in video games, animation and live-action already. When the whole trifecta has been explored, you have a lot of reference material to compare it to, yet the writing here is never given any of the nuance that it's lent in its other iterations. Clayface, Deadshot, Peacemaker and King Shark are basically reduced to a bunch of bumbling buffoons. Not villains who have given Batman a run for his money, but just some shitty villains-turned-heroesque for the sake of it. The only person given even an ounce of character development is Harley, and even hers is superficial at best.

Now, the plus side to this anime. The actual animation quality is pretty good. It's why my score isn't rock bottom, because a lot of what was being shown was easy on the eyes and actually refreshing considering how many animes in the Summer 2024 slate were just CG'd to absolute shit. So that was a good change of pace, and brought my opinion a cut above. But because character motivation and overall plot narrative never actually have any meaningful factors driving the story forward, and the studio choose to just ""let stuff happen"" when the plot demands it, it just, well, happens. You're thinking to yourself, yeah, this is cool but I don't even know what the fuck I'm meant to be watching? Like yay, they saved the city! But what or why or how? And why do we care so little about the initial setup with Amanda Waller? I've seen her maybe a handful of times, and this was a solid 3h 30m+ of watch time. Even when James did The Suicide Squad, he had the sense to keep Viola David (Amanda Waller) as a big driving factor for what the team was doing. You felt a sense of urgency for what was going on, and that she might pop anyone's head at any given moment, even for the most minuscule of things. Why did they only leave it for the end and make it meaningless? So you're telling me these guys are heroes now and none of the death threats actually mattered? Even if it was Clayface, you spit in your own stakes and make the effort mean nothing if you make the main antagonistic force a joke. Like this anime turned out to be.

If this is what DC have to offer to the anime community, respectfully, keep it to yourself. We don't need more checklist and assembly-line superhero TV shows that suck. CW did that with a lot of your IPs. You've done some of it yourself with your recent movies. Crisis on Infinite Earths was stellar, and Batman: Caped Crusader is a decent iteration, but you really screwed this up. This doesn't deserve a season 2, even if they set one up. Try again with some other more recognizable name, but a first season for any anime is the most important one to get you invested in the world and what's going on, and I have never been more bored in my entire life. This is an anime you'd watch if you've literally watched everything else that's even remotely interesting. It isn't a top pick, or even a top 20 pick. It's an anime. Or tries to be, at least. And definitely doesn't deserve the Isekai title. Putting this show in the same category as the likes of Reincarnated as a Slime, is a crime. 

As a closing note - if you enjoyed this anime, then that's okay too. You can enjoy things for the sake of enjoying them, but I think if you want to use already established characters in a new format, you have to change them which both respects the source but also puts your own spin to it to make it stand out. And this does not elevate, enhance or change anything positively from these characters, but chooses to use them for their namesake as an attraction but never break the mold of any C-tier Isekai, and given how much they gut the source, only hurt these IPs instead. If you're expecting this to be a DC story or anything of quality, look elsewhere. James has once again let us down."

Professional manga creation was never pleasant work. The ammount of time spent on this work is unimaginable. Write original story, interesting characters and drawing all details most carefully is not as easy task at all. In addition, there can arise various mental and health problems and everything is all in order to satisfy the readers as much as possible.  ""Bakuman"" will take us to the world of manga where two high school students will risk their career to create a manga which will be good enough to get an anime adaptation. Get ready for a great story where you will laugh with the heroes, be moved more than once and end the adventure satisfied with the achievements of these two mangakas.

Story:
""Bakuman"" begins by introducing two middle school students, Moritaka Mahiro and Takagi Akito. While Mashiro has average grades and wants to live like any other Japanese person. But Akito despite having good grades, plans to become a mangaka. They are apparently complete opposites, but they are united by the fact that they both love manga more than any other person. Akito, first noticed Mashiro's incredible artistic talent and decides to involve him in the creation of his stories. Mashiro at first had a negative attitude towards this offer. The situation changes by making a promise to a classmate. Their journey of creating mangas begins.

""Bakuman"" can engage the viewer for long hours. In it's early episodes the pacing is really intense so there is not a single time for being bored, the story develops at a dynamic pace and encourages you to watch the next episode. This production is incredibly accurate when it comes to the realism of a struggling newcomer mangakas life, Mashiro called this job a ""gamble"" which is a statement that the anime does for three seasons. Our characters must constantly fight to ensure that their manga will not be axed due to poor performance. Eternally creating new titles for the next big competition is nothing rare here. I must also admit that even such a plot can keep me in suspense. Not once i was stressed out together with the characters whether or not they manage to stay in the rankings. Over time, they meet more and more colleagues in the industry, and more precisely, enemies, which they must surpass for their dream to come true.

We don't get a typical shounen here, in which the main characters suddenly get better and better, but they have to struggle with new difficulties all the time. Going further into history, we begin to see some drama about the characters. It is associated with personal and even professional problems. They often doubt their skills or are on the verge of ending their careers. The story, despite its pace, sometimes takes a turn to explain certain issues to us or spend more time showing us problems our characters has to deal with. Sometimes there is too much of it. Monotony is also a problem that arises from time to time in the series. In the end, we get seventy-five episodes about the same but different things. You can easily see that the author was aware of this and developed the plot by adding more and more characters and plot threads. The ending is not the best, it's just simply, which everyone can expect. Too bad there will not be any plot twists in it.

Of course, ""Bakuman"" still has a romance tag to it. We will not forget about any of it the three seasons. We get enough scenes from it, with a good balance between drama and comedy. But the romantic threads were not carried out well. They were terribly prolonged, often uninteresting, and finally forced to use the simplest exits. Compared to other titles of the same genre, the quality is much worse.

Characters:
The characters are what make Bakuman a better series. We are introduced to many well-written, realistic characters who sooner or later get the character development arcs. They are not empty. It's easy to identify them, cheer them on, stress or sympathize with them. The positivity is that the protagonists are not doomed to themselves, because they have a lot of friends who are always ready to help one another. Even other mangakas don't hold back from giving guidance to these guys, which helps them a lot in achieving their goal. The ever-developing brotherliness between Mashiro and Akito is pleasuring to watch, and the relationships between the other characters are very nice. 

Character development is an important factor in this anime. With each episode, the characters becomes more emotionally mature and realize that this is not fun. The romance is also making itself felt, but the progress is still slow and uninteresting.

It is also worth adding that all mangakas are a reflection of real creators responsible for outstanding works. Mashiro and Akito reflect the duo responsible for this story. The first known and main antagonist of the anime, Niizuma Eiji is a genius based on Eiichiro Oda, the creator of ""One Piece"" who won second place at the ""Tezuka Award"" at the age of seventeen. On the other hand, Eiji won this award by being two years younger. The enemies you meet in the series are the next characters with similarities to the real creators can easily be noticed.

Graphics:
Let me put it briefly: it's great. A freely selected color palette adds emotion not only to the characters, but above all to the viewers. While watching your impressions will often change. The background looks incredibly picturesque and has many refined details about it. I would not be lying if I said that sometimes the viewer may spend more time watching the background than what is happening closer. Character designs are maybe simpler than the art, but the facial expressions are quite specific and in own way it's a good solution. Interestingly, while watching the manga creation process, the view is often changed to the guys works, thanks to which we can observe the increasing progress and how much they are still missing from the master level. I must add that the illustrations themselves look like they were taken from the real world, it's really effective. Art plays a very important role, without them the feelings from it would not be the same.

Both the openings and the endings of the series were made very well. The opening has a lot of animations and you can see that a lot of money has been invested in them. However, that doesn't mean the endings are anywhere below it. They are characterized by a large number of well-chosen transitions that end the episode perfectly.The art design was aesthetically pleasing and it would be a challenge to choose a better animation.
img(

Sound:
""Bakuman"" has a wide variety of songs. There will be no shortage of calmness, romance-suited songs, rock, electronics or other exciting music background. Openinigs and endings belong to the calmer part of the tracks, they fit perfectly without destroying the mood delivered in each anime episodes. The soundtrack effectively fits charming scenes while listening to it, we can feel a note of nostalgia, which makes a great impression. Unfortunately, the music, although it harmonizes perfectly with the rest of the aspects of the series, will rather appeal to specific types of audience.

Speaking of Seiyuu while listening to the voices of the characters, you can easily associate them with someone. And yes, the vast majority of them have already voiced popular and liked titles. They did a great job, perfectly blending and reflecting their voices to the characters. Okamoto Nobuhiko deserves special praise, without his voice Niizuma Eiji's character would not be the same. If I were to point out the biggest advantage of Bakuman, it would be voice actors.

Watanabe Jun, who also worked on such titles as ""Kuroko no Basket season 2"" and ""Little Witch Academia"", was responsible for the sound production. The composition belonged to ""Audio Highs"".

Conclusion/Summary:
For this title certainly cannot be denied originality. The simple idea of ​​creating a manga was presented in the most interesting way possible. Although it is monotonous in some of the following episodes, it is still not a bad production. Aside from a weak romance, it's hard to find major flaws in it. Technically, every part of it has been carefully well-done, which all viewers will appreciate. This anime is a great choice for beginners and old fans alike.

Tsurune is an anime directed by [Takuya Yamamura]( https://anilist.co/staff/126449/Takuya-Yamamura) which is based on a light novel of same name, by [Kotoko Ayano](https://anilist.co/staff/124010/Kotoko-Ayano) with illustrations by [Chinatsu Morimoto]( https://anilist.co/staff/124011/Chinatsu-Morimoto). Anime was produced by Kyoto Animation in fall 2018. 
 img 320 ()
Plot revolves around a young man, Minato Narumiya and kyūdō club in Kazemai high school. Our protagonist used to be in his middle school's kyūdō club until an incident in his last tournament caused him to quit archery. His friends Seiya Takehaya and Ryōhei Yamanouchi try to rope him into rejoining the kyūdō club in high school, which he refuses to, at first. This story is about how our protagonist relearns what was it that made him attracted to kyudo with the help of a really great cast of characters. This is such an appreciable story about rehabilitation and teamwork. The presentation of story is done through really serene visuals and elegant pacing. What this anime best is representing the essence of kyūdō in story and characters. Motivation of protagonist towards the Archery is so pure and yet so real.

img(v)

Kyūdō is a Japanese martial art of archery. This beautiful form of sports, is exhibited in one of the most beautiful ways I have seen in anime. Anime captures the true essence of art like none other I have seen before. This anime forefronts true spirit of kyūdō that is, [Shin Zen Bi](https://www.ikyf.org/shinzenbi.html) rather beautifully. Where;

- Shin: Shin means true shooting is the one with no deceit; 
- Zen: Zen is the manifestation of the ethical aspect of kyūdō which involves Rei (courtesy) and Fuso (non-confrontation) requires one to always stay calm and not lose their composure.
- Bi: Beauty of kyūdō, which lies in Shin and Zen.

Each aspect of kyūdō has been touched upon rather lovingly by the anime, and I truly appreciate how well it was displayed through our main protagonist. 

I cannot encapsulate true beauty of this anime without going into spoiler territory, so from this point forward spoiler warning. 
One of the main aspects of the story, which I really love, is how the rehabilitation of character was not a physical one but instead a mental one, that is, target panic. This gave an in depth of what character is like and what is it that makes kyūdō important to him. He relearns this with the help of Shin, which is true shooting without any thought in mind. 
img(v)
Another thing this show does greatly is Teamwork, often with sports shows, teamwork is not as much explored, but this show goes deep with the philosophy of teamwork and how it makes a team sports much more compelling than the individual sports. Our team of boys Minato, Seiya, Ryōhei, Nanao and Kaito really make a good team; they go through a perfect balance of growth in the show. Each member of team grows individually with focus on self-acceptance and also acceptance of other members of team without any prejudice. Throughout the show we see how our team grows and gradually come to accept one another. It is as Seiya says it’s like the tale of three arrows, except it’s five arrows, I guess. Which encapsulates perfectly how team works. Seiya’s quest for his friendship with Minato, Ryohei’s  quest for self-acceptance, Nanao’s quest for helping Kaito, Kaito’s quest on focus and acceptance of others and finally Minato’s quest for Tsurune;  Everyone got room to grow, and they did beautifully. 

Our coach Masaki Takigawa is also very compelling character with his own character arc. He grows throughout the story and learns from his students. His initial motivation of “revenge” is changed during the course of time. I love how his character was explored. Although the car accident, clichéd, wasn’t necessary. Also why’d you cut my man’s beautiful locks, it should be illegal.
img(v)

A thing which I thought could have made this even better was, focusing on the female members of the kyūdō club; Like Rika Seo, she was one of the characters I was most interested in as she represented perfect form of Zen, amongst all the members of the club. Show is definitely not without its flaws, it has some of the clichés, but they can overlooked easily. 
img(v)

Will I recommend this show, of course I will, If you want to watch something healing with beautiful visuals and sound design, definitely do watch this. This is not a regular fast paced sports anime, and does gives you space to breathe and think about it."
127050,"Koroshi Ai had such an unsatisfying ending and looked like a simple ad for the manga that tells you ""this is a bad adaptation. We know. Just go read the manga for the answers."" There was no payoff were it looked there was going to be after it all. It is an anime that feels like the source material is good but was cursed by this adaptation. The premise is very interesting and had me hooked despite the majority issues. I can't deny I liked this and loved the story's potential among all the discussions cursing it and hating it. It's a romantic mystery story about two people with a connected past. 

Chateau is an incompetent bounty hunter that can't do anything right. She's awkward and angry much at the time while putting up with a man that reminds her of ""something."" Song Ryang-ha is a competent assassin of great skill who takes an interest in her. He makes the show. He's a great character and can be both funny and horrifying. Maybe it's just the terrible way the adaptation executes it, but many times when he kills someone I laughed at how they portrayed it. No matter how much she tries to push him away, smack him, and overall try to avoid and turn him down, he always comes back around to try and woo her. She's too innocent to realize what she really has.

Even though I could easily score this so much lower, I did enjoy it. And yet, this makes it even more frustrating because the manga must be so much better than this. Song felt too goofy in his portrayal in this adaptation. It feels like he should have come off as more sinister, and I am sure the manga does this.

After a rough start, the mystery aspect starts to kick in, and this at least made it much more better and interesting. During the later half, their pasts get explored, and their connection gets somewhat explained. For the most part, Song's past is catching up to him, and Chateau gets dragged into it. Still, no matter how much Chateau turns him down and overall sees him as a roach, he protects her and seems sincere about caring about her. Chateau, because she's clueless, oblivious, and has the personality of a lamp post, doesn't get it. Yet, there is a charm to this that made me look forward to each episode despite that the coloring in this anime is ugly.

The only character I didn't like is Jim. Why won't they draw his mouth? that kept annoying me throughout. The animation isn't even strong or that good to begin with. At least the music seemed good with it's piano and mystery tracks. By the end, I'm internally yelling at Chateau who is much too clueless about what Song wants.

At least this shameless ad converted me. I do want to read the manga and see where this goes. A season 2 sounds like a mistake, but I'd shamelessly watch it and continue supporting it."
384,"HOLY SHIT THIS ANIME FUCKING SUCKS! Gantz started off interesting, ""two high school boys gets hit by a train, dies, gets teleported to a room with a bunch of random people who have also died and in the room there is  a black orb named Gantz that tells these dead people to kill a certain alien and if you kill these aliens you get points and if you get enough points you get to leave and live a normal life.""  What made this anime so bad was the characters, the slow pacing, and the trash dialogues, these characters are some of the worst characters I've ever seen in all  of anime. The pacing in this anime is often slow because the characters spend 5-10 minutes talking about useless shit instead of trying to fight these crazy human killing absolutely insane aliens.

Ok. lets start with the slow pacing, in this anime you're going to see a lot of unnecessary talking and this can go on for majority of the episode. in episode 11 the characters spent the entire episode yelling at each other about whether they should shoot the alien that's standing right in front of them. Keep in mind some of these characters have already done this whole ""find the alien kill the alien"" thing yet they still argue over wehther they should pull their gun trigger or not. It blows my mind how stupid these characters are. 

By now you know that I hate the characters in this anime so let me  tell you exactly why I hate these characters starting with Kishimoto, Kei aka the useless girl with big tits whose only purpose is fan service. 

Kishimoto, Kei is a girl who died after cutting her own wrist, and just like every other character who have died she ended up in the room with everyone else. This girl does nothing but hide and rely on others to do every thing. It's really annoying to watch this girl get mad at others for not helping certain characters but she isn't doing shit either. In episode 11 or 12 one of the character was in big trouble and this bitch is standing there yelling at others to help a  character that's in danger instead of helping that character herself when she literally has a gun in her hands. 
img150()


Next up is Masaru Katou a 6 foot tall pussy bitch who is too scared to shoot aliens that is literally killing everybody. Katou is the ""hero"" of the story, this guy just constantly tries to save others and it gets super annoying. One of the main reason it gets annoying is because Katou expects to save people without killing aliens. Which is pretty much impossible in a kill or be killed situation. Katou isn't scared to beat the shit out of humans but when it comes to hurting aliens with a gun its just something he refuses to do. 
img150()


Finally its  is Kurono, Kei, I don't hate this this perverted, wimpy ass bitch as much as I hate the other character because he does get better overtime. Kurono does nothing but thinks about having sex with the useless girl Kishimoto. There are fucking aliens running around killing people and all Kurono thinks about is sex and tits. Kurono is literally dead and instead of being worried or trying to figure out wtf is going on this man is just too focused on trying to have sex. This dudes gains a power up when he gets a boner after thinking about Kishimoto being naked. I know this sounds comedic but its not really funny when this anime is trying so hard to be serious. Okay maybe it's a little funny, lol imagine getting power up after getting a boner. 
img150()

I honestly believe this anime could've been so much better if they  just focused on humans wearing super suits fighting psychotic aliens instead of all the stupid redundant dialogues between characters. Final thing I wanna say is this anime is terrible, it really is, but for some reason I find myself entertained by the dumb decisions these characters make, the death of certain characters and just how bad of an anime it is overall. Now excuse me while I go watch the 2nd season of this horrible anime.

                             THOUGHTS AFTER WATCHING SEASON 2: 

 Well...they somehow managed to make season 2  worse than season 1, lets start with the animation. The animation for Gantz isn't the greatest cause the anime came out in 2004, but in season 2 the animation quality drops, there are many scenes in this anime where it's not even animated its straight up just a picture with voices in the background. 

You still have all the bullshit from season 1 in this season. Kishimoto is still useless, everyone yells and bitch about everything instead of killing aliens, the pacing is wayy slower than season 2, the first arc took like 8 episodes to finish. 

Majority of Gantz season 2 was focused on the Buddhist arc and personally I thought this arc was super boring and anticlimactic, don't get me wrong there were definitely some surprising moments like when !every single character died, it was so satisfying to see that dumb bitch Kishimoto die.!

Also the filler arc ending when !Kei  looks at the train and says ""bang"" right before he dies.! LMAO you ain't spike from cowboy bebop its not badass when you do it."
162983,"Undead Girl Murder Farce is a Historical, Mystery, Detective, Supernatural Novel by Aosaki Yuugo. It was adapted into a 13-episode anime by Lapin Track. 

To get right to the point, this anime is a banger and a must-watch, easily the dark horse of Summer 2023.

img320() img320()


This anime is a thrilling detective saga set in an alternate late 19th century. The story introduces the trio: an immortal decapitated head, Rindo Aya; the formidable half-Oni warrior, Shinuchi Tsugaro; and the battle maid, Hasei Shizuku. Together, they embark on a journey across Europe, dedicated to unraveling a series of perplexing supernatural mysteries. Encounters with vampires, werewolves, and other enigmatic creatures. While also pursuing the location of Aya's missing body.

With such a wild premise, the risk of falling short of expectations is high, but Studio Lapin Track delivered quality.

The anime is divided into three distinct Acts. The initial Act serves as an introduction, setting the stage for what's to come. But it's the subsequent two Acts that truly shine, keeping me on the edge of my seat, intriguing me in the mysteries, and subverting my expectations with each episode.

Each Act is different while balancing multiple characters granting them purposeful roles in the unfolding narrative, and adding an extra layer of depth.

img800()

The main trio's on-screen chemistry is enjoyable, filled with amusing banter in their interactions. Aya stands out as an exceptionally intelligent individual, a fast thought processes and deductions within mere seconds. Tsugaro, with his half-Oni heritage, brings a combination of power and wit to the mix. And Shizuku is a capable servant to Aya but hates Tsugaro insulting him on a regular basis.

The direction is nothing short of superb. The director Shinichi Omata, known for directing Kaguya-sama, showcases his directorial prowess in Undead Girl Murder Farce. Scenes flow very smoothly, especially hard to pull off in a dialogue-heavy show. Despite the large amount of talking and discussion, the engagement factor remains high.

The art and animation are top-notch, with a lot of attention to detail in the backgrounds. The fight scenes are surprisingly well-choreographed and entertaining to watch. Furthermore, the atmosphere created in each episode is great. Elevating the overall experience, drawing you deeper into the world.

Complimented with a fantastic soundtrack that captures various tones within the scenes. The anime boasts an array of outstanding OSTs, accompanied by some of my favorite opening and ending songs of the year. 



Should you watch this show?
Undead Girl Murder Farce is an absolutely fantastic anime, boasting superb production values and a constantly captivating array of supernatural enigmas."
11933,"Oda Nobunaga was genuinely the only harem anime in the past four years that I honestly enjoyed. Now, perhaps enjoyed isn't quite right, maybe amused will be closer. It was amusing the see the brain dead plot and fetish-fulfilling characters actually achieve something. My amusement was a direct product of Oda Nobunaga no Yabou being set in feudal japan (in the warring states period/ Senguku era). If you have no idea who Nobunaga was or what the Senguku era is, you will probably not like Oda Nobunaga no Yabou for the sole reason that you won't be able to connect with it or even understand what's going on. Still, if you want a summary of what happened IRL, its like this - Nobunaga was this really chill guy in the Oda clan, and since he was born during the Warring states period, every clan was at war with one clan or the other clan(duh) and the Ashikaga Shogunate was weakened. He got up and did a lot of cool shit, took down the shogun and almost unified Japan under a single banner. He was forced to commit suicide before that happened though. Anyways, the peace he created lasted almost 300 years until the Meiji restoration in 1868 when the Emperor and the Shogun jumped at each other over foreign interests (mostly the U.S.). 

 img()

Oda Nobunaga tries to do all the above (in a lot more detail and being much more specific though) while remaining a harem/ecchi/comedy. But if you want my advice, walk away if you know nothing about Japanese history or don't even know the map of Japan by heart or are just plain old uninterested in either. Well, unless you are willing to watch Oda Nobunaga only for the fanservice, in which case, I wish you best of luck.

 Artwork and Animation (8/10) - 
After all, what is an ecchi anime without artwork? The story isn't gonna do shit, atleast the artwork is a surefire thing. 

  Character Models  - The characters models are fair enough.There is nothing   wrong   with them but nothing out of the ordinary either. Eyes are a bit dull, but eh, you get used to it.

 img()

  Environment  - Quite good, especially the background soldiers and stuff. Its almost breathtaking to see the huge armies carrying their banners clashing, or the massive ships sailing off into the sunset (even though that is historically incorrect). Despite that, the detail drop across the environment is pretty steep, so you won't see sprawling cities, ever. Well, no loss, most of the series happens on mountains/forests or inside a hut and those don't suffer the same problems.

 img()

 Animation - Probably one of the strongest -and the most unused- part of the entire series. Right into the first episode, you will be awed by the fluid animation during the battles. But it was still disappointing. In the sense that it could have been used much, much more frequently. Considering how we are talking about the warring states, battles oughta be fairly common, right? Wrong. Despite its solid artwork and animation, it just isn't used in that sense. There were, what? five short battles in total? It was almost like the artwork was itching for a fight and the script told it to fuck off.

  Fan service  - Well, no nudity for you. There still some mediocre amount of fan service in the form of Nobuna always showing her breasts and Katsui's breastplate jumping around. The ED had a pretty ecchi video too.

 Sound and Music (6/10)-
Gonna keep this section short. 

 Voice acting - The VAs were meh and I didn't particularly care for them. Most of the ""heavy"" conversation doesn't quite stimulate the viewer to the point it was expected, but its not something disappointing either.

 Environment - By environment, I refer to stuff like town chatter, or the sound of a brook. While the chatter of other people was faint at best, the other sections (like the chirping of birds or footsteps) were pretty good. The war drums  were also quite nice.

 Music - Eh. Like, really eh. Despite having a great OP  video the music accompanying it was quite shit. Same for the ED (except the ED had a shit video too). The BGMs were more....promising. Most of the times, the BGMs came up only when the tide of the battle changed  (for better or for worse), and I really loved that. It gave a cinematic feeling to the entire thing.

 Storyline (25/30)-
There are two sides to war. One is strategy and the other is tactics. Strategy is about planning, diplomacy, economics, maintenance, supply and stuff like that. Tactics is more of a in-your-face affair. Its about (but not limited to) how to defeat the guy in front of you using outmaneuvers. Think of it like strategy, except on a much shorter time scale and with a much more specific objective. Oda Nobunaga is about strategy. It does have some tactics (read: battle) but its kinda secondary.

 img()

 Premise - The premise relies around Yoshiharu who is a student and suddenly ends up in the Sengoku era for reasons unknown (and never revealed). He happens to be a big fan of the game ""Nobunaga's Ambition"" and therefore knows the ins and outs of the history of the era. At the same time, all the daimyos (read: feudal lords) just happen to be cute girls.
Now will he able to take the place of Kinoshita Tokichiro and unify Japan under Nobunaga?


 Execution - Considering how pointless the premise sounds, my expectations were fairly low. Still, the story goes around Nobuna (Nobunaga's female version) trying to conquer japan on her own as the fortune teller MC guides her hand. He meets other important people (who are mostly girls too, for some reason) who played a great role in Nobunaga's conquests and downfall IRL. As I mentioned earlier, the focus is on strategy, so Nobuna is basically treading on a fine line where she can be overwhelmed by other clans if she makes one wrong move. Most clans don't support the rise of the Oda clan and will stop at nothing to kill Nobuna. This allows for great pressure on the diplomatic side of things, allowing for a more enjoyable outlook on the entire matter. The series all but explains to you the predicaments of being a daimyo during the Sengoku period. It still isn't KSnH levels of bullshitting and is sometimes fairly funny, which I guess is a good thing. I would go so far as to call its buildup to episode 8 great but it kinda started dropping off after that. I mean, there were boring emo parts here and there, but overall it was fairly fast paced. I just kinda wished that the battles were more...active. 

To quote Sun Tzu (albeit out of context)- 'Strategy without tactics is the slowest path to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat""
I know I'm taking it completely out of context here, but Oda Nobunaga also took the slowest path to victory. With a few great battles, it could have been a much, much better series. See, the problem is that the tactics totally got killed. The fights are literally just one man armies killing each other's cannon fodder. Most of the focus was on the support crew. I would have preferred it if it showed how the common man fights, because there is nothing more beautiful about battle than a guy fighting to the last breath -torn banner and all- in the service of his lord. Like, seriously. This was one part that was seriously downplayed since the OP support and Main cast go berserk on Soldier C's ass and then he dies without so much as a second look. Archers fire at the valiant defenders who hold against the barrage with their battlements falling apart and without a shield, and we get to look at MC talk bullshit for five minutes straight. I mean, give those brave people some screen time, you fuckfaces.

Also, real battles are much more coordinated than blobs of soldiers hitting each other at random intervals.

 img()

I also hated how most of the cast went into battle without armor. Nagahide literally fights with only a Nagitana and katsuie doesn't wear a helmet and leads the charges at the same time. Even a complete idiot knows that the general is the most important man (or woman) on the battlefield, and a dead or dismounted general is usually a routed army, Katsui somehow doesn't comprehend that stray arrows exist. Toshiie Maeda  also doesn't wear any armor despite using a yari (which leaves too many opening between thrusts). Other than that, the fights are too simple minded and don't quite comprehend logistics. Perhaps you will realize why during the Imagawa arc.

 img()

Other than that, the main diplomacy can't really be argued against, since it happened irl. I did find that some diplomacy was oversimplified to fit the (already narrow) viewer base, which was a bit sad.

As a side note, the romance is, for the most part, about nobuna being a tsundere and saying emo stuff while crying. Not cool.

 Characters (12/30)

 img()
As I mentioned earlier, the characters are made for the purpose of fetish fulfillment. Toshiie is your strong calm loli, Goemon is your loli with the voice impediment Nene is the cute imouto type loli, Katsui is the dependable strong girl and Nagahide is the ""clever"" woman and Mitsuhide is the token tsundere who hates losing. Yeah, pretty damn cliche.

And of course, there are the villains, who don't really have any clear motives to speak of, but want Nobuna stopped anyways. They all assemble in a dark room and be REALLY condescending while saying non-descript things like ""so it has begun"". Because that's what villains do.

Other than that, the characters have no development or goals to speak of with no backstory (even for the MC) and none of them are anywhere near what they were in real life. Despite that, I still kinda liked the people that did not turn into cute girls, the Viper was pretty cool, and so was hanzou. 

 Enjoyment (15/20)
Despite me finding Oda nobunaga interesting, most people will perhaps not share the sentiment. Mostly because of a difference of interest. Still, its decent enough and even teaches you a little on the fly, so it really isn't all that bad. Despite my rating making it end up in the 60's its decent enough to be a 70 anime. Tch, if only its characters were good enough. While I won't recommend it to anyone but desperate history fans, its really not all that bad even if you go in blind. Besides, Japanese history is fun, and learning while watching anime can't possibly be all that bad.
Or can it?

1698,"Nodame Cantabile acompanha a história de dois estudantes de uma universidade de música clássica e o desenrolar de suas vidas após a graduação. Certo dia, Noda Megumi (ou Nodame) encontra na porta de sua casa um rapaz desmaiado pelo tanto que bebera e decide levá-lo até seu apartamento. 

Após o ocorrido, o agora sóbrio Chiaki, desperta ao som de uma melodia tocada no piano, assustado pelo cenário incomum e estarrecedor que vira: o apartamento de nodame. 

Talentoso, genial, rígido e arrogante. Chiaki Shinichi, um estudante e potencialíssimo musicista briga com seu professor, após um de seus ataques de soberba, sendo levado a trocar de mestre, passando a ter aulas com o pior professor da academia, conhecido pelos demais por formar alunos fracassados. 

A troca de turma fez com que o protagonista tivesse de conviver com Nodame. Uma excêntrica, irreverente, desajeitada, mas não menos talentosa, aluna de piano. 

Entre as indas e vindas, o enredo nos convida acompanhar os passos de Chiaki no mundo da música clássica, tendo de contar com sucessos e infortúnios, problemas e dramas pessoais, além das dificuldades provenientes de orquestras iniciantes. 

Com o forte tom da música orquestral, pouco a pouco o show introduz o ouvinte aos dramas e motivações (ou a falta delas) dos personagens. De um Chiaki filho de renomados profissionais do ramo musical e que crescera sob rédeas de rigidez, o que moldaram sua personalidade, a Nodame, que exala e desperdiça talento pela falta de dedicação e interesse. 

Por vezes humorada, outras vezes madura, o enredo desenvolve um romance entre os personagens principais, além de guiar o espectador pela carreira no Japão e mundo afora destes habilidosos musicistas, com uma contundente história que convida todos a conhecer o mundo da música erudita. 


A Primeira Arte  


A música é a forma de arte que consegue expressar a essência dos fenômenos que o homem percebe no mundo. Muitos filósofos chamaram isso de vontade. 

A vontade seria o impulso para os fenômenos no mundo e a música uma das suas linguagens. Por isso, o efeito da música é tão poderoso e incisivo. Pois as outras formas de arte se referem apenas à sombra e a música à essência. Se a música tem esse poder de representar a essência das coisas, podemos usar as estruturas musicais como paralelos para entendermos a vida. 

Nos tons mais graves de uma harmonia, encontramos uma correspondência à natureza inorgânica: a massa bruta do planeta. A massa bruta não é dotada de grandes movimentos, de brilho ou de velocidade. Ela serve de cama onde tudo repousa, origina-se e se desenvolve. Na música, geralmente o baixo não é voltado para a agilidade, não costuma realizar floreios e nem se movimenta em intervalos muito curtos. 

Os tons intermediários representam os corpos ainda inconscientes mas que já se expressam de alguma forma, tais como o mundo vegetal e o animal. A voz intermediária da música, mesmo mais dinâmica que a anterior, ainda carece de um desenvolvimento conexo que, como uma linha, amarre o todo e lhe dê sentido. 

Já os tons agudos que cantam a melodia, a voz principal, se assemelham a vida e as realizações forjadas pela reflexão do homem que, dotado da razão, lança continuamente seu olhar para frente e para trás. Com as suas inúmeras possibilidades percorre um caminho, acompanhado da reflexão, interligado com o todo. 

A melodia conecta todos os significados do começo ao fim da música. Transitar rapidamente de uma vontade para a sua satisfação pode gerar alegria e bem estar. Assim também são as melodias rápidas que, sem grandes desvios, tornam se alegres. As músicas adequadas para a dança, por exemplo, são compostas por frases curtas e fáceis, como a expressão da felicidade comum. 

Já as melodias lentas são como as satisfações demoradas, entremeadas por dissonâncias dolorosas. Retornando ao tom fundamental, muitos compassos além, tornam-se mais tristes, difíceis, como em uma jornada que passou por caminhos tortuosos, mas que ao final ganhou o sentido no todo, tornando a sua realização mais profunda e duradoura. As nuances entre as tonalidades menores e maiores parecem representar as passagens das angústias, no modo menor, para sua libertação, no modo maior. 

A modulação de uma tonalidade fundamental para outra põe fim à anterior, assemelhando se à morte que aniquila o corpo, mas não elimina a vontade que permanece viva e se manifesta em outros indivíduos, mesmo que eles não tenham nenhuma ligação. 

A quantidade inesgotável de melodias possíveis corresponde à imensa variedade de indivíduos e modos de viver no mundo. Por isso, a melodia canta, percorre por muitos caminhos, explora intervalos e tonalidades diferentes, estranhas e familiares. Tudo isso expressa o que a vontade quer. Sofrimento e alegria, ansiedade e dor, aventura e caos. 

No entanto, esta melodia sempre repousa no seu tom fundamental, onde sempre esteve enraizada. Apesar de todas essas semelhanças a música não expressa os sentimentos individuais, mas o contexto universal que cria os seus ouvintes. A primeira arte representa a essência de todas as possíveis aspirações e disposições humanas: A alma interior delas. Essa é a linguagem mais universal que conhecemos. Ainda assim, a cada dia que passa, parece que nos esforçamos para abandoná-la cada vez mais. 

>""A música é um exercício oculto de metafísica, sem que o espírito saiba que está filosofando."""
122441,"To call the anime adaptation of Peach Boy Riverside a mess would actually be an understatement. A “mess” is usually caused by accident, trying to do something well and then tripping for some reason or the other. No, the fate of this anime was sealed before an episode even aired.

The staff decided to take a fairly logical flow of events from the manga, and then shuffle them around, just so the final episode could end on some sort of action climax. This butchers the show right out of the gate. It makes you wonder why certain characters are even in certain places at certain times without properly communicating a sense of time. Occasionally Sally, one of the two protagonists, will have an outfit change, but other than that, it makes the timeline seem jumpy and difficult to really wrap your head around, especially for weekly viewers. If you’re a manga reader, this approach does very little, since you already know what happens in the story and can already say what goes where. Hell, the anime itself manages to both spoil the result of the final episode before it even happens and make the ending of another episode a huge ass pull because it brings in a character the audience hadn’t gotten to know yet. So, this is detrimental on both ends.

I’ve seen some comparisons made to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Baccano before the series aired, in regard to airing episodes out of the intended order from their source, but both of those series better justify this particular decision. Haruhi was mostly a slice of life comedy, with only some plot gradually thrown through the background, so the lack of consequence in the majority of runtime fit the kind of show that it was, while letting individual episodes stand out on their own. Baccano meanwhile was an incredibly fast paced show; many events of importance were happening at once and one of the three plotlines was an action setpiece on a train that was constantly evolving. 

Peach Boy Riverside doesn’t have the forethought of either series. It’s tied to a fairly strict continuity of events each episode, at a pace that can be incredibly slow at points, and there’s no distinct vibe that the out of orderness adds to spice up the viewing experience, beyond learning certain things earlier than they’ll actually come up. To any new watchers, there’s nothing to gain from the way the staff aired this anime, which I will judge as such since that’s how it was released. 

Jee, I’ve talked so much about the out of order timeline and its detrimental effect on enjoying the show that I’ve barely talked about the show itself yet!
So, what is this story that the staff felt was so intriguing that it needed to be told out of order to try and invest a brand new audience? A painfully generic fantasy romp that makes Akame ga Kill seem inspired by comparison, even with its folktale origin.

In a fantasy world that’s incredibly non-descript, half the show follows Sally, a princess with the magical power of getting hot and bothered. The other half follows Mikoto, a swordsman who seems dedicated to solving the systemic problems of the world by murdering nearly every oni he comes across, but not when one of them needs to be alive for plot reasons, or tag along with either protagonist for reasons that don’t add too much beyond more powers for the action scenes. The show likes to abuse the “pet the dog” trope for these characters, giving a determinably evil race just enough sympathy or a cute design for them to stick around, but not enough to really……understand them. It’s mostly a series of slow conversations underlying limp, weakly animated schlocky action. 

Characters talk about various things, places get destroyed, but the show doesn’t do enough to get you invested in its world. It’s a very thrown together world, the kind that’s unfortunately very common in low rent fantasy stories. Every place is just a place to host plot. If each setting the characters visited had a distinct visual identity, perhaps it would better serve the out of order pacing of the anime by making it easy for viewers to remember what place was shown when, but alas. It’s not a plot to really expect much from, but at times it’s trying to say something about racism. 

It’s not entirely lip service either despite not having much punch. How humans treat demihumans (or ogres) with disrespect versus how demihumans harshly react to the human characters is something that’s occasionally brought up as a drive across several episodes. This is at least pondered in Episode 7, and creates the distinct ideologies of the two protagonists.

Sally…is not a great female lead for this story. Beyond the in-poor-taste tentacle fanservice you see right from Episode 1, she’s mainly there to be incredibly ignorant of the world around her as a once sheltered princess and, again, get hot and bothered during the action scenes……………………..like once. If the first episode hooked you on the possibility of her going cuckoo for Coco Puffs in the action scenes, I hate to say it but this hardly ever happens again; one action scene later when she uses the power, she’s fairly measured. Crunchyroll at least wanted to market the series with the scene where Sally goes crazy with her special shonen power, but if you want more of that craziness, it’s missing in a show that’s already committed to being hardcore schlock. 

Instead, she’s mostly just shown as painfully naïve. By the third episode, which takes place a bit later in the actual timeline, she’s deciding between the guy who wants to kill all the ogres, but whom she personally knows has her best interest in mind, and a total snake who claims to be wanting the races to co-exist. She’s one of the characters hurt most by the out of order pacing, participating in action but not driving a plot that’s above the audiences’ heads.

Mikoto is at least a little better; there’s actually an episode in the season that shows us their crybaby backstory which is…………fine, probably one of the few episodes where its timeline placement doesn’t really damage the cruddy pacing of the series. Sometimes his attitude is enjoyable. Otherwise though, he alternates between being nonchalantly morbid and IMUSTKILLALLTHEOGRES much like a certain other Shonen protagonist known for yelling. His voice actress is very sweet sounding, to the point where, in combination with the wiki considering him “non-bindery”, I assumed maybe this character was a non-binary protagonist, which could’ve been fairly progressive for anime. But nope. Quite the opposite, we get an incredibly uncomfortable gender panic scene in Episode 4, where Sally is shocked at him being flatchested and then lands on top of him as she realizes further. Another episode literally ends on a joke of someone else realizing the character is a femboy. GREAT. 

The rest of the cast is pretty dull: a collection of tropes with little to really contribute. There’s witches, nuns, tiny priest looking ogre girls, a boring guy who only exists to be the straight man, and a series of ogre designs which serve more as action obstacles than anything else. With exception to Mikoto and one other, there isn’t much to really care about in the limited time the anime has; most of these relationships are shown out of order at any rate.
The best character in the show is easily Frau, one of the few for whom the racism lip service idea has some kind of fruit to bear. Frau has a distinct design as a bunny schoolgirl shaped like a friend, and their loyalty to Sally is at least charming and believable in a couple of the action scenes, despite the weird worldbuilding to justify their revival mechanics not really being. Still, they’re the most distinct character in a fairly bland and boring cast.

Perhaps the best I can say visually is that there’s at least……………..some creative designs? Like the aforementioned Frau, or the giant walrus and chicken demon things from the first episode. There’s some variety in even the more generic ogre characters. The art style is passable, but you won’t find much in the way of fluid animation to come from it. Most action scenes compromise of several motion tweens moved in sequence, and the occasional big explosion. It doesn’t go nearly as ridiculously bloody as you might hope from a show like this; a Kouta Hirano anime this certainly isn’t. There’s no cost cutting CGI, which is good, until the final episode when there's a hideous CGI tree monster with half committed compositing. It keeps a consistent art style in place, but these scenes don’t do enough to stand out or flow well at any rate. Similar for the soundtrack; there’s a couple decent tunes drowned out by the dialogue, but nothing you’ll think of after this show ends. The ED though is one of the lamest I’ve ever seen visually in some time, with almost nothing going on but panning up on still shots of characters in various places; no unique personality of an animator shining through. 

Peach Boy Riverside is mostly pretty trash, but not entirely from the base of it. I at least like the idea of having two protagonists with distinct ideologies regarding their world’s systemic conflict going on their separate journeys and occasionally crossing paths, even if that happens too frequently in conjunction with lackluster worldbuilding, action scenes being schlocky without being memorable and the out of order story the anime staff planned out not being very considered for narrative investment at all. You’re not gonna get much from here. If you really care about the story that much, just read the manga. But if you’re just a shonen or action fan, I’d say skip this self-inflicted mess. There’s much better options for you out there in both a building structure and bombast from action scenes."

V4Watcher here to bring you the review, as precise and concise as possible. This review will talk about the whole series, including the last episode, which was an extremely fulfilling conclusion to an anime with a very unique concept.


I was like this one fine day without anything to do,
img420()
but then my friend called me was like 'Bruh, there's this anime where they instantly agree to get married. You gotta watch it.' I was a bit hesitant to watch it at first, but after reading the summary, I was like 'Yes. I NEED to watch this.' 

img420()
It started off with our MC Nasa about to be yeeted by Truck-kun, but this is where this anime started to stand out from the rest. Instead of being killed and isekai'd into another universe where he had to battle Demon Lords, his future wife showed up and sustained most of the damage. 

img420(https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1750181218870399350/94D369789976EF5DB33B5A785DB2C490C75C37D2/?imw=637&imh=358&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true)
There are many hints that Tsukasa is not actually human, which was a fun thing to search for while watching the anime. She sustained injuries from Truck kun but was able to walk freely, and one time she even said something anong the lines ""You humans get diseases easily.' (The episode where Nasa had a cold I think? Don't remember too well.)

img420()
The OP and ED is catchy, and when I heard it during this OVA, it brought back fond memories of me watching the series.

img420()
Now that we've been reminded of the main story, let's get back to the concluding episode. One thing I loved is that they made this episode comedic and not just filled with parting and saddness. Usually animes fill the last episodes with saddness and farewells, but this was different. It showed the start of a new life for Nasa and Tsukasa.

For half the episode, we looked at lonely Tsukasa, and for the other half a very embarassed Nasa and Tsukasa. The fact that they could make something like this actually hilarious and engaging to watch is really something. 

img220() img220()

Overall, this final episode had good pacing, a small though solid plot, and humour showing it's face in all the right places. While it may not be the best anime you would've ever seen and blow your brains out, it is a short and engaging journey of a person coming to terms with married life, unfurled to us with humorous events and consistent pacing, along with a tinge of mystery surrounding it. Extremely wholesome. All in all, if I had to describe this anime in a few words...I would say it's 

Tonikaku Kawaii  ;)

131863,"Years of waiting for a No Game, No Life Season 2, and people were thinking this would be similar to that. Well, let me just say, if you thought NGNL was stupid, this will be some abyss fiction to you. With a title like Liar, Liar, you’d expect that it’d be all about cheating and lying through games, and while there’s plenty of that in this anime, it’s done in a very underwhelming way, with contrivances up the wazoo. Powers come out of nowhere, twists come out of nowhere, and in the end, it’s just a trashy harem show with no real spice whatsoever. I’m not usually a fan of ecchi, but I’m not gonna lie, maybe some more ecchi could have at least kept my attention on the screen more.

The premise in a nutshell is that Shinohara Hiroto goes to Academy Island, where everything is settled through games, with the strongest student having the ranking of “seven stars”. Hiroto beats the strongest student on his first day, and took the name away from her, becoming the strongest himself, albeit in a fake sense, thus the anime name. The anime started out decently, as something I could call dumb fun at least, but as the show went along, it became heavily contrived and overly complicated, yet bland because of the numerous info dumps throughout the show. That said, the explanations and the world building just wasn’t up to snuff, as sometimes the games just contradicted themselves or an extra rule would be thrown in last minute. It kind of reminded me of Classroom of the Elite, with the rankings and competitions, but just infinitely more stupid.

The production quality looked fine at first, but like the plot, declined in quality as the show went along as well. The animation was mediocre along with the character designs, and the voice acting had some hiccups too at points, as some of the louder, more epic lines (with big mouth flap movements, mind you) were delivered in such a lackluster way, like the VAs were just bored out of their minds reading their scripts. The best part of the entire show was probably the OP and some of the music, in terms of the technical aspects go.

Character wise, they were very tropey and one-note. You got the tsundere, the OP protagonist, and a maid. Harem hijinks ensue. Whoop-dee-do. 

Overall, this anime was exactly what I feared it would be, though I was coping that after a very solid premiere episode, it would keep up the fun times, but unfortunately, it fell off relatively quickly due to the poor writing and characterization. Just another schlock suspense anime that will be forgotten quickly, not even turning off my brain was able to allow me to enjoy it, though in my opinion it is still minimally watchable for anyone who enjoys the premise and has a high tolerance for buffoonery."
154967,"""Rascal Does Not Dream of a Sister Venturing Out"" can be considered an OVA epilogue to the last three episodes of Season 1 of Bunny Girl Senpai, instead of a standalone movie. Aside from its pacing and format, which don’t fit a conventional feature-length film, it acts as a mini-sequel to Sakuta’s sister Kaede’s arc after recovering from her dissociative amnesia where, triggered by the trauma of her being bullied, she lost all her prior episodic memory and turned into a ‘blank slate’—referred to as “kaede” (due to a lack of a nuanced English equivalent to kanji and hiragana Japanese texts, they will respectively be referred to as such from here onwards).

img220()
img220()

In contrast to the focus on kaede’s remarkable two-year recovery from being a shut-in truant at the end of Season 1, the OVA shows us Kaede suddenly dealing with the fact that a lot of things have happened to her and her loved ones during her absence. Among other things, she now has to adjust to the fact that her brother now has a girlfriend; their mother became mentally unstable while she was having her dissociative period, and they now live apart from their parents all because of that. Furthermore, she is now expected to be able to head outside and attend school, which must all feel so overwhelming to Kaede. It’s like waking from a fugue state and finding yourself piloting an airplane.

Many of the themes explored in the OVA revolve around Kaede gaining back her identity and autonomy while feeling the immense pressure of having to meet the expectations established by kaede. All of these seem like things that have been imposed on her without her consent and active participation. While not entirely all bad and unwelcome, even her progress and achievements feel alienating because she wasn’t there to experience them firsthand, and they were kaede’s efforts not hers. She then feels guilty and extremely indebted to kaede, the crux of which was when she reads kaede’s diary and finds out about her dreams checklist. She saw that Kaede had one unfulfilled dream—to go to the same high school as her brother, in Minegahara.

img220()

As Kaede sets out to fulfill her other self’s dream, she has to face the fact that she cannot just simply apply to any public high school because she blew off almost two years of middle school, and her grades weren’t all that great. But she was determined to get in even at the expense of her health. While she was eventually able to take the entrance exams, her health turned so bad that she wasn’t able to finish it. During Kaede’s struggles and frustrations, Sakuta was always there to support her. It’s very heartwarming to see how much he’s grown over the series, especially in how he’s accepted and loved both kaede and Kaede. It’s also satisfying how Sakuta has finally had the chance to make up for all the guilt he has felt for being unable to help out Kaede before. Of course, he wouldn’t be able to do this much for Kaede without the help of the rest of the lovely cast. Eventually Kaede realized that she did not need to fulfill kaede's dream and that she should follow her own dreams and live her own life.

img220()

Finally, while Mai and Sakuta aren’t the main focus of this OVA, it’s still nice to see how much this adaptation included all their moments together and how much they’ve matured to handle being apart. Part of this, especially the opening and post-credit scenes, is a clever setup towards the sequel ""Knapsack Kid,"" which I’m looking forward to watching next!

While this doesn’t reach the level of greatness that is ""Dreaming Girl,"" I would still rate this OVA quite high because of how well it portrays my favorite character, Kaede. I think ""Sister Venturing Out"" is a great example of an anti-coming-of-age coming-of-age story, and if you’re into that kind of thing, then I highly suggest watching this."

Preface: This isn't a review for the actual anime but my personal thoughts about it, sounds dumb but it kind of gave me an out of body experience and really made me contemplate. I've never done a review nor actually will after this but I was inspired just enough to actually write about this. Also 75% of the reason I wrote b/c I was  thinking I'll have an essay laying around at go if I ever need in the future. So if certain parts seem strange its just me using this as a notebook in a way.  Is it worth watching? If you want something simple and entertaining, Yes.

STORY:   6/10 - Has some pretty basic run of the mill writing for the regular plot stuff but the life lessons are pretty well written. Points off for the criminal amount of plot holes. Most of the points comes from the life lessons aspect I talk about not from the actual story.

Characters: 9.5 - fitting in with my analysis I thing the characters  all play a really good part in showcasing the different  real world problems people have. Nick being cheated on (Idols) , Curran being used by fake friends (eating?), Tiana becoming an outcast due to rumors (gambling), Zem false accused of  child ape (women?)

Visuals:   There's two parts to this. First the main animation which is pretty standard. There's nothing special to be honest its very run of the mill.  so 6.8 for this. Then there's the outro specifically, animation wise still a 6.8 but I'll bump the score to a 7.5 for it's significance to my 'theory'.

Audio: 7.5 - Nothing too memorable. Regular stuff

Enjoyment: 8.9 - If you are looking for a anime more on the carefree side that'll just give you some fun noncomplex entertainment then I'd recommend this. It's perfect for in-between serious shows where you don't want to pay too close attention to what's going on. 


   At first glance ""Ningen Fushin: Adventurers Who Don’t Believe in Humanity Will Save the World"" seems like your standard shitty fantasy anime that of a medieval world which centers around an ensemble cast adventuring with the plot unfolding. However for some strange reason the message behind the plot really spoke to me enough to write this down and eventually post about here.   

I think the storyline has a deeper meaning behind it. It's to my understanding that there are three separate layers. First  the simple anime itself with its natural plot. This is pretty much the quests and the story building that takes place.  Second the ""life lessons"" the characters embody within the story itself.  Which is shown as comedic and childish  however these are common real world experiences. Things any human can possibly / unfortunately have the ability to relate to. Weather directly with the same scenario or indirectly with an encompassing experience. Lastly the actual hidden story that the writer is trying to tell making use of trojan horse tactics. This story is somewhat told with the use of breaking the 4th wall. The writers use the regular plot of fighting monsters, clearing out dungeons and leveling up as a way to build up these characters. They make use of the outro to show and introduce the concept that these can just be regular people with real-life problems. if you skip the outros or don't look into possible lyrics you don't get the full story.  Pay attention the the outro, watch it in it's entirety making sure to pay special attention to the lyrics . (LATER NOTE: I watched the anime dubbed on a website so obviously the actual translation can be different however I think you should be able to get a rough idea)


There are A LOT of potholes in the story line however this is a pretty interesting anime. It doesn't really touch on its own world much with the story and setting but it focuses on the morality of humans. Obviously with the title hinting at it. How things out of their control affects their lives Factors which the characters have no control over affect their lives in a huge way. This anime even possibly teaches harsh life lessons that a lot of people might not know yet. How no one is a bad guy from the start. It touches on the Joker's ideology thought of how one really  bad day can change a person's life and trajectory forever. Babies aren't born evil.  As a infant grows up, their environment, experiences during the developmental state, socio-economic status, education … etc. all mold and shape a person. However this grandiose theory doesn't really fit any where within the main story of the anime. The actual story seems a little too simple at times. This is where it ties into the outro, where the main characters seem to just be normal people living in a regular world doing common things but they are always alone. The characters are always in self isolation. This drives the nail in a little deeper. The though process of how one can't believe in humanity, how they have betrayed you in the past and most likely will again so by default you are alone. It seems like these are people who were wronged and in return have now retreated into a shell which keeps them safe by distancing them from everyone good or bad. They turn into an introvert to protect themselves.

The outro symbolizes that the fantasy world where the main story takes place in isn't really the main focus, at least for the writers who are creating this story, everything happening (the important things) of how these characters lives get affected can really happen in reality. The plot holes could just be bad writing but for me it just reinforces my idea of this ' the writer is creating a normal surface level anime which is just the medium and is layering an insanely intricate painting of life and real issues humans have by hiding it within the ""shitty"" anime and using clues to tell which is only noticeable in a breaking the 4th wall kind of way when the audience fully take in everything (such as title, intro and outro, any lyrics and actual episode'

I kind of feel like the characters are just regular people in the real world who are all playing an mmo together and their personal lives leak through. Maybe they are sharing common experienced or just looking for someone to talk to who would understand. Or hey maybe this is a normal ass anime that I'm looking way to into like one of those "" art lover trope"" with modern ""paintings"" 


later note: Thinking about it, the light novel is still releasing and the manga is done. This can just be a very good light novel that has amazing writing but somehow in the anime stage it was so poorly adapted it causes me to ""realize"" the amazing story ""hidden within"". Realistically this IS a one season anime that's solely created due to popular demand/ to get more exposure for the manga / light novel, so the possibility of that seems pretty high. 

Quick Highlight: In episode 11, Nalgrava has an amazing villain monologue about people being like  playing cards


Update: 
Thinking back on it. I think Nalgrava's monologue is a pretty much the best scene in the show. The whole episode itself kind of reinforced my thoughts on my theory. Nalgrava was first introduced as a villian but as the show progressed the anime takes him from being a character you can easily dispise to someone who you can understand as to why he did what he did. Like any good story it took a clear cut ""bad guy"" and gave him human characteristics, a decent motive and even possibly a good reason which turns him from a black and white character into a grey one 

 Nick was played by a woman who never really liked him and was only using him for money, if im remembering right. 
In his eyes he had a solid relationship which he though was going to be a major part of his future only to be backstabbed by the one he loved. This causes him to fill in the void with idolship. Which is usually seen by most people as a way people add the feeling of being loved by a parasocial relationship based on girls who""ll love their fas as long as there is money involved

Curran being a tank along with being dumb and trusting was an easy exploit for shady characters who saw an eazy comeup with quests who was left for dead by her so called comrades in the end when it suited them. She uses the crux of eating to create the feeling of happiness which a lot of people do in the real world. 

 Tiana becoming an outcast due to rumors effected her entire life. Being pulled into a life of being despised for something she didnt do is terrible. and the rush of gambling seems to sooth her pain. 

Zem is false accused of  child ape by the child herself. A young girl caught feelings for him took it harsly when he did not reciprocate she coped by saying something that would untimely remove him from the picture. With him being a priest who  kept his world urges at bay he just said screw it. I might as well enjoy women as much as I can considering all these years he abstained and it didn't do anything for his image when he needed it the most.  

These vices are obviously not healthy ways to deal with the pain and these characters know this. However They do not care. They tell each other to mind their own business and not to bother."
10012,"This review is all subjective and my own personal opinion. You do not have to agree with it, nor am I asking you to. I hope that this just helps you get an idea of what the anime I am talking about is like and form a basic and general consensus on it. The ratings I give anime and manga are mostly my personal overall enjoyment. I have not read the manga, and it has been around a month or two since I have watched the anime. This review will be spoiler free. A big thank you to [Nikz](https://anilist.co/user/Nikz/) for proofreading this review and giving me feedback. TL;DR will be at the bottom.

So what is Carnival Phantasm? Looking at the cover is interesting, after all. We see characters from across different Type-Moon works, Tsukihime and Fate. What could possibly bring these two universes together? Why, a comedic parody of course. Yes, that is what Carnival Phantasm is. It is a crossover of various Type-Moon works, whilst mainly being Tsukihime and Fate, their other works such as Melty Blood and Kara no Kyoukai make an appearance. Carnival Phantasm places the characters of these any universes into various comedic situations. Sound interesting? The nature of this anime does go differently to the other types of reviews I have done in the past but let us delve a little deeper.

As with many comedies, the plot is not the main focus of the anime. Carnival Phantasm's plot mostly consists comedic situations that take place in each episode, and various Type-Moon characters are placed in them for comedic results. The plot is fairly simple and does not need much brain power to follow it. It is easy just to tune out and enjoy yourself to the kind of events that the characters find themselves in. I will say though, some of the situations end up being quite hilarious. For example, the premise of the first episode is The Holy Grail War gets turned into a game show. That is only a taste of things to come, with many more bizarre and outlandish situations in the later episodes. Overall, the plot gets the job done, delivering a comedic state of affairs to the viewer, and letting them see how the characters they have become so familiar with deal with what is thrown at them.

All of the characters that appear on Carnival Phantasm are the many characters that appear in the various works of Type-Moon. This includes the universes of Fate, Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai and more. We see characters like Saber and Aruceid meet and talk to each other, something only possible in Carnival Phantasm. Having characters from all of these universes is wonderful fanservice done well, for one such as I who is familiar with most of the universes presented in Carnival Phantasm. It was a treat to see them all come together, to make a joyful and light hearted viewing experience. The characters that appear on Carnival Phantasm are just as you know them, some of them having comedic qualities emphasised. An example of this is Rin's tech illiteracy, which is focused upon on one episode. Of course, Saber's gluttony and lion-like nature is in this too. If you are someone who is familiar with the characters that appear in Carnival Phantasm, this will be a treat to see. I only had one personal irk with Carnival Phantasm, which is the lack of representation of Kara no Kyoukai characters, !Ryougi Shiki is one of the only Kara no Kyoukai characters to appear in Carnival Phantasm, only making a brief cameo in the final episode.! I personally would have liked to see more representation of Kara no Kyouaki in Carnival Phantasm, but it is only a minor issue.

The art does well to convey the comedic emotion the anime aims to send across to the audience. Character expressions are done well, and they look good too in this art style. Studio Lerche does well to bring to life the many situations the characters come across, making it feel more alive. For an anime created in 2011, the quality was acceptable, and I appreciated what it did for the anime.

The music is pretty catchy and fits well with the overall mood of the anime. The opening is quite memorable, even now, two months later I can still recall it. The opening did well to set the mood of the anime, and to get their viewers ready to experience Carnival Phantasm. The credits too, from what I recall, was pretty good. It fit the theme and did well to end the episodes. Essentially, Uezu Makoto did a good job on the music and overall sound design as the music is pretty catchy, and fits well with the overall mood of the anime.

I have already talked about the comedy in some of the previous segments, but I will go into a little more detail. For what this anime was trying to achieve, it hit the mark. It catered to Type-Moon audiences, making jokes that most fans would understand and enjoy. The situations that the characters find themselves in are stuff that I would have never thought of. Normally, these kinds of situations would feel so odd, so out of place for these kinds of characters, and yet it just works. I would have never imagined it working out, and yet it did. I will not go into too much detail about what these situations are like, that is something you should see for yourself. You are in for a treat. The characters also go really well with the kind of events they find themselves in. Their personalities, albeit slightly changed for comedic purposes, remains largely the same and effectively go well with what takes place. Seeing normally very serious characters pitted in very comedic situations only added to the comedic factor of the anime. The comedy can be a bit cringe inducing at times, but it is not often it is, and can be easily looked over.

Carnival Phantasm is not for everyone, but for those who it is targeted to, it is a treat to see. This is an easy recommendation for a fan of works such as Fate and Tsukihime, and just want to sit down and watch something fun. If you are only a fan of Fate and want to watch this, it may confuse you as Tsukihime makes a lot of appearances in Carnival Phantasm, so you may want to do some reading up on the general idea of what Tsukihime is. To summarise this review:
- The plot does well to be comedic, creating various bizarre situations for the Type-Moon characters to be in.
- The characters go well with situations they are found in, only making it more hilarious. Their established personalities only build on the comedic nature of Carnival Phantasm.
- The animation and art gets the job done in delivering a comedic experience.
- Catchy music that matches the overall theme of Carnival Phantasm.

Overall, I enjoyed Carnival Phantasm. This kind of anime is really not the kind of thing I normally watch, so I had no idea on what to expect. For what this anime tried to achieve, it did well. Still, this is not my typical type of thing, and I enjoy other things more. That is not to discredit Carnival Phantasm, I think many people will enjoy it. I sincerely hope you will. There are also some extra episodes of Carnival Phantasm, so you may want to check those out after finishing it. If you enjoyed Carnival Phantasm, then you may also enjoy reading another comedic parody on Type-Moon, the manga [All Around Type-Moon](https://anilist.co/manga/57327/ALL-AROUND-TYPEMOON/) (Kara no Kyoukai makes more of an appearance in this manga). I certainly enjoyed it. Thank you to those who took the time to read this review. I hope you were able to get something out of this review. If you did not like this review, then I apologise for wasting your time."
24,"before you read this I just wanna let you know that this is my first ever review (and english is not my first language so pardon my grammatical error).

School rumble is a really good romcom anime with a lot of loveable cast and
comedy gold, when i see the title i was expecting an action focused anime for whatever reason lol.

this review include the 2nd season and the ovas

Lets talk about the story first shall we

What I love about school rumble is its unique atmosphere and its comedy chaoticness
The story in school rumble is honestly so good the comedy is amazing, its so chaotic and wild,Too many things happen at once and its just so damn funny, putting the comedy asides now lets talk about the romances.The romance in school rumble at some moment is like a small riddle to find out who goes out with who,guessing who will the mc ended up with reminds me of my elementary school students days shipping on non canon fictional character ( or even real people,i mean cmon its normal for a young kid doing this ).
This anime being a triangle love tagged romcom anime ofcourse it brings some drama even though its not a lot and when theres One they execute it up so nicely and well done, theres some good romantic moment here and there but most of the times it cut out by its unexpected comedy and thats why you cannot expect whos end up with who but sometimes it doesn't get cut out, but hey when it does happen im not complaining since its so damn funny but despite this,school rumble knows how to get serious which is really great, this anime really reminds me that journey Is more important than the destination and thats what that kept me stays watching this cuz I want to feel the journey of bunch of high school teenagers on theyre youth Wandering love in a chaotic and comedic ways.

Lets move on to character shall we

Oh another thing about school rumble that i love is its use of ensamble cast when everybody get together, this anime really let every character shine on their own which is really really amazing to me and I love it although often I feel like despite being the main character or focus of the show tenma as character feels a little bit weak (shes not bad though), but man harima carried this show so much its amazing, theres also eri, akira and yakumo, 3 girls who make this show enjoyable to me,some side character is also amazing in their own ways and so unique, look at lala for example I did not expect to see a mexican side character In a romcom anime, to me almost every characters in this anime really shines.

Music wise the ending and opening is a banger especially the 1st season ed

Overall school rumble is a really good romcom with amazing comedy thats truly the depiction of youth"
141182,"I dont know why this got greenlit at all honestly, unless the 3rd season is supposed to be really good. The show spent the whole season introducing bland characters and building up new drama which we barely even get a glimpse of in this one.

As for the actual plot of this season, nothing of consequence really happens story-wise with the main character going through the easiest and most anticlimactic final fight I've seen in a while. The results are again anticlimactic ! since the main antagonist literally escapes after failing to kill or hurt a single member of the main cast.! (basically nothing happens to any of the characters). 

The season also contained a sub-plot where a minor character from the first season gets jealous of MC for being so overpowered that he gets rid of all conflict from the story. He then proceeds to get killed quite unceremoniously by one of the girls, not nearly warranting the amount of screen time they gave him. 

This brings me to my main criticism for the show, being that it generally lacks any redeeming qualities or distinctions from the sea of other isekais we've seen so far. After season 1, mc became so ridiculously strong that all the fights feel like him taking out the trash instead of being actually tense. 
The show also completely lacks any comedy which could compensate for this.
The setting itself also fails to be unique enough to pique the audience's interest, with what seems to be a very basic magic system, set in your typical video game medieval times. Either this was written as a very early entry into the isekai scene or it purposefully avoids adding any unique features to its world. 

If I had to say something nice about the show, Its that !hiroaki's! time on screen was slightly more interesting than average. They set him up to be just another cocky asshole to be put in his place by mr overpowered, however he turns out to be an ok guy. 

That said, the author tends to fumble every other character from the previous season as well. At multiple points the girls have to tell MC ""I can be useful to you, I'm always by your side"" and then they proceed to be wholly uninvolved in the fights which MC takes part in. During the climax the author tries to remedy this by 
!setting them aside from the main battle to kill nameless cannon fodder, while MC chases the villain. !
The girls basically just all love him, its a harem besides the funny hyjinks.
Except following the theme of utter blandness in this show, the girls have nearly the same personality and never disagree with anything MC does. They never really act up or do anything that god forbid, adds conflict to the story. 

This season could have been done as a set of flashbacks in the 3rd season and it wouldn't have even been jarring."
19429,"Akuma no riddle is an anime I really don't understand. It was marketed (and hyped) as a dark-action Yuri anime, but what it delivered was disney-esque action with a touch of friendship is magic. The story is based in a certain Myoujou Academy, where the black class is actually just a bunch of assassins trying to take out their hit (Haru). However though, one of the assassins (Tokakau) decides that she likes Haru and will protect her against all these terrors.

 img()

 Story (13/30)

Now, while the premise is rather interesting -being a death game and all- it imposes specific rules to this game. The winner of the game supposedly gets one of their wishes granted, but they must first give Haru an advance notice before they try to take her out. Since only one wish is fulfilled, it discourages the assassins from working together and forces them to give away their element of surprise. 

and from then on out, AnR fell to the ground.

Since the assassins were attacking in installments, it rapidly became obvious that Tokaku is gonna take them all out - after all, that is the only way for the plot to progress. This is often referred to as a ""Monster of the Week setup"". If you are unfamiliar with the terminology, a monster of the week setup has a strong monster appearing and posing a threat to the main character on a weekly (in this case, episodic) basis. Kind of like how pokemon did it. This forces the storyline down a very predictable path, with tokaku clearing assassins one after the other. If that wasn't bad enough, the assassins make such half-assed attempts at Haru's life that it is almost pitiable - and they do hype their master plans in advance.

 !This is probably best explained by Haruki's tactic. Before she attacked, she asked Nio if her wish will still be granted if she died and took Haru with her. This suggested something like blowing up half the school in an attempt to kill Haru so that her wish will finally be fulfilled. What really happened was that she made the theater lights fall on Haru- so SCARY. Even then, her master plan was executed perfectly, Tokaku was taken off-guard and the lights hit her the best they could. But what was the result of this perfectly executed plan? Tokaku just shrugged it off and stood up, and Haruki was knocked unconscious. What a lethal plan.!

After all is said and done, the story ends being pretty wishy washy and forcing happiness through plot armor alone. Oh, X didn't die from whatever would kill her cause company Y had inserted Z in her body!
Something like that. 

That said, not all is wrong with its story. I found that the buildup and atmosphere was really well created and the immersion was pretty nice. The character development -while being episodic- was still fairly good. Think of it like a football match, one team gets a great buildup, breaks through the opposing side with runs and spot on passing, trick the goalkeeper, and then they fail to score. Repeatedly.

 Characters (14/30)

 img()

For the most part, the characters were pretty diverse and didn't follow cardboard cut out archetypes. While there were till characters that were fitting certain cliches (rich girl, crazy girl, cute girl with the bear) they mostly outgrew those during their epsiode. 

And that right there is the fault.
Their episode.

Characters develop only during their turn as the monster of the week, outside of which they just talk about the current monster and comment on non-descript things (like, ""So, its time for THAT, huh?""). So even though their development is good in their own episodes, it still seems like ""oh, its time to throw some story out for girl #1321""

So to describe the development, the word I'd use is probably ""forced"". Despite providing a lot of story and spending a lot of time on the characters, it just isn't able to execute them properly.

That said, some ends really were great. The Romeo and Juliet one comes to mind. That was perfect. Although, the overall end of the series ruined that too. Anyways, the character I probably liked the best was probably Nio, she was pretty likable from the get go and her twin personalities were the deal clincher. I kinda liked banba too, but the story doesn't really give her the respect or the screen time she deserves.

However, considering the large cast of characters and only being given 12 episodes to fit the development in, I think AnR did a decent job.

 Artwork (7/10)
At the start, the palette was nothing special. It was somewhat gritty and realistic, but it was unable to cover for the plot's failures. Despite that, I liked the artwork at specific times. To be more precise, the art really only strays from ""average"" when it tries to be darker, and when it does get darker, it looks great. There aren't a lot of faults to speak of, but there aren't a lot of extraordinary thing either when its being all bright and sunny. 

Character models were fine and a bit heavily detailed, but once again, only showed greatness during darker parts.

The environment was surprisingly detailed, and while I would count that as a plus point, most of the time the environment isn't interactable. ""wait"" you say ""this isn't a game, what the fuck is an interactable environment in this context?"" By interactable, I refer to it being dynamic. Or perhaps showing when something should effect it. It just wasn't there.

 !Take a look at ep10, to be more specific, the part where Hanabusa (?) throws the chandelier at Tokaku. It hits her face first and drives her into the wall, after which Tokaku tries getting up and you can see that the wall is undamaged and the weapons are precisely where they were before being hit by a chandelier going like 40KMPH.

and right before that scene, Tokaku reaches for a pistol after leaving her cover and exposing herself to fire despite the fact that she had multiple weapons behind her!

!!

That said, I still adored the art style and it looked really good at certain points. I'd say that the overall artwork is good.

 Sound (7/10)
This was a fairly surprising development. Considering the wide cast of characters, I assumed that the VAs would probably be terrible considering they are only supposed to play anything approaching a normal character for one episode, but I felt that the VAs did a fine job with what they had.

 img()

The music section is quite...varied. I liked the OP to a certain extent, but the real meat of the music section is the ED. There are character EDs and all of them are unique to the episode and are voiced by the monster of the episode, not to mention - all of them are quite nice.

That is honestly all there is to talk about in the music section. The rest was pretty standard.

 Enjoyment (10/20)
For the most part AnR was...disappointing. Once again, I refer to the earlier football analogy. It was annoying how often the series missed its mark. It was like it wasn't even aiming for the goal, but at the audience of cheering fans who just want everything to work out. In that same sense, AnR's finishes were more aimed at the niche audience of 10 year olds who believe that everything in the world is bright and sunny with friendship being the power against all evil. Which is quite different than what it originally wanted to be - a dark gritty tale of lesbian assassins in a fight to the death. I mean, who the hell would NOT watch that? The complete disregard to its marketed genre and its incompetency at providing satisfying endings is probably the most paramount reason for AnR not being quite as enjoyable. But then again, there is some solace to be found in the fact that AnR really does have some good buildup and it isn't  boring at any point. The pacing is fair enough and it manages to shoehorn everything into 12 episodes.

With that said, I would't really recommend watching Akuma no Riddle to anyone that wants what it seems like. If you want a somewhat darker but happy ending sort of anime, then I guess this is it. Implying of course that such a market even exists, though I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

20995,"The audience disappointed me once again. It seems ridiculous to me, especially not to like the first two seasons and to like the darkness. I respect everyone's opinion, you may not like the previous ones but these 2 seasons are definitely not better than them. I also understand that the main characters have changed due to special circumstances, it wouldn't be a problem if it handle done well, but the series unfortunately couldn't do that.

I have nothing against fanservice (i have watched many ecchi shows with enjoy) but the fanservice in To Love Ru-Darkness seems way pointless for me. Unlike the prequel seasons, they're made just to be made and they're not funny.



The anime tried to be To Love Ru, but really failed. I don't mind that the story shifted to diffrent charcters, but I do mind that it shifted to the wrong characters. It's called ""Darkness"", so I expected to find out more about Golden Darkness, and I did, the problem is that side characters just became main charcters. Momo and Nana are not part of the main character Lineup. The relation between Rito, Lala and haruna became irrelevant, which is pretty bad, considering that they were the main reasoning for the story. For some reason the also thought it would be a great idea to make Rito love Momo more than Lala and Haruna, eventhough they really aren't that close as they illustrate it. 

I think it would have been better if the series had only focused on the side characters instead of the main and side characters making this unfimiliar and weird story lineup. This just isn't a good series anymore and since xebec have broken up their won't be an attempt to fix this mess. On the other hand it is sad to see the series fade out likethis. I really do hope someone will buy the licens to the anime and completly reboot it, by fixing the mess these two dark seasons have made.



No joy, no passion for the series, nothing. Just some writer masturbating to their shitty fantasies. Fantasies that freaking suck shit too. Of all of the anime that aren't failed comedies (a.k.a. the worst), this is it. I do not understand, I really do not understand. I've read a lot of reviews about this dark season, but for some reason everyone liked the season, it once again lost faith in the audience.
People were able to love these two seasons of darkness, I don't understand much. If you decide to watch Darkness s1 & s2, you will see that it is actually a standard ecchi anime made to entertain the audience with the whole season of Rito falling randomly on another girl's pantsu. And also it's funny how the series pretends to have a good story.

(Note - For the simplicity, I'm going to refer this Anime as Jinrui).

I'm writing this review simply because this seems like a niche Anime on AL. There isn't a single review or discussion thread for this and even one of the three people I know who watched this, ended up dropping it (while the other two gave a 9/10). But now, after completing this just few minutes ago, I'll say this;


img()
Jinrui takes place at a time where humanity is at the brink of it's existence due to decline in birth rates. But a new chibi life form known as ""Fairies"" who have very high intelligence and a sweet tooth for sweets & happy things, are starting to take over the mass population of the Earth. Our nameless protagonist, who refers herself as ""Watashi"" (means 'I' or 'Me'), is a mediator who helps to maintain a balance between declining Humans and overgrowing Fairies.
That didn't really sounded like a post-apocalyptic setting now, does it? I mean, just look at this vibrant & relaxing art-style and tell me they look like they're in loss of hope and existential dread;

img()

(Ok. Maybe the last image does gives away)

(Because we tend to follow each other)
img()
Jinrui is just, Watashi throwing quotable satires on everything she interacts in this world like Politicians, Business, BL fans, Manga, and some other pop culture media & storytelling cliches. And the protagonist's cynicism and dry sarcasm makes it all funny but can be a miss sometimes (or a lot of times, depending on your type of humor). But my favourite satire is from episode 2, which is a satire or callout to sub-watchers.
The scene goes like this;

!""Watashi enters a dark room. In there, is a council of a skinless chickens who are planning to conquer the entire world and they're explaining their plan like a B-movie villain to our protagonist. Since she couldn't understand chicken language, a fairy that hangs around her gives her ""Translator Glasses"", which translates the chicken language into Japanese subtitles. But she had to adjust synchronization speed & size, because she couldn't read those subtitles"".

This entire scene felt like it's calling out all the sub watchers cause, if you're a sub watcher who once downloaded Anime or any other media form, you know damn well the problem of unsynchronized subtitles. And the Anime is filled with a lot of these satirical moments.!

In this cast of eccentric characters, no one really has a name or atleast won't call each other with names, which is ironic when you find out there's an entire episode dedicated for naming fairies. The protagonist refers herself as ""Watashi"", the grandfather is called ""Grandfather"", assistant is called ""Assistant"" and pretty much everyone is just like that, except one person. Protagonist's friend ""Y"", and even that doesn't sound like real name, more like a code name. The fairies are pretty cute which goes against their destructive personalities. They all carry these dark & negative thoughts that hit home a bit, but they're mostly left like that. It goes more in depth into it's human characters, mainly the protagonists, in it's last couple of episodes that follows her life in her school days. And now comes one thing that's a bit problematic;

The Anime is in achronological order i.e., it shows events out of order. The problem is that, even though it's basically a satire, it doesn't feel coherent or ordered. You're thrown into events without a clear introduction or explanation, with only dry humor that doesn't sit right with it's cutesy art style as only entertainment, which makes it feels like it's confusing. If you're patient enough for 4 or so episodes, you might get the hang of it but it can feel really boring, considering the only entertaining point here is, satire & dry humor, and the achronological order makes it unnecessarily confusing.
Jinrui has a total of 7 arcs that are individual to each other. You don't really have to watch one arc in-order to know what happens in the other arc. It's just there only to form a jumbled timeline. It goes like this;
The Release Order (the Creators intended order)
1. The Fairies' Secret Factory (Episode 1 & 2)
2. The Fairies' Sub-culture (Episode 3 & 4)
3. The Fairies' Homecoming (Episode 5 & 6)
4. The Fairies' Time Management (Episode 7 & 8)
5. The Fairies' Survival Skills (Episode 9)
6. The Fairies' Earth (Episode 10)
7. The Fairies' Secret Tea Party (Episode 11 & 12)

The Chronological Order (the Timelapse Order)
1. The Fairies' Secret Tea Party (Episode 11 & 12)
2. The Fairies' Earth (Episode 10)
3. The Fairies' Time Management (Episode 7 & 8)
4. The Fairies' Survival Skills (Episode 9)
5. The Fairies' Homecoming (Episode 5 & 6)
6. The Fairies' Secret Factory (Episode 1 & 2)
7. The Fairies' Sub-culture (Episode 3 & 4)

I'm a ""Creators order on first watch; Chronological Order on a rewatch"" kinda person. Even though, the intended order has it's problem, it's better to watch it that way because that's what the creators wanted view it as, but I think the intended watch order might not make an entirely enjoyable watch, it didn't for me atleast. I found a couple of episodes boring, but it was a good watch overall.

If dry humor and satire is your type of comedy;
If you like weird but not completely explained Anime;
If you're OK with cute but slightly dark stuff;
This is for you.
Now, excuse me.

11761,"First review here. I'll try to keep it concise. There will be spoilers up ahead.

I've watched a lot of anime, and I tend to give them pretty high scores, mostly because I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to thing I enjoy. But this anime is easily the least enjoyable thing I've had the displeasure of watching in a very long time, with the exception of School Days.

For starters, if you're unfamiliar with the story, it's about Medaka Kurokami, a perfect and amazing girl with massive... charisma, and her objective is to solve the problems of the students of her academy with the help of the Student Council members, which she recruits as the series goes on.

In theory, the character of Medaka is meant to be a parody of Shonen heroes, being overpowered and having all sorts of nonsensical abilities (most of which aren't showcased in this season, but if you've seen the later parts of the manga, you'd know how absurdly broken Medaka gets). However, the problem with being a parody is that you can't just expect people to laugh about the concept of a joke character, when the ""joke"" is played completely straight.
I hate comparisons like these, but I feel that it would make my point easier to understand. Take a look at Saitama from One Punch Man. Saitama takes the concept of an overpowered character in a universe full of characters below his league, and it uses that to show how dull and depressing it really is to be better than everyone.
On the other hand, Medaka Box does the absolute opposite of this. Medaka and everyone else in the show knows about how wonderful and perfect she is, with only a few unfortunate fools having the guts to defy her. Needless to say, those foes tend to get instantly humiliated. There is one occasion in which Medaka is the one to lose, but it's played so poorly that even a kid would be able to predict it, and it does not even have negative repercussions for Medaka in the long run.

And when you take a look at the supporting cast, they're not any better at all. You have your underdog companion that's totally not head over heels for Miss Perfect; the ""funny"" loli that's always eating stuff or messing with underdog-kun; the other boy who is in love with Medaka, but doesn't actually bother hiding it; and the female character who starts off as a rival but then joins the team after getting kissed by Medaka (yes, it's as stupid as it sounds). Oh, and let's not forget the myriad of one-off characters that don't actually have any contribution to the plot other than to add filler!
Lastly, the main villain (whose name I didn't even bother to remember), is supposed to be menacing and strong enough to put an end to Medaka's reign, gets utterly humiliated after explaining his extremely boring and unmemorable motive. The worst part is that even after the overly-long speech about Medaka's ""ideals"", and the buildup for the villain's defeat, Medaka instantly forgives him and tells him to join the student council. I get that this is supposed to be ""funny"", but it just isn't. At all. It turns a somewhat valid antagonist into a zero.

After the final battle is done, the last episode of the season is... a filler one about shogi (Japanese chess). And it was just as boring as it sounds.

And even when considering all my gripes with the writing, I still can't find a reason to like this series.
The designs were decent and flowed well in motion, but in comparison to other Gainax works, it feels cheap and mediocre. It looks more like something you'd expect out of A-1 Pictures.
None of the designs really stood out, and some of them are so similar to each other that you can easily confuse the characters.

The sound design was not bad per se, but there's absolutely nothing memorable in it. The opening and endings were pretty generic and there's not even a sound effect that stuck with me.

But on the bright side, the show is pretty short, and the abundant fanservice is at least pleasant to the eye, as excessive as it may be at times.

So overall, I cannot recommend this series. It tries too hard to be a parody without actually being funny, and it lacks the self-awareness that could've saved that concept.

Please do yourself a favor and avoid watching this series at all costs."

This Anime is about this 4 year toddler named ""Kotarou"", who started to live alone in an apartment. But despite his age, Kotarou acts very mature. He addresses everyone with honorifics, he doesn't cry for every small mistake, he understands everyone easily... To put it simply, he's like the ""Perfect Kid"" every parent want their child to be. So, he should be happy, right?.. Right?

At it's core, this show tells how tragic it looks when a toddler tries so hard to be mature for the sake of others, when he should be enjoying the only time he can as a child. Even though, there's a fair amount of light hearted moments blended in every episode, it never looks like he's having fun, when he can & probably should be having fun more than anyone. For me, the most relieving scenes are, when Kotarou tries to imitate Tonosan, a fictional character who fights for justice (and looks a lot similar to [Anpaman](https://anilist.co/character/16401/Anpanman)). They are the only moments I find relieving, cause those were the only times he acts as a kid.

His neighbors aren't really the best examples you can think of for ""adults"". One is a lazy manga artist, one is a hostess and one is a Yakuza (There are others too). But they act all childish whenever they're around Kotarou and care for him a lot. It's like they are indirectly trying to tell him that it's OK to be childish, despite having their own trouble on their hands. They all live a broken life, but their encounters with Kotarou helps them to grow and this also applies to Kotarou himself.
While everyone is growing up to be an adult, Kotarou's growing up to become a kid.

As for the technical side of things, the art style and animation are bare minimum for an SoL show but the voice acting is really top notch. They really did an excellent job at hiring talented voice actors and they did a really great job. And the music fits the tone of the show pretty well too. The animation could've been a little better tho.

If there's one complaint for me, it's that it gets a bit repetitive after a certain event in the middle of the show (somewhere around episode 5 or 6). And there are 2 or 3 sexual jokes that are very unnecessary. It had a promising start but goes a little downhill in the middle and picks up at the final episode (The final episode is really good). Kotarou's past is by far the most mysterious thing in the show which drives the entire plot but it wasn't explored much cause the show took it's time to explore the character relationships with Kotarou.

We spend our childhood wanting to grow up faster. But we spend out whole adult life, wanting to go back to the simplicity of being a kid again.

Kotarou lives alone is a story that tackles heavy themes like child trauma and loss, with it's simplistic drama and mature cast."
239,"Ambition. An earnest desire for achievement or distinction and the willingness to strive for such an attainment is often fundamental in success. It produces action, bringing forth moods of passion, emotion and a yearning love for the endeavour. This is especially so with art, where the skill and craftmanship of creators are beared on display, readily available for consumers to take in and experience for themselves. However, in recent times one could argue that overall such craftmanship seems to have dwindled overtime, instead reverting to complacency in one’s ability to prosper. No longer when writing a story is a high level of skill required when accompanied with breath-taking visuals, nor is impressive production necessary for adapting acclaimed literature. Today, ambition appears no longer appreciated as it once was, and honestly, this does seem rational: why take a chance on something new and bold when settling on success still grants enough in return? It is this mindset that I sincerely believe breeds mediocrity whilst leaving those who dare try otherwise in the dust, but I would hope for the opposite; where originality is valued amongst the familiar crowd and if successful, could very well turn out a classic which stands the test of time. 

With that said… Madames and Monsieurs, good evening.

‘High above in the opera box a figure entered. Removing his top hat revealed streaming ripples of hair, his skin ghostly blue. The singer steps forward, hands outstretched as she came closer, her voice lifting higher and higher. He grasped a bouquet of flowers and once reached her climax threw it to her, leaving her audience in wonder; perplexed as well as in awe. He bowed among the applaud of many but to one soul in particular. Of this moment he knew tonight marked a new dawn – this shall be the prelude to vengeance.’

Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo is one such work of art that seems driven on ambition, exuding a distinct, lavish style unparalleled for its time and ever since has never been replicated to the same magnitude. There always lies a certain level of tension whenever adapting a classic adored by many, yet here lies not only a competent retelling of arguably the greatest lovers revenge piece ever put to paper, but a fantastic re-imagining able to stand on its own merit as a masterclass of storytelling. Rather than simply applying a shiny new aesthetic coat to fit a tried-and-true formula, Gankutsuou takes strides in significant changes to allow core facets from the original narrative to align seamlessly in this new world. The setting: Paris, Rome and other major cities used in the original are replaced by entire planets and sectors of the galaxy, each with their own set customs both suiting the sci-fi setting whilst matching mannerisms flaunted from characters near identic to the source material. Through this, the majority of characters are quintessentially the same for both versions, with their French names, relationship dynamics and mentalities crossing over smoothly. In short, it effectively manages to transfer the culture of 19th century Europe into one’s depiction of the 6th millennium without feeling out of place. The result is a rich world where spaceships, aliens and robotic horses are considered the norm, alongside fashion, architecture and entertainment more befitting of the Renaissance period than anything in the distant future. It’s a change of scenery more appropriate to call anachronistic than futuristic, projecting a sense of familiarity amidst the otherwise alien world that separates Gankutsuou from every other iteration of Dumas’ opus. But there still lies more prominent changes with respect to the novel.

The most obvious point of divergence between the original and this adaptation lies in their point of perspective; the former being an enduring melodrama of a man wrongfully convicted who enacts revenge on those who ruined his previous life. Whereas here the retribution played out is portrayed as a tragedy, fixated with the corrosive effect vengeance may have when framed through the lives of what could be considered as “collateral damage”. The most effective way Gankutsuou achieves this is by beginning halfway into the overarching plot, trimming huge swaths of unnecessary content while focusing primarily on the victims within this tangled web of one man’s vengeance. Most notably is Albert de Morcef, a young partisan who unbeknownst holds a greater grief and anguish than his contemporaries know. Displeased with the confines of his own life and desperate to seek out pleasure while he still can, almost as if by chance he meets and is immediately captivated by a mysterious stranger known only as “The Count of Monte Cristo”. He invites Albert to dine with him and partake in a game of fate, gambling lives under the illusion of choice. An enthralling experience, one the naïve hedonist yearns for more of, offers to be the man’s guide for reintegrating into aristocracy, entirely unsuspecting of the danger he has welcomed into his household.

“There is no such thing as coincidence. Everything happens out of necessity.”

Albert acts as the catalyst that puts the Count’s plan into action. Concomitantly strung within a tangled web of deception, greeting the spider readily descending on its prey. Of course, this web only appears as mere strands barely connecting to one another at first, allowing for the story to unravel in thrilling suspense and ambience. As the narrative continues along its own thread, the supposed “first half” of the story is subtly revealed moments at a time, unveiling the true motives behind the Count’s revenge in parallel to his plan enacted out in real time. The pacing of such is truly sublime: key information slowly leaked across the series’ runtime, letting the viewer tie the knots themselves, coupled with asphyxiating cliff-hangers that do enough to maintain excitement and continually upholds a sense of curiosity for what is to come. It delivers on an engrossing tale specifically to those unfamiliar with the source material, however it still remains immensely enjoyable for those experienced with the classic version also. Despite creating a mystery from the most well-known part, the writing here is astute; clever enough to realise this fact and takes careful steps that eventually peel away from the canon in order to move in its own direction, adding extra layers of mystery and surprises to fit with the original whilst feeling fresh at the same time. 

Although this tale is told from Albert’s point of view, the Count himself is without question the star of the show. A master manipulator, using his limitless amount of wealth, charm and guile to play everyone around him like pieces on a chessboard. His ability to shrewdly influence others from even the simplest of conversations is surely admirable to witness, but like a true mastermind he plays on the weaknesses of his adversaries. He creates the circumstances required where they cannot resist exposing their true nature: lust, greed, any immoral act they hold dear are brought to light, and he takes delight in such. An enigma, constantly shrouded in an aura of mystique both frightening and fascinating, his very presence begs one wanting to know more, and sometimes learning more only brings forth more questioning. Just who is the Count of Monte Cristo? Vampiric in appearance and devilish by nature, suave as well as sinister. Controlled chaos… yet also capricious. He embodies that of a man hollowed out by revenge, but at times still appears to have a heart. It’s near impossible to determine all his actions as either manipulations or stemming from true emotion, and this intricacy further makes the man such a beloved character in my eyes, more akin to a compelling anti-hero than the dastardly villain the story portrays him out to be. Regardless of how one views the Count in that regard, he holds an unmistakable charisma setting him apart from every other character. Whenever the Count is present on screen, he demands the full attention of every viewer, all heeding on every word he speaks. His words, often providing the best insight into the creation and complexity that is the Count of Monte Cristo:

“In the darkness, I awaited the dawn. And once dawn came, I cursed my flesh until night fell once more. I even prayed that I would lose my sanity. But those prayers went unheeded. I even strove for death, but the Devil’s cold, pitiless hand held me back.”

The Count and Albert are who ultimately carry this tale; the Count being cause for the mystery and overarching main plotline, with Albert contributing his point of view alongside the struggles attached with being at the centre of it all. Through Albert’s eyes a spotlight is cast upon numerous characters, each with believable characterization and strong chemistry that lends well to the dramatic story playing out. From his arranged fiancé Eugenie who constantly desires for independence, to his best friend Franz, a fellow partisan constantly involved in Albert’s affairs, frequently lending himself as a voice of reason whilst concurrently also directly affected at a similar degree as Albert courtesy of the Count – all are welcome expansions to their development compared to the source material where they barely held any relevance. Even characters who have their roles downgraded in this version are not relegated at the cost of their charm and never feel out of place. Everyone involved in Gankutsuou is complicated, entwined in a complex network of connections with each other and while some eventually fall by the wayside, a great number of them remain integral to the ongoing story.

Albert in many ways represents what the Count is not. Aside from being a very anime typical kind-hearted protagonist too credulous for his own good, from the beginning of the anime he expresses aspirations of breaking free from the confinements of his dull life that soon follows with him demonstrating clear naivete and general fragility. Albert is immature, often showcasing foolishness stemming from his young age and privileged aristocratic lifestyle. All and more play into why he is so easily enamoured by the Count’s mysticism. Albert is the most central character in the show, with his innocent disposition and despair suffered serving as the metric for drama to spring from. He is probably the most criticized part of the series, but as a sheltered 15-year old boy most of his actions can be considered as expected and these faults are what arguably make him oddly relatable. Alongside his friends, they all signify a “changing of the guard” of sorts, with their parents – all important and respected noblemen – representing established customs and traditions of their society, held atop an old, corrupt and overall defective order that forces others to accept it as they hold the power. But this new generation strive for a better tomorrow; one based of personal freedom, love and hope. Simultaneously involved is the Count, bringing about revolution, justice and a destruction for the establishment that wronged him, but also one of sorrow and chaos birthed from retribution. Interestingly enough, the Count does further allow for Albert and others to achieve their ideals, but there eventually lies a crossroad between both parties. This consequent clash also impacting the Count’s own inner conflict, with Albert reminding him of his past trusting nature, yet still driven by a need for revenge. At its climax, viewers bear witness to how far the Count would go through with his vengeance, and how far Albert would reach out to him.

“Everyone has a sword within their hearts; the purer the heart, the sharper the sword.”

The aesthetic choices made for Gankutsuou are what instantly set the series apart from practically every other anime currently in existence and is likely to be what makes or breaks the series for viewers. Personally, I found the artistic direction near impeccable, crafting the best visual definition possible for the term psychedelic. Director Mahiro Maeda had a clear vision for this anime, using Western impressionism and Ukiyo-e as inspiration for an art-style that beautifully blends the designs of classic European and space age to form this spectacular kaleidoscope of textures, with elaborate sets such as the Count’s household appearing more like a dream arthouse than anything remotely realistic. Almost every scene at the beginning of Gankutsuou utilizes various bright textures that immediately grab one’s attention, before slowly reverting to a neutered-down colour palette more welcoming to the eyes. These textures also provide an almost indirect means of characterization with the clothing worn and gorgeous imagery saturated across the series. Its distinct animation uses computer graphics to overlay bright colours and multiple background layers that blends the various animation styles used into scenes rather well. The result was something both complex and minimalistic that adds more value to character gestures and expressions. The staff wanted to create a show that “talked” to viewers, something that from my perspective was a success. The production is not perfect though, as CG still manages to come off jarring in the most climactic scenes. Studio Gonzo was behind the production for this anime, around a time where integrating traditional animation with CG was more often than not the norm for them, repeatedly receiving criticism for many lacklustre attempts. But with an anime so immaculate and extravagant in its design and surreal art-style, it barely amounts to a hindrance that is easily outweighed by the show’s visual strengths.

Much like the artistic endeavours that went into the visual side of Gankutsuou, the music accompanied is also masterful in its own right. The series features a strong soundtrack comprised of various classical tracks that flawlessly set the tone and ambience for each and every scene, lifting the dramatic moments to even greater heights. Ranging from serene and charming melodies to the more haunting and thrilling themes that aid immensely in the narrative conclusion of each episode, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats waiting eagerly for more. Jean-Jacques Burnel both composed and performed the opening and ending themes that were each a delight. The opening “We Were Lovers” involves a simple piano piece, bringing a softer nostalgic sound that draws viewers in, with lyrics vaguely describing lost love that speaks true of the Count’s background. The ending sequence “You Won’t See Me Coming” is a stark contrast to the former, bursting after every cliff-hanger with an energetic number along with distorted visuals that match the series far more as a thrilling drama. The voice acting is incredible across the board for both the dubbed and subbed version, with Jamieson Price and Jouji Nakata both being splendid standouts as the voices behind the Count. Overall it comes down to preference. I was more in favour of the English dub, but you cannot go wrong either way for this series.

Gankutsuou might be one of the closest examples of anime genuinely being considered a work of art. A beautiful series, artistically daring and meticulously plotted, each of its individual facets come together as an overlooked gem that when given the proper attention, shines ever so brightly. Transposing a time-treasured tale from one medium to another will always detract some for fear of ruining the beloved original story. But classics are eternal, and through reimagining old works in a new light they are enriched, able to awaken the love and respect of many generations that follow, staying in our hearts forever.

Out of the hundreds of anime I've seen over the years, only one of them is consistently able to bring such fond, bittersweet memories to mind every time I watch it. As I see this group of friends struggle to come to grips with the meaning of adulthood and love, inevitably, my mind starts to wander to memories of long-forgotten hopes and desires, and old friends of mine that are now far away... Memories of what it felt like to be in college, with no clear path to the future and no idea where to go next. This is Honey and Clover in a nutshell; it is a show so potently relatable, wise, and nostalgic that you will likely come away from it a better person.

Honey and Clover is based on a manga by Chica Umino, known for other titles like Eden of the East and 3-gatsu no Lion. While 3-gatsu has become very popular lately (for good reason), Honey and Clover is often overlooked, perhaps because of its age. It was released in 2006, but still feels incredibly relevant today. In fact, to me, this show feels more grounded and relatable than 3-gatsu, which often relies on the game of Shogi and the settings surrounding that lifestyle to convey its ideas. Here, we have a group of college students (and adults) trying to find meaning and purpose in a world that seems to lack both at times. That core, fundamental longing is something that every single person can relate to deeply.

Upon first watch, the art style might be the first thing you'll notice (apart from the incredibly weird yet legendary OP). The show is drawn almost like a watercolor painting, with faded colors and a hazy, almost dreamlike feeling to it. This unique style fits the subject matter like a glove, and gives the show a soft, comforting feeling, like coming back to a warm home after being out in the cold all day.

Honey and Clover's sound design is a home run, with an all-star cast of voice actors that deliver on every line, and an OST full of emotionally-moving songs that capture moments in time. These songs will sound objectively good on first listen, but as the show goes on, they come to life, and may even bring you to tears. The OST simply brings out the best of every scene, and I can find no fault with it. Oh, and it also features one of the most underrated ED songs of all time: Waltz by Suneohair.

For any slice-of-life series, the heart of the show usually boils down to its characters, and Honey and Clover nails this like few others. Whether it be the uncertainty of adulthood looming in Takemoto's future, Yamada's unrequited love, or Hanamoto-sensei's lingering memories of youthful days gone by... Almost every single character is shockingly human. This is where Honey and Clover truly shines: it has an almost universal relatability that borders on painful accuracy at times. As a result, once you're hooked, it takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride. The humorous moments are on-point, and the emotional moments can hit like a truck; few shows can take you from a hearty laugh to the verge of tears as quickly as this one. 

Chica Umino undoubtedly has a generational talent for writing characters that feel like real people. Here, she was in top form. The cast of this show is absolutely unforgettable, and the intertwining stories of their lives feel natural and genuine. Each and every episode is filled to the brim with wholesome character interactions that make you feel like you're spending time with old friends, and you'll find yourself wanting to come back to visit with them time and time again, to discover one more anecdote - one more nugget of wisdom.

If there was a weakness to be found here, it would be the story, as there really isn't much of an overarching plot to speak of. The characters' lives are the story, and the show doesn't really need much more than that. However, I would be remiss not to at least mention the rather sudden and highly controversial ending of the series. It's something I've always overlooked due to the sheer quality of the show as a whole, but if you're expecting a satisfying, mind-blowing conclusion to the series, you will probably be disappointed (there is a sequel as well, called Honey and Clover 2, that ends the series; in my mind, I count both as one complete show). Much like life itself, this show is not about the destination, but the journey, and few journeys are as touching and meaningful as this one.

As you can probably tell by now, this show is very special to me. When I first discovered it over 10 years ago, while living on-campus at college, it felt like a revelation. To a young man drifting along without any real aim in life, it provided immense wisdom. It taught me the beauty of a simple, honest life, and how precious everyday moments should never be taken for granted. It showed me that adulthood doesn't mean leaving the things you love behind. Even now, as a grown man in his 30s, I still find value every time I come back to spend time with these characters. I've lost count of how many times I've re-watched it, so, I may be a bit biased, but I truly believe this show is one of the greatest anime ever made, and it is undoubtedly my personal favorite of all time. The worth of this show simply transcends entertainment. 

Even though all of this praise is subjective, as all reviews are, I invite you to find out for yourself. Spend some time with this masterpiece. Open your mind, and see where this show takes you. You might just discover something valuable about yourself in the process."

This Review contain spoiler from the third paragraph!

I honestly have so much I want to get off my chest about Stampede after watching it. So just like this movie. This review will be a full-blown spoiler fest. I am not holding anything back, so don't proceed unless you are fully caught up to the manga. Seriously, just don't watch the movie under any circumstance unless you love being hit by a tsunami of spoilers. That's right. Oda-sensei and studio Toei went all out with this movie. It's a sure-fire way of letting yourself get spoiled and have the journey of One Piece ruined a lot if not even completely. Honestly speaking, only someone who is caught up with the story is able to follow the movie without getting confused or overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content here. Just to give you an idea of the kinds of a spoiler to expect, like contextual, foreshadowing events from the main story. Others like character reveal, such as bad guy of the arc and so forth, even powerups. This is a shounen after all. Lastly, there's an endgame related topic that you'd definitely wanna avoid at all cost. I wanted to do a review with no spoilers, but sheesh, that was so boring. So it made do temporarily. Here are my actual feelings about Stampede without sugar-coating zip.

Stampede is undoubtedly an anime movie that is an outstanding example of how to utilize it being ""non-canon"" to the fullest. So you can get much out of it without coming out feeling a sense of disappointment. A hell-of-a passionate love letter to all the fans worldwide and a damn well written on at that gets the point across. Toei went all out with this movie and pulled out all stops to get everyone's attention right from the getgo. There is not a single moment in the film that I would consider dull or slow. It's sufficiently high paced, and you are continually being hit by amazingly breathtaking spectacles one after another. You simply don't get the time to breathe out as you see your character do some hype shit. Or get lost in all the kinds of craziness going on at the screen every damn second without letting go throughout its duration. The story takes place on Delta Island were pirates from across the globe come together in one place. To hold a massive festival with challenges, and even more significant and incredible surprise that will shake the whole world.

Expect to see all kinds of familiar faces, from the Supernova, and known government official right from Navy HQ, to secret organizations. Toei and Oda-sensei went another step up and brought cast from fillers and other movies, even if just for a brief time. But the fact at the matter is, this festival is a bait laid by Bullet to lure out all the strong fighters and everyone else. His only objective is to become the strongest in the whole damn world, even surpassing the likes of the famous Gold D. Roger, the previous King of the Pirates. Yes, a straightforward plot with not much nuance or depth, as you can expect from most One Piece movies. But it comes down to the execution, direction, and everything else. On that end, with an overflowing sense of confidence, I can say they nailed it damn big time on all accounts. If you take into account, this movie barely lasts 2 hours. It's definitely worthy of praise, looking at how much they were able to accomplish, plus the production value is gorgeous.

Both artistically and visually, it's one hell of an eye-candy experience and the best you'll get out of any One Piece movie so far. So full of passion, colorful, and very vibrant and pooping experience. There's a fair use of CGI here, but it was nothing short of top-notch as expected by Toei. I have nothing to pick on. One simple way to explain Stampede in one short sentence is it's the Avengers: End Game equivalent of the anime. There's in a total of three movies (four now), which are considered top dogs of the One Piece film. All of them excel, especially in one category. Let's start off with Strong World. It has both a good plot and lots of slice of life, which is always charming. Shiki is a scary and gripping villain, even while being a total goofball. Film Z still has the best depictions story depiction with a great antagonist that has more depth to him than anyone so far. He surpasses the likes of Tesoro from Film Gold, and yes, even Bullet. I will get to that soon. Finally, there's Gold, as noted before. The strongest point is the abundant amount of interactions with our beloved cast we get. Tesoro is well-written enough to make us feel bad for him in a flash of backstory sequences. This is to give you a comprehension of what happened to him in his awful past. Now don't get me wrong. All of these antagonists are at the very least good. For me, Z was the best executed so far.

As for Stampede, it shines in the breathtaking non-stop action sequences that are packed and loaded to the brim with so much flavor and spice. One of these is the ridiculous number of cast members they threw at us. Many of your well-beloved characters make a comeback even if it's quick. It's still fun and gives you a dose of nostalgia to see them again. I have to say I am blown away by how Oda-sensei and Toei were able to write such a passionate love letter to all the fans of One Piece worldwide. As I said multitudes, it's a fanservice movie, and hence the story suffers from it. If you are looking for a great story. It will no here. As such, Bullet could be considered the weaker part of the movie from a writing standpoint, but he is definitely one of the strongest. Bullet is extraordinarily powerful and impressive others way you can imagine. His design is quite killer, and he looks menacing and just pure awesome. But his character is quite simple written and even if he has some good exploration of Bullet. It might not be enough for many. I was plenty satisfied myself. But it would be nice to see him more fleshed out as a person and not just the big bad guy.

Okay, Bullet's had a lot of gorgeous and mesmerizing depicted fight that your eyes were glued to, full of excitement and charm. Gosh, where do I even begin? Bullet's first clash with Supernova was so damn amazing, and the way he just crushed everyone. What a beast. Luffy's King Haki clash and Bullet's honestly made me go on a mad fanboi session. Ah, Oda-sensei, you even hid hints for the future of Haki. I just loved it so much. That whole fight with Bullet and everyone else was great. If I had to nitpick. I would love to see Bullet crush everyone in his normal state and not in giant mecha like structure. The CGI otherwise looked terrific and exquisite. Bullet's whole fight with our gang I didn't expect was beyond terrific and hade the inner fanboi in me going crazy. My girl Hancock got her time to shine, and that kick right down Bullet's spine was oddly satisfying, and I loved that sound effect. I replayed that moment so many times, my arm almost fell off from repeatedly going back. That goes for so many other insane moments Stampede packed. Hancock's whole routine with Buggy was hilarious. That's not me even mentioning how funny it was when Buggy was monologing about his looming death or getting shafted to the side by the gang. Law is in a more major part of the movie that was welcome addiction. Too bad, Kid didn't get much time to shine. Hopefully, he will in the next one. But I relish the banter we got from him and Luffy and how he and Luffy worked together to get at Bullet. 

Even all of the Supernova working together was like a dream-come-true moment. And honestly, a teaser, no doubt. This whole movie, in fact, is Oda-sensei teasing and letting us get a taste for what's to come yet. Oda-sensei even stated the movie would pale in comparison to what he has planned in the main story. Not the exact words, but you get the point. My boi Crocodile and Lucci had an appearance. It's too bad they didn't get a lot of screentime, but I loved to see them again. The same goes for the Sabo. Zoro's clash with Fujitora had me fired up, and I didn't expect it, so the impact over my emotions was massive. How Zoro sliced that mentor in half, but then Hawkeye came and utterly destroyed it so it couldn't hurt anyone was great. I like how Hawkeye was smugly and kindly glanced at Zoro, possibly telling him something along the lines you're not there yet, but was happy about his progress. I can't believe these two will fight for the title of the world's strongest swordsman. That will be insane once we get there and possibly heartbreaking. If Oda-sensei goes there.

Ah, that final fight among Bullet and Luffy was beautiful. But first, let me bring up the first battle again. I have probably said it countless times already, but I absolutely loved it. Luffy's Snakeman form fighting against Bullet was epic beyond belief. But that final battle was even more insane and impactful. First, I have to give Usopp the MVP reward because how he sneaked in his Pop Green into Bullet armor to destroy it was witty. It helped Luffy in beating Bullet as well. Since if he got himself into that form again. Luffy might've lost there. As we've learned, his Haki is one another level and truly tough. Oda-sensei threw in an idea of how flowing haki (I am calling it that since it's easier and faster to write and say) would work. Luffy literally destroyed Bullet armor from the inside-out. You can see the Haki flowing in there. If we say that colored arms have three stages. One is the way to arm yourself with an invisible shield to deal more damage or lessen the blow from others. Second is how you can shoot it out in the form of a ki-blast by concentrating Haki at your palm. Like Rayleigh did with the elephant on Rusukaina island or even three admirals and Sentomaro did in Marineford and Saboady Archipelago, respectively.

Wow, I got a bit sidetracked there. Anyway, that ultimate King Kong gun is extremely huge. Just look at how small our mad lad Luffy looks in comparison. I loved the fight and how it was a group effort to take down Bullet. Maybe an experiment to see how the inevitable fight with two of the emperors might go down. I can keep on going sharing the plethora amount of great moments, but I think I have said enough to get the point across. I absolutely loved this move to tiny bits. So as expected of a movie of this size and with such a limited duration, not everyone will be satisfied. If you are purely looking for fun and to see all the pieces of why One Piece is such a blast in one place. Then this will be a good time for you. That's why I have no complaints as a person who loves One Piece and from a personal standpoint. I will not let a few issues that couldn't be helped take away all the other fun I had. Oda-sensei did plant some canon stuff in the film, as briefly mentioned before. It was so rich even if it not a huge amount of information. I am sure us One Piece fans have more than enough info to go all out, theorize, predict, and so forth. Information Oda-sensei has written and drawn in the manga is also foreshadowed here to give us more things to speculate about. I want to touch upon this lightly. 

Oda-sensei is such a troll. He never specified how to prounced Laughtale, which was previously for us dancing to his tunes known as Raftel. Its mindblowing Oda-sensei was able to keep that Piece of info untill he deemed it right to reveal it. No one predicted, and it would be such a huge thing, too, to see someone. The island of tales of those who laugh -Laughtale, the name is a big hint to what that island could be like or possibly even the One Piece itself. I adored that moment we got to showcase Rogers's flashback just a bit. I should've mentioned this too previously. We know that Bullet was strong from the getgo was apart of the military but got betrayed by his parent-like figure because of that strength, and they felt threatened. So Bullet became disheartened and went to find a meaning for his life, but he didn't understand his own emotions. So he went around to cause some ruckus untill he eventually crossed paths with Roger. And was impressed by his strength and came to admire as he also got beaten by someone for the first time. I like how it shows Bullet has a character subtlety by showing his innocent-like smile when Roger welcomed to fight him again anytime. He realized it during that he just wanted to have fun, and being the strongest in the world was just an excuse to have something hide that fact. That's my interpretation of Bullet in a nutshell. 

So yes, at the end of the day, Bullet was not that simple as one might think. This movie was a lot of fun, and I have already watched it three times. Twice with subs and one in the dub, and both are top-notch for me. We also get to relive one of the biggest core things that make One Piece such an engaging, fun, and thrilling experience. I was thus not in the slightest felt the movie was terrible or affected my enjoyment. It's gonna be something I watch there and there. This movie is my favorite of all One Piece films so far from the fanservice and purely action aspect. That goes for the abundance amount of character we go here. Basically, are you a hardcore fan of One Piece. You will absolutely fall in love with this movie. Oh, like that moment with Ace illustration, and Sabo was so beautiful and emotional. But If you don't mull over how the story structure is weak and simple. Then it might not be for you. But try not to look it at negative, or that's what you will see. Instead, immerse yourself in all the aspects that go to makes One Piece so phenomenal and more. Enjoy the nostalgia and excitement it brings. Stampede is a full-blown fanservice film and a breathtaking one at that. Extremely high and gorgeous production value from start to finish. Let's also not forget this movie is to commemorate the 20th anniversary of One Piece anime's long run. So I have nothing but praises and love for Toei and our only legendary Oda-sensei. For producing such a high-packed and passionate action movie. One that delivers in all the right categories. Goes above and beyond to give the viewer a completely satisfying and overwhelmingly fun experience."

Megalo Box first aired in the Summer season of 2018. Part of the 50 year anniversary for the legendary series Ashita no Joe it was... satisfactory. It brought anime fans back to a different time, an older time, in ways good and bad. Yet despite ostensibly being an ""Original"" Megalo Box was so heavily tied to Ashita no Joe that it couldn't escape the comparisons. The story felt like a retelling of something we got 50 years ago, smashed into a 13 episode season. And while some, myself included, still enjoyed the series it felt like something was missing. In Nomad we find that something. While while watching Nomad I felt like I was watching Megalo Box for the first time. The real Megalo Box, more than just a copy of Ashita no Joe, what the series was always meant to be. And I love it.

Let's dive in

Like always the best place to start is with the visuals. And compared to everything else about the show it is here that Nomad has evolved the least. If you enjoyed the aesthetic and style of the first season than this is a good thing! The lines are still rough, the colors bright and the backgrounds detailed. If anything the art has only gotten rougher and heavier as the linework on characters appears to ebb and flow, both in thickness and intensity. Perhaps there is an overreliance on dark browns and greens early on, making darker scenes difficult to see at times. But I quite like it myself! It’s generally a very striking style that stands out among the clean, digital art we see in most anime today. Sadly there is one major flaw, or perhaps… eccentricity depending on how you look at it, to Nomad’s style. The resolution.

Just like it’s predecessor Nomad goes to absurd lengths to recreate that feeling of watching an older anime. That feeling of watching a 480p or 720p show on an HD monitor. And it does this by upscaling. By rendering/creating the footage at a lower native resolution and then forcing it to up to HD, 1080p ([Learn more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/8fuott/nerdpostanimeproductionresolutionmegalobox/)). It might not look it because of the size of the screen shots here but the effect is noticeable. Initially this is rather novel and suits Nomad well. It truly does feel older. But as the show goes on, as you get used to it, it starts to become… annoying. The beautiful backgrounds can become ruined by the resolution switch, characters can become fuzzy and lighting difficult. As much as its a part of Megalo Box’s unique visual style I can’t help but wish it was done away with.

This brings me to Nomad’s animation and all I can say is that, like the art, it hasn’t changed much. Just like the first season, Nomad isn’t what I would call a powerhouse. Don’t get me wrong, there are some great cuts! Shinichi Kurita created one of my [favorite scenes of the season](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/154822). When Nomad wants to it’s rougher, looser style of art and design allow for some [great movement](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/155478). But that’s the issue: When it wants to. And Nomad generally doesn’t. The cuts above are a small, small minority in Nomad. Fights often feel slow and plodding, impacts are weak and sometimes you can’t even tell if a punch landed or not. Even the final fight felt lacking here! Is this upsetting? A little bit, yes. But unlike the Megalo Box’s first season Nomad doesn’t actually have that many fights. Or rather, they aren’t the focus of the show.

What I’m saying is that if you came to Nomad for hype fights and fantastic action sequences you will be disappointed. You will often go an entire episode without a single punch being thrown or fight even talked about. And the fights you do get? Well only 2 really made me “wow” at the visuals. It’s outside those fights, in the scenic views and gorgeous backgrounds, that you will find Nomad’s true worth. The quiet moments where the characters and the story are front and center. Because that’s what Nomad is really bringing to the table, where it’s strengths lie: The narrative. And what a fantastic narrative it is.

Nomad's story is easily my favorite part of the show. It's not perfect, and we will talk about why, but it is emotionally effecting. And not in that sappy melodrama sort of way, with signs that say ""CRY NOW"" in all caps. Rather, its a very human story, one that speaks to our lives as a whole instead of a singular moment or experience. It's a story about home and family. About making mistakes, recognizing them and then moving forward with your life despite them. Of not letting who you were define who you are. And in that sense I think Nomad's story isn't just about the characters, but about the show as a whole. Just like Joe must accept his past and work towards a new future with his chosen family, Megalo Box must accepts it's Ashita no Joe roots and strike out to be more than a retelling.

Enough fancy meaning and symbolism behind Nomad's story though, lets get into the nitty gritty! Set 7 years after the events of season one, Nomad follows ""Gearless"" Joe, once again alone in the world. Traveling the desert, fighting in underground matches, what happened to Joe? Where did Gansaku, Sachio, Yuri and Aragaki go? I won't spoil those here, suffice to say a lot has happened in the time skip. Structure wise, Nomad's story can be split into two main arcs, or halves, of the season. The first arc is easily my favorite as Joe travels the desert, meets a group of immigrants, listens to their story and comes to learn what it means to be ""home"". Meanwhile the second arc deals with Joe's return to the city and his reunification with his family along with a side-plot involving Shirato, big tech and a new antagonist named Sakuma. Interested? Read on.

This is where I have to dive a bit into spoiler territory if I want to have any kind of meaningful discussion about Nomad's narrative. If you haven't watched the show you can skip this bit and go to my conclusion where I say ""This is pretty damn good!"". However if you have watched the show then click here and let's talk some light spoilers. And if this section seems to short don't worry, I talk about how much I love the theme's later.

!First up, the first half! This is without a doubt my favorite part of Nomad. It takes Joe out of the ring and puts him into the shoes of the coach. Letting him experience what it's like for a fighter to put their life in his hands and to put his trust in the fighter. Trust that they will win and return home alive. All the while watching from the sidelines unable to anything to help until they come back to you. Meanwhile Chief, the best new character, teaches Joe what it means to have a home to return to. How families, chosen or otherwise, aren't destroyed by a single argument but by the individuals giving up on them. And the entire time it does this through the lens of the immigrant experience as Chief's community struggles to find a home in a new land. It's incredible.

This brings me to the second half of Nomad's story where it starts to flag a little. Here Joe returns home to the city and tries to reconnect with his estranged family, Team Nowhere. All of that is great stuff! His conflict with Sachio, how all of the orphans have moved on after he left and how he has to earn their trust back after disappearing all those years ago. But where Nomad missteps a bit is the introduction of Mac and the Rosco Corporation. On his own Mac's story works well, it's another exploration of ""Family"" and in many ways acts as a mirror to Joe's. However at times it feels like this arc, mostly the Rosco Corp's stuff, comes to overshadow the more familial themes. That this focus on corporate scheming and profit takes away from what made the first half good.

And that's basically the main thrust of the argument with Nomad. Whenever it's focusing on themes of family, immigration, hope, etc, it's really good! But whenever it breaks away from that and starts to involve other factors, like the military industrial complex and mega-corporations, it feels like it loses focus. Luckily Nomad manages to bring this all back together pretty well. It was shaky for a few episodes but through Mac, Nomad connects even this disparate threads to the main story. It takes Rosco Corp, everything about it, and turns it into a tale of exploitation. Of how big corporations will prey on the poor, the immigrant communities, to turn a quick buck and then throw them away when they are done. It explores class dynamics and the disparity in medical treatments, and how the costs for those treatments hang over the lives of many families.!

To sum it all up what I'm saying here is this: Nomad tells a really ambitious story. One of inspired hope and damaged idols. Of found families and new homes. A story that can connect with anyone that has ever moved somewhere far away from home in search of work or a new life, whether it be to another country or even another State, etc. A story that is, at times, to ambitious and tries to cast its net to wide. Ultimately I think Nomad succeeds. It manages to bring all of these arcs together into a conclusive and satisfactory conclusion. But there were a few bumps along the way and in some places its desire to tell a heartfelt story conflicted with its need for boxing action set pieces.

Also the Latin theming is just gorgeous. I'll talk about this more in the OST section, I promise, but... just trust me when I say we need more Latin American/Spanish themed anime. Please.

That brings me to the characters! Though with how tightly they are tied to Nomad's story we've already largely covered them. Overall I would say Nomad has a pretty strong cast, both old and new. Naturally there the returning characters such as Joe, Sachio and the rest of the family. All of whom feel like good continuations of who they were in Megalo Box after the 7 year time skip. Their motivations, their relationships, their goals, all of these are compelling and make sense! Joe in particular has undergone a major transformation and its presented well. Indeed the only major complaint I have is that Nomad relies a bit to much on flashbacks to tell their stories. Often jumping us back 5 years for half an episode at a time to give us more backstory when I would rather it show us the effects of such history in the present.

So rather than spend a lot of time having a spoiled discussion about Joe, Gansaku and Sachio let's instead talk about the new characters and how they influence the old. I am of course talking about Chief, Mac and Sakuma, the three big new additions for the cast. Chief is pretty straight forward, he's the best character in the show. This is a man who has gone through everything Joe is now, who was inspired by Joe to come to this land, who never lets the world beat him down, a paragon. He is the ideal that Joe wants to become but doesn't think he is worthy of. Yet he isn't a Gary Stu either. Chief's made mistakes, he's susceptible to anger and all the emotions we feel. He's a broken man just like Joe, but one who has found a home and is determined to keep it.

Next we have Mac, mirroring another facet of Joe: The one 7 years past. Where Chief is what Joe aspires to be, Mac is what Joe was. Someone in the process of breaking his family through actions that are not his fault but that he still feels responsible for. Mac is here to show that it's never to late to fix things. That running away, for however short a time, only makes things worse. Meanwhile outside of his connection to Joe, Mac also takes the reins of Nomad's theme's surrounding immigration. How good men can be inspired, find a life and a family in a new land, be accepted by their communities. Where Chief and his people were being pushed out, Mac has become the local hero. Yet the sorts of problems that plague Joe, Chief and Mac are not limited to any one social class. They are universal.

Finally out of the 3 major new characters we come to Sakuma. Sakuma is... he's complicated. Not in his story, of that he's rather straight forward. Sakuma quite literally represents the willingness of big corporations to take advantage of the poor, the disenfranchised, for their own personal gain, consequences be damned. He views the world from his ivory tower and doesn't have a care in the world for the lives he is destroying and in that he fills his roll well. However throughout many of his early scenes Sakuma felt... out of place? Like he was part of a larger story that Nomad didn't need to tell. Like a blatant villain thrown into a story of complex characters just for the sake of having one. Ultimately I think his presence works fine for Nomad. But your mileage may vary.

All in all I would say that Nomad has a pretty good cast of characters. They are brought down a bit by Sakuma and his assistant for me but only because the rest are just... so damn good. Joe, Chief, Mac, their families, how their stories intertwine, etc. All of that is fantastic. If you don't mind a bit of Billionaire Tech Mogul thrown in for everyone to unite against then I think you will have a grand time with Nomad.

EDIT: [You can find the full OST here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgQ8JZRlBBw)

Finally, in the last ""real"" section of this review, I get to to talk about the OST and sound design! And if you know anything about the first season of Megalo Box you know that's OST was fantastic. [Manabu Yamaguchi, AKA Mabanua](https://anilist.co/staff/123867/Mabanua) and the man responsible for the soundtracks of Megalo Box, Nomad and BNA, incredibly talented. He can take a setting, whether it be a bustling city or lonely desert, distill its essence and infuse that into his music. Take a listen to his original Megalo Box soundtrack if you don't believe me. From the melancholic and simple tones of [""Sachio's Theme""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NKhW7EyyLU&t=1209s) or the almost community driven [""The Slum""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NKhW7EyyLU&t=1603s) to the high class strings of [""Yukiko's Theme""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NKhW7EyyLU&t=2141s) or the thrumming reverb in main theme [""MEGALOBOX""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NKhW7EyyLU). It was my favorite OST of 2018. And Nomad is my favorite OST of 2021 so far. Thanks Mabanua.

Now you might ask me, ""Lenlo why are you bringing up Megalo Box's OST so much""? Well aside from because its awesome, the answer to that is because a lot of it reappears in Nomad. As the story shifts back to the city the original themes begin to return. There are variations of course, shifts in instruments, pacing or mood for the tracks along with a couple new ones to match how the characters have changed. This is pretty cool! Not only does this let us hear, as well as see, how the characters of changed but it changes the feel of the entire show. The music is changing not only to fit the emotions on screen but our location in the world as well. Giving each location a distinct sound, unique to them. So, if Megalo Box is the city sound and all, then what is Nomad?

Nomad my dear friend is LATIN FIRE. Seriously just give this track from episode one, [""El Canto del Colibrí""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICUyh0AKSQs), a listen. While I can't speak to the authenticity of the lyrics or their pronunciation, since I don't speak Spanish, I can at least say they sound authentic. That when paired with the guitar and Mabanua's soft-spoken way of singing it evokes images of Latin America, of the culture and their way of life. And this sort of sound permeates the first arc. It pains me that the OST isn't released so I can't give you good, direct links to the music so you will just have to take my word on this: Nomad lives and breathes this setting, this culture. And while in the second half it fades away to make room for the more city oriented music, what we get is incredible. More anime need to use Latin music.

This brings me to sound design, the ""boring"" part of this section. I say boring because I'm not a sound engineer! I can't speak to the quality of sound, whether they come from existing libraries or anything like that. All I can do is say whether or not they impacted my enjoyment one way or another. And the answer? Not really. I was never taken out of the moment by the sounds, they never felt out of place. Similarly though I was never really wowed by them. Part of me thinks this is a conscious choice on Nomad's part though. That it's sounds try to stay in the background so that the music, the real star, can take center stage. Whether its intentional or not though, that's the effect. The way Nomad mixes its sound allows the music to reign. And since I love the music, I say good choice.

And with that we are done with the official part of the review! This bit here is just a place for me to ramble a bit and talk about Nomad without any sort of set structure or singular topic. It's where I spoil the absolute hell out of the series and talk about what makes it special for me. Basically it exists to let you, dear reader, have a look into my head and see what I connected with. Might even spark a conversation, who knows. So you don't mind MAJOR spoils or have watched the show then feel free to read on. Otherwise skip it and come back later. In we go! 

!Nomad starts in a really weird place. It's a 7 year timeskip from the end of Megalo Box, Joe is alone and addicted to painkillers, traveling a desert. Gansaku is dead, the family is broken up and I'm just sitting here wondering ""What the hell happened"". I can't think of a stronger way for Nomad to break off and differentiate itself from Megalo Box, from Ashita no Joe, than to literally abandon all the trappings of it's first season. This immediately sets the tone as not only is Joe looking for a home, looking for a place to belong, Nomad is to. The show itself is trying to find out what it is and where it belongs. And while the answer it eventually arrives at is back where it started, like Joe, it's relationship with that starting point has changed drastically. Now it belongs, on it's own terms.

So, how does this tie back into immigration, the title of this section? It's actually rather simple: Joe, and Nomad as a whole, aren't the only things looking for a home. Indeed, it's actually the entire cast. But Nomad pays particular attention to two men who mirror Joe in many ways, Chief and Mac, and their experiences searching for and creating their own home in a new land. I mentioned it above but this is something a lot of people can connect with and relate to, no matter how far you are moving. And while Nomad makes fantastic use of the culture and sound, its not a uniquely Latin American experience either. The feeling of being ostracized, discriminated against for your race, disparaged and mocked despite everything you do speaking to the contrary. Of having blame laid at your feet for things you never did. Nomad captures this incredibly well.

We first see it with Chief and Mara. How they are attempting to take something no one wanted, an abandoned amusement park, and turn it into a community. How they have to fight for everything they have but still maintain their humanity despite all of the inhumanity that surrounds them. Showing us life from their perspective and how unfair and cruel the actions of those already living there may be, whether you notice them or not. They are victims of persecution yes, but they don't let that define them. Chief stands strong in the face of it, becoming a paragon of virtue in the show all the way until the end, despite how many characters in Nomad describe him and his community. Nomad uses him to say ""Look! You're wrong! These are not bad people, they are not lesser, they are just like you and me, dreams and all!"".

This brings me to Mac who approaches the same experience but from a different angle. Where Chief and Mara are just getting started in this new land, Mac has been here awhile. He's successful, he found a home and family, earned a proud career guarding his community. And yet despite all of that the exploitation continues. This time it's not from the community, who has largely accepted him, but from the big corporations who want to use him. Who want to be seen and connected with the ""successful"" immigrant, who wants to use his story for their own profit. And when they are done, when Mac wants to cut ties and remove the BES chip? They are prepared to throw him away without a single thought to his own health and safety.

And while this part of the narrative isn't as cleanly put together as the first, mostly due to Sakuma and the corporate politicking sucking up a lot of it's time, I still found it effecting. Nomad tapped into something special here. Managed to connect with a part of the human experience in a way that I don't think many anime have. Many try of course! Shallow attempts at depicting racism or class struggles are a dime a dozen. But Nomad pulled it off with such authenticity, such are for how its depicted, that I can't help but love it. So despite the production woes, despite the imperfect 2nd half and Sakuma's role in the whole thing, I think Nomad did a great job here.

I realize I rambled for a bit there but that's sort of what this section is. A stream-of-consciousness visit into my head. I hope it helped you see what I did in Nomad.!

So! All in all, when everything is said and done and boiled down to a single paragraph, how was Megalo Box: Nomad? After 4000 words this is the answer I have come to: Its pretty good. The production has some issues and it makes some stylistic choices that I don't like, sure. Nomad really could have done without the upscaling and the final fight definitely didn't get the treatment it deserved. But the story, characters and themes of the work engaged me in ways nothing else could this season. I loved their journey, their arcs, and the satisfying, happy conclusion it brought. It's not often an anime really earns its happy ending. But Nomad certainly did."
156023,"I watched “Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?” purely for the wholesome bits that were regularly posted on the r/anime subreddit, and it did deliver in that aspect, but fell short in many others.


The story revolves around Zagan, a mage who falls in love at first sight with Nephy, a female elf slave. Despite the problematic power dynamic, Zagan is uncomfortable with the idea of owning the person he loves and doesn't treat Nephy as a slave. The slavery aspect serves as a plot device to kickstart the story but eventually fizzles out, without being fully resolved. As the series progresses, both Zagan and Nephy develop feelings for each other, with the main focus on their awkward attempts to express their emotions due to their social ineptness. Their interactions are undeniably cute, and their relationship grows steadily, although very slowly.


However, this is the only commendable aspect of the anime. The side characters are stereotypical and lack depth. Zagan's male mage companion is a classic tsundere, constantly nagging and complaining, while the female knight is perpetually lost, clumsy, or on the verge of tears. These characters are one-dimensional, showing little to no development even when the plot suggests they should. At least so far there has been no real love-triangle, which, in my opinion, is an overused tool in many romance anime to create unnecessary tension.


“Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?” includes several fight scenes, but they lack the budget to be memorable. Additionally, there is no real tension due to Zagan being an absolute prodigy of a mage, who never faces significant struggles. The overuse of only a single soundtrack for tense moments further reduces the enjoyment of these scenes.

In terms of character design I preferred the manga, but the overall animation is consistent at the level I expected. The anime often uses varies between a few animation styles and quite often uses a ""chibi"" style for reactions, which fits quite neatly into the main theme of this series.

In the second arc, “Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?” introduces two new permanent side characters and adds some political intrigue, a revenge plot, and a bit of mystery. While these new elements might seem refreshing at first, they are mediocre and predictable, ultimately failing to leave a lasting impression.


In summary, while “Maou no Ore ga Dorei Elf wo Yome ni Shitanda ga, Dou Medereba Ii?” offers a few wholesome moments in each episode, but the romance alone isn't enough to sustain the series. It's a decent watch if you have some time to spare and want to turn your brain off, but it’s far from a must-watch. I didn't regret watching it, but I also wouldn't highly recommend it."
202,"It’s the distant future, and the Earth has been caught in an endless winter. Humanity has pressed on, as it is known to do, by building enclosed communities where they can keep the weather at just where they need it to be in order to eek out what little living they can, brazenly defying the worsening condition of the world around them. Theirs is a world on the brink of apocalypse, and according to an old legend, it’s heralds will not be humans themselves… But wolves. But didn’t wolves go extinct 200 years ago?

Well, no, they didn’t. They acquired the ability to project the image of humans upon themselves, and to the eyes of most of us, they can walk among the general public completely undetected. Whether they act on it or not, these wolves are drawn to the presence of an entity called The Lunar Flower, a mysterious white plant that’s supposed to be just as extinct as they are. Four young wolves, all abandoned in some way or other, have been brought together by circumstance to answer that call, braving the elements and countless other dangers in their quest to find Paradise. It’s a call they’ll follow to the ends of the earth… Which, according to the legend, is exactly what’ll happen if they find it.

In early 2003, Studio Bones had yet to make a name for itself… It had some modest success with Rahxephon and the Cowboy Bebop movie, but the big hit that would establish it as one of the top production companies was still about six months from hitting the air waves. The anime world, at this point, had not yet become accustomed to Bones’ unmatched aptitude for bleeding beautiful art and animation out of even the smallest of budgets. Well, Wolf’s Rain isn’t one of those cheaper shows… It actually went pretty well over-budget, and the results speak for themselves. This is one of the most beautiful anime I’ve ever seen, on almost every conceivable level. There are a few staticky key frames here and there, mostly where they won’t be noticed by anyone who’s not deliberately looking for them, but for the vast majority of it’s run, Wolf’s Rain is fluidly animated, without a single camera angle out of place. From the mundane images of wolves running across a snowy terrain to more fantastical CG images of air ships and man-sized computer screens, not a penny was wasted in bringing this story to life.

And the artwork is even more beautiful… The landscapes are mesmerizing, even when they’re mostly dominated by hues of white and gray. Whether our lupine heroes are trudging through a blizzard or looking for answers in the many domed cities they come across, the intimate level of detail will make you feel as if you’re there with them… You may even feel the urge to wrap yourself in a blanket during the colder scenes. Character designs are inspired, thoughtful, and very easy on the eyes. Not only does each design fit it’s character’s personality and story to a T… The tough guy is dressed in leather, the laid-back guy is wearing a baggy hoodie, and the forlorn divorced couple are dressed like they stepped off the set of Casablanca, to name a few… But they’re distinctive enough that even in wolf form, you’ll never have any problem remembering who’s who.

So, the animation is beautiful, the artwork is beautiful… What about the music? I rarely talk about music, as it normally all sounds the same to me, but when the name Yoko Kanno is attached to a project, that music doesn’t fall on ANY deaf ears. Kanno’s music has built her a sturdy reputation amongst the anime medium, and rightfully so… In Wolf’s Rain, she provides a range of different music styles, from orchestral to western, and oddly enough, some rock ballads that have actual English lyrics to them.

I recently listened to the RWBY soundtrack… And I mean really listened to it… And while I’ll save my comments on it for another day, it did remind me how important it is to build a soundtrack that fits the tone of your show not only musically, but also lyrically. Otherwise, you wind up with a breakneck paced action song with the lyrics of a solemn break-up song… Which is just sloppy. Yoko Kanno understands this, and even in English, the songs she composes fit the series perfectly, adding to the emotional impact of any given scene she’s attached to.

The English dub of this show is every bit as good as the original Japanese track, with a cast of actors that flawlessly transition their characters through gradual, subtle development that may be lost on some viewers… Which, if you’re monolingual like I am, makes it the better option. Johnny Yong Bosch pulls off what may be one of his best roles ever as Kiba, the leader of the pack, adding emotional depth to a wistful character who could have easily been portrayed as bland and by-the-numbers. Crispin Freeman faced a similar problem, playing an all-out tsundere character… But Tsume is probably one of the best uses of the tsundere trope, and Crispin brings his trademarked sincerity to every single step of it. Joshua Seth takes the loveable slacker Hige through some reveals that will honestly leave you speechless once you reach them, and Steve Blum’s Darcia will earn your sympathy as well as your terror, sometimes in the same breath.

The only real problem I have with the dub is Tomoe, played by veteran Mona Marshall… Not because of her performance, which was outstanding, but because no matter how many times I hear her do it, I can’t buy her as a young boy. The rest of the cast is very natural sounding and subdued, with special emphasis on Kari Wahlgren, Jessica Straus, and an insane cameo from Beau Billingslea halfway through. Despite the caliber of the starring cast, the best performance is probably that of Tom Wyner, who plays Quent Yaiden, an old alcoholic who’s sworn vengeance on the wolves for… He believes… Burning down his village and murdering his family, long ago.

I mentioned earlier that Studio Bones has some very consistent tendencies in terms of their animation. Well, the same can be said, at least in their early years, about the stories they took on. Wolf’s Rain is the third of several consecutive Bones projects that deal with deep, complex ideas about faith and humanity, as well as the general theme of there being another world parallel to our own. It’s also easily the most mature of the group, at least as far as I’ve seen. It has a very slow pace, but it’s rarely boring, as it spend most of it’s time developing and exploring the intriguing cast of characters and the expansive, mysterious world around them.

There are very few big moments throughout the bulk of the show, but when they happen, they happen in huge, climactic ways, taking every possible advantage of the build-up and development that lead to them. It is thanks to the slow, almost meandering suspense that those big moments… Whether they be triumphant, heart-warming, or excruciatingly tragic, are able to work as effectively as they do. You’ll find yourself pumping your fist with every insurmountable obstacle they overcome, from a battle with a giant walrus to the conquering of their own inner demons, and you’ll find yourself crying on more than one occasion as the harsh world around them constantly tests the strength of their bond, and no, this series is not afraid to rip out your heart and stomp on it.

On the surface, this is a very simple, easy to follow story. Well, mostly easy, the villain stuff can get a bit complicated. The wolves and their journey to paradise can be taken purely at face value while still being an entertaining watch. However, watching with your brain turned off will NOT give you the full experience, and it’ll probably leave you unsatisfied with the ending. I’m not the first person to point this out… Far from it, at this point… But there is a wealth of depth, symbolism, and meaning hidden beneath the snowy surface of this series, and while a lot of it finds it’s roots in Buddhism, there is material for any viewer of any faith to latch onto.

I won’t go into the religious stuff… Although I will say that when you realize that wolves are often seen as divine beings in Japan, things start to fall into place… But what I can go into is the most accessible theme that the series has to offer. That theme, ultimately, is the struggle to find fulfillment. As the wolves press on through the apocalyptic world, they constantly have to decide whether to continue their journey, facing unrelenting hardships in the pursuit of something greater, or to quit, settle down in a town and just exist. This dilemma is explored dozens of times through those that they meet on their journey, with entire civilizations leading stagnant existence devoid of purpose to other wolves who’ve put aside their pride and sold themselves into grueling manual labor just to get by. Is it better to live a long life of complacency, or is it better to die in pursuit of a greater, more meaningful path? Does true happiness come through survival, or struggle? Wolf’s Rain puts forth it’s own definitive answer to this question, and makes several very strong cases for what it has to say, but it also leaves just enough ambiguity to keep the debate alive in your mind long after the series is over.

Unfortunately, the show isn’t perfect… There are two rather glaring flaws in it that even the most appreciative viewer will have to acknowledge. First of all, this is the only series I’ve ever seen that has four… Yes, four… recap episodes placed right in the middle of the series. If you have the officially released Complete collection DVD set, this recap takes up the entire fourth disk, and Wolf’s Rain catches a lot of flack for it. As it turns out, this wasn’t a conscious choice on the part of the creators… When Wolf’s Rain was going through its initial Japanese run, there was a SARS outbreak that incapacitated the majority of the people working at the studio. Short on man-power, the four recap episodes were put out to fill up the show’s time slot until they could get back on their feet again. It’s a pretty damn good excuse, all things considered, and one that’s worthy of a little understanding.

And to be perfectly honest, even before learning that fact, I’ve watched this series multiple times without ever skipping them. That’s not to say they’re not skippable… They totally are… But as far as recap episodes go, they’re remarkably well put together, and each one tells a chunk of the story through the voice of a different supporting character. They also give you a second chance to notice things going on in the series that you may not have picked up on the first time through. They’re a waste of time, but they’re pleasant, and I can’t really find it in me to condemn them.

What I can criticize, however, is my other problem with the series… The wolves’ illusions are entirely inconsistent. There’s a scene very early on where a young boy is about to fall to his death, and a wolf(in disguise) tries to catch him. Lacking real arms, he tries to catch him the way a human would, only to end up catching him in his jaws, killing him. This implies… Nay, straight up confirms… That they can’t interact with people and objects the way that people can, and can only act in ways that are physically possible for a wolf. Well, then, how do they punch and kick things? How can you explain a scene where one wolf punches another through the bars of a cage? How do they hold knives to peoples’ throats? It’s not a big problem, but it still bothers me.

Wolf’s Rain is available from Geneon entertainment, and the rights to it have not yet been rescued by company that’s still in business, which of course means the series is entirely out of print. You can find the collection online, but they’re not cheap, and you’ll be lucky if you find a playable copy for less than sixty dollars. At the same time, I don’t believe there are any legal sites streaming for it, so your options are kind of limited here… I don’t personally condemn the purchase of more affordable Malaysian DVDs, as I’m pretty sure it’s not illegal to do so, but those things are shady as hell, and it’s about a fifty-fifty shot as to whether or not they work. I don’t necessarily condone illegal streaming, either, but if you don’t have the cash to pony up, that might just be your only option. Hopefully Funimation will scoop it up and release it as a classic, but until that day, it’s the pirate’s life for ye!

Wolf’s Rain is a very mature show… And I mean that in terms of actual maturity, not ‘M-Rated’ maturity… And as such, it demands a very mature audience. You have to show it some degree of patience, and a willingness to understand the material, so it may not resonate with everybody. People who are looking for bombastic action, a clear definition of good and evil, easy answers and a happy-sappy ending that ties everything up in a nice big bow… For example, the “Brotherhood is better” crowd… Will still be able to enjoy it on some level, but it may take multiple viewings to pick up on the deeper themes and symbolism that make the otherwise confusing ending work as well as it does. It feels kind of wrong to criticize a show for being too smart, but in this particular case, it creates an issue of accessibility… And when you combine that with the few other minor flaws, I can’t really bring myaself to sign off on a perfect score. It’s a deep, profound series that’s extremely well executed, but it could have stood to go a little easier on the audience. I give wolf’s Rain a 9/10."
5231,"As I grow older and more cynical, anime like Inazuma Eleven are just the escapism I need every now and then, like an annual emotional cleanse. It's my go to summer anime--I'm rewatching this series for the fourth time now, and I stand firm in my evaluation that Inazuma Eleven is peak power of friendship and hopes and dreams. Friendship power is something that become somewhat of a staple in anime, especially shounen, and even though series like Blue Lock have started to combat this trope by pushing its egoism agenda, sometimes there is just something so hopeful and uplifting about watching young boys overcome adversity to pursue and eventually reach their dreams. Inazuma Eleven is no where near as grounded or grim as Blue Lock, but it is a show brimming with love and affection for soccer.

Inazuma Eleven’s story is pretty in line for sports anime. Because it’s a kids show, the plot isn’t particularly complex; each arc is basically just a reskinned tournament arc. However, it gets the job done, allowing the opportunity for lots of unique matches and setting the stage for character growth. Like all sports anime, the games are the catalyst for character development. Players face each other and themselves on the field, and a majority of the series' conflicts are resolved during matches, whether it be a plot or character-centric conflict. Because of this, every match runs high with emotions and it's easy to get invested in them. Additionally, the show does a good job balancing matches with training and other miscellaneous fun things. What could be considered filler episodes are also extremely enjoyable as they show the characters in an environment outside the field. Personally, the day off episode in the FFI arc is one of my favorites!

And of course, as a sports anime, Inazuma Eleven also has its fair share of adrenaline-filled moments. The show is known for its iconic hissatsu techniques like Fire Tornado and God Hand, and the creative direction some of these hissatsu take is honestly really incredible. Some of the hissatsu techniques just blew my mind, like Tenkuu Otoshi, Mugen the Hand, or like any hissatsu from The Kingdom. In fact, the moments where characters are able to master a new technique mid-match are some of the most hype in the entire show. Additionally, the animation is also pleasant on the eyes, with lots of bright colors and satisfying choreography. Furthermore, the character designs are extremely diverse (albeit some being quite outdated especially the sausage mouths on black/darker skinned characters). There are many different body types, skin colors, ethnicities, and cultures throughout the show, meaning character designs never get boring or stale and hissatsu techniques are always fresh. Overall just a really fun show to look at in terms of animation and creative direction.

The character writing is undoubtedly Inazuma Eleven's strongest suit. Despite having an extremely large and diverse cast of characters, the show does an incredible job of juggling all the different character arcs, backstories, and conflicts they each face, either individually or as a team. Our main character Endou embodies a pure heart that you can only find in shounen anime, and you can't help but want to root for him as he overcomes challenges with the rest of his team. The concept of having the MC as a goalie is unique, as Endou is responsible for watching his teammates' backs instead of scoring goals like a flashy forward, but he doesn't let this position limit his plays or his presence on the field. He is the keystone of the team's morale, and embodies the idea that true strength comes from one's own hard work and effort. It's honestly really satisfying to watch his growth as a captain.

The other main characters, including but not limited to Fubuki and Kidou, have extremely iconic and well written character stories. Fubuki's journey to overcome his horrific childhood trauma and Kidou's toxic codependent relationship with Kageyama are fan favorites for a reason; they are tackled in a digestible way for the show's intended audience, but don't lack the nuance one would expect from a kids show.

And it's not just the main characters that get the spotlight. Even side characters have intriuging stories, development, and their own motivations for doing things. Of course, not all characters are written equally, but Inazuma Eleven does an admirable job giving attention to so many of its characters. Personally, I found Roneijo and Fidio's stories from the FFI arc extremely captivating, and the story behind Fudou's behavior to be really endearing. Characters you thought you'd hate for sure, like Saginuma, Aphrodi, and even Kageyama, are often much more nuanced than they first seem, and of course sunshine Endou's infectious enthusiasm for soccer is often pivotal to their development. It's a simple and predictable formula, yet it never feels tedious to get through, and since the characters are vastly different from each other it never really feels repetitive either. Endou's ability to forgive and see the best in people is one of his best qualities, and the show highlights this by giving many of the antagonists redemption arcs.

Of course, with good character writing also comes good character chemistry, and Inazuma Eleven does not disappoint. The relationships that are developed and explored throughout the series are all extremely diverse and interesting. From Endou and Gouenji's ever-so-slightly-more-than-bros relationship, to Tobikata and Toramaru's unexpected brotherly connection, to Kidou and Fudou's enemies to rivals dynamic, there are many different kinds of relationships explored across the 127 episodes. Rivalries and healthy competition is a big thing, and the showrunners take good care to emphasize the importance of good sportsmanship. In my opinion, the show is worth watching for the character interactions alone; they're just that good.

Inazuma Eleven also touches on themes like body-enhancing drugs, trauma, exploitation, and debilitating injuries in a way that isn't too much to process for younger audiences, but will still have enough nuance that it leaves more mature audiences satisfied. The overarching plot conflicts usually involve some sort of body-enhancing drug or exploitation which is a little repetitive, but they're different enough in nature and content that it's not too bad.

The OST is also fantastic, with each one of the OPs and EDs being absolutely iconic and certified karaoke classics. A lot of the ED illustrations (especially towards the end of the series) are really cute, and there is even one ED where the VAs of Endou, Kidou, Gouenji, Fubuki, and Kazemaru sing. The BGM also does the job in setting the mood, and there are some memorable melodies in there.

Inazuma Eleven is by no means an earth-shattering piece of media, but it does what it sets out to do incredibly well. It has some of the best character writing I've seen in kids' media, and I guarantee you won't find an ensemble cast that makes you feel so much love anywhere else. It's pure-hearted and complete unadulterated joy. Endou's love will cleanse your soul. Maybe it's my nostalgia speaking, but his victories feel like your victories and his struggles feel like your own struggles. By the time I finish this series, I'm always left wishing I had just a couple more moments with these cherished characters."
20751,"Continuing on from Season One, the Second Season of Mushishi Zoku Shou gives us a further selection of weird and wonderful stories centering on the interactions between many different kinds of people, mushi and elements of the natural world which they make up.

But just what exactly are ‘mushi’? Well to give you an idea, they are described as beings which are mostly invisible to the human eye, taking up a strange but captivating variety of forms, shapes and sizes. Their aim is simply to live. In doing so they can be seen as a symbol of life at its most basic element, a reminder that humans are not the only beings who are trying to survive in this world.

Each episode within this series looks at the fascinating world of mushi through human eyes, documenting many people’s encounters and experiences with these creatures. More often than not, each of these stories is observed by our central protagonist Ginko, who plays less of a role to directly advance the plot but rather acts as an observer, a representation of the audience satisfying our curiosity to learn more about this weird spiritual-like world where things are never fully understood.

img60%()

Despite acting primarily as a cohesive plot element, forming one of the few bits of structure present across the show by tying together all these tales with the encounters he has, Ginko is also an intriguing character in his own right. Cool, calm and collected, he has a natural ability to form intimate connections with the various strangers he meets across his endless travels in an attempt to study and understand the different kinds of mushi which live in their world. The “mushi-shi” Ginko has his own story too which gradually gets revealed as the series progresses, though there is no order to this development since it occurs in one-off episodes like that of the rest.

The episodic nature of Mushishi is definitely a change of pace from what we are regularly used to in our watching experience, something which cannot just be consumed instantly but rather requires a bit of reflection on the subliminal moral and philosophical themes that are present. Although I found that this individualistic style of storytelling meant that certain episodes had a greater significance and emotional impact than others, the quality of the series as a whole was still maintained throughout. The ability to take a step back and appreciate each new episode as a unique experience in itself really stood out, with any fears over a lack of conclusion resolved after watching “Suzu no Shizuku”, which adapts the final manga arc following this part.

img64%()

The Soundtrack is one of the more underrated aspects of this show, which it shouldn’t be because the music absolutely makes the overall atmosphere and impact of each story. Honestly what else can I say but brilliant – Masuda is nothing short of a magician, employing the use of gentle chimes and other simple, yet effective sounds to provide the gorgeous backdrop to this series and truly make it special. The tracks are just as good as the original, showcasing that talent is definitely permanent. Without any particularly standing out, I found that instead the best use of the music is to pull you into the show, putting you in a state of relaxation almost akin to meditation, where all worries drain away once the episode starts and Lucy Rose’s beautiful voice plays one of my all-time favourite Openings.

What, to me, is especially great though would have to be the endings. You know that experience you get after finishing a truly great anime? The awe-struck staring at your screen as you watch the credits roll? Well this series has that, but for the ending of every single episode, more than in part due to the efforts of Masuda and his masterful symphonies. Please never skip the endings before going onto another episode, because they’re simply too good to miss out on!

If you are intrigued by the prospect of a laid-back, calming, quietly beautiful yet ultimately melancholic show that presents a lot of ideas about what it means to be alive – leaving it up to the viewer to decide what’s truly important – then I cannot recommend this series enough.

It’s truly unlike anything else I have ever seen, which made forming an overall opinion and rating really hard until I realised a simple fact: I didn’t actually want this to end! This is a series that could have easily become monotonous and disengaging, each episode generally being completely different from the next, but in fact this has turned out to be something incredibly special because it reminds us of one thing: that if we have a life, then we should just try our best to live it. No matter what happens in the end, whether we achieve happiness or not, all that matters is that we had the ability to be alive in the first place – the potential to enjoy different places, people and things as Ginko finds on his travels. 

There’s one thing which you can be sure of after finishing Mushishi: it’s something which you will never quite be able to forget."
4280,"This review is all subjective and my own personal opinion. You do not have to agree with it, nor am I asking you to. I hope that this just helps you get an idea of what the anime I am talking about is like and form a basic and general consensus on it. The ratings I give anime and manga are mostly my personal overall enjoyment. I have not read the novel, and it has been around a month or two since I have watched the anime. This review will be spoiler free, however details of previous movies will be discussed to some extent. A big thank you to [Nikz](https://anilist.co/user/Nikz/) for proofreading this review and giving me feedback. TL;DR will be at the bottom.

Kara no Kyoukai: Garan no Dou is the fourth movie in the Kara no Kyoukai series, but the second chronologically. This movie takes place shortly after the second movie, where Shiki is left in a coma in a hospital. Of course, Kokutou makes frequent visits to Shiki, leaving rose bouquets. Shiki stays in a coma for two years, and in the meantime, Kokutou meets a prominent character of the series, Touko Aozaki.

The nature of the Kara no Kyoukai plots can leave the viewer quite baffled. Even after watching all of the Kara no Kyoukai movies, there are certain aspects I still find myself not fully understanding. Despite that, one can still enjoy Kara no Kyoukai even if the inner intricacies of the plot fly over your head. But when you do obtain a grasp on the deep meaning this series holds, it can feel quite satisfying. This movie is one of the less complex movies in the series. Luckily Aozaki once again serves as the movie's exposition, explaining the supernatural elements of the world. In this film, it further builds upon on Shiki's character and backstory. Here we learn more about her past and how she obtained her Mystic Eyes. Because of this, the film makes Shiki even more of an interesting character, a character we want to follow along with on her journey. Combined with movie two, Shiki's character is much more fleshed out and she becomes further likable. Most of the plot in this movie revolves around Shiki waking up from her coma, and coming to terms with what has happened to her. Essentially, this movie aims to, like I have stated before, build upon Shiki's character and explain to the audience why she is the way she is as seen in the first and third movie. Straightforward, and yet I was so engrossed in the film. That could be because I was so captivated in knowing more about the mysterious Shiki, who we barely knew. We do not know that much about her from movie one and three, and to see her backstory further explained here may just be what made the plot so fascinating. Simple, and yet effective. Furthermore, this film (and perhaps the series as a whole) excels in crafting an atmosphere that fits the plot particularly well, drawing the viewer in even more. 

The cast of characters is quite small, with only three characters. !The four other characters listed in the AniList page only appear after the credits so they do not really count.! Given that there is such a miniature cast, one would expect them to be quite fleshed out. Shiki takes centre stage in this film, and the entirety of the movie mostly revolves around her. Kokutou serves as the 'loyal partner' per se and Aozaki who serves as the series exposition and Shiki's guide. They play they parts well, but they are easily overshadowed by Shiki, at least in this film. Despite that, they all served to be interesting characters to me, and I enjoyed watching all of them in the film. They were all likable and served to be important pillars of the film, holding it to be even stronger. Shiki is most certainly an unique character, which is part of what makes her such a fascinating character to watch. She is starkly different to regular female protagonists, even the way she speaks is very unconventional for female characters. Cold, harsh, and what could easily be described as an anti-hero, Shiki remains to be an icon for Kara no Kyoukai, drawing the viewer in with her charm. She is well written, and her dialogue makes her character even better. Kokutou is great character (although I am pretty biased here, he is my favourite character after all) but he takes a less prominent role in this film. He is just simply a kind character, very easy to love. Sometimes it is good to get back to basics, and Kokutou is a good example of this. As for Aozaki, she is a recurring character in the series, but I never got tired of seeing her. She is a pretty interesting character and stands out in her own right. She is quite vital for the series as a whole, as she time and time again serves as the explanation to the viewer as to what is actually going on. Even outside of her exposition role, she holds her own as a character. One minute she could be serious and ruminative and the next minute she could be friendly and amicable. The voice actors for the film also do well to bring life not only to the characters, but to the world. They all do well to fit the characters they were cast as and made the viewing experience that much more enjoyable. They seem genuine and the emotions in their voice acting is present.

For a film made in 2008, I am taken aback in how stellar the animation is. Even anime I have seen that come out in the past year or two seem to fall behind in this film in terms of animation. That is how fantastic I found the animation in this film. ufotable excelled in animating not only the action, but everything else in the film. The art is also wonderful, I personally am a fan of the art present in Kara no Kyoukai. The characters look great, and the world looks amazing too.

Kara no Kyoukai has some fantastic music in the series and this movie is no exception. Yuki Kaijura and Kalafina craft music that fits very well into the world of Kara no Kyoukai, making the world and film more alive and the viewing experience even more engrossing. The music during the action draws you in, and the suspenseful music builds the mood. The theme song of this film, ARIA by Kalafina is fantasic, even outside of the film.

This film is phenomenal for those who are watching Kara no Kyoukai. The character development and backstory of Shiki is a great watch, and I will probably find myself re-watching this film, and the entire series one day. All in all, a wonderful film for those watching Kara no Kyoukai and fans of the series. If you came to this review without having watched any other Kara no Kyoukai film, I would still recommend this series, but you should start [here](https://anilist.co/anime/2593/-/) (or movie two, since that is the first chronologically, but I would recommend watching it in the achronological order). The series is good for those looking for something with great animation, along with a dark and thrilling plot. If you liked the Fate series, chances are you will like this series too. It is written by the same author, Kinoko Nasu and takes place in an alternative timeline in the same universe. Of course, Kara no Kyoukai is not for everyone, and can be pretty hard to get into. But still, I would still recommend giving it a try. A summary of this review:
- The plot can be confusing at times, but that does not mean you cannot enjoy the film.
- This film mostly serves as development for Shiki and her backstory, which makes it fascinating to watch.
- A small cast of characters, with the focus being on one character. Luckily, it is a good one.
- Stellar animation and art from 2008.
- Wonderful music that makes the film even more engrossing.

Thank you to those who took the time to read this review. I hope you were able to get something out of this review. If you did not like this review, then I apologise for wasting your time."
153818,"A Fair, Yet Stellar Adaptation of a Hidden Dark Fantasy Gem

The Witch and the Beast is an enchanting masterpiece of dark fantasy that transcends conventional storytelling boundaries. Its allure lies not only in its captivating plotlines and stunning visuals but also in its profound exploration of symbolism and metaphor. Kousuke Satake's masterful craftsmanship is evident throughout the series, as he skillfully weaves intricate layers of meaning into every chapter. The characters, such as Guideau and Ashaf, are not merely vessels for the plot but embodiments of deeper themes and concepts. Each page is imbued with rich symbolism and deep metaphors, inviting readers to delve into the complexities of the narrative and uncover hidden truths. As I found myself immersed in the world of The Witch and the Beast, I discovered that my appreciation for the series extended far beyond its genre conventions. It became not just a dark fantasy tale but a profound meditation on the human condition and the nature of existence itself. For those seeking a truly transformative reading experience, The Witch and the Beast is more than just a manga—it is a journey into the depths of the soul. The manga is one of my personal favorite dark fantasy manga.

With that said, the anime adaptation has come and gone, and I have some things to say about it after having seen every episode. This adaptation was easily one of my most anticipated anime of 2024, and I didn’t hear any red flags surrounding the anime or the studio adapting the manga. The anime itself has an addictive OP and a stoic EP, and they both capture the symbolism and themes of the manga perfectly. After watching every episode, I did have some questions about the choices the studio made and why they would make these kinds of choices. Some choices were good and other choices were okay, but it didn’t have any negative effect on me since I’m mostly judging this anime based on how well it adapts the material that it’s based on. The studio was very faithful to the story, the lore, and the worldbuilding; they weren’t disrespectful to the author’s vision and I respect that. In terms of adaptation’s sake, this studio did a great job at bringing this story to life.

Now in terms of characters and voice acting, I was quite surprised with how much I enjoyed the VA. Guideau is so much fun to see, and the voice actress playing her is excellent. The writing of her character in both the anime and manga is splendid. I would, however, point out that her true form looks much better in the manga than it does in the anime. The manga’s version of Guideau’s true form looks more detailed and more ferocious. The anime’s version does feel a bit desaturated, yet the close-ups of her true form are pretty good. Then, there’s Phanora’s voice actress who does an excellent job of keeping the cold and chilling atmosphere of her character. Helga’s sub and dub actress is good at capturing the character’s strong personality while wanting a relationship. The female characters of Witch and the Beast are lovable, and I was impressed with the voice acting surrounding them.

Some of the flaws I’ve noticed were that a few moments were missing in the anime that were in the manga, which I felt like they could’ve kept in and still made the narrative impactful. Some moments feel a little rushed, and other moments are a little strange with how they execute some of the manga’s more surreal moments. Even in moments with Guideau and Ashaf, only a few instances felt a bit desaturated compared to how those moments were executed in the manga. With that said the flaws in this adaptation are made up for with how well everything else around it is brought together. The symbolism, metaphors, rhetorics, theories, and poetic writing are still done with the utmost respect. The themes of the manga are captivating, and the way they are portrayed in the anime is pretty good, though not perfect. But Guideau’s themes of revenge are executed brilliantly in the adaptation, especially when they are shown in the last two episodes through their flashbacks.

Overall, I quite enjoyed this adaptation. There were a few moments that I believe could’ve been done a little better, but I was satisfied with what we got. Aesthetically, I think they nailed the way everyone appears (though some appear better in the manga than in the anime) and from a narrative perspective, I appreciated the way they handled the lore and worldbuilding that the author came up with. Guideau’s VA does an amazing job, while the English VA also handles the character quite well. The Witch and the Beast is one of my new favorite dark fantasy manga, and the anime does a great job at remaining faithful to Kousuke Satake’s story.

 Rating: 8.5/10"
18139,"[PREMISE OF THE SHOW:]()
The manga focuses on 2 characters, Seki and Yokoi.

Seki doesn't like paying attention in class and thus goes ahead and creates many crazy things as to distract him from his school responsibilites. Yokoi sits beside Seki, she constantly sees all of these inventions, she wants to ignore what he is doing but always ends up paying attention and even participates in them causing her to be in trouble from the teacher and not Seki-kun.

All of the things Seki makes are top quality to be honest,  from making little golf matches to making a dramatic sequence with shogi pieces and lastly to making his own postal service. This lad would excel in Factorio and Oxygen not Included.

Every episodes feels fresh and unique, well due to the fact that each one has new thing to showcase. But nonetheless I didn't get bored of the what basically is the same formula.




[CHARACTERS:]()
Seki - The engineer, he carefully crafts his works. He does the impossible, he goes as far as to make his own postal service in the class which has proper schedules for deliveries and such. This lad right here is going places.

Yokoi - She wants to ignore Seki, but Seki is just too powerful to be ignored by a mere mortal. Her paying attention to Seki's invetion often leads her to getting in trouble by the teacher. 




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The animation is great smooth and fluid most of the time, mostly when an invention is being presented.
The art style is...well I would have to call it so-so, its not bad! But just nothing too new that brings attention, sadly. But despite that fact the show is still great to watch.




[MUSIC:]()
The OP is great, KanaHana rapping is always a brilliant thing to hear.
The ED is a straight up banger, so catchy. There even is a video of [behind the scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lX2tgR7Sg) on how they got the sounds of the school equipment which is neat.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Tonari no Seki-kun has to be one of my favourite short series, the comedy is amazing, the little crafts Seki makes are really detailed and well thought out. Great lil series."
151847,"Did you click on this just to know if you should watch the show or not? If so, your answer’s just a few scrolls away at the end of this review in a TLDR. Otherwise, go ahead and be enlightened with the result of my wasting valuable time whining on the internet about some animated frames. Spoilers ahead, although that doesn’t exactly matter since (IMO) nothing of worth happens anyway. 

When I first heard about this story being adapted into an anime, I couldn’t help but think to myself, ‘wow, out of all of the fifteen million fantasy isekai webtoons, this one’s getting an adaptation?’ I was very curious to see how this would end up, so I decided to watch it. Truthfully, I was captivated by the romance that this series allegedly promised, and me having a massive guilty pleasure in regency-style smut with an interesting premise, I immediately took to giving this a go. However, instead of getting those sweet little butterflies, I ended up finishing it with a sour taste in my mouth that couldn’t possibly be alleviated unless I would complain about it in depth on Anilist.co (real). 

In general, I’m not one to complain about animation. I understand how difficult and time-consuming it is to draw, let alone color, shade, and, in the end, animate it all frame by frame. But in this show it feels like they aren’t trying at all. All of what you would consider ‘cool’ movements (ex. falling, sword swinging, etc) are covered up and substituted with a sound effect, which is, in my opinion, such a lazy way to avoid animating. I didn’t have a problem with it the first few times, but good God, is that the only thing you could come up with? It doesn’t even feel like I’m watching a show anymore. It’s more so a visual novel or just a moving storyboard. In scenes where there is a crowd around, their faces are always greyed out, and this makes the background seem even more empty than if there wasn’t anyone around in the first place. Even the walking sequences, which were probably the only effort to ‘animate’ anything, feels unnatural. CGI is used pretty badly- on the horses and carriages, as well as that one ballroom scene with MC & FMC. I could not enjoy their conversation with the contrast between the different movements (main characters dancing frame by frame & CGI background people dancing), and it feels so out of place and disconnected. Yes, their budget definitely isn’t equivalent to half of that of ufotable’s, but still, could you not try to use what you have in an engaging way? There’s nothing interesting happening, visually. Also, the facial expressions of the characters are so deadpan, and every time they talk, they show legitimately zero emotion at all, especially the main guy, Noah. I could go on and on about how blank and lifeless he always looks, even when he is apparently showing affection for  Raeliana. 

And here we go onto my next point. Noah. He’s hot, and that’s his only personality trait. In the first episode, he is described as this devilish, horrible man with a black heart. This description was never portrayed at all, and I’m not taking ‘well, that’s because he just really likes Raeliana’ as an excuse. We never got to see anything other than one of the most uninspiring characters ever saying corny and lowkey creepy things to FMC. He has no dimension. We did see parts of his past that attempted to add character, such as how his mother tried to kill his older brother so Noah could be king, and how his father was deceived by love, but this development was not expanded at all, and, certainly, Noah was not concerned about being ‘deceived’ into loving Raeliana. And to top it off, there was no mention of ‘why’ he even likes her. He just seems so emotionless that I doubt that he could even feel such a sentiment. Okay, you know what, they actually might be right about him being an awful person. There was one part where Raeliana accused him of exploiting her, waking up in the morning one day on his bed, her lower body aching. He didn’t actually do this, but he took her charge so nonchalantly that I was shocked. He did apologize to her, but in the most manipulative way possible, pinning her to a bookcase and sucking on her fingers (what the fuck?) until she said she’d forgive him. If it weren’t for the fact that she was obviously developing feelings for him (who would though, in the first place??), this event is just so creepy if you think about it, and it still is even if she does like him. He is also overly protective and possessive, treating anyone of the opposite gender who might even have the slightest smidgen of interest in her like a maggot on spoiled meat. He appears so randomly in the story, always ending up as the ‘knight in shining armor’ whenever his beloved maiden is in trouble. His voice, while initially pleasant, ends up becoming so irritating with the cringe that he spits out that I do not understand how Raeliana can have a conversation with him without punching him in the cranium every fifteen seconds. The amount of physical touch that he imposes on her is astonishing; there are probably more frames of their hands touching than there are millimeters from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy.  It’s obvious that his VA is trying extremely hard to sound alluring and irresistible, and it just feels so forced at times that I can’t help but laugh at this ridiculous goober. He is much more likable in the manhwa, so if blushing for him is what you want, go ahead and read it instead of watching this. 

The other characters aren’t much better, either. Almost none of them are memorable in the slightest. The main girl is your average clueless shoujo protagonist who tries to use lengthy inner monologues to create the illusion that she’s smarter than she actually is. Considering how this is an isekai, we should probably have a bit of background information on who exactly she was before she became Raeliana McMilan, right? Nope, we didn’t get anything at all. There is zero explanation on her original identity, Rinko Hanasaki, other than the fact that she’s a graduate desperate to get into a good college. So what’s the point in having those moments where there’s a little flash of Rinko’s image beside Raeliana? It just seems so unnecessary for this to even be an isekai, since we know literally nothing about Rinko- what she liked, what she did, her personality, etc. I do give credit that they at least tried to make her somewhat reliant on herself and not a complete idiot. However, key word, somewhat. There are moments where she’s pretty badass, such as that one scene with her taking Noah’s gun and threatening to shoot Francis Brooks, but she always ends up getting saved by Noah anyways. She always tries to ‘get herself together’ around him and seem witty in every single conversation they have. It was entertaining at first but this style of interaction ended up being so overused that it feels like different ChatGPT generations of the same prompts. Here’s how their discussions would go:
- Noah says something cheesy
- Raeliana says something insulting/clever
- Noah seems completely unfazed and says more cheesy things
- Raeliana starts blushing

Same formula, over and over, again.

The antagonists are exactly what they’re supposed to be. Anti-gonist. Against the protagonist. So, they have to be immature pieces of shit, right? Yup, we’ve got the jealous villain woman, Vivian Shamal, who has no character trait other than wanting Noah all to herself (goodness gracious, what the hell do these women see in him?). I honestly hate these kinds of characters, not because they suck, but because they’re not interesting at all. There aren’t any underlying motives behind anything they do, nothing that might make me relate to them. They have no purpose other than to be hated. Beatrice might seem to stir up something cool, but that’s because we also know nothing about her. We see slight snippets that she may be the one wanting to kill Raeliana, but Raeliana thinks about her, at minimum, about five seconds in each episode, before her train of thought is interrupted with the appearance of the incorrigible numbskull that is Noah Wynknight. The only character that I do actually like is Heika, the high priest. He’s funny and has a personality. I do understand why he’s always alone, because everyone else in the story is nothing but infuriating, shallow excuses of ‘people’. 

In moments of high tension it falls flat. Like when the cursed crystal that Raeliana wore in her hair was about to explode, the screen immediately cuts to the shocked but static reactions of the people watching, just like in a children’s gag comedy. It was such a laughable attempt at suspense, and the crude animation made it even more awful. Well, Heika did literally pull a fucking Jotaro’s Star Platinum time stop when that happened, though, so that was kind of one of the only awesome moments. 

The plot itself is a mess. The scenes are dragging, and the progression makes no sense at all. The politics makes no sense. The ‘mysteries’ throughout the show are so blatantly obvious, since, guess what, they were all revealed to us in the first place! While Raeliana spent three episodes wondering who exactly wanted to kill her, we were blessed in advance with this knowledge from a great scene where it was shown to be none other than Vivian Shamal. Seriously, could you at least make these characters just a bit less shallow? They legitimately have as much depth as those inflatable kiddie-pools they sell at Wal-Mart. I’m not sure if this is the right word for it, but the dramatic irony in this story makes it fifteen times worse than it already was. Destroys the very last smidge for any excitement that I could have about it, ignoring all the romance. What was supposed to be the main focus (What’s happening with Beatrice, the isekai world’s protagonist) gets flashes of relevance here and there, as mentioned before, and is only truly the subject in the final episode, but throughout the series it just seems like a side quest, romance being the highlight. Really unfortunate, because I was pretty invested in that, as well, in the beginning. 

Then again, this is probably all on me. I shouldn’t have expected anything more from an isekai shoujo, but whatever, I’ve already written this thing at full length. If you liked this anime, I am personally very jealous of you, since I definitely did not experience here the desperately-sought giddiness, familiar to all, in enjoying a nice, heart-thumping romance. 

TLDR: Overall, I do not recommend watching this. The story flows more smoothly in the manhwa, and it’s better than watching dull, pretty much moving slideshows for 12 episodes (although, besides the eyefull of attractive people, the manhwa itself isn’t amazing after giving it a go). The MC is an irritating and entitled troglodyte and does not come across as ‘charming’ at all other than his appearance. The dialogue and interactions between the characters have almost no meaning at all, and the story just seems to go nowhere with its main narrative. I do have hopes that the next few seasons might be more enjoyable, but, from what I experienced, I’m not very optimistic."
134252,"Despite what the narrator says this is NOT a story a romantic comedy about a guy and a girl who used to be a guy, but a story about two life long friends going on an adventure. A buddy comedy would be more accurate to call it than a romantic comedy. A road trip in another world with a lot of baggage. 
This is a satirical isekai fantasy and does not try to pretend or delude the audience by pretending to be anything but that. Between mocking romantic tropes one would find in a traditional rom-com to obvious cracks at more popular isekai stories, the show is full of jokes designed to make the most harden isekai fan laugh. And it does a good job. The characters are where the show shines with its straight-laced lead of Jinguuji and its wacky gender-bent ""heroine"" Tachibana, the two are a classic comedy duo trying desperately to avoid catching feelings for one another until they get their real feelings sorted out. While the show lacks a deep or meaningful plot, it makes up for that by showing the audience a pretty deep look into the complicated relationship between childhood friends. Like I said this is a buddy comedy. If you've been friends for someone for long enough there will be hidden resentments and envy on both sides. This show does a good job consistently hinting and flashing those resentments throughout the season until finally the curtain is pulled back and the two leads are forced to face each other and come to terms with the fact that, like a romantic relationship, even a platonic friendship is complicated. Jealousy, envy, how one is raised, how one grows up, and of course gender dysphoria form a labyrinth for the characters to navigate which at times can be more daunting than any demon lord.  
There isn't much of a plot beyond traveling to the demon lord and the shenanigans that ensue due to Tachibana's beauty so I'm not going to say much beyond that is the shows weakest point. If you want a deep fantasy tale with original ideas and concepts, look elsewhere. If you want to laugh at two 30-something year olds acting like teenagers in another world then this is the show for you. 
Lastly I want to give a few shout-outs to Schwartz and Lucius who came through in the end. At first you look at them both and think they're just one-off jokes. HAHA look at the Kirito character,  laugh at his foolishness. Yes he is foolish but he is far for a one-off joke character. He actually grows and matures more than even many main isekai protagonists you see in other shows. He had a more than significant place in the story and that is in no small part thanks to Lucius who serves as a much needed buffer, teacher, and support for Schwartz which allows him to grow from a painfully obvious joke character to a real character. 
I want to give a nod to the door to Tachibana's apartment. You see something that silly and think okay that's cute but whatever. But it actually was used as a real tool than just a cheat skill which deserves praise.
This is a satirical isekai comedy but the characters make it so much more. Tachibana gives the audience a look at the complexity of gender identity which is never an easy subject to examine. Jinguuji is a refreshingly intelligent and sturdy no nonsense character that is nice to see in this genre. Schwartz is an example of how even the most obvious of gags can be so much more if effort is put into development them. The elf queen was fun to watch as well. So this is a story that  while disgusted as a rom-com about two dudes trying to avoid falling in love with each other and more about two dudes who are trying to work together to achieve a common goal while preserving and unraveling 20 years of complicated friendship. That to me is worth watching."
128223,"Ah, those fleeting youthful days where romance was always on our minds, and falling in love was one of the best feelings one can imagine. This show really does warm my heart, and gave me some of those memories, though I will be honest, I didn’t really enjoy this show at the start, but little by little, I started liking it more.

The show is quite simple really, a middle school kendo champion, Ayumu Tanaka, begins his first year of high school, but didn’t join the kendo club, instead, he fell in love with Urushi Yaotome, the president and only member of the unofficial shogi club. Ayumu is a rather expressionless person, which kind of reminded me of Raido from “Aharen-san wa Hakarenai”, but bolder, and Urushi is your typical cute girl that blushes a lot when teased. In a way, it’s kind of the reversal of “Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san”, where Takagi would constantly tease Nishikata and make him blush. This resemblance is no fluke though, because they were written by the same author.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 15.2/25

The story is quite simple and relaxing, inoffensive and fun. It’s a whole bunch of teasing, a whole bunch of shogi playing, and a bit of slow progress in Ayumu and Urushi’s relationship. The teasing is rather uncreative and repetitive though compared to something like Takagi-san, as it’s mostly just Ayumu giving Urushi compliments, and making fun of her small size. I do wish there were more unique scenarios for the teasing and romantic moments, but I enjoyed what we got. The side characters were interesting at times with their relationships, but they weren’t extremely involved all the time. I also wish we would get a small, basic lesson about shogi in this show as well, as that could make viewers a bit more engaged.

ART: 7.4/10

There isn’t a whole lot of movement in the show, but for the most part, the designs were alright and the colours were good. Nothing too special here.

MUSIC: 8.2/10

The music compliments the show well, and gives off a nice slice of life vibe. The opening and ending were also pretty solid, and quite catchy.

CHARACTERS: 13.5/20

The main leads are good characters, especially Ayumu, because he’s completely willing to compliment Urushi all the time, and I wouldn’t imagine he’d be too afraid to confess his feelings. Urushi isn’t all too special, but she’s very adorable, and fun to watch. The side characters are also fun to watch, especially Takeru and Sakurako, who have an interesting dynamic. Another character I’d like to highlight would be Rin, who was also part of the middle school kendo team, and her interactions with Ayumu and Takeru are a joy to watch, and there’s some substance there. There are some backstories that were a tad bit emotional too, which is always a welcome thing.

ENJOYMENT: 11.5/15

Cute and wholesome, pretty satisfying.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 14/20

The one thing I’d say this show lacks is creativity in comedy. Sure, it’s good, but it’s quite repetitive. There aren’t a whole lot of unique scenarios and settings. The thing this show does well is romance, because there seems to be genuine progress in the relationship, and it also feels very relatable to the vibe of high school romance, and I’m glad to see it.

OVERALL: 69.8/100

For a romance anime, it delivers decently. In terms of works from this author, I’d still have to go with Takagi-san over this show, but nonetheless, this show is good in its own way, and features a good high school relationship, but it just doesn’t have that extra kick or uniqueness to it. That said, if there’s ever a sequel, I’d be happy to watch it. After all, who would say no to cute romcoms?"

“I regret things every single day. So just be sure to thank them next time, and let’s work hard to make sure “next time” happens”
– Atsushi, My Roommate is a Cat, episode 9

Character development is something I value a lot when looking at a show or movie. Whether a character becomes better or flawed, it is always interesting to see how the story changes how a character sees the world. But from the shows I’ve watched, this doesn’t seem to get a lot of attention. A character might change a little, become a better person or something like that, but very few shows make that change interesting and satisfying. And this is where ‘My Roommate is a Cat’ delivers.

My Roommate is a Cat, directed by Kaoru Suzuki, the producer behind ‘Flying Witch’ and ‘Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon’, is an adaptation of a manga by the same name by As Futatsuya and Tunami Minatuki. The show follows Subaru Mikazuki, a book writer who’s mourning the death of his parents. One day Subaru finds a stray cat who follows him from his parents grave. And eventually, Subaru decides to keep her. 
The episodes usually are structured in two parts. The first half is usually of Subaru trying to write on his book, but how the cat, who he later names Haru, gets in the way. 
The second half then centers around the cats and her thoughts, where we get some context of what the cat was doing in the first half.

And when I first started watching this show, I was not enjoying it at all. Subaru felt like a very bland protagonist, one I had seen so much before. The cat half of the episodes were still pretty enjoyable, but it was not worth it. So at the third episode, I was almost about to drop the show. But I got a feeling that I had to at least watch the whole episode before deciding whether I wanted to watch the show or not. And thank god I did. 
The episode spends most of its first-half showing Haru jumping around the house. We don’t see what Haru is jumping at, but it is revealed that she is seeing some sort of spiritual energy that is later revealed to be the ghost of Subaru’s parents. Subaru is still haunted by his parents. But as he follows Haru around the house, she knocks down a few books which remind him of his parents. He gets a meltdown and starts to cry on the floor, thinking about whether it was his fault or not that they died. This was the thing that changed my mind about the show. I wasn’t crying or anything, but the thought-process was extremely realistic. I have probably seen that concept a couple of times, but the way that they wrote the scene was amazing. 
Subaru then realizes that he has ignored everyone around him and their feelings, and has just thought of what he feels. This is a turning point in the character, where we see how Subaru starts to want to change who he is. 
We see how Subaru starts to do things that he wouldn’t normally do, cause he wants to change to become a better person. He meets new friends, does meet-ups for his books and other social activities. It is extremely satisfying to see how Subaru is actively trying to change as a person throughout the show. He feels like an actual person because of it. And that’s why character development is so important. Cause it makes for realistic, interesting and immersive characters. It is one of the best character arcs I have seen in a while. 
At the end of the scene, we see how the ghost of Subaru’s parents disappears. Subaru is no longer haunted by his past.

The best episode in the show is easily episode 9, where I took the quote at the top. This is where the structure of the show changes. In the episode, we start from Haru’s perspective, where we see how Subaru leaves his home looking rather distressed. Haru experiences so many different emotions at once from this. Anger, sadness, anxiety. We still don’t know where Subaru is, and we seriously worry about what Subaru is doing and why he hasn’t come home. We sympathize with Haru, cause we have the same relationship with him as Haru has. 
And after half of the episode, we finally see where Subaru is. At a meet-up with for his book. This is something we know Subaru doesn’t like since he has shown his displeasure of it in the episodes before it. He starts out the meet-up thinking that everyone would be disappointed by him. But he slowly realizes how much happiness he has given to people, how much he means to them.
He realizes that he hasn’t thanked any of the people, and starts to get anxious again. But right when that happens, his editor Kawase tells him how everyone makes mistakes, and that it is just about making sure you don’t let that stop doing what you love. That is where the quote comes from. And while saying “don’t give up” or “Everyone makes mistakes” is probably one of the most cliche lines you could write, the way it is written here makes it extremely good. 
And when the last fan leaves and Subaru realizes that he hasn’t thanked her, he starts to get anxious again. But he remembers what Kawase told him, and he loudly says “Thank you so much”.
This feels like another turning point in his character, where he understands that his work is appreciated.

And this is why I love this show. You know, there’s a unique score, some fine comedy, but this is what makes the show what it is. Showing the importance of the people around you could be very cliche, but this show manages to make it extremely immersive. 
In the last episode of the show, Subaru comes home late from a trip and tells his friend Hiroto to make sure Haru is all right. But since there’s such a big storm outside, Hiroto couldn’t close the door at Subaru’s and Haru runs out. Throughout most of the show, we have seen Subaru not enjoying the company of his friends. He finds them all annoying and a nuisance to his work. But in the last episode, Subaru and all of his friends get together to find Haru. He doesn’t even have a problem asking a stranger if they’ve seen Haru. And this ending was honestly amazing. Showing Subaru’s development like this was very emotional, and really encapsulates why I love his character.
It is one of the few shows/movies I would call inspiring.

‘My Roommate is a Cat’ is a show that doesn’t look like much. It looks like a comedy show with some cute animation of a cat playing around. But the way this played with my expectations was honestly astounding. It is a show I would normally not watch. But now that I have, it was a pleasure for sure!

The summer season returns and Mizusawa Team has the ambition and determination to become the best team of all Japan, but first they have a challenge to overcome, being that to find new members to maintain the club, following with the attempt to create the atmosphere of a real team.
    
During this season, the main focus was on the team competitions and what the character can learn from that experience. In the long run of their life there will always be an opportunity to compete individually with the purpose of to be a Meijin or Queen, but the title of the best High School team is only possible in those three years that will be consumed in a blink. With that in mind, the appreciation for teamwork grows in this part of the story.

Compared to the previous year, now with a little misstep on the way, their tears and sweats shows their passion for improvement. Even when they lost the path, they find alternative routes to win, overcoming their weakness and enduring the pain they managed to obtain the desired title of being number one.

On this occasion the balance between personal growth through the Karuta was more present, with constant competitions where the characters had introspection about their performance, leaving different flags to a future emotional development. 

I find that Chihaya had those hints of being something more, despite the fact that it’s usually focused on the Karuta, gradually opens his emotions to new perspectives, trying to understand how she feels about others and about her future. A point that will be explored further.

Meanwhile Chihaya wants to improve and Arata is influenced by her, someone feels pressured because his conflicting feelings. Taichi faced many things in his life, encapsulated within the expectations of others versus his ambitions. This season end up, leaving the tension in the air with what will happen.

For my part I keep getting excited about how every interaction between the characters result realistic, there’s the vibe of ideal youth that gradually breaks down in the transition from being an adult.

The feeling of bloom abounds in this series, being quite refreshing to see, with the same constancy in production as the first season. Now, you will continue to be amazed by the dynamism while they're playing, in contrast the close-ups show with bright colors and a tinge of nostalgia the mood of the characters.
    
For the most part, if you liked the first season and want to understand more about how the Karuta influences the personal growth of the characters, feel sure that in this part you will find an interesting development of youthfulness who discovers their ambitions.

101117,"I'm going to be positively fawning over this season at the start, so please await your confusion at my overall score until the end, because this season really was quite good- there's just more problems here than seasons 1 or 2. and event though I'm giving it basically the same score as High Speed: Free! Starting Days, I'd rewatch this far more often than that, and I'll elaborate on why in a bit, but I'm gonna try to frontload my praise.

Season 3 brings more cute boys, more swimming, and more juicy drama than ever before- and I loved almost every minute of it- I was very worried at the start, when I realized that we'd be going between three prominent locations and character group storylines, at least for a little bit. The first 3 episodes eased my worry, a bit, though- and for most of this season i have to commend the team behind this show for how well this season balances all of the characters and storylines. I expected it to become a jumbled mess, but it really isn't. They almost always focus on very important or interesting plot or character growth elements for each group, with just the right amount of flavor text. To their credit, as well, they clearly & quickly realized the need to bring these characters closer together again for a satisfying collision of all the stories going on here-smart decisions on the whole.

Haru and Makoto's stories receive satisfying, if somewhat predictable evolutions from  Eternal Summer, Take Your Marks! and the Timeless Medley recap films. It won't blow you away, but it certainly satisfied me. I was actually worried for most of the season that Makoto might fall by the wayside from the entirety of the season, as he is sidelined for a hot minute- but they dedicate an episode near the end to answering that exact issue, so if you feel the same way going into this, your patience will be rewarded int hat regard. It's very sweet and just... real the way he clearly loves to share the joy of swimming with other people. Haru also gets a nice little arc about beginning to open himself up to new ways of approaching his craft, and swimming as a whole as the plot unfolds, though I feel that his arc is sort of halted before it can really come to any conclusion. It was nice to see more of how he changes other people for the better around him, but somehow this time around that didn't necessarily lead to us learning anything more about Haru himself- aside from further confirming that underneath his cold heart he truly loves people. That's why I think when he swims with an important character int his season, at loss to himself, just to help them get over their fear and sadness, you see that on display more than ever before- and I'd be a lair if that act of kindness did not make me cry.

Nagisa, Rei and the Iwatobi High School team actually have a solid amount of time focused on them, even as they are definitively assigned b-plot status.I really enjoyed seeing Rei and Nagisa as the older mentors for a new group of students in the group, ESPECIALLY Rei taking up the mantle from Haru as captain. It's so heartwarming seeing him embrace and absolutely shine in that role. You can see that he really believes in his team and wants to inspire them the same way Haru did for him. Granted, seeing Nagisa and Rei in this more matures state is all you get for character growth, but I suppose it's enough.

Ikuya and Toono are somewhat complicated. I really love their stories in a way, and Ikuya is far more likeable and easy to empathize with here than in the prequel movie- I think the allegory of him to the Little Mermaid novel- while a little cheesy- is nonetheless effective at portraying the flawed perception he has of himself and those around him. Haru finally breaking him out of the idea that he has to become powerful and accomplished solely for himself and never rely on anyone is genuinely beautiful and Ikuya's breakdown and full reunion with his old friends is the best part of this whole season, maybe. Toono is definitely interesting, and I did feel like I understood why he did what he did int he end, and even wanted to pity him- but I can't fully because there's a double sided coin to his nature. He's definitely negatively affected by the expectation place upon him to care for his friend like a father almost- but he displays some rather controlling and mean behavior towards his friend's old colleagues- to the point that when Ikuya said that he wasn't really a bad guy I wanted to ask... ""I mean, isn't he kind of a bad guy, tho?""

Rin has a fun littler story int his season, even if he's part of a C-plot that is not touched on in several episodes, and the interactions between him and Mikhail are pretty funny, I'll admit. there's also a few touching heart to hearts that he has with Haru and Makoto later on that made me smile, and it was good to just see him as a fully confident character removed entirely from the shackles of the past in this season, just... happy. Mah boy deserves to take on the world. He doesn't get as much screentime as I'd like, even so... He's my favorite supporting character int his world and here it felt like he was somewhat of an afterthought in the narrative for about 3/4ths of it.

Natsuya and Nao don't play the largest overall role int his plot, but they're a satisfying piece in this puzzle, and it's sweet how much they still care about these kids even at the point they are in their lives- especially when Natsuya leaves his life of pure money-seeking to discover the thrill and joy of competing for competition's sake all over again. Nao is sort of just there, yeah, but he makes a nice foil to Natsuya in a lot of ways and you can feel how much Natsuya longs to swim with his dear friend again- and admittedly he gets to give some nice advice to Makoto, too.

Now for my main issue, beginning with the very late introductions of Albert Wehrlander and Kaede Kinjo. I understand that these two are here to tease Free: The Final Stroke, but neither serve any explicit purpose in the narrative other than to inexplicably trip Haru up mentally for ill-defined and shaky reasons that don't even end up being resolved in this season, hitting you with the ""see you next time"" before you know it. That really bothered me, because Seasons 1 and 2 were complete stories that worked on their own, for the most part. this season felt like it ended before it actually fully completed the story it began, and these two characters feel partially responsible for why it feels that way. I just HATE these characters with no real buildup or development pending a movie that hasn't happened yet int he chronology derailing the main plot and leaving the ending to be so bittersweet and unsatisfying. It would be one thing if one of these characters was built up the entire season and then just crushed Haru in a shocking ending, but it literally ends right before another race begins- we don't even know how that turns out- and the one race we see the results of feels rather anticlimactic and weirdly paced- considering how much time was dedicated to Nagisa and Rei's portion of the All-Japan Invitational. And overall, I really o not like the feeling of having this season be truncated in order to advertise the future movie, which I would be happy to watch anyway because I love this series, you didn't need to cheapen this part of the series to get me on board. ugh.

And in general, as admirably as this season juggles as many characters as it has, the fumbling at the finish line because of two sudden newcomers as well as the fact that the Samezuka cast mostly falls by the wayside here despite Iwatobi still having a decent part to play and the fact that most of Sousuke's story has to be done offscreen are evidence of how hard the writers were having to work to make all of this really work in just 12 episodes. I feel like maybe 2-3 more episodes would've fixed all of this, even one more could've fixed that ending. And as much as i think they did a good job balancing everythign they had to handle given that, the pacing is often totally breakneck, there's rarely time to stop and have a slow moment like the first two seasons had plenty of.t hat's not to say you get none, but they feel more fleeting here than before- and less impactful as a result.

Overall, I'm happy I watched this, and I think there's plenty to gain from watching Season 3 of this series I love- but if I was watching this after 4 years of waiting upon release back in 2018... I could easily see myself being more than a little disappointed. It's not even close to being bad, but it just feel underwhelming in a way I cannot say about Seasons 1 or 2. maybe the movies will fix my issues with this, on the whole- but it could never fix the way I  felt seeing it end so abruptly."
111965,"As a great man once said, “Being a hero, it's hard.  Being a hero, it's hard all the time.  Superhuman powers, you'd think it's easy...  But being pretty much invincible is not what it seems to be.  Being a hero is hard...  Because there's an unbelievably endless stream of poontang.  It's like you're a tapioca factory running 24 hours a day, and even if you stop for a second to foil some kind of robbery or something, You find yourself in public wearing tights with a woodie that won't go away.”  These are the lyrics to a classic heroic ballad that was NOT sung by Peter Grill, but they might as well have been, because they illustrate the story of his life.  Blessed with incomparable strength, durability and combat prowess, Peter Grill is in his prime, cheered by the crowds, idolized by all, and engaged to the love of his life...  But he’s also attracted the unwanted attention of four humanoid women who desire nothing more than to harvest his seed and bare the next illegitimate warrior of his bloodline.  Can Peter Grill preserve his honor long enough to walk his beloved down the aisle, or will the man who lived like a tiger find himself drowning in pussy?

I hate myself so fucking much I hope you all know that.  Also, in case anybody’s wondering, no, I have no idea why this anime’s title is a parody of Harry Potter.  It has nothing to do with Harry Potter at even the smallest level.

Peter Grill and the Philosopher’s Time was the debut title from a production company called Wolfsbane, who were founded in 2017, but wouldn’t release this series until three years later, which is weird, because it does not look like this anime had three years of work put into it.  It does, however, look like the work of struggling first timers.  To be completely fair, this is a pretty good looking series, as long as two caveats are in place.  First, it looks fine as long as nothing’s moving.  The environment is rich, immersive and highly detailed, which is asking a lot for what would otherwise be considered a generic fantasy setting.  The color palette is bright and vibrant, the non-human races are given skin tones that are easy on the eyes and stand out against their human peers without clashing with them, so there really isn’t a dull moment in this show visually speaking, you know, as long as you’re holding pause.  What I’m saying is that the animation itself is bafflingly terrible.  It’s not just cheap or low budget, I could handle that.  It is those things, but it’s just poorly directed, especially in the early episodes.  Just about every other decision made from that perspective was the wrong decision.

As for the second caveat, let’s look at the character designs.  Honestly, they’re kind of awesome.  It’s tempting to give all the credit for this to the manga author, but it can still be challenging to translate someone else’s work from the page to the screen, so Wolfsbane does deserve some credit for this.  Peter Grill is a pretty damn cool looking hero.  It’s a shame we only see him involved in one particular type of action, because if he were the protagonist in a video game, he’d be a fun avatar to adventure with.  His fiance flawlessly rides the integral line between beautiful and respectable, so it’s never a stretch to believe that he’d put so much value into his own virtue for her.  The non-human races look quirky and full of personality, with my personal favorite being Antonio Spartacus, the big hulking red ogre who reminds me of Vtuber Zentreya for some reason.  However, here’s the second caveat...  They look good as long as they’re clothed.  The nudity in this show is hideous, overdrawn and indulgent to the point that I’m willing to believe they handed nude scene artwork duties over to a twelve year old boy.

There’s a phenomenon in ecchi that I like to call The Pillsbury Effect.  You know when you crack open a tube of Pillsbury biscuits, and the dough starts spilling out of the sides, becoming it’s true engorged size?  If that’s what happens when an anime character’s clothes come off, you have The Pillsbury Effect.  C-cups become D-cups the second they’re released from their cloth prisons, and then E-cups whenever they’re shoved into the camera.  The most tight, toned bodies become thicc with an extra c once the director wants to pretend he’s making porn, and hell, not even the one flat character is spared from these inconsistencies, as she constantly fluctuates between A and B.  I don’t know, am I the only one who likes character proportions to remain consistent in all forms of dress?  Maybe I’m the weird one on that, but it doesn’t excuse censorship that’s so inconsistent that Peter’s peter can go from blatantly being covered by a censor-cloud to humorously covered by a cartoon elephant face to horrifyingly just not being there for several awkwardly extensive scenes, sometimes in the same episode.  Yeah, I’ve complained about Barbie doll bodies in the past, but this show fucking lingers on both male and female characters having bare, featureless doll crotches.

The english dub was a Sentai Filmworks effort, and as it’s one of their newest projects, I’ll be honest, I don’t recognize most of the names attached to it.  There are a few industry veterans in the mix, but none of them got more than two episodes without picking up multiple characters, and almost every single lead role went to someone so new that they don’t even have their own wikipedia page yet.  Don’t get me wrong, this doesn’t result in any poor performances, in fact it’s quite the opposite, it sounds like they all showed up at work looking to pull out their A-game to try and take full advantage of this opportunity, with a project I’m assuming most of the studio’s biggest stars said no too, and I wish them all the best of luck for trying to make this opportunity count.  Kyle Colby Jones throws a lot of wild translations in there, like all of his colorful euphemisms for sperm, and these up-and-coomers still say all their lines with gusto.  It is a surprisingly good dub, one that’s well worth the recommendation, but you’re not missing anything world-changing if you’re a hardcore sub fan.

So before we go any further, I need to clear up a few things.  This show was not made for me.  It’s an ecchi series that was very clearly designed to cater to a small handful of fetishes, none of which I personally have in even the smallest amount.  There are a few kinks I will shame people for, but none of them are in this particular show, and fanservice is meant to offer service to fans in the form of specific fantasies, so if this show touches you in a way I would prefer not to be touched, there’s nothing wrong with that, and I don’t want you to think for a second that I have anything against you personally.  On the other hand, I would like you to recognize that just because I don’t enjoy it on the same level as you, that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t have the right to review it.  It was not made for me, but I still wanted to write about it, for a couple of reasons.  First of all, I had thoughts about it, and when I feel compelled to write down my thoughts, I will make it everyone else’s problem.  And second, my last nine reviews have failed to hit 10 upvotes each, and I figure if I review a recent ecchi title and fill it with sex jokes, more than four people might actually find my crap worth reading.

With that out of the way, I have a few issues with this show, so let’s start with an easy one;  The entire plot is inherently flawed.  If you’re just tuning in, the premise of Peter Grill is that the main character is the strongest warrior in the land, and his harem wants to bang him so they can get pregnant and bare equally powerful warrior children.  Now, ignoring the fact that using pregnancy as a female character’s primary motivation is just disgusting as hell...  Existing for the sake of her future offspring is an even shittier narrative purpose than existing for the sake of a love interest...  None of that really matters, because that kind of genetic superiority doesn’t exist.  True, there are physical and psychological traits that can be hereditary, but to the specific degree that it’s presented in Peter Grill?  It doesn’t matter how strong or weak you are, it won’t be inherently reflected in your children.  This sort of idea kinda reeks of eugenics, by far the most stupid and detrimental field of study in human history, and historically speaking, the backbone of racism and bigotry.  So yeah, this whole premise is fucking stupid.

True, this idea has popped up in other anime, but it’s usually easy to ignore because other anime don’t dwell on it as much as this one does.  Like, it’s hinted in Battle Athletes Victory that Akari should be a better athlete because she possesses her legendary mother’s genes, but it’s never explicitly stated to work that way, and Akari improves throughout the story by her own efforts, both physically and mentally.  I keep thinking about these ogres saying they want Peter’s spunk, and they’ll leave him alone when they get pregnant, and I’m like, they’re not going to know how powerful a warrior that child is going to be upon birth.  What if they get back with their fresh pregnancies, give birth, and raise their children to be the next big warriors, only for them to gravitate towards literary or artistic pursuits?  What if they turn out to be lazy?  Spoiled?  Are their mothers going to come back for round two?  This isn’t even taking miscarriages or deformation into account.  It doesn’t sound like any thought went into this outside of “reason for the fucking.”  Hell, if that’s all you’re here for, you don’t even get that, they cut away from every single sexual encounter before it can happen on screen!

It’s also worth mentioning the surprising amount of times that a character’s decisions make no sense whatsoever.  I’m not sure how I feel about Luvellia’s Dad being so overprotective of her that he raised her to be completely naive to how procreation happens, or the fact that his standards are so high that he doesn’t even want the strongest warrior in his kingdom to marry her...  On the one hand there is a potentially funny joke there about fathers who are unnaturally obsessed with their daughters, but I’ve seen the same joke done so much better...  Fucking Drawn Together knew how to pull this off, what’s your excuse?  They push it so far that it strains believability.  Then again, there’s a scene early on where the two ogre girls are sexually assaulting Peter, they get his pants off, and he hides them under the table(You know, instead of yelling for help over the fact that he’s being assaulted) and he sits down to conceal his lack of pants...  WHICH ANYONE COULD EASILY TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM FROM MOST ANGLES.  Hell, the King has a full on conversation with him standing right next to him, plainly able to see the side of his naked ass.

Peter makes every single idiotic decision he can, to the point that listing them off sounds exhausting, but rest assured, there are so many easy ways he could have escaped the demands of his harem if he had a single brain cell to spare, and because of that, he starts out the series from a place of extreme unlikeability, as he not only crumbles under the pressure of his harem, but when the prospect of his fiancee finding out about it comes up, he prioritizes lying and covering it up over being the honest man we’re supposed to believe he is, which allows his harem to gain more and more control over him, and here’s where my biggest issue with this series comes in...  This show is supposed to be either sexy or funny at any given time, and I can’t muster up either of those reactions, because this show is fucking disturbing.

I mentioned before that Peter begins the series unlikeable.  He is also unsympathetic, because every time the King threatens or demeans him, well, WE know as the audience that he has cheated on Luvellia multiple times, so yeah, dude’s gotta point.  The problem is, over the course of the series, Peter does manage to become more and more sympathetic, but it’s in the worst way possible.  I’m sorry, I know I’m probably about to get dragged for “bringing politics into it,” but it doesn’t take long for Peter’s situation to become skin-crawlingly horrible, as every time he agrees to cheat on his fiancee, he gives the other woman blackmail material to use against him, and he very quickly begins to lose his agency in the story.  Don’t get me wrong, there were elements of pressure and manipulation right from the start, but eventually Peter winds up being coerced into sex so hard that you could make a legitimate argument for lack of consent, and his abusers possess the empathy of fucking paralysis demons.  If the genders were swapped, this show would get canceled faster than a Rooster Teeth First account.

I’ve made no secret of the fact that I’m asexual, I’ve mentioned it in several of my reviews before, but I didn’t know I was like this until I was about 28, and I went through a lot of confusion up to that point.  I had a serious girlfriend from the age of about 19 to 25, she was an older woman, and it was pretty obvious that she had more of a libido than I did, and I’ll spare you the gory details, but I know what it’s like to have a lot of sex that you didn’t want to have.  I know what it’s like to be pressured and coerced, and to be stuck in that situation with seemingly no way out, so when I see just how casually these women blackmail Peter into fucking them whenever they damn well please with no concern for his well-being, it legitimately makes my skin crawl.  Like, if even one of those women had threatened to commit suicide to keep him under control, it may have actually triggered me.  This is really bad.  This is an exceptionally terrible anime.  The only thing I really liked about it was the character Antonio Spartacus, who seemed like a really stand-up dude, and who actually had a really charming and satisfying ending, which is nice, because nothing else in this shitpile had an ending.  No resolutions, just the introduction of disgusting looking goblin waifus for the second season. Hurray.

Peter Grill and the Philosopher’s Time is available from Sentai Filmworks.  The original manga is available from Seven Seas entertainment.

I would again like to state that if you’re into cheating fantasies, power dynamic fantasies, giant boobs no matter how badly they’re drawn, or any other fetish this anime employs, there’s nothing wrong with you enjoying it and ignoring every single point that I just brought up...  Although I do think you deserve better, of course.  For me, this anime was insufferable.  Honestly, as a side effect of writing reviews of terrible anime for as long as I have been, it’s hard to not look at something as putrid as this and try to figure out how it could have been savaged, and I actually have an answer for that.  All they needed to do to make this show palatable was to never allow Peter to actually cheat.  Everything else could have remained the same, all the seduction attempts, all the fanservice, everything, all that would need to change is that instead of every situation ending with Peter cheating, they would end with him finding clever and creative tricks to avoid it, which could be a genuinely funny running gag while also preserving the stakes of the story.  That would be the smart way to tell this story, but in the words of Robin Williams, “God gave men a penis and a brain, and only enough blood to run one at a time.”

I give Peter Grill and the Philosopher’s Time a 2/10."
106051,"Senryuu Shoujo is a cute romance, TV short that aired during the 2019 spring season. I have only watched it recently, and before happening across it on Anilist, I had not heard of it once. It's a shame, really, that it didn't reach the popularity that say Horimiya had met. As much as I enjoyed this show, I understand why this may be.

Senryuu Shoujo tells the story of Nanako Yukishiro, who is quite frankly one of the best female leads in the romance genre; maybe even in anime as a whole. Nanako is a 15 year old girl who has a difficult time communicating with other people, including her own family. This is why she is entirely mute, and communicates only through senryu (5-7-5 poetry, like the haiku) using a board she carries with her everywhere she goes. Even still, Nanako is very animated and expressive in her facial features and reactions (plus giggles a lot), sometimes in even a comedically exaggerated fashion.

Nanako was bullied for a time when she was young for this mutism, and as a result she holed herself up at home and refused to leave the house. She didn't want to interact with anybody, and was depressed to such an extent that her father had grown very concerned for her well-being. However, after joining a poetry club in the community comprised of all adults, she meets a boy her own age: Eiji Busujima, also known as the ""Demon of West Middle School.""

Except Eiji is nothing at all like a demon; actually, the nickname is hilarious to tell you the truth, because Eiji is an airhead who is all dorky and smiles and loves bunnies. There's not much detailed about his father up to the point that I've read in the manga, but he has a very intimidating appearance and smokes a lot, especially so in the eyes. Eiji's eyes and smile make him look scary, so much so that everyone is terrified and makes him the victim of a bad reputation due to rumors. For a time, Eiji befriended gangsters and got into a lot of fist-fights, but he decided to turn over a new leaf and take up poetry, which is how Eiji came to join the poetry club.

To make it long story short, the two connected, and when Eiji meets Nanako's mother, she tells him that he was the one who broke Nanako from her shell. He was the first person Nanako wanted to spend the rest of her life with outside their family, she had told him, and that was when Nanako's personality transformed to being the perky, bubbly, free-spirited girl she is in the present.

What I love about the romance between Eiji and Nanako is just how easy it is. There's no miscommunication, no jealous love rivals; all their friends are rooting for them, and are trying their best to get the two of them together. Nanako is fairly expressive of her feelings for Eiji albeit subtle in a sense, and the two of them do so many couple-like things already such as linking arms and going on dates like it's the most natural thing in the world. They're always joking around together and find each other's quirks most charming, and most importantly, the two of them are constantly stressing to one another how much they adore them just the way they are. When other girls in their grade pressured Nanako into wearing makeup in the manga (which she didn't like), Eiji told her she was beautiful but admitted how he found it more difficult talking to her that way since she doesn't look like the same Nanako he spends all his time with. Their school's poetry club in which they're both apart of tried to come up with a strategy to make Eiji more approachable, but when they asked Nanako for suggestions, she said that Eiji is perfect just the way he is (and made a joking remark about how his eyes roll back into his head when he's lost in thought).

This isn't a story of strangers falling in love, but two best friends who are already mutually exclusive without realizing. Hell, even when a guy tried confessing his feelings to Nanako in the beginning of the manga, Nanako rejects him and says to Eiji that she's relying on him to protect her, and I thought that was really sweet. There's no drama occurring whatsoever, and while I like that in a sense, it gives the plot little substance. Every good story needs a conflict, and that is something vital that this series lacks. Not to mention that every episode is not only 12 minutes long, but every manga chapter are stand-alones that are quite short as well.

While the animation is stunning, the plot lines are original, and the VAs are incredible (ESPECIALLY the dub, which I highly recommend), I think the lack of a sole, driving sustenance and the short duration of episodes over the course of a single 12 episode series, there isn't enough content and development to really take the story home (plus the anime ends on a sort of random note in my opinion; they gave the backstory of how Nanako and Eiji met, which is very important, but it ended the anime so suddenly, not to mention the two of them didn't get together). I also quite dislike the subtle (but frequent) fan service that shows up in just about every episode, especially with Koto and her entire character as a whole (she sort of gives off a ""big sister"" fetish, and is just super sexual in general). I also think it's quite off-putting that the entire cast other than Eiji are all women, with not a single male character except for unimportant backgrounders.

All in all, I think this story and its characters had so much potential (far more than many romances I've seen / read), but the execution just wasn't the best. But even still, it's a wholesome, funny, and enjoyable watch, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a drama-free, feel-good series!"
145604,"We’ve been blessed with quite a few good to great anime original series in this decade so far, ranging from Odd Taxi, to Lycoris Recoil, and even Do it Yourself this anime season. I suppose this is a grim reminder that not every single original can be done at an elite level, but even so, this show was quite the abhorrent showing, oozing of generic storytelling, mixed with a lot of contrivances, questionable ideas, and very inconsistent character writing. I’m not one to lambast things often, but this show needs to have its fair grilling.

STORY:

You’ll see this in the synopsis already, but essentially, Ittoki, the main protagonist, is just living his daily life, although heavily surveyed by his mom, Kousetsu, his childhood friend, and Tokisada, his uncle. Someone called Tsubaki tries to seduce him and kill him in the process, but he is protected by ninjas? The shocking truth is then revealed that he is the supposed heir to the Iga ninja clan, and to train up at a ninja academy immediately. The moment I found out an academy would be involved, I just rolled my eyes and waited for Ittoki to probably get a harem, and to gain insane levels of plot armour. Did that necessarily happen? Not exactly, but the plot got more disappointing to me than that.

Turns out, the ninjas aren’t your typical ninjas, with the jumping, the shurikens, the mental dexterity, but instead, “ninjas” are powered by ninja gear, something resembling mechs. I thought this show was about ninjas! Yep, with ninja gear, you can be a ninja whenever you feel like it, how about we just don’t train at all? Then what was the academy even for, to learn how to beep boop beep boop and press buttons???

Honestly, this show just doesn’t have any sort of identity, it’s simply a story about “ninja” wars, with contrived plot twists, or twists that had NO prior build up to it. It even sort of gave up and just gave us a beach episode in the middle of the series. “Hey Ittoki, which of us is hotter?” Imagine if anyone even cared to discuss that.

ART:

The animation was not very impressive overall, very bland and boring. The character designs for the most part were generic, perhaps only Kousetsu had the passable design.

MUSIC:

Except for the ED which is fine, the OP and the soundtrack are very bland as well. Just a poor showing of audiovisual direction overall.

CHARACTERS:

Needless to say, the characters were also very laughable and not memorable at all. Ittoki is your typical dumb protagonist, with a sense of justice and morality I bet no one else would even care about, and did I mention he was kind of dumb? He’s constantly out of the loop, whether it’s with the ninja gear, or the knowledge of ninjas in general. So why didn’t y’all just tell him about the ninjas from the very beginning if he’s the heir of the Iga clan? Now this poor child has to figure it out all on his own with that brain of his.

Now to the girls. Ryouko is just kind of there, the cutesy girl who knows all the academy stuff, and of course ends up liking Ittoki. Kirei is also just kind of there, with some twists and turns of her own. Kousetsu is also just there, though the ED would signal she has a bit more depth to her character.

Now to the villains. LOL, imagine the political discourse was actually interesting. Yeah, I’m going to be honest, I forgot who the villains were. Some bozo from the Koga clan or something. Not even going to discuss this.

ENJOYMENT:

It really had potential, but not only was it rushed, any sort of twist wasn’t very well done.

THEMATIC EXECUTION:

Like I said, these ninjas aren’t really even ninjas, so any sort of ninja theme was a failure. There were some weird rules around the “way of the ninja”, and they say that rules are meant to be broken, but yeah, there weren’t any real rules were there? Any sort of romance was a waste of time as well.

OVERALL:

Probably one of my least favourite anime from this entire year, as this was not only generic, but thoroughly contrived, uninteresting, and the entire premise of ninjas was squandered by horrid ideas. There is nearly nothing to praise here at all, and I’m glad my watching of this has come to an end.

Oh, and did I mention Ittoki is not a good ninja? Don’t remember if I did."
20778,"I'm honestly just going to talk as I feel about the movie for this first half here.

I can honestly say that IF the ""Frieza Saga"" WAS the ""ORIGINAL"" ending to the entire Dragon Ball series, Akira Toriyama definitely did a good number on ending the SPECIFIC series  of ""Dragon Ball Z""  off on a nostalgically ""Poetic"" note. With it building-up to another CLIMACTIC BATTLE between Goku and Frieza. Although, the different with THIS battle VS. the ORIGINAL battle is present in their NEW STAKES: 

1. Not only are all of the ORIGINAL Characters from the FIRST encounter still present, but ADDITIONALLY other Characters AND NEW (Some even more powerful) Characters also confront Frieza's army until their Final Battle is ready to take place.
2. Unlike where in the Original series, Frieza was invading Planet Namek in search of their Dragon Balls at the same time that Goku and his friends were going there to borrow them to resurrect his fallen friends from beforehand, just as we, the AUDIENCE, have been informed of that Planet being their ORIGIN WORLD, this time the Planet Frieza is invading is EARTH, entirely JUST to get revenge on Goku and Vegeta whom originally killed him in the first place.
3. Whereas in the Original series, as Frieza gradually transformed his body, but still kept his ""White""-coloring regardless and Goku had ultimately turned ""Super Saiyan"" along with his hair changing color to to a bright ""Gold/Blonde"", this time as the time has past with two Characters individually, their further increase in power has ALSO interestingly led to them changing COLOR-PALLETS as well...! The battle has and probably always WILL be ""Dark Vs. Bright"" but now the CHARACTERS have changed which Color they represent...! 
Original: Goku vs. Frieza - White vs. Black:
img220()
Modern: Goku vs. Frieza - Black vs. White:
img220()
4. Finally, the most appropriate difference with this movie VS. the Original Series is that when the series had gotten to this point of Goku and Frieza's battle, the popularity of the series was SO massive that the series that was meant to ORIGINALLY be JUST a Sequel-series to the Original ""Dragon Ball"" INSTEAD ACCIDENTALLY TURNED INTO THE ACTUAL MAIN SERIES OF THE FRANCHISE. Meanwhile, THIS MOVIE, which has the same basic plot, manages to ACTUALLY finish-off the story of ""Dragon Ball Z"". But still positively informing the audience about the potential for the Series to live-on in another Sequel after ""Z"". 

Finally, that ""Metal"" Frieza theme-song, just freaking AWESOME! 
(I'm not going to lie at all, I originally made this translation of the Song for Musician - ""JoYo"" to sing, but if HE'LL never get around to it, might as well just put the Lyrics on here so that they're on SOME kind of Platform.):

- Captain Ginyu FINALLY gets to return back to a normal body, it is still TRUE that it isn't HIS original body and he IS immediately KILLED right after, but at least he was FINALLY ABLE TO RETURN TO A FULLY-ABLE BODY!
- Even though, as usual, Vegeta HAPPILY volunteers to kill Frieza off just as he normally would, it is actually GOKU who has to kill Frieza as his attention is entirely swayed by Vegeta from a previous battle, so Goku is officially brought to the Brink of one of his ""Morals of Honor"" as a Fighter and is immediately informed about his final duty against Frieza!

100675,"Since the release of the Saekano film last year, I have anxiously been waiting for the film to be released in the US, checking every website possible, hoping that the sub had already been uploaded somewhere. Finally, after a year later, I got the chance to watch the movie (sadly no theatrical release) and I am glad to say that it was gratifying to finally experience the conclusion to a series I adore so much.



Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata or Saekano: How to Raise A Boring Girlfriend was my introduction to the harem/romance genre and it quickly became one of my favorite anime as I began to indulge myself more into the medium. Now, Saekano is by no means a masterpiece or a flawless series but it is still quite impressive overall. The story is well executed and entertaining, the characters are charming, the animation and soundtrack are great and overall, it is really enjoyable to watch.

 > > > Spoilers For the Film Ahead  Utaha > Eriri. It doesn't matter though because in the end, I enjoyed watching the journey of these characters and their growth from start to finish. It was a definitely a wonderful experience.



If there is one thing that stayed consistent throughout this adaptation it is the animation and soundtrack which were well done. The animation is clean and fluid while the visuals are alluring and beautiful. The music is similar to that of the anime with some notable tracks. The movie gives us a couple of new songs such as an Icy Tail song,『icy tail YO!』, a new Megumi song 『ULTIMATE♭』 and the ending song ""Glory Days"" performed by Luna Haruna. All Saekano songs are memorable, straight bangers and catchy as hell, including the OP and ED's. If it weren't for the first season's ending ""Colorful"", I might have never even watched Saekano in the first place. And I almost forgot about the voice acting. Just like the first two seasons, the VA's gave an amazing performance bringing out the emotion and truly instilling life into their characters and making them even more lovable.

Now for the criticism. Was Saekano:Fine a perfect film? While I do like the movie a lot, truthfully, it could have been better. One major issue I had with the film is the pacing. It honestly felt rushed at times, which made certain transitions between scenes awkward and scenes that should have left more of an impact on the viewer are not as strong. Although I have not read the source material (I have skimmed through parts of it though) it is obvious that much of the light novel content was cut to fit things into the timespan of the movie, and the parts cut out might have been interesting to see on screen. I can't help but think that a third season might have been a better option. Maybe the story would have been executed better or maybe not. Who knows. Am I disappointed though? Not at all. As I mentioned in the beginning, I am satisfied with the movie and how things turned out. Not to mention that Clover Works added an extra 10 mins or so of anime original content after the credits which was great so I guess that makes up for the missing LN content lol. 

Saekano was one of the first series I watched when I was just starting to get into anime, so it is always gong to be special to me no matter what. It is nowhere near perfect and it is definitely not for everyone, but I do believe this anime is kind of overlooked by people for whatever reason it may be and there are certainly those who are missing out. There is undoubtedly people who would genuinely enjoy this anime. This review has gone on longer than I expected so to sum everything up, Saekano is an excellent anime which I appreciate wholeheartedly and I think the movie was a pleasurable and rewarding conclusion to the series. After all, it's got everything that most anime viewer want. A good plot, comedy, nice art and animation, great songs, excellent waifu's and all in all, it's an entertaining and fun show. And to those who are still questioning if they should watch Saekano, go for it."
158028,"When you think about isekai surely one of the first things that come to your head is that it has an OP MC. This show is completely about this, about an OP MC killing things, that’s why it’s called Sokushi Cheat ga Saikyou sugite, Isekai no Yatsura ga Marude Aite ni Naranai n desu ga aka Instant Death, and just as those other shows where the OP MC makes every single battle uninteresting because they have no stakes, this series is no different, actually, it is even worse because of how Yogiri is designed to be, he is designed to try to be the strongest character, and not just from his own series, the author of this very clearly tries to make Yogiri the strongest when compared to other characters from other shows.

Actually, Instant Death is not a show, it is VS debating brainrot. If you don’t know what’s VS debating is I’ll give a little explanation, have you ever seen people asking “who will win Goku or Superman?”? Well, VS debating is taking that question and actually trying to answer it, people will search feats of the characters, use physics to calc their speed and destructive power and even classify every single one of their abilities, and while classifying them you will get to a tiering system to put the characters in some tier of power level. What do I mean with VS debating brainrot? Well, obviously, some characters will be created unintentionally powerful to the point of being ridiculous, but then what if someone knows about this kind of stuff and decides that he wants his character to be even stronger than them? Well, this series happens, that’s why you get some really specific details about how Yogiri’s instant death ability works, to make it able to affect characters when compared to him in VS debating, that’s why there are random scenes of people saying “oh, he killed my avatar and was also able to kill my real self” or introducing a character to kill their external power source that was in another dimension, this is to showcase his feats, because the creator of this series knows about VS debating, so as I said before, this isn’t a real series and it is more a wanking fest of a character to make him the most powerful fictional character. This makes the series completely worthless, as it doesn’t tell a real story, the characters are just there to have different powers and abilities to be defeated by Yogiri so someone can say “my character can beat this other character” in a discussion.

Honestly, even if you watched it because the main character has the ability to kill people and see stupid people “paying the price” for what they did, it would still be a waste of time, the way they die is so instantaneous that it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t feel satisfactory to see idiots die because they just drop dead on the spot. You can’t watch it for the animation because it is terribly done, none of the battles between other people matter because the protagonist can kill them with a thought and they just drop dead.

This series is a pit of nothingness, there’s nothing here, it doesn’t exist, because it’s complete and utter shit, it’s the meme of the OP isekai MC but taken to the absolute extreme, so it is just boring to watch. Honestly, the only reason why I knew about this series beforehand was because of hearing about Yogiri in VS debating posts, because there’s nothing more to discuss about this show.

Thank you for reading."
10588,"Persona 4 and the Inevitable Tolls of Adaptation

When it comes to all the mediums that could potentially be turn into an anime, such as a manga, light novel, visual novel or even a movie, few are trickier than a video game. While adaptations from other forms tend to turn one non-interactive media into another, video games rely far more on interaction and players getting as much time out of them as they put in, based on the speed they can get through its challenges or how much side content players go for, which won’t be the same for everyone.

This inherent difficulty is why so many video game based anime either are original stories that have game elements present, such as Kirby Right Back at Ya, Sonic X, and most notably the long running Pokémon anime, original stories that directly tie into the game canon like the Professor Layton/FFXV movies, anime that remove the game elements entirely like God Eater or Tales of Zestiria The Cross, or in general glorified advertisements to the game without closure to anything brought up, not wanting to flesh anything out more than the video game could.

Even those times you get full adaptations of games like Danganronpa: The Animation, BlazBlue Alter Memory, and the Ace Attorney anime, they tend to be seen as rushed, sterile retellings that ruin the plot experience for newcomers and offer almost nothing of new worth to established fans. But years before those deflating series, there was Persona 4 The Animation.

Attempting to adapt Persona 4, a nearly 80 hour RPG, into a 10 hour TV series would be a herculean task to any staff, but the great thing about Persona 4 The Animation is how it manages to think creatively and pull together, even if there are notable problems in dealing with the interactive to non-interactive pitfalls. This is less a “review” in the traditional sense and moreso an analysis on the creative choices involved in Persona 4 The Animation’s development to their effect on presenting the game to a wider audience.

1. The Storytelling
img220()

So in terms of basic storytelling, Persona 4 stars your player character, entering high school in the town of Inaba when suddenly, murders start happening, you find out you can enter a world inside of TVs, you link the two subjects together, and try to prevent any more from happening while slowly learning more through investigating. For JRPG standards, it’s an appreciably digestible, simple plot that focuses on the chemistry and characterization of its protagonists over convoluted plot beats, with a unique overarching theme of societal conformity and acceptance that echoes through all of the game’s major characters. The game alternates between fun bonding scenes between you and your friend group, serious scenes involving the murders and kidnappings, fantastical dungeon crawling, and heavy character exploration through these dungeons as well as “Social Links” which help you better connect to Inaba as a community.

The anime, to great credit, covers the entire main plot of the game, minus the hours spent dungeon crawling against enemies. It, plus the additional OVA for the True Ending, complete the entire story in a fairly cohesive way without adding any anime-exclusive plotholes. Additionally, it well retains the balance between the serious plot and bouncy character moments just like the game, letting each character be themselves yet still contribute in a meaningful way even after their character conflicts.

The character conflicts themselves are often the type that fly incredibly close to the sun. Topics such as repression via gender norms, excess overcompensation, and image in place of identity are represented by one or more characters and just like the game they’re bold topics for the YA audience. One could argue the intentionally over exaggerated presentation of these elements creates certain unfortunate implications but from my point of view, the nature of what these problems piled up as is presented in a deliberate incomplete, inhuman way to still properly supplement the conflicts. Greater expression of anime shows these off than they were before for better or worse, but it’s genuinely well meaning and what the characters learn from these experiences is reflected in future moments as well as the core theme. In general this aspect was a win for the anime, with certain conflicts like Yukiko’s and Naoto’s having some more anime original backing to them, perhaps to account for the missing Social Link info.

It’s also very nice how P4’s anime is able to maintain the sense that “filler-ish” scenes really ARE a great course of character building and camaraderie in conjunction with the main plot and characters. They help to structure the repeating pattern of the plot and add further to the characters even after their main conflicts conclude. Several of these, such as the camping scene, night party scene and school festival scene are genuinely fun moments that bring out a lot in the cast as a group, helped a lot by how much fun you can tell the voice actors are having. Regrettably though, the anime does nothing to fix the worst of these scenes: the infamous Amagi Inn incident (a scene where gender roles are divided to where it’s practically torture porn for the guys when it’s meant to be funny). It's even somewhat made it worse with an entire episode to further build each part of it, only mildly mitigated by a rather rushed Social Link integration that feels more out of place compared to the one there in the game.

Thankfully though, once the plot does get on track in the final fifth of the TV series, it really stays on track. The mystery’s conclusion makes sense and the last handful of battles, while not amazingly animated, are well put together for animation and there’s clear spirit to it, despite how much it wanted to rush the falling action to hold off on the true ending. And the way the separate true ending OVA was handled was........................................not very elegant.

Regardless, the storytelling itself is properly maintained, with the mystery, character moments and message for the sense of community still coming across.

2. Spacing and Flow
img220()

Despite the proven competence of the story, this is, unsurprisingly, where the series has the most problems, having to do with of the amount of content it feels like it has to show in an attempt to downplay the “gameplay for gameplay’s sake” aspects of the game. That being said, the handling is very much a mixed bag.

I mentioned above how it felt like the anime maintained that character building comedy in between conflict, but for a good dramatic example, at one point in the plot, a major character is kidnapped, forcing you to enter a dungeon filled with high leveled enemies and a boss if you want to rescue them. It’s an incredibly desperate situation, but in the game you can massively reduce that by holding off the rescue for days of grinding, or progressing Social Links within that timeframe. In the anime, the rescue and confrontation happen immediately after so the sense of urgency is fully maintained, with the battle following being one of the best moments adaptation wise for how it adds onto the drama of the battle.

Similarly, there are a number of Social Links in the game relating to side characters that do not impact the plot in any way, and a couple of them were presented in ways that make sense for being non-interactive. Some of them, while not as delved into as the game ones, are shown in a really fun comedy episode that practically mocks the game player‘s daily activities. Four more Links (in pairs of two) get their own episodes to help break up the plot (Episode 5) and in Episode 18's case, neatly combine two stories together rather than force them to be separate like the game. This helps create a stronger emotional punch with the anime’s expressiveness.

That’s not to say all of them are well adapted though and you can really tell sometimes. Naoki Konishi has his entire character spat out in less than five minutes only for the anime to consider it a done deal. Margaret’s Link doesn’t exist in any capacity. One Link, for a little girl named Ayane, gets the worst of this. Rather than feeling like an actual struggle to work through like in the game, it just comes off as a short bit of emotional manipulation, before said character disappears completely.

Other moments as well greatly suffer from a lack of clarifying these in-between parts, especially for viewers who haven’t experienced the game. For instance, every episode begins with a brief segment in the “Velvet Room”, which game players would know is the place where you can fuse Personas together and gain ones for your party by using the Compendium. The anime, however, makes no attempt to explain the Velvet Room despite having scenes featuring it at the beginning of every episode. In the anime, Yu fuses Personas inside of dungeons several times instead of using the room, and neither does it clarify where he actually gets his Personas, which seems to downplay its purpose even further despite how much they show it, and the pleasantness of Margaret’s voice.

Individual episode pacing wise, Episode 10 is definitely the low point. It attempts to cover entering a dungeon, a character’s confrontation, and two boss fights in the space of a measly 21 minutes, which was just not enough to cover so many events, let alone events that even in the game itself were explained poorly. On top of that, the boss fights themselves aren’t conveyed in nearly as fun or interesting a way as the boss fights before and after this, likely because of how much they had to cram in.

However, that’s just a matter of time constraints. What’s truly jarring is a brief bit of editing in Episode 12. Most of the time the show’s editing is perfectly functional, aside from little things like not showing a double punch or a sliding fall animated, but this episode had an odd segment. There’s a scene in which the team confronts the dungeon boss, and then mid-villain monologue, it hard cuts to Teddie doing a silly comedy bit with the team outside, completely taking you out of the scene with no transition to showing the battle as a foregone conclusion. They later bring you back into the scene, mid-fight, about 9 minutes later, in what’s conceptually a pretty epic scene. This could’ve been one of the best moments in the series, but with no proper transition, or attempt to show what happened in the meantime, it felt jarring and disconnected. Almost as if the director had a good idea for a scene, but didn’t know how to properly implement it, so he just hard cut and thought people wouldn’t notice because of what it leads to. But people will. Thankfully the rest of the series avoids this incredibly jarring editing..................until the True Ending episode which continuously cuts between three plots at once in half an hour, which is disappointing but not irredeemable.

These issues aside though, the editing never precludes the game experience and despite this rushed pacing, the bulk of what the game aimed for is still there and does come across despite occasional rushing, condensing or slotting in events elsewhere.

3. Comedy and Characterization
img220()

This is where the series shines. While the game had notable moments of comedy, they often had to rely exclusively on line delivery and the small portraits since the models were not very expressive or animated. Completely the opposite here, where models move to the beat of every joke to add to the punchlines. Many of the comedic scenes from the game are retained or added to, sometimes with more expressiveness and other times thanks to cute new character Aika Nakamura and her tendency to always be around for food deliveries. The fact that there’s more jokes may result in some of them not landing (some may find Teddie’s jokes to be unBEARable), but the only parts of the anime to me that weren’t funny were scenes that weren’t funny in the game.

A new element that adds to the comedy is the anime’s portrayal of the game’s silent protagonist, now named Yu Narukami, into non-interactive animation. As a character he works for the most part. He’s reactionless enough to still project some, but also witty and funny enough to feel distinctive character wise as the collective straight man, combining aspects of every choice path the player could make into an engaging character. It’s his comedy moments, many of which were original to the anime, that got a lot of the laughs out of me from the series. Some of his louder emotional moments do feel a bit “on cue” because of this, but Daisuke Namikawa and Johnny Young Bosch still put in the effort all the way to sell it.

I’ve already brought up the side characters in terms of spacing, but as for the rest of the main cast, thankfully Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, Teddie and Naoto all maintain their strong personalities from the game and in the chemistry from their voice actors old and new continues to shine just as well in the more expressive medium. Everyone gets their due, and something I really appreciate about Persona 4’s characters is that even with their initial arcs, they maintain a sense of relevancy to the core theme, add further to the team investigation, and each play off of each other in a way that goes beyond being token party members into genuine friends. The anime adds some strengths and weaknesses to adapting them. On the plus side, the anime adds more scenes to foreshadow their conflicts prior to their climaxes, which help to make them seem like built up, real problems seen in the present, rather than simply having sad backstories expositioned out for quick feels with no buildup. The downside is that, with the inability to get all of their Social Links, the most you get for aftermath is one scene from each character’s link placed at random points in the narrative. These don’t have the same depth, but most of them do help to an extent that is better than nothing. Teddie’s the only one majorly hurt from this, because his Link is story mandatory but several pertinent scenes are cut short or cut out.

The real-world supporting community aspect of Persona games is something that’s present, particularly in Episodes 13 and 14, even if the whole thing couldn’t be fleshed to nearly the same extent in this TV series. It’s at least better than the Persona 3 movies which don’t have any time for it at all, but there is that sense that many conflicts have further places they could go, and the anime just didn’t have time. But for the sake of preventing disjointedness, I get some of it. The player making the decision each day to pursue Social Links or dungeon crawling works because it’s an interactive medium. In an anime though, hopping continuously between over 20 different characters would not only stall plot momentum but be bland to watch on its own from a passive point of view. So while not the most substantive, it’s a choice I can buy.

4. Presentation/Animation

img220(
While faaaaaar from the best-looking show around, especially in a season where Fate/Zero and Guilty Crown aired alongside it, Persona 4 The Animation nonetheless properly uses the perks of an anime in comparison to the videogame presentation wise, in at least consistently getting the job done. Shigenori Soejima’s character designs still maintain their distinctiveness and as of the latest release there aren’t any “off” looking scenes, but conversation scenes themselves are mostly average. The one odd differing detail is Adachi’s hair. I have no idea why they decide to make it more of an auburn compared to the blackish grey from the game, but it’s the type of odd choice that newcomers won’t really care about.

The Persona themselves were all rendered cleanly and distinctly in 2D animation to capture their unique designs and abilities, in a way that thankfully did not use CGI as a shortcut. At worst CGI was on a few objects and certain places in the one area where computerized designs fit. On the downside, few of the action scenes themselves leave much of an impression or engaging choreography. They are certainly commendable when it comes to how the directing creates an increased sense of space and scale for say, the first two major battles, and the penultimate boss battle of the TV series, but the fight choreography itself isn’t particularly standout, often using fast cuts that reduce visceral impact. To their credit though, they are at least animated loosely rather than stiffly, which fit for the nature of Personas themselves.

Backgrounds look great when trying to replicate the game’s dungeon and at least average anywhere else. The one place the art faltered was inside the Junes supermarket. While the backgrounds had generally been believable enough otherwise, in the market, it looks as though the background was taken directly from a REAL store, so the 2D characters create an unintentional Roger Rabbit effect that makes the market look extremely off in every scene that takes place there. It’s just odd compared to everything else. It has a look that could be better, but it could look FAR worse.

5. Audio
img220()
The great thing about being adapted from a game with such a large number of music tracks is that the anime doesn’t need to change many of them or make a whole new soundtrack from scratch And the game has a GREAT set of fitting tracks. But even still there are a number of anime exclusive tracks, whether for tense scenes or for comedy moments. Along with these include the first OP, which sounds great, the first ED which has a great melody change in conjunction with the visuals, the second OP which isn’t as good as the first but still has some slick visuals, and the second ED, which is a decent track, but pales compared to the three preceding. The only real negative I could say score wise is that certain tracks could occasionally be either cut too short or misplayed. The song that precedes boss fights being used around comedy moments doesn’t work nearly as well, a brief playing of Your Affection in Episode 20 felt similarly out of place, and some of the unique boss music near the end of the game would often get cut short for a mixing of tracks to varied effect. As for the dub, nearly every voice actor from the game returns, and those who don’t get replacements who are either better or just as good as the original voices. They do their best to bring out all the fun they can in the script, even if one may find Teddie’s bearly contained pun catalog a bit grating. Adachi’s voice was the only partial sacrifice, because Johnny Young Bosch uses the tone he used in the game for Adachi for the now talkative Yu, so Adachi now has a slight helium to his voice. It still works well enough when it needs to but to some it could make the voice more grating; I got used to it enough.

6. The Little Touches
img220()
Ultimately this section is what led me to want to write this review, because it feels like that even with the series’ pacing issues and average animation, the team at AIC ASTA made sure to add a load of great, appreciated small elements that while not much on their own, add up to show that it’s clear those involved cared about its game origins. Though anyone who doesn’t want to know about some of these can just skip to the last part.

•The eyecatches, often used in most shows to simply say the title, only occasionally showing cool pictures, feature a stats screen for Yu's progress at the moment.

•Yu pulls out Pyro Jack, a Persona can learn the ability to absorb Fire, to counter a boss that primarily uses Fire attacks as a distraction

•The first ED not only is a great song that changes song styles exactly when the animation does, but it displays the current Arcana Yu gained in the episode, as well as falling cards that show every previously obtained one. It’s a great example of an evolving ED because of it.

•The show is more than willing to change the OP song every once in a while. While the original songs are great, they’re able to change up the songs for episode-specific events just enough for the changing to not become a dull trend by itself

•One episode ups the Persona 3 fanservice even FURTHER than the game did, as if they had the entire soundtrack on speed dial. It’s really nice appreciation for those fans over a year and a half before it got its own anime

•The clop clop clop of Teddie’s footsteps is maintained while walking through the dungeons.

•Analysis screens not only display Persona weaknesses like the game did, but also some additional comments without actually needing to say them.

•Ayane on her trumpet is playing a version of I’ll Face Myself, the game’s boss battle theme used in the game and remixed in the anime.

•The main villain uses the Reaper as a potent distraction, which Persona 3 fans will understand given the sheer wrath it has in the game without cheesing.

7.  Conclusion
img220()
In a world where Disney can get away with re-releasing their animated classics such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King as soulless, shot for shot remakes that bloat with nothing necessary, there’s a great deal to appreciate about the genuine effort of this series to do the opposite. In becoming a series, Persona 4 adds much more expressive characters, expressive comedy, expressive direction choices (even if some don’t work) and expressive new scenes to allow the whole thing to function as a good series, if not a great one. However, it is still inferior to the game, as the anime can’t compete with the density, playability, measured endgame and more intimate connection with events that the game provides. Despite these downgraded elements in the transfer, I believe the anime understands the game’s core and has enough heart put into it to be on its own, a solid anime series either way with action, laughs, intrigue, character and a relevant overarching message. True Ending aside, it’s cohesive enough for newcomers while providing enough differences to keep interest for longtime fans. While watching this as a game player, I wasn’t thinking “man, I really wish I was playing the game, but rather “I can’t wait to see what they present next” and when it comes to video game adaptations, that’s something really admirable."
152802,"Dark Gathering is a Supernatural-Horror, Adventure Manga by [Kondou Kenichi](https://anilist.co/staff/120684/Kondou-Kenichi), who was an assistant who worked on the manga D.Gray-man. It was adapted into a 25-episode anime by OLM, housing talents that helped produce amazing shows like Summertime Rendering, OddTaxi & The Apothecary Diaries.



Set in modern-day Japan, it follows Gentouga Keitarou who is trying to readjust to society after being cursed by a spirit. He meets a young girl named Houzuki Yayoi, the cousin of his childhood friend Houzuki Eiko. Yayoi is a genius psychic, hell-bent on finding an evil spirit she named “The Spectre”, who was behind her mother’s disappearance. She drags Keitarou into her terrifying world of grotesque supernatural adventures.

While overviewing the Summer 2023 catalog, my initial thoughts after watching the trailer were that of uncertainty. The question was if this anime could be genuinely scary or just another cringy edge fest. Luckily Dark Gathering succeeds with flying colors in being a horrifying, creepy, and suspenseful show. 

While the initial episodes have an episodic structure it quickly develops into interesting story arcs as Yayoi discovers that the creation of The Spectre seems to be more sinister than initially believed.

img820()


The anime tackles very heavy and taboo themes, with very little if any censorship to accompany them. The horror and tension are intense, and greatly executed, mainly due to two reasons.

First, the haunted locations the characters visit. Many of these locations you could connect to real-life ones, locations holding some dark unknown past of many decades ago, showing the heights of cruelty possible by human beings. For example, in one side-mission, the characters travel to an abandoned building that in the past was connected to a sex-trafficking ring and now is haunted by the spirits of its victims. The supernatural encounters and the horror they unveil never feel too try hard edgy, but instead genuinely creepy in how the spirits, many of them being tortured souls, show their wrath towards the living.

Second, I greatly enjoyed the ghost-hunting combat. A tool the characters use are dolls that act as damage proxies, they transfer damage the evil spirits deal to them to said dolls. The dolls are a great plot device since they greatly increase the sense of urgency, a reality check to you the viewer, that without these dolls and Yayoi’s knowledge, you would have an easier time surviving the Shibuya Incident compared to some of the spirits they encounter.



While the cast is small, they each fit their role within the story well. Yayoi carries the show's narrative and is the most competent among the trio. Keitarou slowly becomes more heroic during the supernatural adventures and Eiko’s love of scary encounters grows.

The production is good, the character designs are cartoony, and the animation is consistently good. The designs of some of the spirits are downright horrific and scary, even scarier in the manga. The sound design is top notch and the soundtrack succeeds in aiding its creepy vibe. The slice-of-life moments are similar to that of Higurashi, where everything is more colorful and goofy, but once it gets serious the art gets more intense.

img820()


Overall this anime is amazing, I desperately need a 2nd season. It takes some time for it to cook, but once it does, you are hooked and can’t stop watching. 

If you like good horror anime I would recommend Higurashi and Shiki as well."
16201,"Environment Establishment

I want to talk about the anime’s art style and particularly about the environment establishment. I know that the anime’s art style is very different from the manga but the anime’s art style actually suits the environment of the story better than the manga. Every single movement by the characters are so natural and nonchalant and even background characters are shown to be doing something instead of standing still or just walking back and forth. I think fear stems from the feeling we feel when we realize something is happening that shouldn’t be happening. The characters faces are extremely similar to real Japanese faces that it’s creepy because you know that this is just an anime and anime people must have huge eyes and pencil like body structure. And I’m sure that was intended.

The BGM is used mostly for conveying the character’s state of mind and it does that quite well. The environment is designed to represent a cage or a small space. You can feel Kasuga trying to escape this cage. You can sense the oldness that hangs in the environment. You feel as though you’ve been living there you whole life. You can relate to how the people born in that town express nostalgia for that town even though you’ve never lived there. This is mostly due to the scenic shots in anime that don’t glorify the scene it portrays and just shows the old building and walls and neighbourhoods as something normal... something lived in. The sky is almost always cloudy and gloomy further enforcing this idea that Kasuga is like a rat put in a dark maze with a very low ceiling. He does nothing but run into the maze, randomly choosing paths hoping that he will escape.

Characters






Kasuga is someone we’ve all seen and maybe interacted with in life. You know that one guy who always trash talks about book adaptations? Says that the novel was better, and thinks that reading books makes him a superior human being. Kasuga is that guy. He wants everyone to know that he reads books and therefore is someone who deserves attention. He in fact believes that if Saeki knows that he reads books she will fall for him. He also unironically shouts to his classmate “Shut up, you don’t know anything. You can’t even understand a line of the kind of literature that I consume”. He even goes into monologues in his mind reciting the lines of the book The Flowers of Evil. He is so narcissistic. He is so obsessed with The Flowers of Evil that he believes the book portrays his mind and his way of being. He even has a picture of the author in his room. If an anime fan turned pathetic is a weeaboo a bibliophile turned pathetic would be this guy. But this unkind and brutally honest portrayal of him helps us keep our objectivity  and not feel anything for him when something happens. You just see characters acting out of various emotions and don’t sympathize with them. 

The anime will be very relateable to those who have done something in school that you hope no one finds out. You know that feeling when something you’ve done in school is being talked about but no one knows that it was you who did it. That rush of adrenaline you feel. Your heart beats so much that you feel as though it touches your rib cage each time it beats. That feeling – that fight or flight feeling – has been conveyed very accurately.  

Themes And Character Motives







The entire anime can be said to portray the relationship between Kasuga and Nakamura. Both of these characters have motives that stem from the same feeling. They both think that the town that they live in is dull and boring and have an innate feeling that they we’re born to do something great and therefore don’t belong in this town. Kasuga feels as though since he has been reading books that are considered to be from a very high level of literature he is superior and the people of the town are therefore dull compared to him. He feels caged by the mountains around the town, and feels as though he can achieve his ‘superior destiny’ if he crosses the hill and gets out of the town into the ‘interesting’ outer world where people will recognize and appreciate his true value.


Nakamura on the other hand doesn’t consider herself as superior or different from the other people of the town. In fact she believes she is just the same as those around her but she just doesn’t act like others. She believes everyone is a hentai (deviant) at heart but just act so that they can fit in with society. This is why she develops an interest in Kasuga when she sees him stealing Saeki’s gym clothes. She thinks she has now witnessed a true hentai and someone who acts out of their true will. She fetishes about Kasuga being an hentai and derives pleasure from the fact that she can make someone do all the things that they actually want to do but don’t want to do because of societal constructs like morality which she believes just prevents people from being their own self and promotes false behaviour. She sees Kasuga as someone who further cements her views of the world and therefore pushes him further to be an hentai. Because in Nakamura’s mind Kasuga being more of an hentai means her worldview is more justified. So Nakamura can be seen as someone having an ideological crisis who grasps and propagates anything that reinforces their view on life and society.

This relationship is so intense and affects everyone in their life in some way or another. They are both trying to break free from society so that they can be their true selves even though in the process they both lose their sanity and peace of mind.

This anime is the most underrated anime that I have watched. I was constantly reminded of Oyasumi Punpun watching this because both share a central theme – The Loss Of Innocence. Kasuga realizes that he is not someone who he believed he was, that reading books is not something that makes you any different from other ‘dull’ people and all humans are just – in Nakamura’s words – ‘pieces of shit hentais’."

- Pei Xiu, Episode 11

Tian Guan Ci Fu is a visually impressive series that utilises elements of mystery, fantasy, and the supernatural to spin an intriguing tale within its short timeframe. 

It gently eases the audience into its fantastical setting in a way that isn't overwhelming; building on its premise over a couple of episodes. This avoids a common problem in fantasy based works while highlighting the interesting elements that might have been overlooked. Tian Guan Ci Fu paces the episodes well enough that it covers two engrossing, longer plots without them feeling too rushed. The mix between action, drama and comedy work well enough to prevent monotony in the narrative structure and the less intense episodes work well in developing the characters.

Perhaps the biggest issue with the plot is that it can become a little too reliant on exposition. While it is often played off as one of Hua Cheng's personality traits, it can be a bit overused. Tian Guan Ci Fu tries to lessen this impact by utilising a slightly more comedic tone during these moments which does work to make them less jarring to the narrative. A second issue is that, due to the genres that are being utilised, the pacing can be a little bit chaotic and some of the plot beats can be a little bit predictable.

The art style is really strong, with the scenery standing out, creating a fitting atmosphere that makes it easier to slip into the world that is being constructed. One of the biggest issues that Tian Guan Ci Fu has is its inconsistent handling of 3DCG when it is used. The more subtle uses work well, not being too distracting and allowing for some interesting camera movements that emphasise important elements of the narrative. However, when used in action scenes where several separate elements are using this method of animation, it becomes very rigid and negatively contrasts the flow of the 2D animation. This is a prominent issue in the third episode as it dampens the effect of the story and mars the tone.

When it comes to the characters themselves, there are a couple of shortfalls as many of the side characters are reduced to flatter archetypes relying on a couple of gimmicks to equal a supposedly well-rounded personality. This is especially true of Fu Yao and Nan Feng who we only get to see a surface level of. While it can be argued that there is a narrative reason for this, it means that they can become a little repetitive when they show up. Hopefully, any future episodes will do them justice. Some of the liberties that Tian Guan Ci Fu took, in regards to developing some of the character's backstories, works in its favour and makes scenes more impactful.

Overall, Tian Guan Ci Fu is a series with a lot of potential and does well to weave an intriguing story within its 11 episodes without biting off more than it can chew. Hopefully, it will keep up this momentum and improve on the weaker elements, especially the use of 3DCG, to create an impressive series."
140754,"This anime is bad.
That's the long and the short of of it. It's just bad.
Spoiler free review with some spoilers marked in spoiler boxes

Summoned to Another World for a Second Time has a simple premise: that being that this is the second time the hero Setsu has been summoned to this world. In theory, this opens up the door for a lot of depth. Perhaps the hero knows too much, and the mystery becomes how does he? Or maybe he does things differently, and uses his prior knowledge for villainy. Or what if he  just laid low and hid in the shadows waiting for the optimal time to make his triumphant return?

This anime does none of that. It doesn't even do bad time travel. Instead, there's just a 5-year time gap between the first and second times Setsu was summoned. Also, Setsu reveals himself basically immediately as the former hero and that's that. He just picks up where he left off 5 years ago. The entire premise is wasted and only exclusively as a cheap excuse to introduce characters with no depth or backstory that instantly trust Setsu because ""he met them last time he was summoned'. It's just used as a lazy hand wave to promote disgustingly bad writing and horribly cliche tropes.


So lets talk about the story:

It's terrible. It's cliche. It has zero depth. Setsu just aimlessly wanders for a bunch of episodes and then the final battle happens. That's basically it. Sure, he was ""gathering allies"", but that's really just window dressing. There is so little content that actually happens that I'm surprised they managed to stretch it out to 12 episodes. I could summarize the entire anime in one paragraph and you wouldn't miss a thing. In fact, let's try it!

!Setsu is summoned with his classmates and childhood friend to stop a war. He reveals himself to be the former hero from 5 years ago, and meets up with various allies from the last time he was summoned. He helps a young girl deliver a broach to another of his allies, Dezas the queen of the demon continent, and reunites with Levia (another ally) in the process, who follows him for the rest of the anime. While there, he saves her from the control of Toma's underling, and discovers that the war is a setup by Toma (actually he just assumes this and we roll with it). Then, leaving the continent, he runs into another ally, Alize, and her friend Amel who turns out to be one of Toma's underlings. They fight, Amel escapes, and Alize leaves. Then Amel captures Alize. Levia and Setsu then travel to the Beastman continent and, after foiling an assassination attempt by another of Toma's underlings, he makes new allies. Then, he goes to the king and his daughter (also allies), and has to fights a pointless duel with a guard that get's interrupted by Toma because he's evil and wants Setsu to be his friend. Lastly, we return to the demon continent where the war is held. There, Setsu's allies defeat all of Toma's underlings and rescue Alize, and Setsu defeats Toma and we get a stupid happy ending where Toma is rehabilitated and the classmates aside from Yuuhi go home. The end.!

That was less than 250 words and that summarized every important plot point in the show. That's just sad.

Overall, It's like they tried to write the most generic box-standard isekai plot of all time. It's legitimately hard to be more generic than this.

!Also, so many things were left unexplained or just flat out ignored. No development was given on the whole ""reincarnated back in earth"" plot point. Also, his three allies that specifically said he travelled with them last time don't travel with him again this time because... reasons? I guess they have to babysit his nameless classmates??? Among other issues.!


So, what about the characters?

The first problem is, there are too many. Almost every episode for the first like, 9ish episodes, they introduce at least one new character that Setsu allegedly met the first time around. None of these characters have any depth and most disappear basically immediately afterwards only to reappear for the final battle. The one exception is Levia, who becomes the de-facto second main character by virtue of having the second-most screentime of any character, but even she has basically nothing going for her to make her any sort of dynamic character.

It's not surprising that a short 12 episode anime has no meaningful character development, but this is exasperated by the fact that there are too many characters, so none of them even get enough screentime to do anything interesting.

!Even episode 5, which one comment described it as ""It’s the “Don’t forget about the Childhood Friend” episode."", which theoretically develops Yuuhi, ends up being nothing more than pointless filler and padding and a waste because Yuuhi has zero relevance to the story and never ends up fighting side-by-side with Setsu anyway. And she's still just as flat and one-dimensionally at the end of this episode as she is at the start.!

!The motivation of Toma, the villain, is at least like... not the standard ""I want to destroy the world because I'm evil"", and the one episode we spend on getting his backstory is probably the best episode in the anime (not a high bar to clear). But still, if Setsu did literally anything other than inexplicably ignore him completely, then we could have just avoided everything anyway. The entire plot hinges on Toma just wanting to be loved by the one person that he thought would understand him. Which, is shockingly deep for this shallow of an anime, but still, this entire anime could have been avoided if someone just gave Toma a hug.!

Animation?

Animation was average, I'd say, for a modern anime, however I want to specifically point out the fight scenes which are so bad that they look like they were choreographed by a 6 year old playing with action figures. None of the fights have any impact or weight to them, except maybe, MAYBE, the final fight.

! Bonus points to Yuuhi for casting a single fireball and suddenly rivalling Elka in power somehow.!

Can we at least like the music?

Eh, the op was a generic shounen, that reminded me of My Instant Death Ability is Overpowered but worse, and the ending was extremely out of place, hyper, and just so generic. None of the background tracks were that amazing, and in fact I don't recall any of them.

Basically, the music was dull and extremely unremarkable or memorable. But that's an opinion about music, so that's usually pretty subjective. Maybe you'll like the music."

Nyanpasu! Are you ready to repeat the whole experience of relaxation in the countryside once more? I hope you are! Repeat is another seed planted on an already wonderful garden. And it's a sequel that has flourished into a daisy symbolizing the purity and innocence shared by Non Non Biyori.

Asahigaoka. It may just be a small village, but it knows what purity is all about. Like an aromatic wave of petrichor after the pitter patters of rain, the lingering sweetness marks the cycle of pleasant experiences bounded by freshness and positivity. Many new adventures are awaiting them as the sun celebrates the time to rise and shine! For these blooming flowers, Asahigaoka is their special home. The country life is full of rejuvenating activities, and these children continue to enjoy each other's company while living in that simplistic joy. They play with the elements found in nature, from exploring the floras to gazing at the bugs. And they also interact and form new memories with one another, speaking volumes to the young and carefree nature they all have. Together alongside the nonchalant comedies, these aspects are able to produce a lighthearted spirit. It's only packed into a small circle of friendship but the expressed friendliness emits out an aura that will make anyone smile brightly. To be able to feel this much warmth, it's not everyday that you'll experience such a purified emotion. So let's cherish it. March along the path laid out by these girls. There's a soothing oasis waiting to greet us when we reach the end of the trail!

Here we go! It's time to advance forward towards that refreshing sanctuary. Feel the freshness as we walk through the lush playground. With nature bringing a bountiful supply of life and love into the village, the entire place is decorated with a verdant beauty composed of hues chosen from a rainbow-colored spectrum. This palette paints a landscape with emotional attachments. And whether it takes place in the glassy daylight or the starry night-time, just embracing the pastoral setting is enough to cause many strong feelings. You can always feel the joy as you stand on Asahigaoka's ground. It's a reminder of all the harmonious and melodic qualities found in the outside world. Similar to the wafting wind that blows gently against our cheeks, the rhythmic music balances each scene together and reflects an image with soothing effects. It's no wonder why the girls of Asahigaoka can enjoy the rural environment. Their elation taking form with childlike personalities can be seen in the opening sequence, which serves as a great set up for the happy tranquility that follows on. All these genuine smiles are a bliss worth more than a thousand words. They are the treasured experiences. Not something to be forgotten through the four seasons, but something that will always live on as the days change and grow. After all, happiness is a paradise right?

In this rural idyll, Repeat has blossomed into a daisy with its white petals and yellow disc floret. It represents the purity enveloping a warmth brought upon by the wonderful memories of Non Non Biyori. And together alongside other daisies, it will forever continue to spread its relaxation around."
857,"So what makes this different from any other hidden gems in anime? I could go on about plot, music, animation, and other details. But I rather start with how it made me feel first.

Growing up and learning about anime, is what I think is the best thing to ever happen to a developing kid. For me I was a rumbustious, wild kid, I was longing for the taste of adventure and thinking of ideas out of thin air like I was in a different world. Seeing anime was like, seeing a new look on life for me. Getting to see all the characters talk and interact with one another like I was watching from the side lines. Now you understand how I feel about anime, lets go into why I love this anime so much.

Air Gear is about the life of Itsuki Minami,""Ikki"",(also known as ""Baby Face"" and ""Lil (Little) Crow"") and his friends. The story follows their use of Air Trecks, an in-universe invention derived from inline skates. The early parts of the story carry out the introduction of characters that eventually join Ikki. (From Wiki)
!Threw out the story he fights different teams for truff/information/respect, you name it, its worth for the taking. Itsuki Minami or aka Lil Crow had the sense to taste the air current and follow it, this lead to get the idea or to find this place called Trophaeum Tower, but the way to get there is threw Sonia Road. Since he had the power to under the wins, he needs to train his power and become stronger with his gears. Sadly this didn't make it into the anime, but I still hope for the chance to see it one day come to anime. !

Why I think this anime should be at top with the great like FLCL, Chobits, and Fruit Basket is because we can all relate to it so quickly. It's about a kid who wants to go against that the worlds wants to tell you, or what the world wants to shape you. Growing up this made me so happy to see him over come so many people trying to stop him from what he believes in himself, to sore great heights and to counter the playing field is something of like power rangers. You know he can win, its just how is he going too, that what so many people love about anime. We can relate to this in such a easy manner, it just takes a little bit of work to see it in that light. Lets say, you know what you want to do for college and your about to get out of Highschool. Just like the Lil Crow he says the road, like how you see what college you want to go to. Its about how you get threw it, and meeting/Seeing the People along the way. But I think I didn't have to tell you that, for you to understand that life can be so relatable if you understand anime.

I think this brings back the 90's fashion, and color but more darker and gray. (Talking mostly about the anime, haven't read the manga sorry) How they  use 90s colors like blue, orange, lime green, yellow, but just all dark in the anime. Witch I love the style, but this could have been just due to the coloring style back then so we have no way of knowing this was done on purpose, nevertheless, one of the best coloring choices. Looking at the art style fits well during its period of time. Half-Skater, then Half-90's feeling really good, Mostly there dressed up like Delinquents, but I like to believe its something to due with the 90's. Anyway, I think this part can just explain itself to you how to relate, you can just put on the same cloths as Lil Crow and live life like he is doing now. The High road, the Winds taking him, riding life by its wings, he want to go as high as he can to be number one and I think we all can say the same. We want to be number one at something right?

It take hearts in matter of seconds if you give it the chance to let it, you must at least like some type of under dog, because that what he is. That what we are, someone who is the under dog and wants to rise up. They to claim something for there sells, and getting to the end of it no matter what it takes. To be known and respected for there achievements, that is what Air Gear teaches you. There good comedy in between, and some lewd scenes (Not too bad) I think its the best anime for someone to start anime. This is something that is not talked about more on YouTube, so I made a YouTube video about it go check it out. Thank you for reading this, much love.

Youtube Coming Soon
Here is my youtube channel to keep an update about it. [LilComfy](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComfyKing)"
114340,"Before I get to do a proper review, I would like to discuss episode 1 regardless.

Episode 1.... Well, It's both confusing and questions why is it even existing. Even my friend comment ""I pretending it doesn't even exist in the first place"". I want to talk about it,  It looks normal and fine for a first-timer or doesn't read manga/light novel, but when you get to episode 2, it becomes a mess. I am not even sure what the studio was thinking, maybe they mixed up a frame/scene? We will never know. 

Not to mention, the first episode (an only scene that was isekai) was before the 4th episode in terms of storyline, yet somehow they add new materials that didn't even exist in the manga of her life before being' isekai (unsure about Light Novel) and combine those two into the first episode.

What I think they are trying to achieve is showing that this ISEKAI (that a keyword for this show) is based on the VRMMO game that the main character played. However, if that was the case, the studio is clearly making a mistake of using the wrong design since VRMMO character and isekai character design are totally different and ep 4 is directly related to it in terms of story flow. 

What they could do is remove any scene outside of isekai, and clean it a bit then put it in episode 3 (before 4th) while any before 4 push down by 1 (3rd become 2th, 2th become 1th while originally first episode could be the third episode.) 

To keep a short summary of the first episode. ""Everything about it was weird and doesn't even make sense""
So for those who want to watch this anime smoothly, you can choose to skip the first episode, watch 2nd to 3rd, then 1st(ignoring the part where we see her outside of isekai world), then finally onward 4th to end.

I am hoping that in the BluRay version, it will be fixed. Hopefully.

Now, on to the proper review.

I haven't read Light Novel, but I did read the manga of it (up to 7-8 episodes in an Anime), One thing I can say for sure that it is normal, few contents were skipped over. If my friend is right about this, this show, 12 episodes have contained 6 volumes, which is really unusual as most average LN adaption typically do 12 ep per 3-4 volume) Which can say it is certainly rushed.  However, that doesn't matter for this as this show is entirely focused on wholesome/kindness. This reminds me of another good anime of this seasonal that I enjoy, [Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko ](https://anilist.co/anime/115740/Kamitachi-ni-Hirowareta-Otoko/). 

Unlike most typically isekai, this show only focuses on a wholesome, kind, slice of life, about the main character named Yuna who doesn't have anything to do in real life other than eating, selling/buying stock, sleep and games, It was a life of being alone. Somehow, she was transferred to the new world with a mirror of herself looks and in a bear suit that she can only use to survive in an unknown world that is filled with adventure, monster, magic, etc (her bear suit equipment help her to be strong).

Yuna eventually meets many people, and help them out while building a relationship and friend. There was a time where she doesn't need to help and let things go naturally, but she refused and went out to help. It not like she is some of a hero so to speak, it was more of ""If I happen to be there, I will do what I can do to help others""

This show has shown that showing kindness to others will return kindness back to you, and you can build up any connections without any conflicts. Given an example is when Yuna wants to do something, she tries to think of the best solution that works for both sides, so that both can have profit gain, and able to do something to improve their life. 

As I mention early, Yuna was used to living alone, with no friends, etc to the point where she thinks it is normal. However, as soon as she was transferred to another world, she was filled with a busy life, having friends, people that she can rely on. Eventually, as time goes on, she starts to understand and want to be with her certain friends as she enjoys companionship with.

I enjoy this show, as it is very rare to see wholesome isekai when they are usually filled with dark, action, power fighting, etc (Unless I haven't watched a lot...). 

Bonus: There is a lot of cute girls, so this is a bonus point.

It's not something perfect or worst, it not exactly the isekai you would be expecting off, but it's a nice show that you can enjoy having a positive aspect."

A few months ago I wrote a review. Not just any review, but a sequel to another review. That review was of Danganronpa 3: Mirai-hen, and at the end I promised to return to the Hope Side, and lay out all my remaining issues with Danganronpa 3. In all honesty, I hadn't even thought about that and wrote it moreso as a joke than anything else, but due to recent events, I have come upon inspiration that will allow me to write what will be something that will get me tons of annoying messages. 

Danganronpa 3 sucks. Just flat out going to say it, it sucks. At its best, it's a 3/10 in Mirai-hen, and at its worst it's needless fanservice for characters that aren't even remotely like their original incarnations beyond the most superficial and surface level. Despite all that, not only do these anime receive stark amounts of love, but Kibou-Hen itself receives quite a bit of good will, when really it's just a continuation of many of the flaws present across Danganronpa 3 in general.

I think fan service is a fascinating topic, as I have had or seen plenty of discussions surrounding the idea, of varying intellectual quality. The reason I bring this up is because, ultimately, the vast majority of Danganronpa 3 is just fanservice, unrelenting, annoying, fucking horrible fan service at that. What point does the Ultra Despair Girls episode serve beyond tying up a red herring in Monaca and showing off characters from said game? Why do most of the Zetsubou-hen episodes exist if not for fans of the Danganronpa 2 cast? And, to come back to a general idea, why does Kibou-hen exist if not to service Danganronpa fans? You may ask what I mean by that, and what I mean is...

Kibou-hen essentially removes any and all consequences from both Danganronpa 2 and 3. Kirigiri is dead! Oh, wait, she's alive because she got a cure in the most asinine way possible. The Danganronpa 2 cast is a bunch of vegetables! No they aren't, they fine, they're all walking around dressed up like they were three years ago in universe despite 2 stating that many of them had done horrific things to their bodies. Oh, but surely Hajime's decision at the end of 2 mattered and he has chosen a life devoid of talent because he realized it's not the most important thing, right? Right? You can see where this is going.

Now, why does all this walk backing and removal of any complex ideas actually do? It creates this safe and sterile conclusion where everyone is happy, nothing bad happened, there was no tough decisions and no consequences to follow. Hajime gets to keep all his talents and be himself, Nagito isn't dying anymore, Kirigiri came back to life, the DR2 cast have nothing to worry about since their bodies were perfectly fine! It's so... bland. It almost feels like hope is being forced upon you, like it's some attempt at a meta commentary, that this is the in universe hope video, except for the viewers. But, there's no subversion at the end of the day, no grand ""Gotcha!"", nothing. The DR2 cast gets on a boat and leaves, Mirai-hen crew just moves on, and now Naegi is the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy. Oh, but I guess Gundham has more hamsters now and that's so cute and so kawaii, this anime is perfect.

img2200(

I felt very drained the first time I saw this back when it aired, and I felt even more drained when I went to rewatch it just a few months ago. I don't get how someone can watch this and accept this conclusion. This isn't an ending, this isn't some grand culmination of all the series events, the second game is pretty much a non factor now. There were no consequences, it was all just manufactured despair that went nowhere. 

I guess the thesis statement of Danganronpa 3 could be summed up in this ending. They did not care for the prior entries, and so instead they indulge in references and showing off the characters with none of their major flaws.  I originally wanted to go through each and every character from Danganronpa 2 and discuss how 3 mishandles them, but I can show no better proof of that than this singular episode. None of the characters are handled well in just these 24 minutes of subpar animation. 

It's such a shame that the Hope's Peak Academy Arc had to end this way honestly. I don't want to hate Danganronpa, I love this series, but I can't in good faith say anything about this anime other than, ""What a waste of my time"".

136484,"Link click might be the best of chinese animation and its not hard to see why. The Emotional storylines incorporated with thriller and mystery elements not to mention the sheer unpredictability of the plot itself. 
Unlike the first season, the story enters a linear plot line, which involves our main characters entirely. With addition to giving hints on how far the abilities can go and quite possibily a teaser on where they began.

The main theme of this season happens to be domestic violence. And how it can be extreme in many cases. Considering how little it is represented in media despite being one of the most common issues in asian countries and how well a job someone rarely does with its portrayal I cant help but applaud the creators for the work they did and making it standout from a psychological prespective. From the children having psychological issues though in a non traditional way with addition to the extreme cases of murder and paranoia, it does an extremely good job.

All the characters are good standouts especially the twins. However some can be stereotypically ""mad"" as well. In addition to this, Lu guang happens to be the best of the trio this season. Considering how it was primarily focused on the twins mostly, the protagonists can take a back dive however Lu guang with his development as a character and his actions makes up for it. Season 1 was primarily focused on Cheng Xiaoshi while the main storyline(which begins in this season) happens to center around Lu guang especially considering the concluding episode.
The plot explains everything up to a satisfactory degree... How it happens and why it happens though it can become a bit hard to follow in the middle. Considering we are talking about time loops etc. But it explains it later on in case you miss it in the previous episodes so its a win either way.
All of the 12 episodes are connected however with a astounding reveal making up for another cliffhanger ig. But overall while it has some short comings since it was experimenting with some stuff(episode 9) it did a job well done overall in more ways then I can count. Link click stands out among similar storylines involving timeloops with its emotional touch and real world elements. The plot contains a sense of Alturism which is rare in many thrillers.
The art and aesthatic is beautiful overall. In terms of quality it improves from first season and the story boarding is nothing short of unique in many cases. The Music just adds to the entire thing putting a cherry on top, every score is enticing and the opening sequence being complimentary to the plot itself without containing spoilers is also pretty good. 
The last thing I will probably mention is the action. The creators definitly researched martial arts. There are several sequences and all of them are done beautifully. 
All in all A great season that ultimately sets itself for the next."
322,"EDIT: Now that I have read the manga, the anime completely botched the ending. The source is fantastic and fully realized unlike the anime's unfortunate and somewhat contradictory ending.

Paradise Kiss is a coming-of-age story that follows the journey of Yukari, a young woman who has never found her passion in life. But after being thrown into the world of fashion modeling, she finally discovers something she loves. However, this is not just a feel-good story of escapism. The show delves into the harsh realities of pursuing one's dreams, depicting the constant obstacles and struggles that come with it.

The relationships between characters, whether they be familial, friendly, or romantic, are portrayed as complex and challenging. The show does not shy away from depicting the toxic and imperfect nature of these relationships. A prime example is the relationship between Yukari and George, which is filled with uncertainty and often feels one-sided. George treats Yukari more like a sexual object than a person, while Yukari herself is still trying to understand and navigate this new adult world she has found herself in. These relationships can be seen as a representation of the difficulties and complexities that come with growing up and finding oneself in the world.

Paradise Kiss also highlights the idea that even when working towards our dreams, there will always be rough spots and difficult decisions to make. This theme is echoed in the relationships between the other characters as well, with familial and romantic ties being portrayed as complicated and messy. This story does not sugarcoat the harsh realities of life and the struggles that come with it. However, despite these obstacles, Paradise Kiss manages to capture the beauty of pursuing one's passion and the sense of fulfillment that comes with it. It is a reminder that the journey towards our dreams is never easy, but it is worth it in the end. The first 11 episodes do a fantastic job of capturing this theme and capturing the audience's attention.

Unfortunately, the final episode, which had the task of adapting the final and longest volume of the manga, falls short. Instead of giving proper development and resolution to the relationships, it relies on melodrama as a cheap substitute. This leaves the story with an unsatisfying and unfulfilling ending despite the promise of the first 11 episodes. One of the biggest disappointments was the conclusion of Yukari's character. A story all about learning to live by herself and developing her own agency ends with her missing George 10 years after the conclusion of their relationship - a pretty strong contradiction to these themes. It's a shame that the story didn't receive the justice it deserved with just a few more episodes to satisfyingly conclude all of the plot points.

Another important aspect of Paradise Kiss is the representation of Isabella, a trans woman. While she is mostly a background character throughout the series, Yazawa Ai handles her story in a sensitive and respectful way. The reveal of her identity as a trans woman comes in the 10th episode, and it is done in a way that is both heartfelt and nuanced. It is unfortunate that Isabella does not have a more prominent role throughout the series, but the moments that do focus on her are well done and a highlight of this show. However, the final episode does not do her justice, as it ends with a cliche unrequited love story between her and George. This is a common trope for LGBT+ characters in media and it is a shame that the series ends on this note.

It's worth noting that the manga source material may have handled Isabella's story differently (I am fairly certain it does), and I plan on reading the manga to see how it compares."
20448,"My first review will be about Seitokai Yakuindomo/ Season 2. This is my first review and I'm always happy about feedback! So have fun reading ^^ This review contains spoilers!


I think I don't have to answer this question, because I'm reviewing Season 2, but let's summarize: Our protagonist Takatoshi Tsuda has come to Ousai Academy (Girls' School), which now also teaches boys. There he meets the student council president Shino Amakusa, who ""forces"" him to join the student council. And so the fun begins...

Right off the bat, there is no real character development. But there is none necessary! The characters make their jokes and we laugh at them. In a comedy anime I don't expect much character development since the point is to entertain the audience. The characters are very different from each other and all of them have their own personalities. You can recognize them not only by their appearance but also by their behavior. The jokes even vary from character to character which is a positive aspect for me.

If you have a goofy sense of humor like I do, this series is really entertaining. If you're expecting well thought out and varied entertainment, I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment. There are for the most part only perverted jokes, but they are not disturbing (mostly). Quite the opposite! It is something different to the mainstream anime out there.
 !webm(https://i.imgur.com/A8Hy36h.mp4)! 
 However, I have to say that in Season 2 a lot of jokes from Season 1 + OVA's were reused and just weren't funny anymore. For example jokes about that stupid bear. (.. )

Studio GoHands did a really solid job! The animations are very good for a nonsense comedy. (For me, however, animations are not that important).

The music in the anime is very pleasant and never out of place or inappropriate. Small details were even added, such as the characters sometimes humming along with the background music. Little details like that really make it! The opening was great and I liked the ending as well. (It is of course a matter of taste)

Whoever thought this was a typical harem anime is wrong. The female characters show almost no interest in our protagonist. Except for episode 13, the harem genre has not been addressed. Personally, I would like to see a bit more harem, as you could add more variety to the jokes. But it was hinted that the sequel should go more in that direction.

12175,"Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate is an anime based off of a visual novel going by the same name. Being based off a visual novel, it’s hard to fit the plot of a 40-50 hour game to an anime that’s 12 episodes. I believe that Koichoco does an okay job fitting the plot into the time slot allocated. That being said, there are definitely problems with the anime plot, but they’re not enough to ruin it for me.

img()
Yuuki finding out he's going to run for school president, whether he likes it or not

Koichoco’s main character is Yuuki Oojima, a high schooler that gets pushed into running for president of his school after another candidate, Satsuki Shinonome, states that one of her main policy goals is to cut clubs that drain funds and have little to no achievement. Yuuki’s club, the Food Research Club, is part of the main clubs that would be cut if Satsuki wins the upcoming election. Yuuki decides to run after getting support and encouragement from the other club members. While his campaign starts out as a single-issue candidate focused on not cutting clubs (and also stating that his name is Oojima, not Ooshima), his platform expands as time goes on. As with any candidate running for any office, he faces several speed bumps and discovers how other candidates use tricks to sway favor.

Being an anime that’s mainly focused on Yuuki’s exploits with the five heroines, I’ll cut to the chase and briefly talk about all of the girls that have routes in the visual novel that the anime’s based off of:

Chisato Sumiyoshi
img()
Chisato Sumiyoshi is Yuuki’s childhood friend and the president of the Food Research Club. Chisato and Yuuki live next to each other and walk with each other to school every day. She’s very attached to Yuuki for reasons that are explained later in the anime.

Satsuki Shinonome
img()
Satsuki Shinonome is the main candidate that Yuuki’s running against. While she knows that Yuuki is running for president especially because of her, she still takes a liking to him. Her older sister is a teacher at the school and is the advisor to the club that Yuuki is in. Every time she sees him, her face noticeably lightens up from her usual stoic tone, and she walks up and calls him a nickname based on what he’s doing at the time.

Mifuyu Kiba
img()
Mifuyu Kiba is Chisato’s and Yuuki’s good friend and fellow member of the Food Research Club. Due to illness, Mifuyu is a year behind in school. Mifuyu is quite frail and is not able to push herself that much. She supports Chisato’s love for Yuuki, even though it is shown that Mifuyu has feelings for him herself.

Isara Aomi
img()
Isara Aomi is a student that’s assigned to help with Yuuki’s presidential run due to her status as a ‘financial aid student’. Due to her not being graced with generational wealth, she’s mocked for her status by those who’ll never have to work a day in their life. Her struggles influence Yuuki and the policies he pushes for. She takes a liking to Yuuki for standing up for her.

Michiru Morishita
img()
Michiru Morishita is a shy and mysterious first-year student that’s part of the Food Research Club. Not that much is known about her until the end of the anime due to things I can’t explain right now. All I can say is that she’s fond of Yuuki.

An anime like this shouldn’t be scored by its plot itself. It’s the characters that make an anime like this what it is. The characters in this anime are quite nice, especially Satsuki (in my opinion). Luckily, Koichoco’s plot isn’t total garbage. I really enjoyed watching this anime. It’s not anything ground-breaking or amazing plot-wise, but it does a great job at what it’s supposed to be; an anime based upon a visual novel."

If I could somehow give Japan Sinks: 2020 both a 2/10 and an 8/10, I would. So to that end, this will be two separate reviews. Sort of.

First that 2/10. I won't spend much time here, but the gist of it is that Japan Sinks is not good. The animation nosedives to abysmal depths as early as episode 3, the soundtrack is underwhelming and often poorly utilized, the story meanders and takes absurd tangents, and the tone is as confused as I was in the locker rooms of ninth-grade PE. There's not much, on a technical level, that I can honestly defend about this whole thing, and if you're crunched for time or just not particularly interested, I'm gonna say pass on this one. It's a bad series, and that's my honest take. You can stop reading here, if you like.

...But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy Japan Sinks. 

It starts strong enough, with a first episode that at least somewhat resembles a competent production, even if the faults already start to show: the animation is a bit stiff; the earthquake is rendered with just a bunch of still frames jittering and blurring; weird, stilted pauses jeopardize the moment-to-moment pacing. But throw in a fiercely resilient protagonist and some horrific on-screen deaths and I'm hooked enough to follow through on a second episode. That second episode is noticeably weaker, but a bombshell in the last moment drags me into episode three, where the Japanese landscape is a muddy, CG mess with cut-and-paste trees, character walk cycles average about 3 frames while the models just sorta shrink into the distance like puppets on popsicle sticks, and the gang's reactions to certain traumatic and outlandish events are both underwhelming and baffling. But in the last few minutes our protagonists are dodging arrows in a department store and I'm clutching the edge of my seat and frantically muttering at my screen for this obnoxious little kid to run for cover behind the produce shelves.

img1000()

This is where Japan Sinks both falls apart and begins to make sense. This won't be a series to make you sob over the loss of beloved characters. This won't be a series with much of anything meaningful to say about tragedy or disaster or the human spirit or whatever. It might try, but any insight here comes out ungainly and awkward. If someone tries to sell you on this show with those tags, just nod politely and look for an exit. No, Japan sinks is not Yuasa's next masterful entry to his dazzling repertoire. 

Instead, Japan Sinks is the animated equivalent of a made-for-TV, B-rated disaster flick that airs on SYFY on a Tuesday night. And in this sense, with this lens, it's an absolute ride.

That's how I began to love Japan Sinks. The plot contorts and corkscrews and often literally explodes, and it's impossible to justify some of those narrative turns beyond shrugging my shoulders and saying, ""Yeah, sure why not? They might as well join a cult in episode four."" New obstacles are ridiculous and serve mostly as theme park attractions that will inevitably dispatch a character or two and, oh boy, characters are dispatched frequently and in spectacular fashion. If nothing else, the show is a constant rollercoaster of huge set-pieces and gruesome deaths, and for some that'll be enough.

img1000()

But more than anything, and most importantly to me, Japan Sinks nails the dodgy, are-they-serious?, naively earnest B-movie vibe. This is an absurd journey told with utmost gravity. Characters make heartfelt exit-monologues before sacrificing themselves to convoluted ends. They wax poetic about the beauty of Japan. They engage in rap battles about the dangers of nationalism. Japan Sinks is starry-eyed enough to make you buy into the delusion that maybe this is a serious matter, and it's that delusion that really sells the better parts of this show, the moments where the animation gets its act together enough to deliver something unexpected and astounding; where the grating optimism of its characters wins you over because fuck, dude, they've earned it, let's give them this, at least; where you cheer for characters who just barely slip through incredible danger and salute those who didn't make it; and where the quieter moments might actually make your eyes wet, just a little. Don't get me wrong, these moments have little to do with legitimately good writing, it's just that Japan Sinks so stubbornly constructs an atmosphere that convinces me to believe in it as much and in the same way as it wants believes in itself.

It's like rooting from the sidelines of a little league baseball game: on any professional scale, these kids suck. But the bases are loaded and the little tyke at bat has an unpredictable swing and something magical just might happen.

img1000()

So no, Japan Sinks is not good. It's a show you have to meet on its own ridiculous, hokey, schlocky terms, and even then every moment of its wonky visuals and bizarre plot will warn you against stepping foot on its unsteady and crumbling ground. But if you do that, if you can overcome more than a few rupturing fault lines and look at them not so much as weaknesses but as endearingly busted gears in an inane carnival ride, then maybe you'll come to enjoy it as much as I did, despite your better judgement.

5/10, because I can't give it both a 2 and an 8 so we'll meet them in the middle."
104159,"Let's be honest. If you're here, you're one of three things.
1. You played Azur Lane and heard they had an anime adaptation
2. You're a history fanatic who wanted to see anthropomorphized ships interact with each other
3. You're both

Azur Lane brought about a very fine second wind to the shipgirl subgenre. Continuing the legacy of Kantai Collection and giving it a modern twist that has attracted millions of players on its app. However, many fans, including myself, were dismayed at the anime adaptation. As a very new person to this community, who hasn't even accumulated 5 hours on the game and only heard about this entire franchise through a chance encounter during Spring, even I was disappointed at the overall effect of this adaptation.

 Story

As I said earlier, I'm an extremely new addition to the Azur Lane community, as of such, I have no idea what the general game plot is. However, I was aware of the general gist. Humanity was attacked by alien vessels sorta like that Battleship Movie, and in response they turned their most famous battle vessels into cute anime girls. The Anime adaptation helps newer players like me clear up a lot of specifics of the system. How do these girls control these ships? Are they gijinkas of ships? Or actual humans possessed with the spirit of these ships? No, they're ships, that, through the mental cubes that were the bane of my gacha luck, become human, and they're able to convert their ship bodies into battle armor to use. Alright, understandable, frankly, that's actually a very comprehensible explanation, and I have no complaints with it. 
But that's where it sorta all goes downhill. Following generic anime timelines, they yada yada the background information so they can capitalize on it later for plot convenient flashback scenes. Suddenly, Japan  the Sakura Empire attacks! That's where the first issues I noticed came in. Most importantly, I realized that the anime really loves their Deus Ex Machinas. Belfast saving Enterprise, Enterprise saving Ayanami, we get it, animes love to flaunt their character's speed but  if it gets repetitive it really takes out of the main feeling. Second is the overall spread of the story. 6 episodes for Enterprise to figure out that she's not invincible, 3 episodes to figure out the Sakura Empire is up to something, 2 dramatic action scenes, and of which one is completely backstory fodder, and whatever's left is thrown to the fanservice machine. Anyone who's watched any show before knows that this isn't good pacing. the 6 episodes of Belfast vs Enterprise eventually feels like it drags on and on and on, while they did try to amend this by having other character interactions, like Kaga and Akagi, the Shokaku sisters, Ayanami vs Javelin and Laffey, etc. But that doesn't curb the dragging feeling. Meanwhile, the last 3 episodes are super rushed. Barely any explanations are made about Akagi's motives, Enterprise is still the Deus Ex Machina Queen, and hell, it honestly feels like we're members of the Sakura Empire in that last battle, just as confused as everyone else. 

Characters

Arguably the most anticipated part of the series, everyone, including newcomers like me knows that Azur Lane's selling point is its vast diversity of shipgirls and their quirky personalities. The Anime adaptation literally didn't do anything on it. Sure, they made sure to include cameos for the minor ships like Cleveland, but even with their main cast they struggled to make sure every character was well rounded and at least presentable as somewhat human. With their rushed attitude most of the characters were forced to stick to one central theme and crank it to 1000, which overall is a detriment to their personality and sets them as way more dull versions of their in game counterparts. On top of that, even if they spent 6 episodes fixing Enterprise's personality it overall still feels bland. All she did was realize that the ocean was scary. That's literally it, sure she's eating normal food a lot more, but in the grand scheme of things it was a very minor change. 

Even with these flaws I still found myself gradually able to like a few characters. Even if the screentime isn't representative of how well they build as a character, it still is noticeable enough for certain characters to stick out. People will most likely love the Starter Squad for their quirky personalities, the two floofy tailed carriers will still be ara ara AF, and I personally loved the Shokaku sisters. At least not all of the personalities were sunk with the adaptation



Animation

The thing about converting big badass ironclad warships into cute anime girls is that you deliberately sacrifice many great opportunities for killer animation by opting for the more conventional approach. The main appeal of warships is that they're intimidating, they kick ass, and they are the most alpha way for nations to flex their biceps. It would've been great seeing these iron giant duke it out with shells and torpedoes, but now that they're kawaii anime girls, we really just get to see them use peashooters and swords... really? Meanwhile, the CGI. It's good in some places, but bad in others, especially when these human avatars are riding on their ships in ship form and not battle body form. The animations of the ship's turrets turning and firing is really chunky and looks like something straight out of Super Mario 64. 

In all cases, the anime was a good watch. Not a great watch, but at least it isn't absolute bullcrap like others. Watch it if you're bored, watch it if you want to see shipfus, but don't watch it expecting to get something cool."
20556,"Nanana's Buried Treasure

img220()

Is one of those anime that you either hate it or you love it. It grows on you as the season kept on going. By the end I was looking for many answers. What happens next? The answer could easy be find online, but the sad truth is that the light novels have not been translated to English, so our only hope is for the future. Regardless, this is a hidden gem in all sense of the word because of the simple fact it is an Indiana jones movie.

Summary:
Nanana’s starts with the protagonist Juugo Yama arriving on the island Nanaejima to continue his study on the island many research orientated  schools. He arrives at his new home where he meets a remarkably interesting roommate. The lovely pudding loving Nana, but he soon realizes there is much more to his new roommate. 
img()
This is where his journey begins where he embarks to look for Nana’s treasure which are treasure that are hidden in ancient ruins, and they hold amazing powers. Some examples are glasses that allows the user to copy the fighting style of anyone, a lie detector, etc.
img200() img200()
!For the goal of finding the person that killed Nana. !

What it does Right:
img()
The anime is visually appealing especially when it comes to the ruins the treasure are being kept at. The premise is amazingly simple it is a treasure hunt and it fits the story and nowhere in it is 11 episodes does it feel repetitive. Personally, it kept me engage because it got me interested if the next treasure would help the protagonist come closer in keeping his promise to Nana. 

What it does wrong:
Other that Nana the other characters are kind of bland with most of them having very cliché motives especially the main character. The villain is a letdown and is only introduced much later in the season. Not to mention the anime leaves in a cliffhanger, and with little potential for a season 2 the best bet is to look up the ending if you are not able to read Japanese. 

Characters:
Juugo Yama: 
img400()
A seemingly normal protagonist at first until you realize there is more to him that meets the eye. He has a moral compass with a set of skills to match, but that is where his character stops. Throughout the series we see that he does want to help Nana, but the reason is bland and overused. His backstory not so compelling, and predictable. Overall, a carbon copy of other protagonist. 
Nanana Ryuugajou: 
img400()
The main female protagonist and the only the one that matters in my opinion. She is the one who proposed on finding the island, and the one who found the Nana treasure conveniently called after her. She is a pudding lover, gamer that stays at home, and can kick your ass if need be. She grows on you slowly, and by the end you will be shedding a single tear for her. 
Tensai Ikkyuu: 
        img400()
A detective that will put Sherlock Holmes to shame. Just a imagine a loli with the capacity to solve any case, puzzle, or any complicated problem in seconds. Not to mention she knows she is smart and is not afraid to stick in your face. You will either love her cockiness, or come to find it a little annoying because she constantly reminds you throughout the whole season, she is the greatest detective that ever lived. 

Conclusion:
As the saying says you get what you pay for, and this no more apparent in Nanana’s Buried Treasure. You get a treasure hunting anime that goes under many radars for the simple fact that it did not sell well. I am here to tell you it is worth a watch; it delivers in the aspect being visually appealing, and a somewhat interesting story. A lovable cast, but annoying at sometimes. Which all turns to a gem that needs to be experience once.

9367,"It’s the distant future, and the planet Earth has been ravaged by an extraterrestrial scourge.  Taking the appearance of giant celestial beings, The Nova show up without warning, attacking indiscriminately, leaving untold death and destruction in their wake.  The only hope humanity can offer up are an advanced futuristic military the Pandoras, teenage girls who’ve been implanted with a mysterious substance known as Stigmata that gives them superhuman powers.  Fighting by their side are Limiters, teenage boys who form bonds with them and aid them by restricting the movement of their enemies.  Together, the Pandoras and their Limiters will navigate the cold, brutal, and unforgiving battlefield known as...  Highschool life!  Yes, while humanity may be under constant bloody siege that they still don’t completely understand, what’s really important is the social minefield of the Japanese education system!  Can our heroes survive petty social climbing melodrama, love triangles and the constant attempts at murdering each other long enough to even BECOME soldiers?

When I’m researching an anime for a review, I often come across some tidbit about the production that winds up catching me off guard, but in the case of Freezing, there is nothing surprising about this show’s pedigree.  Director Takashi Watanabe might be one of the lesser known Watanabes in his field, but this is hardly surprising when you look at his resume, which(as far as his main directing duties are concerned) includes not only such stinkers as Aria the Scarlet Ammo, but fellow piece of shit battle vixen shows like Senran Kagura and two entries into the Ikki Tousen franchise.  He has done a couple of titles that MIGHT sound promising...  He directed multiple seasons of Slayers and Shakugan no Shana, two shows that I do like, even though I’ll admit their visual direction and animation was never their strong suit, and he also directed a Kino’s Journey movie that I’ve never seen, so I guess I’ll reserve judgement until I see that, but for now, his overall involvement in crappy fanservice battle girl anime is more than telling.

As much as that one Kino’s Journey movie feels like an outlier in Watanabe’s resume, Freezing feels like a huge outlier in the resume of Studio ACGT.  I’ve never talked about them before myself, probably because they haven’t taken on that many projects in the twenty years that they’ve been operating.  From what I have seen, a lot of their early work had decent budgets to work with, but still followed a minimalist style in order to both conserve money and strike a more high-brow tone.  The final project they put out in the 2000s was Monochrome Factor, an incredibly cheap looking show that promised badass action and scintillating BL content before ultimately dragging their feet on both counts, and I’m guessing that show’s failure to catch on must have been disastrous for the studio, because they went quiet for the next three years before putting out Freezing in 2011, and looking back at where the studio started, Freezing feels every bit like an attempt to modernize and rebrand the studio. 

Not only was it ACGT’s first ever real ecchi title, launched at a time where battle vixen fanservice harem titles were all the rage, but it also doesn’t really look like anything they did before...  Again, out of what I’ve seen.  I don’t know, if GR: Giant Robo or Project Blue Earth contradict anything I’m about to say, let me know.  Unless I’m missing something, Freezing was the studio’s first real attempt at merging 3D effects with otherwise traditional 2D animation, and honestly, it looks pretty good...  At first.  In the first episode, everything comes together pretty smoothly.  The two techniques complement each other exactly as they should, and the two-dimensional fight scenes between the human characters isn’t anything to write home about, but it also doesn’t appear to suffer in compensation for the more expensive stuff.  The problem is, it only looks like that at first.  They must have blown a huge chunk of their budget trying to make a good first impression, because from the second episode onwards, things just look worse, and worse, and worse. 

I guess I should clarify that the 3D effects themselves never look bad, at least not in a way that they should blame on themselves, but as the constant fighting between Pandoras wage on, the editing deteriorates to the point that they can become downright incomprehensible at times.  Those fights themselves are extremely cheap, relying way too hard on frozen panning shots of every punch, kick and slash, with an occasional cut to the character’s bare breasts as the clothing previously covering them gets shredded.  They spend a little money on that one frame of jiggliness before going right back to cheap, heavily stylized combat.  Combat against the Nova isn’t much better as both sides of the field barely move, with the Novas just sorta floating there perfectly still while firing off their lazers, and the Pandoras just shift their posture a bit and shield themselves while screaming and talking to each other.  It also doesn’t help that just about every character design in this series is bland and uninspired, from the Nova who all look the same, like they’re based on some obscure angel-based Yugioh monster, and the humans looking like the cast of every generic harem action anime ever.

At least the music kinda slaps.  The actual video part of the OP is a jumbled mess of clips from the show, making it kind of an eyesore, but Color is honestly a pretty awesome rock ballad.  Mizuhashi Mai has always been a popular choice for anime soundtracks due to her strong voice and impressive vocal range.  She had done a few projects prior to this, but Freezing was the first anime she performed a theme for under the name Maria, which she’s been using ever since.  She goes hard in this song, and the rock’n’roll inspired instrumentals do not let her down.  The ending theme uses a lot of synths and autotune, and I usually don’t like that kind of thing, but it’s used to a pretty catchy effect, all things considered.  The soundtrack over-all is pretty solid, with intense rock numbers standing as the only good thing about the fight scenes, and the occasional somber tune almost managing to wring emotion out of the one or two scenes that deal with the lingering trauma of past battles against the Nova.  The english dub is also pretty good, although that should be expected out of Funimation at this point, they’ve always been weirdly good at recording amazing dubs for fanservice shows.  No real standouts, most actors are immediately recognizable, putting in the top tier efforts that we’ve come to expect from them.

And speaking of top tier efforts, I finally managed to get through this series!  My first attempt to watch Freezing took place back in 2012, at the recommendation of a friend, and I wound up dropping it after only two episodes for being a thoroughly unpleasant experience.  What I remember most clearly from that time was how uncomfortable I felt watching the lead female go around brutally murdering her female classmates as part of some placement exam, these scenes being interspersed with long, convoluted exposition drops.  I don’t know, maybe I was interpreting things wrong, but there was footage of students participating in the exam being cared for in massive numbers in hospital beds, while there was some dialogue about not wanting any casualties this year, and then Bridget just callously slashes open somebody’s throat.  I’m not generally turned off by gore and violence, but we’re talking about a main character...  A fucking protagonist...  Building up an unnecessary body count, in a show full of bouncing boobies and an extraterrestrial threat that they SHOULD be killing, rather than each other.  Something about how morally and logically questionable the bloodshed was, and how it clashed with the show’s attempts to be sexually appealing, made my stomach fucking churn.

And then things got worse because not only were all of Bridget’s apparent kills never addressed, but the lead male enters the picture, and nothing he did made any fucking sense.  Something about this blonde girl reminds him of his dead brunette sister?  Tackle hug now and ask questions later!  People tell you explicitly she hates being touched?  Repeatedly grab her wrist and restrain her against her will so you can make absolutely sure she knows how sorry you are!  Somebody tells you she has social issues?  Get mad at them for bad mouthing someone they know who you just met!  Even though that is a very real thing that somebody could warn you about someone else, for very damn good reasons!  Fuck this guy, I wanted to tear off his nuts and feed them to my garbage disposal.  Also suddenly Bridget’s wearing glasses, and considering I had already identified her as a herald of sexualized violence, adding the meganekko fetish to her just felt like a bridge too far.  So I dropped this show, and I spent ten long years avoiding it, until just this year, when I realized I needed a Christmas themed anime to review.  I don’t feel like doing the Haruhi movie, and I figured nobody would click on a review of Itsudatte My Santa or Love Hina Christmas, so how about an anime whose title directly references the winter storm that we’re all trying to survive?  Freezing it is!

Approaching this show a second time, it’s just as uncomfortable and abrasive as I remember.  The first two episodes pissed me off just as much as I remember, and the third episode actually made things worse, with a scene where Bridget is pinned to the ground and violated when a rival Pandora pulls her panties down and gets three boys to take pictures of her exposed body.  Thankfully, this is the peak of Freezing’s awfulness, as the show mostly just gets boring and stupid after that.  Oh, that’s not to say it gets easier to watch, it just stopped pissing me off.  Or at least not as often.  I should pause right now to clarify that I don’t have an issue with anime nudity...  In fact, as I’ve mentioned in previous reviews, I’m a fan, I really appreciate when an anime has the courage to show breasts exposed nipples.  I’m grateful the bath scenes aren’t obscured by steam, and that when a character’s top is ripped open, there isn’t some stray, strategically placed shred of fabric left behind.  Unfortunately, I also appreciate variety.  With the exception of one or two flat-chested girls(by anime logic at least) all the tits in this show look exactly the same, and their presentation is also repetitive.  There’s one girl who likes to skinny-dip, which I guess is kinda refreshing, but everyone else either showers in a couple of panning shots, or gets their shirts ripped open, rinse and repeat.  The nudity honestly gets dull really quickly.

None of this bullshit makes any sense, and I’m not sure where to start explaining why.  I guess I’ll start with the obvious question, why does all this take place in a high school?  I’m willing to buy magical teenagers being trained as weapons to defend mankind against an imminent threat, but why are they doing this in high school?  What exactly are they learning there?  Every time we see anybody in class, it’s so the teachers can deliver expositio to the audience, in the form of basic information that nobody on campus should have a good excuse to not already know.  All of this hierarchy and love triangle drama feels so insultingly pointless in the grand scheme of things, because the Nova threat should logically feel like an ominous threat looming in the distance, but no, they feel like an afterthought at the best of times.  I’m not even sure what the point of limiters is.  It’s possible that this is entirely my own fault, as I found trouble paying attention to this series at times, but I don’t remember any instance of limiters participating in battle against Novas.  I only remember them helping out in Pandora vs. Pandora fights, which it turns out aren’t actually allowed on campus anyway!  How the hell is a fucking high school supposed to work in this situation?

Yeah, the pilots from Evangelion went to school, but that was separate from their piloting duties.  They spent time in a government facility, training and being tested, so they could defend humanity if called upon.  The Angels are a constant threat in that show, as they should be.  Hell, even Strike Witches does this scenario right, as the girls live on a military base to train and improve their skills, and like the angels, the Neuroi are always a constant premise.  In both of those anime, there’s a ton of conflict between the soldiers, but it’s always for understandable reasons, it’s considered a serious problem when they get in the way of combat, and none of their conflict ever feels superfluous.  In Freezing, I see these futuristic sci-fi soldiers back-stabbing each other and jockeying for power and status, fighting over their love interests and flat out attempting to humiliate and murder one another, and I keep wanting to step in and tell them all to shut the fuck up and at least act like they give a shit about protecting humanity.

There’s also an issue with sexism, but I don’t feel qualified to discuss that myself, so I’ve decided to leave you with the words of my biggest inspiration as an anime reviewer, Jesuotaku.  Just remember, every word he says about Ikki Tousen here applies equally to Freezing.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uC94-eD8dQ&t=10s)

As long as we’re going with that comparison, there is one way I think Freezing is actually quite a bit worse than Ikki Tousen, and that’s that it never lets you have any fun.  That’s not to say I have fun watching Ikki Tousen, but at least I feel like I have the option, because while it does try to have a serious plot, Ikki Tousen knows that it’s silly cheesecake, and it leaves room for the audience to not always take it seriously.  With Freezing, everything it does is dead ass serious.  Even when characters are kicking each other’s clothing to shreds, the tone of the material never wavers, never drops any of the tension.  It wants you to feel like these ladies are fighting for their lives, blood splashing through the air while their bare boobs jiggle in the background.  There’s a scene where the boring male protagonist goes into the boring female protagonist’s room, almost reads her diary, only to be caught by said female stepping out of the shower in a towel.  She lunges for her diary, her towel falls, she lands on top of them, it’s nothing short of classic ecchi harem comedy, except it isn’t presented comedically.  This is a serious moment in the development between them.  I am not fucking kidding. 

Before I wrap this up, I should probably address a few key elements of the series that I couldn’t find an appropriate spot to mention until now, that people might be curious to hear my thoughts on.  First off, there’s the fact that in order for a Limiter and a Padora to bond, they have to have sex.  I don’t think this is ever explicitly stated out loud in the series, only hinted at a few times, but that’s probably because harem anime always dance around the idea of characters fucking for real, in order to preserve some illusion of chastity so the basement dwellers in the audience don’t lose interest in them.  This idea raises a ton of questions that I don’t really feel like listing out, but I think it could have worked if the series thought it out a little better.  Another contentious element is Bridget’s backstory, AKA the reason she’s called Untouchable even though she gets her ass kicked a lot.  I’m not going to spoil exactly what happened to her, your mileage will vary based on how well you’re able to take abuse-related backstories, but for me, it felt a bit lazy.  If someone were to tell that story in a Reddit thread, I’d be more than a bit skeptical.  And as far as Bridget and Kazuya as a couple are concerned, the only thing I find interesting about them is the fact that the animators couldn’t seem to decide which one of them was taller.

Freezing is available from Funimation.  There’s a second season named Freezing Vibration, also from Funimation, and they each contain their own 6 episode OVA.  Both titles are currently available for cheap from the Rightstuf holiday sale, as well as various other sources.  The original manga is available stateside from Seven Seas Entertainment.

I’m sorry, I tried to give this series a fair shot, but there is nothing about it that works.  Freezing is the perfect example of an anime that attempts to be mature from a place of immaturity.  I’m not saying an anime can’t be sexy and violent without slipping into sexualized violence, in fact, lots of anime have done exactly that, it’s not a difficult balance to find, just look how well Berserk handled things...  Well, the series, anyway.  I don’t know whether to call this Ikki Tousen without the self-awareness, or the twelve-episode version of Master of Martial Hearts, but either one of those titles would fit beautifully with this pathetic, sophomoric attempt at gritty edgelord nonsense.  Out of a massive cast of characters, nobody’s motivations made any sense, I didn’t find anybody sympathetic or relatable, and aside from the music and the English dub, I really didn't find anything enjoyable in it.  I dropped this show ten long years ago, and I should have just left it on the ground.

I give Freezing a 1/10."
5258,"Second to last season of Ippo before I have to join the unbearable collective wait for a season 4 but I'll have a truckload of tomes to catch up after.
And if until now I thought that the summit of the manga was the Mashiba vs Kimura fight which still puts me under hypnosis when I talk about it this season has a final that can easily compete with this fight but this is my biggest cartridge from the beginning and it's never recommended at school.

Artistically there's one thing I appreciate is that they kept the design of the manga in 1990 which is very retro and goes very well with modern animation, when I see anime like Devilman Crybaby or Dororo (excellent anime, no worries there) which modernizes the chara-design which is extremely retro, it reassures me that there are still recent anime which keep this retro design like Yasuhiro Imagawa does for example on his mecha anime.
Otherwise to come back on the subject it's always a visual killer Madhouse obliges, the passage to digital makes even more justice to the work of Morikawa with better effects of light and shaking camera during the big shots, I prefer season 1 because of the OST, after 76 episodes where you can hear Yuuzora No Kami Hikouki during the emotional parts of the show, it's a beautiful song, tell me otherwise or Under Star during the shonen parts, it's hard to go on with something else, it's still a good ost and Hiekireki is a great opening (the best one for the moment because I'm waiting to see Rising's opening), but it's hard to get out of the habit.

Scenaristically I think this is the season that made me laugh the most, the double episode at the beach with its ghostly curse and giant sea cockroach craziness and the pre-fight against Hawk where Aoki has his eyebrows shaved off and looks strangely like Giovanni in Pokémon made me piss with laughter, not to mention the last two episodes with the absolutely awesome comic dad, but it's not a secret that Ippo makes me howl with laughter it's the case since season 1, also noted the appearance of a new character in the club in the presence of Manabu Itagaki a very nice addition because although in the background he contrasts with the eccentric and stupid personality of the trio Aoki/Kimura/Takamura by being better off in terms of IQ, on the other hand of the strong and serious moment there is here it goes crescendo: first of all the return of Miyata and Kimura on the ring, and I would even say finally concerning Miyata because for the moment I find the character rather discreet and I am quite happy that he comes back to fight.
Then comes the return of the fanboy of Ippo Yamada whose physical change is as funny as spectacular but it allows to deal with underdogs in the world of boxing, and the stakes that there is behind in this case because it is to break the face of a guy who admires you and that you have trained, and the stakes are felt well with Ippo who tries to finish as soon as possible but Yamada gets up so how to do to knock him out. O quickly but without having too many regrets? then even to have made this minor character come back with such a radical physical change and to give him the spotlight was quite audacious as Eiichiro Oda didn't invent anything with Cobby.
But of course, but of course the main part of the season is after that, it's Hawk the first real villain of Ippo, because if until now Morikawa humanized his characters to make them non-manichean here it's not the case, Hawk is a human purge as we love to hate them: Provocative, reducing Japanese women to pieces of meat and his favorite dish, threatening Japan to fornicate all their women to bring them his superior American genes and I just caught that it is the first American of Ippo and the first treated in this way, Morikawa would he be as hateful of America as Hideaki Anno? And on top of that he slaps Genji in the face, this character is an infamy that we are just waiting for the match to see him get beaten up and even if he is the only character treated like that I love this kind of villain a la Freezer where he is just the absolute evil to be shot on the spot and that gives a crazy rage to the protagonist.
Moreover before and after the introduction of Hawk we have a long phase on his extreme dryness, point mentioned in season 1 but this time fully exploited with the complications that it provides, because for the anecdote the dryness of Takamura is perfectly feasible in real life it's just extremely hard morally and I really appreciated this mini-arc of character and the way it is treated although it's hard to see Takamura with the zombified face but it only confirms the richness of the portrayal of the world of boxing in this manga.
Then comes the fight Takamura vs Hawk, THE FIGHT, the unpredictable fighting style of Hawk, Takamura who literally flips out and goes into Ultra Instinct mode 8 years before it exists, the animation of the fight fluid and nervous with the most devastating punches that there was so far, the public who is 100% on the side of Takamura and who waits like the spectator for Hawk to eat his teeth, this fight is just incredible so I could say if it's better or equal to Kimura vs Mashiba because one is crazy in its preparation and its antagonist and the other one is the enhancement of a comic-relief in serious business mode and the challenge of the other side, I'll have to digest a long time before I decide.

This season 2 is just as good approaching new or already mentioned aspects with a better and better animation and a fight among the most striking and intense of the sport manga or even of the manga itself, in any case the more I advance in this long adventure the more Ippo rises a way in my top manga."

Contrary to what you might think of this anime based on the title alone, A Galaxy Next Door is not about a literal galaxy that can be accessed with a portal next door. (Although there’s an idea for a manga if anyone feels like it) 
It’s actually a wholesome anime with a fairly fluffy romance in center stage and heartwarming sibling relationships. Even if it's mostly a thin layer that doesn't really strike your heart deep. 

The three Kuga siblings live in a townhouse (I don’t recall if they managed it too or were just tenants, but I think they did), without their parents. The eldest, Ichiro, is a mangaka who works at home, taking care of his kid sister Machi and brother Fumio. They live peacefully, until one day, Ichiro’s new assistant arrives: Goshiki Shiori. 
Shiori is a little strange, from her awe at small things to the way she says “lovely!/suteki!” when she likes something. Even so, she’s skilled, with a pleasant, cheerful demeanor. The Kugas take an instant liking to her, Machi and Fumio especially. 

A coincidence, accident, and misunderstanding later…it seems that Ichiro's inadvertently got them stuck in a betrothal pact. 
Shiori ends up moving into the townhouse as a new tenant, and the two of them are now figuring out how things will be from then on. 
It's pretty mundane, honestly. If you were hoping for a deep story, you won't be getting one here.

Got a clue of what it’s like yet? 


Every time I think of words to describe this anime, “cute”, “sweet”, and “wholesome” are the first ones to come to mind. I feel like I tend to underline this whenever I talk about A Galaxy Next Door. (which…isn't all that often, mostly after I finish an episode and it's on my mind) 

Most of my enjoyment might be biased since I felt that I could relate to some of it. Being able to relate makes the watching experience more engaging for me. (Not that I relate super often…) cough cough anyway

As I mentioned before, this show isn't one that's really thought through. However, I feel that the simplicity might be a good thing; sometimes you just wanna unwind and watch something that makes you go ""aw, that's sweet"" without thinking too hard about it later, y'know? 
Good and bad sides to everything. 

The siblings were heartwarming. I’m not just talking about Machi and Fumio–although their interactions are definitely cute–but all three of them. Ichiro seems to be quite a handful of years older than Machi, while she and Fumio are close in age. But they’re still close, even with this age gap. Ichiro always works his hardest at his job, making sure his younger sister and brother can live comfortably and happily. Meanwhile, Machi tries to hide it, but she worries for her big brother sometimes. Fumio is just plain adorable, and while he seems rather young, based on how he speaks, he also cares for his older sister and brother. 
Especially in episode 12, when 
! Fumio purposely invited Ichiro to play and wanted to play with his older brother, thinking that Machi had turned down her friends' invitations to go play to hang with him. 
I find this really endearing of him, definitely amped up his cuteness levels for me. ! 
Honestly… I think I might like Fumio cause he reminds me of my own younger brother, back when we were kids around that age

The opening music was decent, I let it play instead of skipping like I do with most anime. Around the final episode, I decided to download it. The lyrics seem to match the show pretty well…didn't give the ending music a listen though, I ended up skipping it. 

The art style was nice to look at. Shiori is pretty, and the two younger Kuga siblings look cute. (Though that might be the little kid effect)


If you’ve read the other reviews on this, you can probably tell that most people don’t think very highly of A Galaxy Next Door, describing it with words like ""mediocre"".
When thinking about it as a whole and from a more “professional” point of view…this might be the case. 
I’ll be honest; I was so wrapped up in my positive opinions and thoughts that I didn’t really think too hard about the flaws until I read the other reviews. (Guess my positive outlook on just about everything and my habit of looking on the bright side are starting to become a problem, huh?) 
Some of the views I had to disagree with…others, I couldn’t quite defend. 

I can’t lie, when thinking of the highlights of this season, A Galaxy Next Door didn’t come to mind. I didn’t give it much thought unless I was currently watching an episode, just finished watching an episode, or looking through my tabs thinking about what I’ll watch. As cute and sweet as it was…this show doesn’t leave a lasting aftertaste, pleasant or otherwise. 
It doesn’t really have a particularly special quirk, other than being one of the few that reminds me of, well, I’ll let you wonder. 
From most viewers’ perspectives, this is just another romance anime. 
The one thing that may or may not have made it different sadly did not feel fresh to the mind (I feel as if the “stuck in an arranged marriage” or “accidentally in an arranged marriage” thing isn’t very new) and overall, didn’t stand out that much. 
Shiori’s mysterious upbringing and such could’ve been left out of it, too. It didn’t really have much effect on the show. 
In fact, we could throw out everything that makes the word  “galaxy” in the title and turn it into realistic fiction, a slice-of-life romance sort of show. It wouldn’t change much; it actually might make it more popular with viewers. 

Now, here’s a random thought: was it too easy for them to fall in love? 
I feel like there could’ve been more obstacles other than Shiori’s parents disapproving in the later episodes. (10-12 in particular, if I recall correctly) 

There could’ve been more character development as well…Ichiro and Shiori are pretty much the same people they were before at the end. The only difference was that they were head over heels for each other. 

All in all, I can’t disagree with some opinions others brought up, but at the same time, I enjoyed watching A Galaxy Next Door. Even if there wasn’t really any intense hype or excitement. 
This show just can’t shine when next to some other greatness airing in the season. 
Things may have turned out better for it if it picked a different time to air…


Honestly?
I think it’s not a priority. 
I would insist you watch some other really good romances out there first unless you’ve already seen them. 
there’s really only like one person out there who I'm being pushy with and pressuring to watch…you know who you are

Given how most people feel about this, I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re new to romance anime and looking to try out the genre since it might make you dislike the category altogether. 
If you just feel like adding another one to your belt, go ahead. 

What can you expect if you do watch? 

- endearing moments that you’d really only rave about until you’ve cleared your mind
- some cute SoL that doesn’t make you think too hard
- adorable kids (no, I’m not “one of those people”, I just happen to think they’re cute okay, no more than a kitten or something)
- mostly style but not much substance

Time to get this over with, I have stuff to catch up on. 
Sorry if I brought up your hopes too high and disappointed you, mutuals"
20553,"One day, out of nowhere, the world fell under attack.  Appearing suddenly, an alien force known only as The Abyssals emerged from the depths of the ocean to become a scourge upon humanity, attacking from both above and below.  In response to this, humanity launched the deadliest force they could possibly counter with...  Teenage girls with the souls of Japanese war ships inside of them.  Might not seem like much, but at least if one gets shot down, you don’t lose an entire crew.  Anyway, these girls, known as “Fleet girls,” use magically augmented military and naval technology to battle the Abyssals up close and personal!  Our story begins when Fubuki, a rookie Destroyer type vessel, joins up with the Third Torpedo squadron, and despite her lack of experience, she vows to become as useful and talented as one of her senpais, the one who saved her life, and whose name I don’t remember.  It’s a deadly battle between the Fleet Girls and The Abyssals, and we’ll just have to sea who prevails.

Kancolle, which is short for Kantai Collection, was produced by a studio called Doimedea, whose output I haven’t seen very much of, but the quality of what I have seen has been...  Mixed, so far.  Squidgirl, for example, was a really good looking anime.  Fuuka and Shobitch were not.  And I’m just going to put this out there, there is a special place in hell for the studio who produced Kodomo no Jikan.  Kancolle, for better or worse, is somewhere in the middle of all of this.  For the most part, it’s fair to say it’s a pretty good looking show.  Outside of battle scenes, the animation is conservative enough to save money, but confident enough to still flaunt what money they’re spending at any given time.  There’s a lot of dialogue in these scenes, so there are long stretches of time where a characters’ mouth will move but their body will still freeze under the lip flaps, which isn’t that big of a problem because these scenes are often very well lit and edited.

The downside, however, is the action.  I’m not going to pretend these fight scenes aren’t well choreographed and planned out, which they were, but the animation style for these scenes is notably inconsistent.  I’m going to be making a lot of references to Strike Witches in this review, which is largely inevitable for reasons I’m going to go into later, and in early Strike Witches, when the witches fought, they were animated in 3D in the distance, and 2-D whenever we saw them up close, but Kancolle doesn’t bother with this.  When characters are out on the sea, either fighting or about to fight, they’re sometimes in 2D, sometimes 3D, with little to no rhyme or reason inbetween, and it changes from shot to shot.  It almost feels like, whenever the ocean or other characters are in the shot, THEN the characters are in 3D, but when they're in closeup, then they appear in 2D, and while I do generally have a soft spot for anime characters moving in CGI, it just looks unforgiveably uncanny here.

The other downside is the character designs, and that extends to both the Fleet Girls and the Abyssals.  For the most part, I guess any individual character from the heroic side of the equation doesn’t look too bad, but when you see them all together, you see an absolute dearth of variety.  I felt hard-pressed to tell a lot of these characters apart, with the exception of a handful of garishly over-designed characters like SPNATI veteran Shimakaze, and a tiny group that I can only assume were created to be the lolicon clique.  A lot of the characters dress the same, combining traditional Japanese attire with ship parts for some reason sticking out of their bodies, and you can usually find multiple characters at once wearing similar outfits, which only adds to the confusion.  As for the bad guys, you rarely ever get a GOOD glimpse of the female humanoids controlling the Abyssals, but they look fairly derivative, and the minions that they send out against the Fleet Girls look like the love children of Bullet Bill and a Sharpedo.

The English dub was a funimation effort, and in an extremely unusual twist for me, I don’t really have anything to say about very many of their performances.  You have pretty much the majority of the Funimation stable, from less common names to industry veterans, but when it’s already hard to tell the characters apart, it’s equally hard to appreciate any of their individual performances.  Everyone does their jobs well, turning in adequate performances, trying their hardest to elevate the shallow material for their shallow characters.  I guess the only real standout to me is Cherami Leigh, whose character has the emotional range for the actor’s actual talent to shine through, giving her a chance to prove her own abilities outside of just filling her role.  She plays the main character’s best friend, which is a little ironic since back in Strike Witches, she was the one who played the protagonist, so it does kinda feel like she’s passing the torch to Felecia Angelle.  It’s a good dub, I just can’t think of anything particularly remarkable about it.  I guess it’s interesting to note that the original Japanese version retained the entire cast from the game the series was based on.

Yes, this series is based on a game, which means that even before I can talk about my thoughts on the series proper, we have some significant baggage to unpack.  First off, when a piece of media like a movie or a series is based on a video game, that is almost always a good cause for worry, save for a few very recent exceptions like HBO’s The Last of Us and the recent Mario and Sonic movies.  I’m also partial to Silent Hill.  As for Kancolle, I have no experience with the games whatsoever, but from what I hear, it started out as a free-to-play browser game that was exclusive to Japan, and it used Gacha mechanics...  Which I’ve come to understand means you randomly collect characters in order to use them in Gameplay.  I’m pretty sure this is also how Genshin Impact works, right?  I’ve heard stories about people bankrupting themselves and/or their parents by playing Gacha games, but apparently Kancolle lets you do this for free?  I honestly have no idea, I barely care enough about this show’s source material to do the slightest bit of cursory research on it.  I basically skimmed Wikipedia.

So yeah, in Kancolle, you collect teenage waifus that are based on historic war ships in order to do battle against other players, and in 2015, they made an anime out of it.  From what little I’ve learned, the game doesn’t have a whole lot of lore behind it...  You don’t know what the world was like before the Abyssals attacked, or how the Fleet Girls came to be, and I’m guessing the gacha girls also don’t have the most defined identities or backstories, and while you would think an anime adaptation would be the perfect place to finally develop all of these details, they really don’t, which is ultimately how I would summarize all of the major problems with this series.  Well, before I get into all that, there is one other thing I would like to point out about this franchise...  It’s about teenage girl waifus who personify war vessels battling monochromatic, monstrous aliens over the sea.  It came into existence in 2013.  I wouldn’t go as far as to say it was a direct rip-off of Strike Witches, but there had to be some influence there, so just like in my review of Vividred Operation, I’m going to be occasionally mentioning Strike Witches, making comparisons where I have to, you have been warned.

First of all, there are way too many characters in this show, and the early episodes do a flat out terrible job introducing them.  We’re introduced to the team through a rookie named Fubuki, who is a humble, friendly, fucking boring blank slate of a borderline Mary-Sue who has no backstory whatsoever.  Yeah, remember in Strike Witches, how we spent two entire episodes with Yoshika, one detailing her personality and life at home, and another showing her bonding with Sakamoto and adapting to life on a warship, before she officially joined the team?  We don’t get anything like that with Fubuki, who never goes through any conflict other than her own self-doubt and training, and never develops a complex relationship or unique dynamic with anyone.  There are characters she looks up to, characters she befriends, and characters she cautiously avoids, and that’s it.  There’s nobody really interesting beyond her, either, just repetitive character designs that occasionally have some kind of shallow gimmick attached.  Like, there’s one character who mentions a couple times that she likes the night time, and fighting at night, but at no point is it ever revealed WHY.  What does she like about night time?  What advantages does battling at night gain her?  If she loves fighting at night so much, why is she active during the day?  Shouldn’t she be a night owl, or are they not going to push this concept as far as Strike Witches did with Sanya?

I have seen this series three times, and yet, I only have five characters' names memorized.  I know Fubuki, Yuudachi, Sendai, Shimakaze because she’s also in SPNATI, and Ro-500 because she’s a popular MMD model.  And Ro-500 isn’t even in this series!  There’s little to no focus on character development in the first half of the series, and with so many characters having barely distinct designs, I found myself saying “Who the fuck are you?”  to speaking characters multiple times an episode.  I still don’t know what actual significance half of the cast was supposed to have in the story, as most of them could have been cut completely and not been missed, at least not by anybody who was unfamiliar with the game.  Bringing up Strike Witches again, that show didn’t have a small cast either, but they resolved that issue by pairing the cast off into units of two so while one character was being explored in their own episode, their counterpart could also be explored through their unique dynamic with each other.  In Kancolle, I can’t imagine anybody going into the series blindly without getting overwhelmed by its bloated cast.

The lack of lore is also a problem, as this entire concept doesn’t make any sense, and now that that concept is being represented by a full series, that’s something you have to think about.  Yeah, you could have ignored all of this when you were just playing waifu cards against each other, but now that we have a story and plot, those chickens have come home to roost.  I have so many fucking questions about the world this series takes place in, and if any of them were answered, I must have fallen asleep through that part.  Where did the Fleet Girls come from?  Did they come into existence before that Abyssals attacked, or were they created in response to it?  How does one become a Fleet Girl?  How does that power manifest, and how is it discovered?  If a Fleet Girl can shoot an arrow that becomes a tiny airplane piloted by a little Chibi homunculus, why does she have to have perfect stance and aim when firing?  Wouldn’t it be up to the pilot to aim?  Why do some of these warplanes start out as arrows, when the ones launched by grenade launchers start out as little planes? 

How do upgrades happen?  If Fleet Girls are able to receive upgrades that completely change their appearances, does that mean they’re not actually human?  Are these girls cyborgs, or were they created in a lab to be used as weapons?  Why is it that at no point in the series do we actually see real people who aren’t Fleet Girls?  What kind of relationship do Fleet Girls have with non warship people?  Is there any kind of prejudice against them?  Is there any friction between them and traditional military people?  Is the battle only going on in one area, or are the Abyssals attacking all over the world?  What kind of relationship do different Fleets across the planet have with each other?  Is there ever competition between them?  How exactly has the existence of the Abyssals affected the current culture of humanity?  Has mankind been pushed to the brink by constant alien assault, or do the Fleet Girls pretty much have things under control?  If any of these questions WERE answered, either in the anime or somewhere else in the franchise, please tell me.

Of course, I am assuming a lot of these issues tie directly into the game.  There are a ton of characters because, of course, the game has to have a ton of characters that you can win through the Gacha mechanic.  There’s a metric fuckton of them, so giving them each unique identities and backstories probably just sounds superfluous.  A lot of them look similar because they were designed to appeal to players who have a specific taste to cater to.  A bunch of characters wear similar outfits to suit collectors who would naturally want to track them all down.  Upgrades are probably some kind of Pokemon-like evolution mechanic.  And of course, unless there’s some kind of victory cutscenes with narration attached, you don’t need to know jack shit about the outside world.  I’ve never played the game, and I COULD play devil’s advocate on all of this in regard to said game, but you know what?  Just because a series is based on a game that doesn’t have a lot in the way of story and character doesn’t mean the adaptation can’t put in the effort to fill in the blanks.  Just look at what Arcane did with League of Legends.  I’ve never played that game either, but I have no inconvenient questions nagging at me when I watch that show, and it does make me kinda want to check out the game someday.

But even taking all of that aside, the Kancolle anime is just really badly written.  One of it’s biggest sins, hell, probably THE biggest sin, is what happens in episode 3, so consider the rest of this paragraph a half-spoiler warning.  There’s a major character death in episode 3.  I’m not gonna say who, but it really only affects one other character.  That character deals with her grief in the following episode, and then she only brings it up a few times in later episodes, while everyone else moves on.  Now, I have no military experience whatsoever, so for all I know, maybe that’s just the reality of the situation.  Maybe losing your teammates and friends is something you just get used to after a while, I don’t know.  But what I do know is, that’s not what I want for a story.  When a character dies...  Not even a main character, just a member of the main character’s team...  I want it to be one of the most important moments of the story.  I want it to leave a fucking impact.  I don’t want to be sitting there bored through a terrible Curry-contest episode suddenly thinking “Wait, didn’t somebody die three episodes ago?”

And even then, as much as I want to care about that dead character, I can’t stop reminding myself that the only reason I’ve been given to care about her is that another character made some vaguely potentially romantic overtures at her, despite being her ‘sister ship,’ whatever the fuck that means, at the end of an episode where a bunch of girls were blushingly throwing around “I love you” declarations to each other despite in some cases knowing each other for less than a week, and while every single one of those exchanges was TOTALLY PLATONIC YOU GUYS, DON”T WORRY, YOUR WAIFUS ARE STILL PERFECTLY AVAILABLE TO YOU SO YOU CAN KEEP BUYING THEIR MERCH, FAPPING TO THEIR RULE34 FANART AND HUMPING THEIR BODY PILLOWS WITHOUT FEELING GUILTY ABOUT IT, the one character who might have been actually romantically pursued is the one who died faster than you can say “Bury your gays.”

I’d like to think that I’ve made a lot of progress as a critic over the years.  I used to be the kind of person who thought there was an objective good and an objective bad in media, yes, I used to be really cringe like that, but especially since coming out of retirement in 2021, I’d like to think I’ve gotten a lot better at understanding what people see in anime and movies that I dislike.  Still, I’m not perfect, and there have been pieces of media that I found so terrible that I couldn’t see their popularity as anything other than an elaborate prank.  There’s the movie Pitch Perfect.  There’s the cult hit Librarian franchise.  And up until just now, there was Kancolle.  Throughout my first two viewings of the series, I couldn’t for the life of me understand why it was so popular, until just this week, when I found out it was based on a gacha game.  Now I kinda get it.  People prefer this over Strike Witches for the same reason people prefer Idolmaster’s anime over Love Live...  While one may be a better series on its own, the other is catering to an already massive pre-existing fanbase of a popular game.  And that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that on its own merits, this anime has nothing to offer.

Kancolle is available from Funimation, with season 2 being available for streaming on Crunchyroll, where season 1 is for some reason listed as season 3.  The original game franchise is not available stateside, nor is the movie, or even the manga.

It is entirely possible that, if I had prior experience with the source material, I would have a more positive opinion on this anime.  I mean, there are a lot of issues with the movie Serenity, but I still love it purely because I’m a huge fan of the Firefly series that preceded it.  Fandom can skew or even outright change a person’s perception towards a piece of media, but I can only review Kancolle from my perspective as a newcomer to the franchise, and from that perspective, this series is just terrible.  Each episode is a slog to get through, because I don’t know any of the characters well enough to like or care about them, and I don’t know enough about the world around them or actual status of the war to find any engagement in the story.  Without anything or anyone in the story that’s worth grabbing onto, the series is a chore to get through.  The animation was good for the most part, but that’s really the only positive thing I can say about it.  I have nothing against anybody who loves this series as an extension of the game, but for me?  It’s boring, it’s lazy, it’s bland, and it’s just overall kind of worthless.

I give Kancolle a 2/10."

It feels fair to say that Magia Record is a bit of a weird thing. Nearly ten years out from Puella Magi Madoka Magica, the series has spawned a surprisingly large franchise. In this day and age, that means a gacha game. Thus it comes to pass that we have MagiReco, an anime adaptation of said game. It’s easy to be cynical about this sort of thing. Must be a soulless cash-grab, right?

Well, nothing’s ever really that simple. 

Any franchise that lives long enough has to reckon with itself eventually in some way or another. Madoka was already doing this as early as Rebellion, but as much as the franchise itself, that was Gen Urobuchi and Shinbou codifying and modifying what they’d done with the series proper. Production-wise, the Magica Quartet is no more. Shinbou is gone, and Urobuchi is working on [some thing on youtube about robots](https://anilist.co/anime/111964/OBSOLETE/). This is not the first time Madoka Magica has been revisited or expanded upon. There have been manga, there have been books, there was, of all things, a roguelike for the PlayStation Portable. Nearly a decade later, Magia Record is a different animal. Even if the base parts that make something “Madoka” are all still here, they’re arranged differently. New characters form the bulk of the show’s cast, many of whom have similarities to the original Puella Magi. When old ones are reintroduced, it’s in  an altered context. No one is quite who they appear to be, and the show itself by turns makes open nostalgia plays and is willfully cryptic. 

img880()

To be very clear, this is not Rebellion. MagiReco is neither an obvious continuation of the franchise nor a radical departure from it. The patch of middle ground it seeks to farm is thus a tricky one. 

MagiReco seems to operate from a curious core thesis, which is that Madoka’s metatext has been so heavily mined by other stories that there’s little point in digging into it. Instead, MagiReco almost aggressively foregrounds this iteration of the Madoka universe as pure text before it does anything else, only approaching deeper themes through this odd backdoor route. It is a show with a keen interest in the mechanics and the aesthetics of “Madoka” as an idea. Before it is any other thing, it is a vehicle for telling “Madoka stories”, and sees that as a valid goal on its own.

img880()

The show’s structure, which emphasizes smaller character arcs within a fairly large cast, somewhat ironically builds it similarly to the traditional magical warrior series to which Madoka is often (wrongly) cast as an antithesis. Add to this a bit of trademark SHAFT-y oddness, helmed by Gekidan Inu Curry (who both reprise their roles in the animation and now lead the series as directors), and you have a recipe for good solid fun. Which in some ways, is exactly what the show is. 

You may notice that I have danced around the issue of the series’ actual quality. To tell the truth, I think MagiReco’s odd priorities mean that even moreso than is the norm for this kind of thing, you will take away what you put in. Do you have an interest in Madoka more as a cool magical girl series (however dark it may be) or as a Faustian tragedy? MagiReco is not solely for the former crowd, but it is that mentality that the series is clearly written from first and foremost. In part, MagiReco seems to see iterating upon “Madoka” as an idea as an end unto itself in the same way that post-Futari wa Precure seasons have done to that franchise. 

This isn’t to say that it’s shallow. MagiReco’s habit of picking at the clockwork of the PMMM universe (or at least this version of it) means that it occasionally interrogates its own predecessor, sometimes to truly interesting effect, and sometimes not. The way that MagiReco interacts with PMMM is curious, often bordering on audience-antagonistic. Mami returns, but as a villain. Kyouko shows up only to dip for the finale, where she’s nowhere to be seen. Sayaka makes an appearance in the final episode where, while she does get to participate in one of the show’s highlights as far as fight scenes go, she does not actually do much. Of Madoka herself and the ever-divisive Homura, the former only shows up very briefly in a flashback. The latter, not at all.

img880()

Of the show’s original cast, its two leads Iroha and Yachiyo are clearly riffs, design-wise, on Madoka and Homura respectively, but they only broadly resemble those characters in writing. Iroha’s quest to find her disappeared sister is much more focused than Madoka’s broad love-everyone attitude (which is not to say it’s better or worse, but it’s distinct). Yachiyo on the other hand, is like Homura in her general lone wolfishness and status as a “veteran” magical girl, but the similarities don’t go much farther. Her own tragic past is of a very different kind. She loses friends and teammates to what she believes to be the results of her own wish--simply “to survive”--and in the show’s brightest spots, which it has a surprising amount of, she actually comes across as rather motherly.

If all of this seems a bit circuitous, it may be well because MagiReco’s biggest weakness is its lack of much of a unified core. That aforementioned structure means that the series lives and dies by individual arcs. Some are absolutely great; Rena Minami’s plumbs some truly moving depths of self-loathing, and you really feel for the character. Much later in the series, Sana Futaba’s absolutely wild arc about living inside a computer and how this relates to her (now bygone) home life, is also superb. On the other hand, some others are simply competent, and it’s here where the show loses points.

img880()

How much worth you’re going to find in even the best arcs though does ultimately come down to whether you think any of this is worthwhile in the first place. This in turn is going to tie into how you feel about the original series and possibly Rebellion. For a show that is otherwise rather humble, there’s a lot of high emotion tied up in discussion of Magia Record. It is a series that is “post-Madoka” in a very different way than the numerous imitators--good and bad--that have tried to bite a piece of the PMMM pie since the early 2010s. This will doubtless be further exacerbated by the on-its-way second season, which promises to build up a stronger overarching narrative and to return Walpurgisnight, and possibly Madoka herself, to the show's universe.

Longtime fans are as likely to love MagiReco as hate it. Personally, as a somewhat recent Madoka convert, I found every episode compelling and am thrilled to see what comes next. But even as I type that, it feels like trying to force clarity onto a series that continues to thrive best without it. The Less You Know The Better, and all that.

MagiReco feels uncommonly like a series that will meet you halfway but no farther. Puella Magi Madoka Magica aired nine years ago. MagiReco, intentionally or not, seems to beg the question; are you the same person you were in 2011? Is anyone?

154364,"The second season of The Ancient Magus' Bride continues the enchanting tale of Chise, a Sleigh-Beggy with extraordinary powers, and her enigmatic master, Elias. This season lacks the creative visual storytelling and captivating artistry of the first, but it provides a compelling plot nonetheless.

As Chise navigates the magical world, she is offered a place at a college by Adolf. This sparks uncertainty and support from Elias. In her first class, she learns about sorcery basics and meets new classmates with unique magical abilities. Amidst her exploration of her unique physiology, Chise encounters a silver-haired student who faints, leading her to question their mysterious connection. Elias watches over Chise at school as a temporary professor, maintaining his relevance to the narrative. 

The season further delves into Chise's relationships with her newly made friends. Chise's happiness with her friends sparks jealousy in Elias, revealing their relationship's complexities. Amidst personal growth and character dynamics, Chise encounters Rahab, Elias' master. These revelations shed light on Elias' mysterious nature and provide a deeper understanding of his motivations and inner struggles. This revelation sheds light on Elias' struggle to process emotions and his growing concern for Chise.  

The plot takes a darker turn when a mystery arises, solving the stolen Grimoire. Chise seeks answers from Cartaphilus, who has connections to her cynical roommate Lucy: She’s perhaps the most prominent side character at Chise’s Hogwarts-esque school. Lucy is one of the last surviving members of her family and initially confrontational. As her past is explored, she reveals glimpses of vulnerability and curiosity. Slowly the two roomies bond, even leading to processing trauma and thoughtful drama between their other classmates. Lucy's character carries much of season 2’s fleshed out themes, such as mistrust, loss, and resilience. Her relationship with Chise also allows for comedic moments. These quick cuts to chibi art are less forced than the first season’s tonal shifts.

Chise's encounters with various magical beings intensify, despite this season’s plodding pacing. One of whom is a Banshee who is cursed to sing until someone hears her true voice. Meanwhile, the story explores family dynamics as Chise and her friends assist a young sorcerer in reuniting with her estranged father trapped as a monstrous creature. This allows Chise to reflect on forgiveness and acceptance from her own history. Furthermore, the story introduces a powerful ancient dragon named Nevin, who seeks Chise's help to stop a malevolent force. Throughout the arc, different magical creatures and forces are brought together, allowing Studio Kafka to set their production standards high. The animation manages to breathe life into these creatures despite their not overly detailed designs.

Within these overarching storylines, the season explores individual characters' personal growth. The most compelling character I witnessed was Zoe Ivey, a half-Gorgon student at college who constantly wears headphones. Initially fearful and hostile towards Chise and Elias, whom he saw as hidden monsters, Zoe gradually grows to accept them as friends. Zoe struggles with self-esteem issues, feeling caught between two worlds due to his mixed background. When Chise tries to reconcile with him, Lucy removes Zoe's headphones, triggering a transformation that exposes his fear. Zoe's past provides an intriguing connection to Chise's Dragon's Curse—the curse in her arm that grants her shapeshifting abilities.

Despite her struggles with self-worth, Chise eventually embraces her magic abilities as a Sleigh-Beggy. She might not win over viewers who were frustrated by her subdued personality, but I never had an issue with it personally. Notably, her friendship with her classmate Alice provides a supportive bond and an opportunity for both characters to heal together. This season’s robust character growth is showcased in the climax as Chise and co. confront the dark forces threatening their world.

Season 2 of The Ancient Magus' Bride weaves together a tapestry of personal journeys, magical encounters, and complex emotions. While it doesn’t quite capture the same awe-inspiring feeling of the first season, it still offers moments of heartfelt storytelling and character growth for the next installment to build upon."
140999,"There's something about a VRMMO focusing only on melee combat that has remained as novel and fun of an idea to me in my early twenties as it was to me as a twelve year old. Despite how much flack the Sword Art Online franchise gets, I'm not afraid to say how much I like the Progressive spin-off series, particularly the novels. So, I am always looking forward to watching the movie adaptations, even if I'll constantly lament it not being a high-quality television series. I watched the Aria of a Starless Night when it came to theaters, and have just come back from watching Scherzo of the Deep Night. 

This sequel doesn't pick up directly after the events of the first movie. Instead, it focuses on an arguably more important story arc that occurs a few novel volumes ahead. On one hand, I understand the decision go in this direction because let's be real there's no way every single floor's arc will be adapted (nor will the volumes ever be completed in Reki Kawahara's lifetime, for that matter). But on the other hand, I'm disappointed that the earlier stories aren't covered because they contained my favorite aspects of Progressive, which I'll get into later. Since the movie skips ahead in the story, the beginning of the movie is a bit jarring because it jumps right into a floor boss fight and afterwards quickly introduces the audience to a new character, Argo. Argo is a character whose importance is greatly understated in the movie as a consequence of going ahead in the story. 

The rest of the movie is pretty good for what it is. There is no lack of spectacle in the action and visuals are all high end. Though in my opinion none of the fights are as well choreographed or satisfying as the last fight from the first movie. Matsuoka yelling ""ASUNA!"" and ""SWITCH!"" are as iconic as ever, Tomatsu Haruka is still wonderful, and I'm glad that Izawa Shiori's voice as Argo is really close to what I had imagined when reading. Kajiura Yuki is once again responsible for the absolutely banging music. She's done the rest of SAO as well as the Type Moon stuff - what else is there to say? If you enjoyed the first Progressive movie and want more, then this is a treat. Looking at the movie by itself, it is a fun action-packed hour and forty minutes of well spent time. It's hard to shake off the infamous reputation of the original series, but if you're already at the second movie then you should already have your expectations properly set. However, as a fan of the source material, I should take a moment to talk about the things the movie lacked not because of poor execution but because of the movie format. 

As I had said earlier, what I love most about Progressive takes a backseat in this arc. The best part of Progressive is its detailed floor-by-floor world building, lore, and exploration that breathe much life into the world of Aincrad. Much of the source material involves Kirito and Asuna exploring the floors for the first time and encountering in-game side quests or other conflicts along the way. Their constant dialogue with each other leads to insanely cute banter and the time spent together helps justify how strongly they depend on each other. Many of these stories may not be directly important to the main quest of beating the game, but they're just plain fun and help strengthen Kirito's and Asuna's relationship. This important characterization is unfortunately lost in the movies due to obvious time constraints and this particular arc focusing more on the broader SAO story with more side characters involved. Kirito's character suffers as a result because the audience doesn't get to see just how dorky he can be when he's alone with Asuna (though he's not as bland as he is in the original). The tender moments between Kirito and Asuna in the movie are still undeniably nice, but if I were a first timer of the series, I wouldn't find it super impactful and would need to see more of them together to be convinced. The world building isn't the Lord of the Rings knock-your-socks off kind of level of deep, but it's still a shame that such a level of detail couldn't be included. All of this is just me saying I'm sad to not see all the fun lighthearted aspects of Progressive that lead to the absolutely intoxicatingly adorable romantic moments they share together. 

Overall, I enjoyed Scherzo of the Deep. It for the most part delivers the SAO experience without all of the garbage that once weighed it down. I'm excited for the next movie, and hopefully it'll fulfill what I personally want most out of it."
107420,"It's been a long time since an anime grabbed me in such a way that I watched it without pausing. However, I have to say that ""Infinite Dendrogram"" was fun for me, but it is far from perfect, let alone my favorite anime (or similar).

Appearance / sound
I couldn't find anything in particular that I would like to praise here. But nothing to criticize either. Only the sub was strange in some places or the choice of words was weird. This also includes names of things in the game, such as the special designation of the NPCs ""Tiam"". Either way, I'll just call them NPcs, there isn't even a real justification for the name, why shouldn't I call them ""Non Player Character""?

Plot
I just have to compare this anime with Bofuri, the extremely similar scenario alone invites you to do so. At the same time, the anime couldn't be more different.
While Bofuri is a pure comedy anime that doesn't have really good characters or a great world to offer, Infinite Dendrogram isn't really funny, but has a well thought-out world and great characters, but story-wise it can't (yet) shine. There are allusions to various story elements, characters swear revenge, others make mysterious remarks, otherwise the protagonist Ray just walks around and happens to run into problems again and again.
That's why I didn't think the anime was as good as Bofuri. While this unfolds completely in the comedy and is absorbed in it, this anime (so far) seems like an introduction that only introduces important characters and elements of the world or story. Still, I see great potential if the anime ever continues.

Unfortunately I have to criticize the finale and the second half of the anime. While the first half went through one event after the other very quickly and treated one episode for several days or weeks, the pace was slowed down significantly in the second half. About episodes 7 to 13 deal with 2 days. I don't like such changes, although some events are of course more important than others and therefore get more attention, but I would have liked a pace to be set and roughly maintained. Simply for the reason that you can see from the number of episodes how far the story is going this season. In this case, I assumed I was seeing at least a little more, maybe even another form of nemesis, Ray's embryo. The term ""embryo"" is pretty strange if you think about it. Due to my expectation to see a bit more, I was slightly disappointed, also how the anime ended in the middle of the fight.

Otherwise, a few problems can be listed here that Bofuri also had. Above all, however, the fact that ""Infinite Dendrogram"" is just a game can be criticized: Even if it is repeatedly pointed out that the game does not look like a game, it is a game! This makes successes or defeats less important, because it only happens in the game. In addition, I find the death penalty slightly ridiculous, being locked out only for 24 hours (72 ingame hours) sounds like a lot, but it is not. On the one hand, every player will have to pause for a longer period of time, certainly 24 hours. On the other hand, there are no other disadvantages, I find death in Minecraft, where potentially all items are lost, much worse.

Characters
The characters are, as already mentioned, quite good: Most of them have a background story, which is usually not very long but fits their characters. The successful and comprehensible links between background stories, character traits and skills are also cool, making the anime look more realistic.
Otherwise the characters are unfortunately quite one-dimensional, Ray alone is probably the stereotypical hero that exists in such stories.

Conclusion
Even if it was really fun to watch, the first season of this anime is just above average. The story is only hinted at, the world is well made, the characters not bad, but far from perfect. I see great potential in other seasons, so I hope that some will appear. Even if I can't imagine that it will ever come close to Bofuri. Unless you don't like comedy anime or the humor of Bofuri."

Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan is an ultimately decent episodic OVA which follows one of Araki's most eccentric characters; it recounts some of the ghastly events which the titular protagonist has experienced firsthand. By any and every stretch of the imagination, it is an enjoyable watch--particularly for those who are drawn into and fond of the Jojo's universe. Though a claim such as this would come as no surprise, it is also important to note that these four episodes have the potential to be enjoyed by those who may not even be familiar with Araki's work. 



The overall premise for this OVA stems from the desire that lies deep within the heart and soul of Rohan Kishibe, the mangaka. This desire is an incessant need to bring the ""real life"" to his work. That is his quirk, nothing short of a fatal flaw perhaps, which has always been a part of his character since fans were first introduced to him in Diamond is Unbreakable. Kishibe's desire to bring real life experiences into his manga tends to get the best of him from time to time, yet it is what drives him and encourages him to push limits and extend beyond what the eye can see. 

This four episode OVA is comprised of supplemental chapters, all a part of of a spin-off series, which Araki has composed throughout the years. Though I could be wrong in claiming so, these Kishibe stories have the feel of a creator extending himself and stepping out of his own self-imposed limits. I mean this in the strictest sense that creators, especially mangaka, can feel tied down and constrained by what may be called the unspoken rules of creative works. Araki has composed a collection of stories about Kishibe's exploits, and it has become a creative outlet for him. Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan is fun for Araki and fans, as each chapter seems to serve as its own episodic arc without the need of any outside context. This does not seem out of the question. It should be noted that possessing a general familiarity with Kishibe as a character and the Jojo universe as a whole would be ideal prior to stepping into this, but it is not necessarily vital. 



What I found interesting about these four different episodes was how each one told their own tale in a quasi-didactic way. Though it would not be correct to state that these are four parables, each episode does in fact teach a moral lesson of sorts. If nothing else, they each do call attention to the darkness and misery that may arise within the lives of those who do not take heed and gird up their loins against temptation, impurities, etc. Each individual that Rohan-sensei encounters within these stories tends to possess a flaw of some kind which leads them into some sort of supernatural ruin. Experiencing these happenings firsthand encourages Kishibe to flirt with and discover the thin line that separates destiny and despair. 

!As an aside, the popcorn scene in episode 1 made me think of this scene from Escape From LA. It is honestly the same vibe. I don't know, but I just felt the need to offer the comparison. youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMlHiDzHkSk) !

>""He wouldn't give up when the ghost haunted him. He faces life alone, but optimistically. I think he's evil, but I can admire his resilience. Maybe I'm the only one to think so.""



These four episodes all lie within the realm of the paranormal. Each episode presents Rohan-sensei, oft in a desire to encounter a fulfilling life experience, in order that he might be able to conduct research and thereby draw something great for his manga. I have had mixed feelings for the character of Rohan Kishibe since I first encountered him in part 4, but his development as a character was executed well throughout the series to make me a fan of his. These four episodes have solidified my appreciation for him as a character, as he demonstrates genuine compassion and humility throughout the course of these events. I am fond of him, and I wouldn't have it any other way. 



I have established that the enjoyment of Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan may or may not be dependent upon how one feels about both Araki's and Kishibe's work. I do not feel the need to touch base on the animation quality, considering the studio and nature of the adaptation, one would be right in the assumption that it is well done. At any rate, this collection of episodic paranormal [semi-]parables serve well as a evening watch with a cup of tea. I found the show to my liking and appreciated it for what it is."
132193,"Our greatest Aniki is back for the second curtain of Gakushufudou or The Way of the Househusband. I didn't expect to laugh hard like this because the previous season was just fine. I did not found the first season to be funny but this second part was more hilarous than ever. This season made me cried in tears to be honest.

Story:
Following the misadventures of our Aniki Tetsuya from the previous season, as he continues to tell his audience his way of living as a househusband. The comedy was improved than the previous season and I loved the development of the story. More screentime to his buddy yakuza, Masa, and his previous enemy, Torajirou. More lovely scenes between her wife, Miku that she was more powerful than his husband xD There were many more hilarious jokes from the second part like the rap part in the meat store. The family time of Miku's family with Tetsuya was one of the most hilarious from the series, as we know that Miku's family was more scary than Tetsuya himself. Anyways, the whole story was episodic but they were so good.

Art:
It was the same in the first season. The PPT animation style was the perfect art for this anime because it is a gag manga. I invested myself in this kind of animation style so I found this anime beautiful. The charm of JC staff animation was there and it was good though. If you like to watch this kind of animation, you'll surely love this anime, but I guranteed that you will not like this anime if you'll looking forward for the animation.

Sound:
It's the same as ever. The sounds and music were suitable for the atmosphere of the anime. It gave comedy vibes, as they helped to make the jokes, funnier than ever. The eyecatches were somewhat perfect timing when they wrapped up a funny joke after a certain scenario. The OP and ED were amazing too.

Characters:
The characters were rowdier than ever, even Masa was lazier than the previous season. Tetsu-chan never failed to amaze me for laughing so hard because of his dialogues and attitude. Masa gained his character development of laziness, which is good. I found Tetsujirou was one of the funniest characters in the whole series and had great development and screentime for Miku. Overall, they were amazing.

Overall:
This anime is fun to watch if you will don't mind about the animation. The story was funny and you will get used to it when you'll watch it. This kind of anime is worth to watch and I can't find another anime like this. It thought me some lessons and tips on how to become a great house worker and a cook. Who says that yakuzas can't handle many household chores? But guess what? They did LMAO. Overall, I'll give this anime a 9/10 and this anime is one of the funniest humor I've ever watched."
9760,"Children Who Chase Lost Voices is an okay-ish movie. The art is amazing, all the animations are smooth and pleasant to watch, the characters' and monsters' designs are good and there was a lot of attention paid to small details. While the eating scenes cannot be compared to those animated by Studio Ghibli, they have good art and animation. If my score for this movie was based solely on these points, it would be an easy eight or nine out of ten.



The world building is great, but it isn't one of the best of Makoto Shinkai works in this aspect and it lacks some more originality when compared to similar stories in the fantasy genre. However, it is really captivating and interesting. I honestly liked a bit more the fantasy in the world of Suzume and how it was developed.

!Quick tangent: Did they really needed to include Hitler and Stalin in that scene with the explanation about the past of Agartha and it's relation with the external world? In my opinion, the scene would be able to pass the message ""humans suck and are selfish"" yadda yadda without needing to add this visual ""aid"". It was really unnecessary, every other element in that scene was already enough to convey that message.!



Even being a overall visually good movie, it lacks a good sense of story progression somewhere between the beginning of the second half and the third quarter of the movie, and a bit later in the story, where the ""plot"" starts to feel kind of rushed, like the script is begging to get to the ending faster. Also, in my opinion some of the connections made in the last quarter or so were kind of ""forced"", or I just wasn't able to understand it.

I was expecting a better ending with more impact, but I think it was too cliche for me in some aspects. While it's still a good ending, it felt kind of blend.

!While the scene with Shun and Mimiwas kind of nice, we could've seen a bit more of it than just a glimpse when Asuna's soul was already leaving to go back to her body. A longer interaction between her, Shun and Mimi would make that scene a bit better and aggregate to the viewer's experience.!



In the end, Children Who Chase Lost Voices feels like an attempt to make a movie similar to some of the stories written/directed by Hayao Miyazaki: a story of an extraordinary world where magic forces reign and are the foundation of the place in some way, but are kept hidden for some reason unknown by the protagonist. Sometimes it really felt weirdly similar to something directed by Miyazaki, but it didn't keep the similarities for too long, and this feeling kind of came back and forth quite some times throughout the movie.



TL;DR: The movie has good animation, art and attention to small details. However, the world building could've been more original, the plot could've been more developed and the end is a bit too cliche."

Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju, I wasn't quite sure what this anime was about when I first heard about it, but I was curious since I have heard many others praising it. At first, I watched this anime in the hopes to learn more about Rakugo, however, what I got, in the end, was a lesson about life and death.

Story:

The plot, just like S1, is outstanding and it really grabs your attention and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Drama, comedy, romance, mystery, Rakugo has it all. It attracts you into the story through its unique storytelling and makes you feel like you are living in the Rakugo world. Rakugo takes storytelling to another level and I have never been so emotionally attached to an anime like this.


Characters: 

In Rakugo S2, we see the present-day Yotaro and Yakumo, both working together to help Rakugo gain more popularity and acceptance. This season adds more depth and development to the characters, especially Yotaro and Konatsu. In addition, every character presents complex emotions, which makes them feel more real and relatable. Konatsu, for example, shows forgiveness towards Yakumo when she realizes how much he has done for her. Yotaro is first portrayed (even named) as a simpleton, but later on, we see that he is someone who takes initiative and confronts his challenges. I couldn't help but respect Yotaro for his determination to enjoy everything he does. Although each character has their problems and flaws – just like a real human – they are overall likable and relatable.

Art & Music: 

The art in Rakugo is stunning and it helps to capture the little aspects well. Although not as impressive as some other anime in the medium, the animation is certainly unique and stands out.  In addition, the OST is arguably one of the best in the medium. The use of the soundtracks during some moments chilled me to the bone and provides more emotional value.

My thoughts:

To me, Rakugo is an anime that exploits the complexity of human nature and human emotions. It accurately portrays the incomprehensible emotions that we humans experience every day, whether it would be love, hate, happiness, or sadness. Such incomprehensible emotions that we experience are what make us human. Rakugo has helped me realize several things and has made me question my own beliefs. 

A big theme in Rakugo is humanity, humans desire intimacy, even if it means getting hurt because of it. Perhaps that is what it means to be a human: to make friends, to fall in love, to build a family, and to die. The relationships between each character in Rakugo help establish the idea of humans depending on each other to move forward, whether it's Sukeroku inspiring Yakumo to continue doing rakugo or Yotaro inspiring Yakumo to keep living. As the viewer, you get attached to the characters and their relationships and often will emphasize their ideals.

Rakugo also makes an emphasis on death: humans fear death, even the thought of dying makes us shudder. Rakugo presents death as a way of gaining freedom because that is when humans are truly free and atoned from their sins. Live is full of hardships and loneliness, but the relationships we build, the people we meet, the places we go, the things we do during that short life will all help make life much more enjoyable. Rakugo encourages the viewers to keep on living because, in the end, they will be rewarded.

Conclusion:

Rakugo is a story about finding and developing your own identity, building relationships, and facing others. It is a story of life,  I have never felt the urge to cry this much after finishing an anime. I have learned many things from watching this anime and I hope that future viewers will also take away something. Most importantly, you should enjoy watching it.

Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day!"
97625,"Do you like fanservice?
Do you like well directed battle scenes? 
Do you like well thought out emotional stories?
If you said yes to one or all three then; Well this one may just be for you! 

Forewarning: This anime is not for the light hearted, people that just want action, or people that do not like anime that features lewd scenes of girls that are not tall and have massive tiddies. But there are some pretty massive titties in here, so if you like all shapes and sizes, then you'll find the characters hot in this anime.

Tsugumomo is an action, ecchi, harem, supernatural anime about friendship, romance and the bonds we share with other people. This anime at first really doesn't feel like it should be emotionally investing. But if you find yourself liking this, trust me you're gonna get attached to these characters. 

Tsugumomo's story is very simple, yet so outstanding at the same time. It's not just titties and fanservice scenes, it's about more than that. This is a story of a young boy who has been inflicted by a grave misfortune at birth, and must deal with it's effects through his life. By meeting more people and awakening to his powers once again, a boy must find his path in life to protect his friends and family from monsters made of evil malice. By mixing Japanese mythology with the modern day times, Tsugumomo has succeeded at making the simple interesting.

Kiriha: AKA the perfect being to ever exist, such a great character

SO now that I am done ranting about it let's give it in an easier to digest format for new viewers or anyone interested

Story 10/10: Tsugumomo is a 1:1 adaptation of it's source material. There really is not much missing from the anime, it's all there! Pretty rare for most anime these days to actually represent what the author wanted. I kind of detailed on the story a bit earlier, but this first season is mostly centered around Kazuya building up his powers and learning about the world of tsukumogami and gods. Season 1 is the buildup to season 2, because in season 2, a LOT and I mean a LOT happens, it blew me out of the water. There is also a lot more material after where the anime ends, and you can just pick the novel right up right around chapter 67 where it starts immediately after the last episode. 

Animation/art style 9.5/10: I am really only going to take some points off here because i don't think the animation really diverges itself from your average anime animation, EXCEPT for the battle scenes. The battle scenes are very well directed and will have you on the edge of your seat. Although, I think if there was a lot more attention to backgrounds in this anime, it would definitely succeed in being a genuine 100/100 anime for me. But I still love generic anime art style, I mean it's anime, it's not meant to give you ultra HD 4k graphics. Think about the poor animators in their studios making awful wages. 

Characters 10/10: You like a certain character archetype? Well it's mostly here? I mean the characters are not the stereotypical character archetypes by any means, especially Kiriha. Who in all honesty, is just a lazy, lusty lady who just wants to protect kazuya from harm. Kazuya himself is really just the average wimpy MC, but it's not about him being a wimpy MC, it's about his development into becoming a fuckin chad. By the end of season 1 you'll be like damn that's some character development. Those are the 2 characters that are definitely ""MCs"" the other characters serve their purposes in the story line and get the character growth they also need. Honestly, character growth is probably the one quality of this anime that is most important. 

img800(
Come on look at that face, you can't tell me she isn't god tier. 

All in all, I genuinely believe Tsugumomo is the pinnacle of ecchi, and if you don't that's all good. Because at the end of the day you, the reader may not even like it. If you don't like the anime or me that's okay, we all share different opinions, and enjoy things in different fashions and manners. If you liked season 1, be sure to watch season 2. 

If you liked my review leave a like and I'm more than welcome to discuss the anime in private messages!"
153360,"Isekai is a genre that needs no introduction. If you're at the point where you're not just watching anime, but using a tracking site and reading a review of some obscure seasonal, you know what the isekai genre entails. I've also made my [thoughts ](https://anilist.co/review/4892)on isekai [known](https://anilist.co/review/10859), so I won't belabor you with my spiel, except to say this: it takes a very specific type of premise for me to consider watching an isekai.

Said premise usually involves giving a character an extreme handicap. In a genre saturated with overpowered protagonists, the only shows that feel unique enough for my consideration are those that exhibit a hint of restraint. I'm not alone in this preference  — [Re:ZERO](https://anilist.co/review/7271) is [the second-most popular isekai](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Isekai) on the site and I’d wager a big draw is the fact that Subaru is physically ineffectual, with his signature power being that he revives upon death. It just makes for a more engaging and exciting story when there's the threat of your protagonist being beaten. Beyond that, handicaps and limitations tend to make isekai protagonists more distinct, as their strengths usually lead to the same conclusion: an absolutely cracked power fantasy.


Iskeai authors recognize this, as it's not exactly rare to come across an isekai with a seemingly nerfed protagonist. The operative word here is ""seemingly"" because rarely do these authors want to commit. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and So I'm a Spider, So What? are shows that I was primed to watch since they featured unorthodox, seemingly weak protagonists. My enthusiasm enthusiasm deflated once I learned that they both both of them ended up getting human forms because of course they did. At least I was able to get out of dodge before investing my time unlike Rising of the Shield Hero, whose main character supposedly was only able to use their shield for defense (as you do with a shield) only to end the season whipping out offensive capabilities that would make Naruto sweat.

This isn’t about them Pockey, stay on track, stay on track.

When I heard of an isekai about someone reincarnating as a vending machine, I was intrigued, yet cautious. On one hand, being reborn as a stationary vending machine provided a wealth of opportunities for the main character to navigate a fantasy world with severe limitations such as being unable to move. On the other hand, as far as I knew, two episodes in, the protagonist would be able to turn into a Gundam or something.



With that in mind, I'm happy to say that Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon exceeded my expectations. It's an isekai that handles its premise well, not only sticking to what makes it interesting, but surprising me with just how far it stretched the concept while remaining true to it. 

Our unnamed protagonist is largely undefined save for his interest in vending machines and after he ends up dying in an effort to save one, karma reincarnates him as a magical vending machine in a fantasy world.



 While it's true that ""magical"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting, it isn't doing as much as you might think. This magic manifests in our protagonist, quickly christened ""Boxxo,"" being able to modify himself using points earned from purchases. These modifications range from increasing his stats such as durability, creating a barrier, changing prices, altering stock, and, most notably, changing his form. The catch is that he can only change into types of vending machines.

The transformations lead to some very interesting solutions to problems. One notable application of Boxxo's quick and imaginative problem-solving skills is vending [mentos and coke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4unm8iwHyTc&abchannel=AHBrandonReviews)in order for his allies to defeat a monster. Part of what makes Reborn as a Vending Machine work is due to the sheer amount of different vending machines there are. Another example of Boxxo's quick-thinking is displayed when he's in freefall. To slow his descent, he creates a barrier, fills it with balloons via a balloon vending machine, and then turns into a vending machine made of cardboard. These are all real things! I was pleasantly surprised by how informative the show was. Some transformations, such as a gas pump, stretch the definition of a ""vending machine,"" though nothing really feels egregiously out of line.



While the transformations give Boxxo versatility, he still has his limitations. Under an author with less restraint Boxxo's other mods and features could have functionally made him human, or, at the very least, something with more utility than a vending machine. But no, Reborn as a Vending Machine sticks to its premise throughout its run. Boxxo can give himself wheels but he can't turn them himself; they're mostly used to make transporting him easier. He can give himself a vacuum, but it's only powerful enough to suck up coins and the like; it can't really be used as a weapon in and of itself. The biggest possibility for the show to jump the shark was in giving Boxxo the ability to display text. Throughout the show, Boxxo is limited to seven stock phrases; the only way to converse with him is by asking him questions and assigning responses to certain phrases(""hello/welcome"" is ""yes,"" for example). Having him be able to speak freely via writing would make Boxxo feel a lot less limited in his capabilities and less interesting as a result. Thankfully, when Boxxo chooses the ability, he discovers, much to his dismay, no one can read the text, as it's in Japanese (even if they could, he can only display the same phrases he says, anyway).

Thanks to these limitations, Boxxo makes his way through this fantasy world with the help of his friend and deutaragonist Lammis. We're treated to the unique ways a medieval adventuring guild would use a magical vending machine. Boxxo is parts ration pack and parts Swiss Army Knife. I appreciate it because it's an effective and intriguing blend of the mundane with the fantastical.



When Boxxo is parked somewhere in the characters' home base, he's used more the way you'd expect. Honestly, I may have enjoyed this slice-of-life segment of the show more than the adventuring portion. There's a very cozy feeling to Reborn as a Vending Machine at times. It's very cute to see this sentient vending machine blow the minds of medieval villagers when he introduces them to the likes of ramen, menstrual pads, shampoo, porn magazines, and condoms (Japanese vending machines are wild).



Reborn as a Vending Machine's greatest strength is doing right by its premise, which has more depth than it might seem. The show not only treats us to a fantasy world but familiarizes us with an aspect of our own world that we might not have been aware of. And I think that's pretty neat.

I just wish there was a bit more to it.



Because, as well-executed as Reborn as a Vending Machine's premise is, like many isekai, the show operates under the assumption that the premise is the end-all-be-all, leaving the rest of the show's aspects out to dry.

Take the setting, for example, which is the same generic fantasy you've seen before. It's nothing to write home about and if any thought was put into the setting to make it unique, it hasn't translated into making it interesting for the viewers. I imagine this is largely the point because for as much as isekai shows are ostensibly about exploring another world (almost as if it's in the name or something), they tend to just be an avenue for exploring all the things the main character can do with their fancy powers.

Not, mind you, an avenue for exploring the character themselves.

Boxxo is no exception. Sure, all the ways he can use his powers are cool, but I have little sense of who he has as a person. I know he's creative and loves vending machines, but these traits are just extensions of his powers. One of the more interesting bits of Boxxo's character is when he briefly wonders if he'd want to turn human again because he feels more useful as a vending machine. It's brief, but it's something.



Reborn as a Vending Machine features a large cast, but not a particularly interesting one. There's Lammis, who can be summarized as ""genki girl,"" a character trait that's simple to a fault; whether you find her endearing or annoying is largely based on your own personality and your mood on a given day rather than anything the show itself did. And she's probably one of the more rounded characters. The cast at large is less memorable than a literal inanimate object. I distinctly remember feeling lost in the penultimate episode because we were following a character we were introduced to, yet whom I could not remember for the life of me.

Reborn as a Vending Machine doesn't do much to escape the confines of the archetypical isekai. While it plays to the genre's strengths extremely well, it's evident that it's very beholden to its weaknesses. Believe me when I say I didn't intend to go into this review raving about a genre I barely watch, but the more I dug into the show, the more convinced I was that its weaknesses are intrinsic to its genre. And I don't just say this to be a hater — I want to like isekai, I really do, hence why I occasionally give one a try every few years. But each time, I've been disappointed for one reason or another. 



For what it's worth, I don't hate Reborn as a Vending Machine. I don't even dislike it. I'm more ambivalent towards it. It's enjoyable enough; I had a good time while watching it, but it started becoming a real struggle deciding to watch it. It's a fun show, but not an interesting one and one I didn't find particularly gripping.  I’m sure a big part of my enjoyment came from my fascination with Japanese vending machines.


If you're a fan of isekai or are interested in giving the genre a shot, Reborn as a Vending Machine, Now I Wander the Dungeon features one of the most creative and interesting power sets I've experienced. It's a fine enough show if you're just looking for something fun and cute. If you're looking for any depth in characters or setting, this probably isn't the show for you."
15335,"“How about we add something sad to make it seem like it’s the final one? Like ‘Farewell,’ or ‘Forever,’ or ‘Final.’”

- Gintoki Sakata, Episode 50 (Gintama)

Before watching Gintama: The Final Chapter: Be Forever Yorozuya it’s important to understand why some people were frustrated with it. After the end of Gintama’: Enchōsen, this film was supposed to tie up plot threads, answer the fan’s burning questions and wrap Gintama’s story up with a neat bow. So, did Be Forever Yorozuya manage to fulfil any of these demands?

No, of course it didn’t. It’s a Gintama film. 

Those working on Be Forever Yorozuya were aware that they would never be able to offer any satisfying answers or solve any mysteries, so they didn’t even try to. This was a bold decision that ultimately worked in the film’s favour; especially when watched in hindsight. Rather than attempting to haphazardly patch a backstory together, the film charts its own course; offering up the usual mix of ridiculous humour and unique bittersweetness that only a series like Gintama could meaningfully balance. 

By centring the main plot around time travel, Be Forever Yorozuya is given a large scope that allows the film to freely experiment with the story. Thankfully, it keeps its focus on three key moments in time which prevents the film from stretching itself too thin. Any story that deals with time travel often runs the risk of falling into over-explaining its premise, or inadvertently being trapped in a paradoxical nightmare. Be Forever Yorozuya decides to keep time travel as a story mechanic, so there is very little explanation behind how it works which works well for the narrative. However, it might be a little frustrating if you are wanting a story which focuses more on the implications of time travel. There is a strong balance struck between the past, present, and future, with each setting being given importance to the narrative. This is something that can be difficult to pull off in a film’s timeframe. The story utilises each setting well; focusing on particular narrative moments rather than spreading itself too thin and trying to cover too much. 

The central narrative is also an interesting one that simultaneously slots into the wider Gintama canon while also setting itself apart; developing some ideas that would otherwise have had a major impact on the series. This means that there are a couple of twists that the film has which, while predictable, are very emotional and are built up well. This is especially true in regards to the handling of Gintoki’s past and how he is in the present remains both the same, yet distinctly different. This tentative handling of the narrative shows how this film, despite deviating from the series, manages to be a perfect distillation of what makes Gintama Gintama. 

The weaving together of humour and emotional moments is, of course, another area where Be Forever Yorozuya shines. There is a captivating way this is done, simultaneously keeping the audience on their toes without feeling overbearing. This creates a comfortingly familiar experience that mirrors the main series. The film is aided by its clear focus on the overarching relationships between the cast; something that Gintama always puts to the forefront of its stories. Not only does this mean that the emotional moments shine brightly, but it also allows the comedic moments to push the envelope in a way that only a standalone film could achieve. 

Gintama is, after all, a series that is completely carried by its characters. It is immediately apparent how important the main trio, as well as the wider recurring cast, is to Be Forever Yorozuya. They are each given moments to shine, allowing the audience to see them at both their best and their worst. Despite there being different versions of their characters, the audience can easily distinguish between them through both their personalities and appearances. This shows that the film handles the characters with a lot of thought, not throwing out their pre-existing personalities for the sake of the story. 

 It is a testament to how well characterised each member of the cast is and, outside of a small handful of moments, they remain consistent with their established personalities and roles. This makes it easy to become absorbed by the film’s comforting familiarity. The bonds between characters are used to their fullest, acting as the focal point for Be Forever Yorozuya allowing it to deepen the emotional aspects of the film while retaining its absurd comedy. There is a level of joy in wondering how different characters have changed and what effect that has on the story with there being enough variation from the main series to make the changes stand out. 

This is matched by the character designs which are markedly different, standing out from their previous designs while still carrying an air of familiarity. This allows the audience to recognise the younger characters in their older versions. There are also some nice sentimental touches, such as Kagura and Shinpachi utilising elements from Gintoki’s outfit while making it their own. It subtly reinforces the bonds that they share without hammering it over the audience’s head. It’s also nice to see the film not taking the redesigns too seriously, such as Okita becoming a Rurouni Kenshin rip-off or Elizabeth walking straight out of a horror film. 

Rather than trying to up the ‘coolness’, Be Forever Yorozuya leans into its absurdity, but this doesn’t mean that there aren’t some really engaging fight scenes. The smooth choreography and dedication to highlighting the character’s different fighting styles work to show how well the cast fits together. Fighting is also used sparingly throughout which means that the audience isn’t over-saturated and each carries an emotional weight.

With the ending credits paying a sentimental homage to the series, this film may not be a perfect film but it is a perfect Gintama film. When I first watched this film, unsure if the anime would ever make a return, it felt like a tender send-off. Nowadays, with the knowledge that Gintama returned only a few years later, I feel that Gintama: The Final Chapter: Be Forever Yorozuya was never supposed to be a film about saying goodbye but instead about saying “we’ll see you again.” Even if that means going back and starting the adventure all over again."
430,"Review in brief:  The Conqueror of Shamballa attempts to be its own thing while being a sequel to a show with loose ends and completely fails to succeed as either.  It's almost as though this movie was initially a failed standalone pitch before being shoehorned into FMA as the 2003 anime was reaching its end.  As disappointing as FMA '03's ending was it's far better than anything The Conqueror of Shamballa has to offer.


Anyone who finished FMA '03 knows that its ending was just a setup for a sequel.  Aside from the implicative final scene there were still a number of lingering questions regarding specific details from the show that were left unanswered.  This movie serves to end the anime-original storyline, but nothing more.  It has no desire to answer the questions the series left open and instead seeks to stand on its own as the final arc of the story.  This in itself raises serious questions about the validity of its setup (FMA '03's finale) but considering how much of the series' rules this movie forgets they may as well have just forgotten about what they had done before.  This is especially true when it comes to ""the gate"", the means by which alchemy acquired its energy to function in FMA '03.  The TV show went to great lengths to show that transmutations had a cost (except the last one that got Edward & Envy to Earth, apparently ""the gate"" stopped caring).  Now ""the gate"" arbitrarily lets people switch worlds (either freely or at a cost) so long as they can open it.  The old rules simply don't apply anymore, nor are they cared about as the ending similarly tosses chunks of the remaining system out the window.

Even within its own story, this movie features an unending torrent of plot holes & conveniences.  Many of these revolve around characters (and most of the characters at that) doing things not because it fits their presented character or because it's a sensible thing to do but simply because otherwise the plot would not have moved forward.  This wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't the excuse for such events as Edward cheerfully deciding to miss the public unveiling of his past 2 years of work for a quick snooze because it was apparently the only simple way to set up the next scene, or Fritz Lang crashing the Beer Hall Putsch because he magically knew Edward would be there, or just about everything Hohenheim does.  The whole movie is like this too, in fact it's difficult to give examples without giving spoilers.  There's more hole than plot and it's not even funny.

img()
By ""crash the Beer Hall Putsch"", I do mean Fritz crashed his 1920's automobile into the beer hall where the putsch was just kicking off.

Nearly all of the characters (including the new main characters) are cardboard cutouts who are either only present to push the plot another step or enforce a stereotype to hammer down its broken attempt at a moral lesson.  This movie could have had a solid central message if it understood or remembered what it was doing with its characters (much less had any actual characterization) but instead its failed effort only drags the sorry display down further.  The few characters with any meaning to them derive all of it from the TV show, so while Edward has clearly matured since his state alchemist days and Alphonse (Elric, that is) has become bolder (and can fragment his soul to control objects now, no reason given as usual), none of the development is actually shown and rather is just what we're given from the get-go, which means that most of what they do is just set up to push the plot forward as well.  Meanwhile you have characters like the main villain who attacks people she's supposed to ally with (because how else is someone who leads the antagonists going to look evil?) and Maes Hughes who has been reduced to a laughably shallow evil nazi stereotype.

It's frustrating considering how little the setting has been tapped into by general media.  Weimar Republic Germany was a time of wild uncertainty with revolts and movements of just about every kind that would have been possible during the Interwar period.  Many of the important events and people associated with World War II were already set in place during this time, and Germany was at the center of it all.  The Conqueror of Shamballa does tap into its setting (though events revolving around ""the gate"" and the antagonist Thule Society are the main focus) and provides an interesting (though hard to believe, mostly due to poor execution) theory regarding the Beer Hall Putsch.  However, even if it succeeded at building a story around this, it has nothing to do with Fullmetal Alchemist and would have likely worked much better as a fully separate entity.  What few elements that were brought over from FMA almost all appear shoehorned in to remind the viewer that this is in fact a FMA sequel and certainly not something completely different.  FMA's world could have been swapped out with any other fantasy world without any other change.

img()
Conqueror of Shamballa's graphics are quite standard for GameCube titles of its time.

Finally, this also isn't a movie that features worthwhile production values. The sound is merely alright with passable music, forgettable effects, and (in Japanese anyhow) voice-work that only could have gone as far as the flat characters who were speaking to begin with.  While the animation quality is generally slightly better than the TV show it also features highly dated CGI and plenty of stilted moments. There's definitely worse but there's something to be said when a 2005 movie can't truly improve over a 2003-04 multi-cour TV series.


It's the FMA '03 finale and it has so little to do with FMA that it's painful.  If you want a sequel that cleanly ends FMA '03 rest unassured that there are no answers, just holes.  If you want a good standalone movie set in the Weimar Republic then I regret to inform you that you won't find it here.  Those are the only two things this movie attempted to be.  You can skip this movie without missing anything worthwhile, in fact I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding it."
98514,"Back when the Spring season originally started, Uma Musume was memed in the anime club I'm at as being “just another beast show” and one that would fizzle out of popularity and quality very soon, I tried the first episode anyway expecting a train wreck, what did I get in return? One of the best shows I've ever seen. Period. There's a lot of reasons as to why this show is just so fantastic and I have noted down most of them in this review of a show that defied all odds, all expectations and gave us one hell of an epic anime. The show that I gave an 8 which was pushed to a 9 in it's fourth episode and a 9.5 in it's second half, this is the might of Uma Musume. Let's begin. Original Review published June 17, 2018 on AniList

First off, one thing the show was excellent in doing was the way it accurately portrayed the original history behind the horse girls. To those of you who are unfamiliar, the names of the horses aren't made up, these are real life Japanese horses who raced in the '90s and have been anime-ified as being horse girls while maintaining a 95% historical accuracy rate. Why 95%? It's because one of the horses had a dark backstory which was toned down in the anime, although you'll see it, it won't be as dark as the harsh reality was which is pretty much understandable because Uma Musume isn't such a show in the first place. Nevertheless, apart from that, from start to finish, Uma Musume maintained a healthy accuracy rate (in fact, it's 100% in terms of who won and lost the race) throughout its entire run. Pun intended. 

Despite its accuracy, most of the people who watched the show may obviously not have knowledge of the original Japanese horses and their races, so this helps to bring suspense to the table, but this is not all. Uma Musume knows a lot of things, and it knows damn well how to control the element of surprise as well as the suspense it brings with it. What am I talking about? You can never predict who'll win in the race, not even when the race is going on. You might think this is easy but if you look at most sports anime they don't have as much suspense or any suspense at all because they always show the main characters as Shounen as possible who will work hard and defeat the opponents no matter how difficult they are to beat. 



What Uma Musume makes us realise (that most other sports anime don't) is that hard work and teamwork alone won't give you the win you think you deserved. It shows us the harsh life lesson that hard work doesn't always get rewarded and you won't always win, and this is shown by making the protagonists lose at times. “Is that all? There are a few anime that show the team of character lose” you might say. As with most things in life, losing isn't the end of the story. It's what comes after that. The lessons you learn from it, Uma Musume knows and shows just that, such as by characters coping with their loss, starting to work even harder, not be too overconfident and take proper measures and be grounded. Beware, if you expect this anime to be all wins and celebrations 24/7 you're in for a surprise. This seemingly kiddish show (I really feel sorry for those who think that) has a lot of lessons to teach, like friendship. In particular we got to see the friendship of Special Week and Silence Suzuka build up. At first Suzuka was admired by the rookie Special Week but after becoming roommates it all changed. For the better. Making new friends, interacting with your friends, having fun, this is all the joy of friendship and we saw all of this excellently shown by Progressive Animation Works (or P.A works to you acronym fans). 

On the other side of the spectrum friendship also brings with itself, rivalry. And this was also evident although not as much. We saw Special Week and Silence Suzuka cheer each other on along with challenge each other from time to time. This is very important to show since most friendships have these (to those of you without friends, please find some and discover the joy of friendship and rivalry) and this ends up as yet another plus point for the show, rivalry isn't always hating each other, it can also mean friends battling each other for who comes out on top and having a nice laugh about it later. That's friendship. That's rivalry. No. That's friendly rivalry. Or wait. That is the true spirit of friendship itself isn't it? Apart from having someone to challenge we also have the hardships. What happened to one of the two was horrifying and though it wasn't as dark as the reality was it still left a crushing impact on most of the viewers and many were devastated (or at least the characters in the anime were). That's where the hardship struck. The friend rushed in tears to save her best friend and neither could function properly since they were so worried about each other. This is what hardships in friendship can be sometimes. And we should support our nakama and try our hardest to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead. 

Coming back to the previous point of suspense, we got suspense because we saw our favourite characters lose. When we see someone not maintain a 100% win rate, we start to get tense when we see their next race because there's a possibility that they might lose, and this is evident in every real life sport (and a few anime). No team will lose forever, no one will win forever, both will happen to everyone albeit in different ratios. And another important thing is that victory isn't always achieved with working alone, or to be more accurate, it mostly doesn't work. Victory is gained through teamwork, and no, not the Shounen type. Teamwork is helping your friends do better, share your ideas, cheer each other on, encourage friendly rivalries. These are all what makes us achieve victory, and although we can't always win we still learn important lessons and realise that we had fun working with our friends. And this spirit is what people should follow. 



Uma Musume didn't show us everyone working alone, despite being an anime about racing, a primarily single-person sport, it showed us how all the girls helped each other gain the edge and have fun racing. This is what Special Week embodies, this is what sports should embody. Sports is fun and when it stops being fun, you quickly drop out and this is what was evident with Silence Suzuka. She couldn't find racing fun and Special Week taught how to have fun while racing. 

On the topic of racing we cover the artstyle as well. P.A Works knocked the ball out of the park with this one (been a long time since I made a sports pun). The bright colourful palette cheered me up and the animation during the races was much like the rest of the plot, serious yet cheerful. Uma Musume might show it's characters being playful and lazy at times as with every sports person outside the field but when you step into the field finally, it's a battle. And P.A Works knew it, which is why the races themselves are taken very seriously. You don't see hilarious stuff happening while the race is going on. You see the characters fixated on that finish line and have to keep moving forward, which is pretty reminiscent of P.A Works’ name itself, to move forward. Think of it like a two sided dish. One has the playful nature of friends meeting each other and messing about and the second, which has everyone become serious because of the situation and obstacles ahead. If it wasn't obvious, the artstyle even while they're racing takes a serious yet excellently designed turn. 

And speaking of the races themselves, I've never enjoyed watching a race where people run. Car races and the like are fun but P.A Works made running enjoyable, which is also a huge plus point to the show. Despite it's unique aspect and nature of the show (horse girls based on real horses racing), Uma Musume does a fine job of making it's premise easy to understand, heck it's TOO easy to understand. Just run as fast as you can while making sure you don't waste stamina. Train too hard and you lose, train too less and you're unprepared. Finding the balance is what's necessary. And this concept may feel simple because it is simple, it's surprising how many anime haven't done this as easily. To cover another good point and to make another pun about the anime’s plus points, we have the pacing (:P). Surprisingly, it's not fast paced. The pacing is done such that it's easy to understand what's happening without having to go back and on the other hand it doesn't drag on. We saw a race in most episodes and it was a breeze to smooth over them without issues. 



A large cast left me concerned since I thought not everyone would get development and unfortunately this was what I found as a problem in the anime. The show was too focused on Special Week and Silence Suzuka to focus on even the other Spica horses, let alone Rigil. I felt we could have seen much more if this show was a 24 episode series since that could mean we'd see development for them as well. Another problem I felt was that at times Uma Musume felt repetitive. This was in the earlier stages of the anime, namely it's first 4 episodes before it went with one proper varied formula and stuck to it. As a final point, yet another positive one, the show had a fantastic soundtrack. Apart from the catchy OP and ED, the BGM (or background music to those who don't know) hyped me up and oh the music that played when the races were on, especially the way the tone of the music went even higher in the last corner of the race. It left chills on my spine. Never been so hyped for such a show before. 

So overall, Uma Musume is a show that started off a bit slow, but it later (after the third episode in fact) steps up and excellently continues it's run to the finish. It teaches us lessons about friendship, hardship, rivalry, loss, teamwork and whatnot, and still manages to hype over it's viewers with it's brilliantly done racing segments and soundtrack. If a bright cheery anime with important life lessons is your type of anime to watch, then Uma Musume will be sure to leave you satisfied and wanting for more. Although the anime was mainly for marketing and engaging interest for the Uma Musume mobile game, the Anime’s quality itself far surpasses what people would expect, all thanks to P.A Works. 

The Spring season had a lot of interesting anime but only two came out on top for me. Hinamatsuri and Uma Musume. If this review gauged your interest in trying out the anime, please do so, for you are in for one heck of an awesome show at the Starting Gate!

P.S: Without spoilers, that last episode has got to be one of the most legendary ones I've ever seen. Why? It's one hell of a FANTASTIC send-off to a lovable series. It embodied everything that made the show great from it's previous episodes. The final race and the end credits made it feel like I was watching a big budget anime movie, and that's exactly how the artstyle was, but it was EVEN MORE EPIC in the last episode. Uma Musume is definitely a show I'll miss a lot. Pretty sure you'll never see a show like this ever again! What a show! What a finish! This is UMA MUSUME!"
19647,"Damn I did it, 126 episodes 1 movie and 1 ova it was long but it was good, at least it trained me for my future marathon Space Battleship Yamato

This final season of Ippo so still animated by Madhouse and surprise for me co-produced by MAPPA, Yeah the studio now known for Dororo Dorohedoro and Jujutsu Kaisen in particular made its first steps on Ippo after as long as we have a solid animation I do not complain and it is once again the case with fights always as dynamic and impacting in the staging of the blows received and some idea of realization that are welcome as many ""X- Ray"" when a character tears his muscle or breaks his ribs and a slice of lice more sparing but which is used to accentuate the gag, for example when Takamura and Aoki tears the manga of Umezawa and that he runs away of shame, we move the layer of the characters as if they were simple NPC to accentuate the shame and the embarrassment of the situation, it's methods that uses a lot Kill la Kill for example and that always works for me.

It's not the season that made me howl with laughter the 2nd one is still superior to it but the gag on the manga mentioned above or the passage with the characters who learn to fish are funny moments even more when like me we fish occasionally and we laugh at the mistakes of the characters that we made ourselves at the beginning

Same thing scenaristically I find the season 2 always at the top in term of fight but it remains of very good invoice: I mention all the same the fight of beginning between Ippo and Shimabukuro because we forget it enough considering what there is after but it is a great fight of beginning of season.
Because after we have my first surprise to know FINALLY we see fight of Aoki in whole, since Kimura had his hour of glory I waited that Aoki has his it was the only one of the trio not to have had it, his style of the Frog is very fun to see in more to be in front of an adversary mirror (the two are motivated by the love of their wife) and this blow of milking: this swivel of the head to make believe that something crazy is happening outside the ring and VLAN down, it reminded me the trick of Kiwi against Vegeta when he makes him believe that Freezer is behind before bombarding him with kikoha and in both cases it makes me laugh a lot.
Second big fight of the season Ippo vs Sawamura who is the second real villain of the manga, well unlike Hawk we know his past with his father who beat him, him who killed him to save his mother and the latter who abandoned him so there is still this ambiguous side to the character where Hawk as I said it was the absolute evil but it is still that in his immediate action he manages to make you wish to be dismantled piece by piece by Ippo and we know he does not carry in his heart, And the fight that follows is what I would call ""a happy mess"" with Samawura who transforms the ring into an open air tent flouting all the rules of boxing and still managing to put Ippo in trouble (not helped by his overtraining) it offers a good tension in addition to the unusual side of this fight which makes the task more difficult.
And the last major fight of course Takamura vs Eagle, Eagle is a cool opponent with a shonen motivation in the spirit (he wants to fight Takamura to see what kind of man can put Hawk in PTSD at the mere mention of his name) and it is precisely a Hawk reversed in terms of personality much more polite and friendly in order to propose an American character who is not an asshole (and we'll talk again about Americans) and not fall into the Manicheism that Ippo has always brilliantly avoided, and the fight that follows and just as mirror with Takamura vs Hawk, then it's a very long fight, even the longest of the anime, the characters make multiple openings until they have quite hot handicaps like blood in the eye (the worst thing to have in the middle of a match according to a close boxer friend) but it's much more professional where against Hawk it was an execution in public, It's so pro and shonen that when both seem to be at the end he orders to continue the match and even beaten he congratulates and encourages his opponent, no really it's an excellent mirror match.

However it's not the end and I think the best is at the end, when comes the flashback arc about the youth of Kamogawa and Nekota and how they helped Yuki against a new American scum which is for me one of the best arc of the manga, it's beautiful, it's just beautiful as an arc in what it tells and Yuki is really a wonderful character for his only appearance, not to mention that seeing Kamogawa and Nekota's bonus is a pure pleasure for the fan in me in addition to dealing with the consequences of the second world war on the characters suffering from radiation, well you address an absolute fan of Godzilla obviously it is a theme that speaks to me in Japanese works so you had the trifecta to conclude this season in beauty.

Oh and before I forget, best opening: Yakan Hikou is the song that I enjoyed listening to the most so I have no musical culture so it's not me who would do musical analysis but I love this song and visually it's beautiful so the 3D of the sets will not be to everyone's taste, but the transition between the different shots, the little idea like the moment between the characters in the sweat drops or just the animation of the exchange of shots absolutely crazy, in addition punaise they made Tumbling Dice come back during some scenes; ah it surprised me seeing how season 2 got rid of the compositions of season 1 but I really liked this return.

But here comes the unbearable collective expectation of a season 4, at least it will give me some reading in the meantime, I'll check it out but since there are 3 seasons, it must cover a big part....72 volume to catch up on at the time I'm writing? ah yeah, there's enough to make 5 seasons there."
21445,"spoilers for Big Order

Big Order is an enigma. It's beyond our comprehension, in the worst way possible. It throws you for all kinds of loops in the dumbest, more surreal ways imaginable, thinking that's it's a clever, emotional, deep, and truly thought-provoking being when in reality, it's a sloppy, horrifically told mess. Trying to really understand everything about it is to succumb to a Lovecraftian horror that will destroy your mind and soul since it actually manages to be both convoluted in all the potentially interesting and deep ways while fucking it all up and being convoluted the wrong ways. It doesn't answer all the right questions we are left with, and it sometimes answers them in ways that make things worse. Hell, it doesn't even understand the revolting implications of some of its characters actions, so how the hell can it expect to understand the major plot it has created?

It's actually futile to try to understand this anime since it doesn't even understand itself that well. It's like it's final antagonist, trying to delve deep into something it was never gonna truly get, making detrimentally wrong decisions, and losing sight of what it tried to do as it went and tried to one-up itself in ""craftiness"" and ""mind-bending twists"". It knows what it's trying to be, but that it's trying to be is something it cannot handle, which is truly fitting given that many of its characters suffer that exact same fate. So, just how badly did Big Order implode in on itself? Or rather, just what happened to make it suffer that fate? Well, let's find out, shall we?

Basically, 10 years ago, Eiji made a wish that ended up destroying the world, add that wish was to dominate it for world peace. Now, you're asking why didn't he say ""I want world peace""? The thing is, it wasn't his actual wish, it was his sister's. I know I'm jumping the gun but I need to tackle this early. The flashbacks make it seem like she's a girl who can comprehend full conversations and the state of our worlds as well as empathy by then we learn she was only 3, making this make little sense since actual 3 year olds don't do any of that. I know this because the flashback specifically states 10 years ago, as well as the fact that in the final episode, she turns 14 soon after the major events of the final episode. Now, basically, the plot tries to one up itself in terms of stringing its MC along for all sorts of twists, turns, betrayals, etc., so let's tackle some of them, as well as a few other moments and see what went wrong, shall we? After all, it's hard to really describe the plot well given how wrecked it is, but we can attack it's logic and see why the story falters, in sort of a rapid fire kind of fashion, though this isn't my usual formula.

When Kurenai Rin stabs Eiji's sister (Sena) in the shoulder with a sword and she bleeds horribly, you'd expect that when Eiji reaches her far more than 10 minutes later given how the episode presents itself, that she would actually be dead from blood loss. Eiji takes down two heavily armed and protected dudes by going ham with a sign (that was never shown), so yeah, that's dumb. If Rin wanted to finish off Eiji herself, she definitely shouldn't have ordered her men to riddle him with bullets (regardless of the fact that it didn't even work). When Eiji effectively puts her in his dominion, or rather, when he uses his order to block the shots before he uses his dominion order, she, for no reason, heals Sena and he never even ordered to. She wants to know why, and neither she nor we get a definite answer since we never hear him tell her to heal his sister. Barring the stuff I listed above that ultimately is explained away by the big Sena twist, this is basically all of the really crazy illogical moments from episode 1. Keep that in mind. Also at the end of the episode, Eiji uses his Order avatar to wrap Rin and given the audio and the way the episode fades to black for the credits, it basically sounds like he basically forced her into tentacle rape, and I'm not sure if they really wanted that implication or maybe they did it as a joke. Dunno.

Characters betray each other for no good reason. I mean, Franc betrays the group in episode 7 for no adequately explained reason only to do a face turn, only to do another heel turn in the finale. Characters also try to outsmart each other all the time, to varying and often pathetic degrees of success in terms of making any sense, like how in episode 4, one of the 10 members working for them was pretending to work for the enemy by giving the enemy heavily compromising information that jeopardizes his side's own plans to nearly getting their pawn (Eiji) killed (even though it easing their own order), or well, everything in one ginormous sequence in episode 7 that amounts to the two leaders trying to outwit each other until they are betrayed by one of their own (Rin for the bad guys and Franc for the ""good guys"", except Rin's was a part of the bad guys' plan). It's like the writer(s) decided to try to make the story one-up itself in terms of convoluted schemes of planning around plans and adding in betrayals regardless of whether or not it can be easy enough to remotely follow or if it all makes sense.

Characters also don't use their OP AF powers on ways that actually make good sense in their situations. There are a few notable accounts of this. Episode 3: Eiji has the Group of 10 (what a boring name) under his dominion and claims to be in control (though that's what they want), and he doesn't even do anything to bind them under his will aside from ""don't leave my domain"". If he really wanted to be in control, he should've tried to make them actually submit to his power and decisions via his dominion instead of saying ""you're in my dominion"" and expecting them to just follow him and not get him entangled in their scenes. Episode 6: A swordsman has an inter-dimensional sword that can slash between dimensions, and when he has Eiji and Iyo in his sights (as well as a now useless colleague and Kuroko (the Miko of vitality and couples in episode 6 who is gorgeous AF), he swipes vertically to kill the latter two. Even if it's revealed that Eiji needed to be alive for his father (the main antagonist), did he swordsman know that? Why not swipe vertically to kill everyone, or if he knew that he needed Eiji alive, why not depends diagonally to try to cut off a limb to make him more susceptible to capture? Episode 10: Sena Wishes dominion over the world for world peace. Even if she was basically 3 at the time, why didn't she just wish for world peace? So that the plot could happen? There had to have been better ways of making this work, like maybe trying to justify why she didn't (like maybe she wanted to emulate the world domination aspect of her idol book comic character, or maybe she didn't think it through at all). Instead, she wished for world domination and couldn't handle the power so it fucked over the world. Also, when Eiji wished to shoulder all of the damage she did with that wish, how does it equate to him taking her power, messing both his and her memories, and basically suppressing and replacing their memories of their father? Bah! Moving on!

As I said, this show doesn't understand any of the downright horrible implications of some of the characters' actions. Let's run down the list, shall we? The Group of Ten basically leaked info to basically ruin a high schooler's life by turning the world against him and manipulating him into their schemes just so they can kill his father and stop his plans, even knowing that both he and his sister were crucial in his plot. That literally makes no sense and the fact that they expect him to go along with it is especially galling. They basically made him a global pariah worse than Adolf Hitler, so no shit he often has a hard time of complying! In episode 4, Eiji and Sena are in bed with him on top in a very sexual position, and then we next see all of their clothes on the floor and an open shower curtain. Regardless of the fact that we only blatantly know that they're just showering together, it's very creepy for a teenage boy to shower with his not much younger sister at their ages. Also, given all of this context, you can imagine that the implications of actual incest run rampant here, which is just not good. Hell, the fact that she kisses him in the final episode of the anime (without any context to blatantly suggest otherwise), it's basically confirmed that she was wanting to have incest with him, or at least heavy implications make it come off that way.

Time for this last example to really sell my point home. In episode 9, Iyo has Eiji handcuffed to a bed with just his shirt off and they take off their clothes, but he is trying to decline sex in favor of current matters, and given the context of what's going on, it's implied from the anime that she was already sorta having sex anyway thanks to Eiji's line about her going any deeper, and again, he never actually consented and she was still trying to have sex with him. Does that sound like rape to you, because it does to me. Don't try to give me some bullshit spheal about ""women can't rape men, that's not how that works; at worst, it's only physically possible for it to be sexual harassment or assault"" since she had him chained up to something without his knowledge or consent and is trying to have (and given the anime's context, likely in the middle of having) sex regardless of his declining (likely because he'd rather save it for a time where his sister wasn't in danger) so that counts as attempted rape, even if none of the characters realize it as such. Do you see what I mean by horrid implications that no character seems to take into consideration regarding their actions!

Before we get to the real meat of the convoluted nature of the series, let’s also smash a few weird ass scenes apart since, well, this anime is beyond strange. The ultimate example of this is the beginning of episode 5. Kagekiyo basically grabs and fondles the tits of Rin, Mari (the chick with the glasses and lasers), and Iyo, all while basically having an orgasm over their “twin peaks” when she fondles them enough, getting her ass kicked every time, brushing it off like it's nothing before moving to her next target, and not learning not to be such a perv to other women. All this scene adds is time and discomfort. I've already talked about the episode 4 scene that really hints at incest, so I'll tackle one more scene: Eiji gets an arm and a leg cut off in episode 8, and the moment he uses the Eiji x Iyo fusion of his Order avatar, he can suddenly manipulate his limbs to attach to him for no reason other than asspulls since it was never shown to be able to do that. I know orders defy conventional logic, but they only do that via the user’s ordered actions, not by nature of their existence.

There’s this whole thing about how the people hate Order users because they hate Eiji for what happened to the world. Problem is, the way they go about this is hamfisted. Civilians in this show are absurdly hateful and are portrayed in this vicious, uncivilized, basically evil light. Also, you know, it seems like none of them try to move on from their grief and put it past them in order to try to live a better life. I get that their families were killed and their lives were inverted but everyone comes off as insanely hateful for the sake of it. I'll address the final thing that makes the civilians on the show horrible when we get there.

Yeah, time to delve into the big plot of the second half. Given that the anime ended a few months before the manga did, I can only assume that all of this, or at least a good chunk of it (namely the final episode or 3) was filler, though even with the research I did (without reading the manga or knowing someone who has) I cannot prove this. Well, it turns out that the Group of 10 were initially meant to track down and kill Genai, Eiji’s father, and you can refer to a few paragraphs ago on why that is horse shit when taking everything into account. Also, the bad guys are tracking down and trying to kill mikos. Apparently it's because they are involved in this pentagram involved with the gate to this mental world that he wants to unlock because it was Sena that originally did so, though she couldn't control it, causing the world to be ravaged, apparently so that he can create an infinite amount of parallel universes, including ones where Sena’s wish was granted and she was happy and world peace, even if it means forsaking the universe that we are currently seeing our characters in and everyone storms the place and betrayals and Eiji denouncing his goal and getting stabbed by his sister and then fusing orders and kicking ass and winning and God shows up and the world is now good and now that means everyone sees Eiji as a hero which makes no sense given how much whiplash that is with how hateful they were and good ending and blah blah blah! I'm not even gonna question any more aspects of the finale like the memory parasite robots or anything since my mind is fried beyond belief. 

Another crucial problem is that very few of these characters have any remotely interesting personality to speak of, so I'll prattle a lot of them off quick. The Group of 10 are mostly useless, with only a few of them being relevant like the leader, Mari, Iyo, and 3 other dudes who only do one specific thing like flying, teleporting, and punching, and some of them are so useless that they don't even have any real screen time, and of course, each of them is basically one note and dull, even the fun-loving flying and punching dudes are just meh, and are just there for deus ex machinas. Even the main character Eiji is a boring teen protagonist who is basically Lelouch if he had the personality of an ordinary school protagonist, including his devotion to making his sister happy. Rin is just an annoying chick who always wants to kill Eiji until one final sappy scene where she motivates him in the final episode. Also, yeah, different hair color aside, her design is strikingly similar to that of Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Kagekiyo is just a vengeful and quirky person who also happens to be a total perv (and probably either bi or lesbian given the twin peaks scene in episode 5), and is basically irrelevant aside from episodes 3 and 4, and one scene in the finale. Also, Sena is basically a worse Nunnally who sorta is in love with her brother and is the one  actually responsible for the world ending. Plus, her heel turn in episode 9 was abominable.

Now into the full-blown antagonists. I don't even think most of them have names aside from Jyuubei (the sword guy) and Genai (the main antagonist). Aside from Genso, there nothing but generic, borderline personality-less baddies. It's sad when Fairy Tail can come up with tons of evil teams (Oración Seis, Tartarus, Grimoire Heart, Phantom Lord, and a good few others) that have each and every character have some kind of defined personality with some of them getting sort of fleshed out, and in rarer cases, even developed and yet no one here has a truly concrete personality aside from the most generic templates of a personality. Genai has this weird obsession with flowers and the series tries its damnedest to make him a sympathetic scientist father whose plans drove him insane and ruined everything for everyone, but when they can't even do a good job with his backstory, the backstory about him for one of the characters, or even how despite supposedly  caring so much for Eiji and Sena he never actually shows care after the major incident (he never looks for them orthopedic to get others to do the same, and he doesn't care how badly their hurt as long as they're alive and useful), even he misses the mark. 

I can't even really begin to describe Daisy in any way that isn't how much teasing he does to Eiji about his powers and memories. She is as much of an enigma as the show itself, and I don't think it was as intentional as you might think since we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she was used as the vessel of an experiment that caused her to become some kind of floating person that hands out Orders. We never really see that from her perspective, nor does she really have anything concrete about her aside from her great looks and how much she teases Eiji about pertinent information. What was she like before? Did the change affect her in any way? Why did she get a job as a waitress at the end of the series! Despite being one of the more prominent characters in the series, I probably have the least feel for what kind of personality she has. Also, the only Miko we get to know aside from Iyo is Kuroko, a beautiful lady who has perfect vitality and spend her days basically forging couples, and it's funny to hear her get annoyed when Eiji and Iyo don't understand one another and have awkward moments despite them being obviously the pair that will be a couple, though she doesn't really get to do much since she was killed off unceremoniously. She was, all things considered, the best character in the show, and when a basically one-off character is the best character in your entire series, that's pretty pathetic.

The character art...is inconsistent. Sometimes it looks amazing, with all sorts of wonderful shading to complement the (mostly) wonderful (albeit sometimes borderline copy paste) character designs, and other times, it looks flat with characters having none of that shading. It would've been great if Studio Asread were capable of doing what Studio Wit did with Kabaneri and managed to have the perfect shading all the time instead of only sometimes, but hey, it's better than having the flat looking moments for the characters all the time. Only one design looks terrible and that's Kagekiyo’s, especially with those absurdly pointy nipples that stick out from her g-string big time. The actual animation isn't spectacular but ultimately competent, despite a few laughable moments like the way Eiji turns/slides in episode 2 (I bet you know the scene I'm talking about). The censorship is pretty terrible though, but not as horrid as the usual black bars or even black circles. The kaleidoscope imagery looked nice though, even if the series doesn't really do well in terms of having contrasting light and shadow in the same frame. Also, the CGI is pretty terrible, not just with the avatars, but especially with the nukes in episode 4 and just how prevalent the CGI is, also bogs it all down, especially since it doesn't work well with the aesthetic of the series, nor does it look good on its own. I do at least like when the imagery gets really triply like with the world destruction and with most of the final episode.

The OP “Disorder” by Yousei Teikoku...is certainly fitting in terms of its chaotic nature and how much of a mess Big Order is. I don't particularly like it, especially in comparison to some of her other songs like Mirai Nikki OP 1 or Deus’s character song. The ED “Kobore Sekai Oware (毀レ世カイ終ワレ)"" by Aki Hata is...fascinating. Both somewhat unnerving and simultaneously alluring. I really like it, more so than any other piece of music in the series. The Actual OST is somewhat ok but is really unfitting (with tons of jazz pieces that sound like they’d be playing at certain parts of a fun spy series instead of an anime like this), and some of them, especially the track “Dominate” are played over and over again and it gets annoying since none of the tracks (aside from track 7) are particularly good. It's not that they're bad, it's that they are overused and ill-fitting most of 

For a while now, Big Order was easily the most enjoyable train wreck I had ever seen. It's decisions were so baffling and out of left field that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off constantly throughout the first 6 episodes. It wasn't enjoyable in the conventional sense and the episodes got increasingly aggravating, but the last 4 episode felt more aggravating than funny bad, mainly due to how it grew stale and unbelievably convoluted, and the fact that it tried harder than ever to be serious and heartfelt rather than crazy and fun in terms of what it was trying to do. I don't actually hate the ending, partially because I couldn't even care anymore and my mind was crashing like Hindenburg or the Titanic, and blowing up like a Megaman boss. I was more distraught by its failures than infuriated or poised to laugh at them in the last 4 episodes, especially the finale. Plus, certain implications and true ramifications of situations really broke me at times. Nonetheless, I can say that for most part, I consider it to be the first truly effective schlock title I have ever seen, in the way that I laughed my ass off constantly throughout a majority of the run, for whatever that's worth.

Big Order is an absolute mess. It's not just convoluted, but stupidly confusing and confusingly stupid. It becomes legitimately hard to grasp as to what is actually wrong with the story and what is just convoluted and/or absurd but intentional and not harmful. As your mind tries to parse all that, as well as the awful CGI and constant kaleidoscope imagery, as well as the unfitting music that makes you speculate as to what kind of series the OST would better suit, it all moves along at breakneck speeds. It's mentally taxing for sure, and not even mostly good character art, a few good songs, or even kaleidoscope imagery can remotely salvage that. You actively need to be mentally prepared to sit through this show or you will be left in the dust worse than any unprepared schmuck watching episode 20 of Ergo Proxy, which is an actually good anime that comes off as very convoluted at times. Big Order is a big pile ‘o shit and it deserves its dismal rating. It's sort of fascinating in a way if you’re capable of keeping up somewhat with the absurd narrative and decisions of the show, which is probably its biggest strength despite being fully comprised of the show’s fatal flaws.

Music anime with girl bands or groups being the focus have never been more prominent in the anime sphere, with recent hits like Bocchi the Rock, and old hits like K-On. In this season alone, we saw the revitalization of another old music hit in Sound! Euphonium Season 3, and new kids on the block in Girls Band Cry, and Jellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night. There’s so much that writers can do with this type of show, from stories of inspiration, stories of young people trying to find their passion, or in other cases, more comedy-oriented shows that serve to brighten up one’s day. In the end, the formula remains similar, to showcase the growth of the characters and their differing personalties, through their involvement in a music group.

Jellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night is a bit of an odd case to me, because while it has its share of light-hearted moments, and the comedy is snappy and quite honestly, amazing at times, it also goes down the slippery slope of leaning into heavy melodrama. With the limited runtime that this had, with just twelve episodes, it was a bit of a questionable decision to me. In the first number of episodes, it was all about how people motivate each other, rather it was through art, music, or any other expressive outlet, and it was indeed very interesting. As the characters got introduced, they were characterized through various backstories that showed how tough their pasts were, or how they got to know other characters in the show. I’m not always a big fan of that story structure, as while it might provide great emotional highs, I’d much rather see the characters get characterized with how they act in the present, which this show does eventually do as well.

I call this an odd case, because each individual bit of character drama was honestly handled quite well, with very realistic and relatable struggles, for example, wanting to enjoy and behave in a way that people think is “childish”, or having one’s path to stardom broken because of a response to injustice. It led to some brilliant character chemistry between the members of JELEE for sure, but I also don’t think the drama contributed to the big picture of the story well enough, and also got in the way of what I expected the show to be more like, which was seeing the creative process of JELEE’s music.

To do all this in twelve episodes is no easy feat, and I just do not think there was enough time here to flesh everything out. The messages were really good, the pieces were there, but with twelve episodes, it was virtually impossible to fit in the progression of JELEE and the character drama, leading to various aspects feeling contrived and rushed, lacking the organic growth that we could have seen if this series had more of a runtime. JELEE gains a following in almost no time at all due to a timeskip, Mahiru’s art is suddenly highly respected from being mocked just a few episodes prior. Suddenly, a performance at a venue happens with not much build up. A career is put to a halt because of one single internet warrior. The antagonistic character suddenly goes along with what the protagonist proposes. You get my drift. Could this all have been fit into twelve episodes if the script was just a bit tighter? It’s hard to say how this anime should have went, because on the one hand, if you don’t have the comedy and light-hearted moments, the audience would not have as much of an attachment to the characters and their respective personalities, though on the other hand, if you don’t have the drama, the plot does not move forward. The best anime series are able to balance both the aspects of character building and pacing effectively. I do believe that the script could have been a bit tighter with the removal of a few characters, such as Baba and Koharu, so that the eventual drama could be less contrived. Again, I want to emphasize that the individual stories were good, but they just did not mesh well enough with each other. Some emphasis of side characters took away from Kano and Mahiru’s issues, and led to the overall storyline being resolved rather haphazardly.

Visually, this anime is stunning. Props to Ryouhei Takeshita for directing this as well as he did. It had a very snappy feeling in the editing made it a great vessel for comedic timing, which I still believe is the strongest part about this anime. I might not have agreed with some of the drama, but the way some of the dramatic scenes were directed was superb, along with the sound direction, to illicit as much emotion as they could out of the viewers. Furthermore, the voice acting performances here were excellent. Shout out to Rie Takahashi, Miyu Tomita, Miku Itou, and Miyuri Shimabukuro for their incredible work as Kano, Kiui, Mahiru, and Mei, respectively. There were also several music videos from JELEE that served as special ending themes, and you could see the improvement in the visuals with each passing music video. That type of subtle growth was what I wanted this anime to be like, but obviously, it went in a different direction.

With how solid the first few episodes were, I think it really showed that sometimes, things do not need to be deep and hugely thought-provoking to be good. The message was there, the characters were perfectly fine, the growth was JELEE was being seen, the comedy was snappy and funny, but the decision to go into heavy melodrama was one step I feel this anime did not need to take. The sheer energy of the show, the vibrance of the characters, all of that was sucked out with the melodrama, because even though the comedy still remained throughout, there was always that bit of drama that loomed large over it all, leaving it less fun than it could have been. It lacked a proper identity, and tried to do too much in a short amount of runtime.

In the end, it was like a slightly overcooked steak. It tastes good, but it is chewy, and leaves you slightly underwhelmed. Occasionally, some anime just have that sort of a fate. Oh, what this could have been…"
163142,"What a weird show.... Seriously, it refuses to adhere to things such as ""logic"" or ""common sense"", containing some baffling decisions, such as having its worse looking episode be its first and making its final episode end with a fucking slideshow. Seriously, what the hell.
The best way I can describe this anime is ""disappointing"". It's not a bad story, the voice actors aren't bad, the animation (generally) isn't all that terrible, but its an extremely poor adaptation. 

Let's first talk about the art. So many aspects of it look so weird, for instance, it looks like [someone poured gasoline in everyone's hair]( sometimes everyone just freezes for a bit while we wait for someone to just finish talking, the 3D looks absolutely terrible, it constantly reuses stuff, it often looks jank, the colors often seem off, the lip syncing is off sometimes, etc., it's not bad looking, but it has so many small little things that constantly pick away at its overall quality that it just left me with an overall negative impression. The sound design has a similar problem with it's just generally unpolished, which left me thinking of it as amateurish. Sometimes it's perfectly fine, however, other times its bafflingly out of sync with the action on screen (there were some scene where I was seriously wondering how they let sound work this bad pass), uses sounds that just feel completely off or uses repetitive sound effects (including a few stock ones that felt really out of place). Again, same story with the voice acting, it generally isn't bad at all (actually, it's probably the most consistent part of the show), however, there are a few instances where it sounds stiff or off. 
The story ends up being a 1 to 1 recreation of A Returner's Magic Should Be Special's, so while it's not bad, it ruins its source material by making the pacing so much more terrible than the original. Everything is left in, including stuff that clearly doesn't work outside the comic format like there being a pause everything Desir uses magic analysis so we can see his eye light up and the action being cut up by dialogue (nothing is allowed to happen as long as someone is talking, this is true for basically every single scene). These issues make the show feel unbearably slow at times, with some moments feeling as if they twice as long as they really needed to be. Nothing being cut (from a story that was already somewhat slow at times to begin with) does mean the story doesn't feel rushed and characters get properly developed, yes, however, it's really not worth it when it means the end result ends up being this slow. Words cannot do justice to how mind numbing some scenes are, I couldn't believe the fact no one brought up, at any point throughout the process of making this show, how slow some of the scenes were. 

Mid 5. All things considered, it's not terrible, like the title of this review says, it's disappointing, but it's not terrible thanks to the base it uses. If you should take 1 thing away from this review it's this : don't watch this. Just read the web comic instead."
477,"Aria is a masterpiece. Everything from the characters, story, setting, art, and sound all come together to make an experience I will never forget. Aria the Animation is the perfect beginning to this journey. I'll be writing based on the assumption that you have seen or know about this series already. Some spoilers included. 

Aria the Animation introduces you to the characters and world you'll be spending time with throughout the rest of the series. The city Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua. Neo-Venezia is my favorite setting in anime. It's beautifully detailed with interesting culture and locations. Animation doesn't spend as much time exploring Aqua as it does introducing characters and their relationships with each other. Akari, Aika, and Athena are ones I love in particular. I can see myself in Aika to some extent as I am a blunt straightforward person at times like her. She is just a very interesting and complex character from the get go from her admiration of Alicia, which she doesn't try to hide at all, to her secretly cherishing Akira's mentoring. Her relationship with Akari is also really cute and fun. Their personalities are practically opposite of each other which makes for really entertaining moments. As for Akari herself I adore her love for Aqua and endlessly positive attitude. Athena is memorable to me because of her beautiful singing. I listen to it almost daily and it's always as amazing as it was the first time I heard it. 

When it comes to Neo-Venezia the supernatural elements are my favorite part. This season introduces these elements with a young girl with a bell. The girl sends Akari on a wild goose to deliver an undeliverable letter. By the end the girl is revealed to be a pet cat of someone who lived on Aqua in the past. Another example of the supernatural elements this season is when Akari goes through a tunnel to the past before Aqua became a planet of miracles. We get to see the moment when Aqua becomes said planet and it's a beautiful moment. Easily the best of the season and exemplifies the greatest thing about this series. The mystery, wonder, and miracles of every day life. Art wise Aria has beautiful visuals. The waterways and architecture are all so beautiful to look at. This and the minor/background characters truly bring Neo-Venezia to life. 

My favorite theme of Aria is to find joy in life. Find the meaningful side of every situation and every location. There are miracles all around us. We just have to find them. Akari embodies this mentality and inspires me to do the same. Aria is an unforgettable journey worth the time to go on. It will soothe your soul and create memories to cherish forever. If you haven't seen Aria I wholeheartedly recommend it. Thank you for reading."

Though Pokémon: The Origin is decidedly too short for its own good, it still manages to tell a concise and entertaining tale that doesn't require the viewer to have prior experience with the franchise to enjoy (though I would imagine that it helps).  As someone outside the fandom, I would feel comfortable suggesting it to a general audience given the lack of commitment needed to partake.

Again, the most noticeable thing about this anime is how short it is.  Having at least 6 episodes instead of just 4 would have done it wonders (though at the same time its shorter run-time makes it easier to watch in one sitting).  Regardless, while it could've used its time a little more efficiently it still used it well.  Instead of showing the entire journey it takes a number of key portions in that journey and takes some time to flesh them out, which actually makes it feel more whole.

While serious Pokémon fans might berate it for taking this approach, I'd say that for something this short it would've been a bad thing for it to have tried to show the entire journey.  Sure, we don't see most of the 150-odd Pokémon that Red sets out to catch or all of the gym battles and so forth, but we do get to see enough of these things to know that they're being done and what it looks like.

img600()
Pokémon: The Origin shows Pokémon fighting just long enough to leave PETA members appalled.

For people familiar with the game it allows the show to go deep enough to tap into their nostalgia, while for those of us who never played Pokémon it offers an idea of what it feels like to be engrossed in the game without stagnating itself on the (seemingly) repetitive side of things where you throw balls at monsters and then train them into all-powerful fighters to throw at more monsters for hours on end.

That's not to say it's a flawless approach either.  It still doesn't leave much time for most characters to develop or flesh out, and of course it's harder to get invested in a story that's only half-shown.  Still, at the end of the day the journey itself was preserved through its highlights.

The production values were not exactly memorable, yet did their job proficiently. Animation-wise Pokémon: The Origin does offer rather appealing visuals (though not breathtaking) without making it difficult to see the world it draws up as the game it represents. The music & sound do their jobs well enough.  If they offered anything nostalgic I was not in the position to pick up on it. 

Pokémon: The Origin could've gone from good to great with more time to develop, but it managed to use it's short time well enough to at least be enjoyable.  It's a decent watch if you're thinking about checking out Pokémon but don't want to sink too much time into a game or different anime."
21335,"One Piece Film Gold, a canon movie that takes place right after Dressrosa, impressed me almost as much as it surprised me.

As my first movie from a series with very many movies, I expected it to be slightly-above-average for a mini story, but it's more than that.

Production

Right from the intro scenes, it feels like a VIP experience: quick and flashy introduction of our beloved straw hats, in new fancy outfits, and matching flamboyant scenery, with jokes, laughter, and enthusiasm as they enter. Throughout the whole movie, the music, designs, and everything all give a feel to match the golden place they enter. And just the production overall is pretty stunning for a 2016 movie.



And despite taking place literally after Dressrosa, the power scalings are kept intact and everything is logical, which is something I worried it'd mess up.

The Surprises

It doesn't even follow the usual side-story format you'd expect. One of the straw hats is taken out of commission. There were many parts where I thought ""Ok, cool, good movie, now they're gonna have Luffy beat up the bad guy and end the movie, yay"", but the movie did not do that, it still went on, and had plenty more to offer. Yet even so it didn't feel drawn out; the pacing is perfect.

And as a special note, Film Gold has more surprises and plot twists than one movie should be allowed to have. You go right into it thinking 'oh, that's suspicious. those people might betray these people?' but the surprises never end. You're kept guessing, both in the fights and in the alliances, until the crazy end twist.

Depth

Film Gold does get pretty dark pretty fast, with straight-up death early on. It wastes no time creating a deep plot ad getting right to it. The dark parts have even higher stakes later on in the movie, with more people and a theme of despair / hope.

Besides that, there are multiple perspectives shown, not just the protagonists'. Even the 'bad guy' characters have their own, complex, motivations, which are shown in gradual flashbacks, and while alot of details are intentionally left out, it all paints a clear (and somewhat tragic) picture by the end.

And the side characters exclusive to this movie are golden too. They have style as well as depth, and I wouldn't mind if more of them were kept for the main show (especially Raise Max).

""Is this movie worth my time?""

That depends. If you don't really care for side movies, then you can pass it just fine. If you are looking for a really fun movie, and you are past Dressrosa, then I do recommend. It literally does everything I could ask of a movie. I am personally really looking forward to watching more One Piece movies after this."
142193,"Reborn to Master the Blade: From Hero-King to Extraordinary Squire is an isekai-fantasy light novel written by [Hayaken](https://anilist.co/staff/123654/Hayaken). It was adapted into a 12-episode anime by Studio Comet.



I will cut to the chase.. this anime sucks. 
I first saw it while overviewing the Winter 2023 season, the premise was generic, but I did get interested in its gender-bending gimmick. It sounded like fun. I was open to giving it a try, especially when it had an above 75% score.. for some reason? 

I thought it would be some dumb fun like Season 1 of How Not to Summon a Demon Lord. Nothing great, but fun enough to keep you entertained. But nope it is incredibly boring, so boring I would rather watch Naruto filler. This is the type of anime you use as examples when trying to list bad Isekai to someone.

This is a generic power fantasy. A reincarnation story of an old king reincarnating as a busty silver-haired girl named  Inglis ""Chris"" Eucus.  His main goal in his second life is to become the strongest person possible... but it’s so booooring.. It reminded me of The Strongest Sage with The Weakest Crest, as each episode kept getting duller and duller.

World-building? There was world-building? 
Umm, let's see monsters attack people, some people get crests on their hands to use magic but our OP MC can gather mana from the atmosphere or some shit. Some supremacists called highlanders look down on common people, and some resistance groups forms trying to kill the highlanders. While our MC goes to school and wants to fight fight fight.



Chris is one of the worst main characters I have had the displeasure of watching. Watching her is the equivalent of self-harm to the brain. She is dumber than Goku from Dragon Ball Super and her key personality trait is that she loves to fight.. and she reminds you over and over again. More in a single cour than a majority of battles Shonens. 

She is incredibly smug with no humility or weaknesses. There is no purpose to her even being gender-bended into a female body, except for an internal monologue or two.

Incredibly powerful no less. She no diffs every single character in the series. Despite being called Reborn to Master the Blade, she never uses a sword! Instead just throws her hands and shoots Kamehameha waves as a baby. Whenever I hear the term Mary Sue, Chris will pop into my brain from now on.

The side characters are not worth mentioning in the slightest, all of them feel like Oblivion NPCs that you can summarize in a single sentence.



The production values are what you usually see out of J.C. Staff's C team.

The art style is appealing to me, but the animation is bad. Punches have no weight behind them, half of an episode you have characters just moving their lip flaps in a room with uninteresting dialog, and the CGI for the monsters is exceptionally bad.

The sound design wasn't anything noteworthy, and it felt like even the voice actors just wanted to quickly record their lines and bail.. but at least the opening is good.

Would I recommend this anime? Hell no.
It is boring, uninspiring, and has a truly terrible main character."
8142,"- This review is being written under a subjective lens and mainly enjoyment. 

- If you come to expect opinions from a very critical sense, wrong place. A lot of people online come to expect reviews as such, this review ain’t gonna be like that. I just like to talk about anime I enjoy. And so this review is about such things. Sorry if this ain't what you're looking for.




Colorful  The Motion Picture is a film released in 2010 from Sunrise Studios and Ascension.  Based on a Japanese novel from Mori Eto, this movie has also won some awards in film festivals.

Overall, I would personally rate this a 9/10 on my scale.  If you have the 2 hours and are in the mood for a film in an animated format, check it out and form your own opinion about it.

As for the why, that following review explains about it.  I’ll try to keep spoilers to a minimum!  When making this review, I watched this in subtitles.




I believe to gain maximum enjoyment from this film, you have to understand some aspects of Japanese society’s culture in terms of their values, relationships, beliefs, and structure.  If I watched this film without understanding some aspects of Japanese culture then I probably will not get certain scenes and why they are important.

Does this mean you shouldn’t watch this film without understanding some cultural aspects?  No!  You can infer why certain aspects are important because the story is resonant everywhere in all societies anyways (albeit in certain societies in the South-east Asian countries lol).  Considering the good presentation, you can pick up what’s confusing and look up why certain things are confusing.  We all have to start from somewhere anyways.

Maybe the dubbed version of the film was able to successfully localize/translate the intricacies of its setting and characters, someone else will have to comment about that.




Since I talked about the presentation earlier, I’ll talk about it here.  I think the way the story is unravelled by the Colorful production team was outstanding in terms of its pacing.  I have never felt like the story dragged at any parts.  Everything felt relevant and the story had a lot of themes to tell.  Its soundtrack really complemented certain scenes alongside the animation.  This animation is movie quality for sure and nothing felt out of place unless you’re so absolutely abhorrent to CG assets but don’t let that blind you from what it’s trying to tell.  And what I think gives the movie a huge plus is the fact that it utilizes a good mix of narration & show don’t tell.  I’m a fan of show don’t tell directing and so it was a very welcome surprise to see it utilized in the movie.

Another positive for me is that I barely saw any anime-ism tropes that plague a lot of anime today.  While I do enjoy those tropes, sometimes it can become too saturated for one's taste which is understandable.  So, if you’re sick of anime-ism tropes but want to see a nice story told, check this out.  While it has a supernatural aspect to it, it’s not like taken to extremes and a lot of the film feels super grounded in what it’s trying to tell.

Alongside the stellar animation and story are the voice actors.  They really helped sell the scenes and I think they deserve praise for their efforts.  It worked in tandem with the body language the animators made.  I really enjoyed the voice acting performance from everyone.

It was an overall satisfying experience and I don’t have much complaints personally.  This movie may not be for everyone but I say it’s worth checking out if you’re ever in the mood for these types of stories.  Our tastes evolve over time after all.  Hope you have a good time and thanks for reading the review!



The section below is me talking about spoilers because I want to talk about it.  I wouldn’t recommend reading it if you haven’t seen the film before as it may hinder your enjoyment from knowing things you shouldn't ahead of time.




! This film is honestly a great case for showing how important it is to have characterization and just be empathetic of people in general.  The entire point of the film is that everyone is colorful and there’s more to people than meets the eye.  I believe this understanding is missing in conflicts in the world.  While emotions are valid, it’s the empathetic feeling that I find most people miss out/ignore from all sides.

Anyways, did you like that theme/title drop during Makoto’s console of Hiroka in the Art room?  I sure did.  It actually confused me a bit on why Hiroka was so confused and what she was talking about until I realized she’s confused about who she is as an individual in middle school.  Part of growing up really.

It seemed a little bit obvious about how people are 3-dimensional and it’s not uncommon in certain stories.  I just liked the way they presented this theme and story.  It felt raw with how it executed its scenes and knowing how the Japanese are like with getting into a better academic program, how reputation is tied to who you’re associated with, cram school, bullying, communal culture, etc.  It really elevates the type of empathy that isn’t seen in many Western films I’ve seen really.  Felt like its own unique thing.  Though I’m a huge af weeb lol.

I think it was also a nice commentary about the social structure in their society.  They cannot talk about certain subjects but they have to face it eventually as they’re important issues.  It’s only with grit and facing things forward are you able to tackle challenges that go your way.  This will turn things ugly.  Nobody wants to talk about how your wife had an affair, how you neglected your family to work so much that your own child attempted suicide, how your little brother is suffering academically and generally overall unhappy.  These are very taboo subjects to bring up about.  It was super respectful and realistic about these portrayals of said subjects especially in a Japanese context.  

We value so much on academics but not on the other talents of individuals and it really comes into question about us as a society on how we value other people.  Everybody is colorful in their own right but why do we only value certain colors over others?  Why does everyone have to be a certain color?  We’re all ugly, bitter, and at the same time - beautiful.  A range of personality traits to form a character overall.

In a way, it’s a theme about a person’s humanity and the respect for them as an individual.  A simple story about how even the littlest of good gestures can go a long way for helping people out.  I saw someone mention in the forums how if you relate a lot, it will impact a lot and I think that’s why I’ve been thrilled about it.  The little moments and bonds you have with people can matter a lot to certain individuals.  It may feel like nothing on the other side (which I also too have experienced), but it’s something that is cherished.

This film had a lot going with it and I don’t know if I was able to successfully unpack it all, maybe someone will.  Hell, I enjoyed that aspect where it said a lot but didn’t push it down my throat.  Maybe I’ll rewatch it in the future.  The final line of being alive and what it means to be alive feels similar to other anime.  Of course, that’s just one way of looking at things but yeah, it’s nice.

I hope the people reading this know that “You’re alive and kicking.”  There’s a lot of awful things in this world but there are also a lot of good things too even if the world is all bleak.  This is all like a painting in a way haha.

If you somehow managed to make it to the end, thanks for reading.  If you like talking about anime, hmu, I always love talking about anime.  

I tend to write long essays in general for these reviews and I know it can be a chore so I do appreciate you taking the time especially with the attention span of people’s being so little haha.

13469,"Note: There will be some spoilers as this review comprises of an analysis of specific plot points

As odd it may be, I am here writing a review of an anime, released around 10years ago now with little reception in recent days. Compared to the main series, this episode was not flashy neither was the mystery intricately woven to warrant massive praise. So why have I decided to write one, not for the 2-cour anime, but for this OVA? Firstly, this is my first rewatch and I have came to better appreciate it. Secondly, I am truly baffled at the interpretation and perspective of this additional episode. I decided to do it justice by providing context for the reader that stumbles upon this review so that more will come to recognize its value much as I have.

Before transiting into the overview, I would like everyone to keep in mind that this OVA is actually an original anime. It never originated from the ""Koten-Bu"" novels by Honobu Yonezawa, the author of the ""Classics Club"" Series better known as ""Hyouka"".

The Hyouka OVA: ""What Should be Had"" is a greatly misunderstood piece of work. Many simply disregard this as a 'fan service episode' and while I may agree to such a statement on an outward front, I would argue that there is much more processing psychologically and emotionally.

This episode follows the previous, 2nd arc which left Oreki Houtarou dejected from his failure to 'solve' the mystery. We begin with Houtarou being offered a job at the pool. We know Houtarou to an extent and there’s no reason for him to take it up(even if it’s for money) “If I don’t have to do it, I won’t”, he has no financial struggles yet he does not react or even slide a snarky remark in his inevitable acceptance.

img400()

Throughout this episode, Houtarou was emotionless and rather bland in all his actions—similar to what Satoshi once said, this represents a colourless personality. Chitanda while not being as sensitive as the other two deduced from her conversation with Houtarou that he had certain self doubt because of his abilities(due to his recent failure) and encourages him with reassuring words. His talent-crisis made him doubtful about helping his friends but Chitanda reassures Houtarou throughout all their conversations; what he does is special and he very much is special too. Additionally, Mayaka and Satoshi realizes his ‘blandness’. Satoshi points out to Houtarou his lack of emotion while Mayaka notes his lack of spirit. Regardless how lazy Houtarou is, he is still human and characterized by these qualities. Without them was the bland personality we witnessed—a colourless personality.

>”At least give me some reaction, even if it’s gripping. You’re being a bore.”

The episode reaches its turning point when Houtarou decided to present his theory on the mystery. He lets out a sigh conveying to us that there was self-doubt. It reminds us of the burden from his failure and psychological aftermath on Houtarou. He was concerned about another failure yet he takes this step. He was becoming like himself again.

As the episode draws to a close, Satoshi intends to grab himself a nice treat: an ice cream. What a coincidence as that not only reminds Mayaka but serves as our reminder and a transition to the subsequent, 3rd arc where “Hyouka” becomes relevant again. Subsequently, Houtarou had a final interaction with Chitanda and now displays his emotions that portrays his cynicism and laziness. He is finally himself again. And as a nice touch, his final remark(to the job) is the response he should have given(to his sister) from the very beginning.

img400()

""What Should be Had"" showed us how much Houtarou's friends value him and despite the disappointment they expressed at him in the previous arc, it did not change their respect and appreciation for him as a friend. The value of being needed by someone is an idea many propose to be essential in life. While the title is subjected to interpretation, it is undeniable that this episode acts as an important reconciliation for the group and bridges the unanswered gap in Honobu Yonezawa's novels. In this respect, the producers and director did an excellent job in presenting us a meaningful and worthwhile episode."
98448,"It has been some time since we obtained Subject T-33. Recently, we have learned of something about him that we could use to get a great experiment out of him. Henceforth, while I am a new member of the Theoretical Generalyzing Goblins group, I shall take the reins and begin experiment K-2.

Since acquiring T-33, we have gotten him to calm down a bit. However, as a matter of precaution for what I am about to show him today, I've requested our staff of orderlies to relocate him once again to the padded room. Let's go meet with the Subject now.

Hm? Oh, nothing. Go ahead and eat our The Golden Goblin™ apple.

""Oh... this is horrible! What the hell... this isn't an apple at all! Like sure the outside is gold and looks great, but why is the inside just filled with dirt???""

Please finish the apple. You shouldn't waste food.

""This is awful! With every bite, it just somehow gets even worse! Why would you do this???""

Coincidentally and completely unrelated to this apple experiment, did you know that there is a new Kino no Tabi anime? I've been told that you loved the original.

""Holy shit, they did a new season??? Can I watch it?""

Of course you can! Why, we wish for you to review it!

""...Wait, why would you want me to revi--""




...Kino no Tabi, or Kino's Journey, is a [novel series](https://anilist.co/manga/30399/KinonoTabiTheBeautifulWorld) by [Keiichi Sigsawa](https://anilist.co/staff/97373/KeiichiSigsawa) that's been going on for seventeen years now, with twenty one published volumes at the time of writing this review as well as a [spin-off series](https://anilist.co/manga/41263/GakuenKino). It received [an anime in 2003](https://anilist.co/anime/486/KinonoTabiTheBeautifulWorld) but for several reasons, I am not going to base this review heavily off of comparisons to the original anime. 

Don't get me wrong, there'll still be a separate section for that, but I want to stress that the several problems I have with this show go beyond... the remake episodes.

Additionally, with the new anime, it received two separate new manga adaptations, both by different artists. [One](https://anilist.co/manga/98489/KinonoTabiTheBeautifulWorld) follows the original novel's order of stories (with a small bit of tweaking that puts the earliest chronological story first), and the [other](https://anilist.co/manga/100466/KinonoTabitheBeautifulWorldGou) adapts random chapters. The new anime takes the latter approach, picking and choosing random bits and pieces throughout the 20+ volumes of Kino no Tabi. I'm going to go into why or how the order of stories matter later, but I genuinely believe there is merit in both approaches.

Although, the reason why we have not received an English translation of the novels beyond volume 1 is because the English translation changed not only several things within the actual writing, but also changed the order of the stories within volume 1, putting the chronologically earliest chapter first.

img440()

""Due to issues with the licensor, the remaining volumes have been canceled.""

How unfortunate. This brings us to this new anime by [Lerche](https://anilist.co/studio/456/Lerche) (creators of [Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace)) a mere fourteen years after the original anime aired in 2003. The original Kino is in fact, one of the handful of shows I first watched when JUST getting into anime.

img440()

...So it's safe to say, I was reasonably excited when I learned that ""Kino 2017"" was gonna be a thing. And... just let me tell you right now. Nine times out of ten, going into a remake or a new ""entry"" of the thing as a fan of the original ends up leading to disaster. Because the more you liked the original, the more you're gonna want the new version to be good.

But if that new version isn't good, hell, if it doesn't even live up to the original... it's all gonna fall down and eventually, you're gonna just start pretending that it never existed in the first place.

Granted, there are exceptions... some avoid falling flat on their face... but MOST of the time...



Oh yeah, I'm gonna be going into detail on numerous of the episodes so uh... I'll just declare SPOILERS right now, I guess. For the actual new episodes, I mean. Obviously, I'm not going to care about spoiling the remake episodes since it's been fourteen years since the origin



img440()

Despite the impression I may be giving off, I truly did not immediately turn on this. As a matter of fact, I was enjoying it quite a bit. I'd have some questions pop up in my head about some of the episodes here and there, but there was nothing too major early on. The animation looks good, Kino looks and sounds like Kino, and I could clearly see at least some of that tone of Kino no Tabi.

""I heard about a country where apparently, killing is legal. Let's go visit it. I'm sure there'll be no twist to this country at all.""

Like Kino running into someone and talking with them on the way to this country who was heading there both on the way to the country and in the process of leaving the country that both had very different reasons for heading to this country where apparently killing is allowed, felt very Kino no Tabi.

 

To clarify, this was the very first episode and to be quite honest, I believe the peak of the entire show. Everything is downhill from here on out. I was of course completely unaware of this, and was additionally unaware that there was going to be an episode so horribly stupid that a hand would reach out from my computer monitor and then proceed to bitch slap the scales off of my eyes.

It could be argued that that episode is the true start of the downhill slope of Kino 2017, but after I grew negative due to the later episodes, I started thinking about the earlier episodes and how I have a lot of problems with them. But yet, episode one still... actually works. Nothing glaring jumps out at me. I'm still capable of saying, yeah, this is Kino no Tabi.

img440()

So what... what went wrong in the following episodes, then?




I have no idea who Kino is in Kino 2017. She's a traveler who goes from country to country on her motorrad named Hermes... I got that, but not much else from this version of Kino. I didn't know why she did the things she did, and... I could probably count on one hand the times I was capable of telling what emotion the character was having throughout this entire series.

img440()

On one hand, you think she's just a traveler who wishes to stick to herself and not get into any conflicts within the countries she visits. But then, there are several times where she does something that clearly contradicts this. Which would be fine if we knew more about her as a character or why she was doing the things she did.

The coliseum episode, we're vaguely shown or can guess the reasons why she did what she did. That one was... mostly fine, but I'll go into it more when I start specifically discussing the episodes that are ""remakes.""

It starts really with the third episode... or rather, when I actually stopped and thought about it after my opinion of this show began to landslide in the negative later on, I realized nothing about what Kino does in the third episodes makes any sense at all. She boards a gigantic moving machine which is in fact a country that is constantly on the move and while she's there, the path of the moving country ends up leading through a different country down on the ground.

img440()

The moving country is prepared to literally crush this other country that was completely minding its own business up to this point (granted, yes, they put up a wall, which does inconvenience travelers attempting to pass through this area) and Kino is on board the moving country to witness this. Kino does not at any point try to dissuade the people of the moving country to either stop or perhaps just simply change paths. Perhaps I'm just mistaken here, but I genuinely recall her not even asking or bringing up the idea of them just changing their path.

No, what she decides to contribute to this situation is... once the country on the ground realizes they are completely helpless to this technological behemoth that wishes to crush its way through its country to the lands beyond, the soldiers get pissed and for some reason start... specifically aiming their weapons at... the murals of the moving country that the children made. Kino steps forth and basically squashes the petty resistance by shooting her gun at their targeting systems in a pointless and needlessly showy action scene.

 

...Why, exactly? Okay yes, I get it, the lasers of the moving country are super deadly and, they were genuinely considering obliterating the entire land country because they were attacking the goddamned murals. But... BUT...

 

THEY HAD ALREADY TRAMPLED OVER THE COUNTRY'S FIELDS. THEIR FOOD SOURCE, GONE, DESTROYED, THEIR WALL IS GONE SO THERE GOES THEIR SECURITY, AND LET'S NOT EVEN GO INTO HOW TRAUMATIZING THIS EVENT HAD TO HAVE BEEN FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. 

img440()

""Gosh, I sure hope another moving country doesn't come through and blast us with gigantic death lasers! Gosh, I sure am glad they didn't just outright destroy us but rather let us starve to death after destroying our crops!""

 

Kino is witnessing these events firsthand and she just... no emotion, whatsoever. Just a goddamned BLANK SLATE. She just outright tries to ignore the genuine rage and hatred the general of the other country is venting. After all, she doesn't want to get on the bad side of the moving country, they'll kill her WITH LASERS. You know what... let me just check right now.

img440()

Okay, this country is from the seventh volume of Kino no Tabi. Meaning, there isn't such a gigantic and absurd leap... like seven volumes in, and Kino obviously has gone through some serious shit in a bunch of other countries that the reader has experienced throughout the past novels. In this anime, this is the third episode, and the second episode was about the coliseum country (which is from the very first volume) where Kino outright puts herself into the middle of the country's problem and DIRECTLY changes the country entirely.

img440()

We go from that to... to this. Within the span of a single episode.

 

""Shh, Hermes. They'll finish their war after they finish devastating this country, then we'll be on our way."" 

How am I supposed to like this character if I'm not even capable of making heads or tails of her? Also it's even worse if you've watched the original in which Kino is actually even more active in doing things, so you're absolutely flabbergasted when she just decides to watch this war play out before her.

img440()

Then there's episode four which is primarily focused on Shizu's (don't worry I'll get to him too) experience in a country. Basically he's told that during his stay, he can either go toil with the commoners of the country or lounge around in luxury overseeing the filthy commoners. Shizu, being a good guy, decides to go hang out with the commoners. It's revealed later in the episode that another traveler shows after Shizu and what do you know, it's Kino, and she chose to... lounge around and oversee the commoners? Shizu eventually tries to lead a rebellion to help out the commoners, and Kino is sent to actively try and stop him.

...Which she appears to genuinely attempt to do, and only doesn't when the ruling group of the country turn on her after noticing that she seems to have a previous relation to Shizu who is basically leading this rebellion. 

 

Kino, what the FUCK. Choosing to lounge around overseeing the commoners aside because I guess maybe she was probably being less cruel than the past travelers who chose that option, why was she actually trying to stop Shizu?

 

Even after Kino shows her face after they ""kind of fight"", Kino still asks Shizu to stop his attempted rebellion and just go back. It's like the second after this when the ruling group turns on her, and then she basically just decides ""oh well, I guess my eggs are in the Shizu's rebellion basket now.""

Kino is supposed to be the protagonist, the series is KINO'S JOURNEY, but from what has been offered, Shizu is so much more likable than Kino edition 2017. Honestly, I actually kind of hate her. I don't know if it's the fact that she's a seemingly emotionless robot or the episode order, which I'm getting to, but...

Probably the most baffling thing to me about Kino 2017 as a whole is that Kino herself was just infuriating to me. Which leads me to the next point...




You know what's even worse than Kino being unlikable? Kino not showing up at all or mattering very little throughout entire episodes. I'm not even making a joke when I say I would have loved this show if Kino had been cut out of it entirely and it had just been Shizu no Tabi. Shizu's wandering the world and throughout all these countries in an attempt to find a new place to life, an actual goal and... actually tries to help out the people in the countries he visits when he can.

img440()

He's actually on a journey with a purpose. Kino, on the other hand... ""let's go watch and participate in a war!""

But this section isn't even about the Shizu episodes. Let's talk about episode six, my personal turning point with this show. After at least mildly enjoying the show thus far, episode six just... it's when everything just crumbled. Every episode after that was just awful, and there was the realization that they were doing two more ""remake"" episodes and they possibly picked the absolute worst locations for those episodes.

img440()

But let's calm down and tackle one thing at a time. Episode six does not focus on Kino or Shizu. It focuses on a random completely unknown slave girl in a completely unknown country. Basically, she was from a religious country who ended up having to sell her off to a group of traders... and the group of traders seems like an ordinary group of upstanding citizens for the most part.

 

Excluding the fact that they apparently have no qualms with slavery, and not only slavery, but being absolutely fucking malicious to their newly gained slave girl. ""You're okay with being sold as a slave by your own people? Wow, you're fucking worthless. You absolutely have no worth and are a fucking drain on our resources, why did we even accept you.""

...Just... just keep this important fact in mind. She is a local to the land they're in, basically. She possesses knowledge about the land they are in and about you know plants and whatnot. Potentially useful information. That's not super important, but just keep it in mind for now.



Basically one of the girls of this merchant group finds a group of super tasty looking herbs, which they decide to harvest and use for their meal. The slave girl realizes they're in the process of making a horrible mistake and tries to do the right thing and warn them, but she's incapable of bringing herself to yell loud enough for them to hear. They eat the poison soup.

   

So the girl's basically like, okay, fuck it then. I'll just eat my bowl and die along the side of these horrible people. But then this kid just fucking launches a stone to knock her bowl of poison soup out of her hands because he noticed she wasn't going to use a spoon and simply DOWN the entire bowl of POISON in one go. This act intended to be cruel ends up denying the girl the horribly painful death she wanted at that moment.

   

Finally, she manages to tell them about the poison herbs, but this results in having more stones thrown at her to get her to shut up. When she comes to, the blond boy who knocked her bowl out of her hand is in the middle of negotiations with his father to buy the slave girl. 

   

...The kid, of this totally normal and upstanding merchant group, suddenly launches off into this whole fucking crazy tirade of how he REALLY wants to brutally torture and murder this poor abused girl. 

img440()

And the adults are all like YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT KID. WE SHOULD TOTALLY FUCKING BRUTALLY MURDER THIS POOR GIRL WE ACCEPTED AS A SLAVE BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO WARN US OF ALL OF OUR IMPENDING DEATHS. What? Why? Why accept a slave as payment and then basically just discard that extra slave labor because one of your psychotic kids suddenly descended into a ravenous bloodlust? Aren't you supposed to be merchants??? I swear to God with this episode, I almost felt like I went back in time and was watching Ranpo Kitan again while locked within a horrible struggle as my brain tried to understand what was happening or why it was happening.

img440()

The girl just fucking fully snaps in this moment and admittedly, does this actually cool screaming moment because yes, I can empathize with this character. I'm surprised she hadn't fucking snapped earlier, jesus christ. Of course, everybody who ate the poison soup starts to die right after she screams.

 

Then, as she's left alone and surrounded by corpses wishing she could have died too, it turns out one of the merchants survived and claims that he'd help the girl end her own life. In actuality, the gun only has one bullet (???), so he tricks the girl into using it on him so only he gets to escape this horrible HORRIBLE world. Thankfully though, she finds a nearby motorrad who proceeds to tell her the true way to die.

 

By... by living. Oh. Well yeah, you'll definitely die eventually if you do that! You're thinking to yourself ""oh, is she going to be a recurring character like Shizu?"" because that would explain the purpose of this episode and character. Unfortunately, it turns out that nope, this episode contains a conclusion to this slave girl's story therefore meaning she's never going to appear ever again. She goes on to live out her life, becoming a talented photographer, who is eventually called... drumroll please...

 

Photo. Her name becomes Photo. As in photo in photograph because she is a photographer. That is what becomes her name. No, that's fine. Hey, your occupation is baking donuts? Well, your name is now Donut. That makes sense. That makes PERFECT SENSE. 

Oh yeah, and... after all of that, at the end of the episode, Kino and Hermes do show back up and Kino looks through her binoculars at all the corpses from the preceding events because... it's Kino no Tabi after all. Kino is definitely an important character of the series, haha... ha...

img440()

...She may as well as not have shown up at all. Granted yes, she does in the novel's version of the story as well but... ugh. That chapter probably works as its own thing within whatever volume of Kino no Tabi that is. But the thing is if you're doing a new anime and you're picking stories from all these different volumes from over the years, wouldn't you want to do stories that primarily feature Kino? Or if not even that, then just interesting and good stories. It would only make sense to do the best ones.

Why choose to devote an entire episode of a twelve episode series to a side character we don't know and aren't invested in, whose story is entirely concluded within the episode, therefore meaning her importance probably doesn't go beyond that singular story? 

Revising TGG: ""Wait, wait, wait. Photo [apparently is actually a recurring character in the novels](http://kinosjourney.wikia.com/wiki/Photo/Chapters) SHE JUST DOESN'T SHOW UP EVER AGAIN IN THIS FUCKING ADAPTATION WHY INTRODUCE HER THEN IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO AT LEAST ONE OTHER STORY THAT'S CENTERED ON PHOTO. WITH SOU'S LITTLE SPEECH AS THE CREDITS ROLL, I FUCKING REALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS JUST SHOWING HOW SHE ENDED UP BUT NO, IN THE NOVELS APPARENTLY SHE COMES BACK. MAYBE IF THIS GETS ANOTHER SEASON, THEN THEY'LL DO HER CHAPTERS. OR MAYBE THEY'LL INTRODUCE MORE CHARACTERS THEY THEN DON'T USE AND THEN ARE COMPLETELY POINTL--""

If Kino had interacted with her or the group of merchants in any way, then that would have changed things. But she didn't even see any of the events of the episode. She just saw the corpses, threw out some Kino and Hermes dialogue out there because it was required as this is a Kino no Tabi episode, and then it was over. Her role in the episode was concluded.

I can't get over it. She's an emotionless husk. I had more reason to care about this pointless side character slave girl than Kino, who you would think would be the heart of this series.

img440()

But hey, since we're on the subject of Kino regurgitating dialogue, I really liked the episode about Kino's Master (whom they didn't bother to introduce beyond a weird bad two second scene) that they made primarily be in sepia tone because the episode is about the past and everybody knows if you're gonna show anything from the past, you gotta go full sepia tone otherwise the viewer won't understand it's in the past.

The episode is mostly about the shenanigans the Master would get into with her partner when she was younger, and how they essentially overthrew a country's tyrannical ruling class by setting all the trash cans in a country on fire and then refusing to leave the country's tower when asked. But like there could have probably been a whole action scene between the Master busting her partner out of prison and them getting into the tower, but the episode just transitions back to Kino.

 

...Kino suddenly just takes over the episode and explains what her Master and her partner in crime did rather than the show actually just... show it. How'd they make it from the prison to the top of the tower? Nah, that'd be too interesting to see actually happen. Just have Kino drone on about it to Hermes as she's taking care of her campfire. Rather than Kino doing interesting things, we get to hear Kino just drone on about other people doing potentially interesting things.

Wonderful. That was certainly my favorite part about Kino no Tabi. Oh, and remember the country where Kino had a great time and experience being in the country, but the country forces travelers to have their memories of their time in the countries to be erased so the anime equivalent of this is we just immediately cut to Kino leaving the country right after entering it?

 

That was my favorite country of them all! I really wonder what made them choose to animate that country specifically!

Dude, it's basically a ""free"" country. We don't have to animate SHIT for this one.



Look, the whole thing of Kino no Tabi is that the countries are all... there's mostly no chronological order. Or rather, apart from a handful of exceptions, there's no real order among the sequence of countries Kino visits. But that doesn't mean the episode order doesn't matter at all. Especially if you're going to pick and choose a bunch of different stories from the seventeen years plus of Kino no Tabi.

The original anime didn't exactly have that option, so it stuck with stories from the first couple of volumes. There wasn't any more of a meaning to the sequence of countries in the original than there is in the 2017 version. But also, you didn't go from a story from volume 1 to a story from volume 20 in a one episode span. As far as I'm aware, the farthest the 2003 anime goes is a story from like volume 6.

It's probably safe to say that a story from the beginning of a series compared to one twenty volumes later is going to be different in tone and ideas. If you adapt them faithfully word for word and then just slap them next to each other, it's gonna come off as fucking bizarre when you do the episode detailing Kino's backstory and how she became a traveler and then an episode when she gets into a violent and horrific war with an army of violent rabid sheep.

 

Just on a brief tangent here, Kino 2003 worked so well because of the countries and the stories they did. The 2003 version of Kino went through some shit and was an actual character and actually did things, and actually went through interesting and sometimes horrible or even outright ruined countries, leading up to the final country she visits which she personally hears is outright horrible to travelers, but when it turns out to be the direct opposite, she actually wishes to stay longer which actually has weight in the 2003 version because we've seen the sort of shit she had to go through.

But as it turns out, she's forced to leave, and the final note that Kino 2003 goes on is that she moves on and keeps traveling. It was such an effective final episode. Oh, I should also note, that we get to see Kino's backstory in like episode 4 of the 2003 version so watchers of the 2003 version actually got to learn who she is and why she's traveling.

...So let's finally get to it. How does Kino 2017 order these things?

Episode 10: The finale episode from 2003.
Episode 11: Kino's Backstory.
Episode 12 (THE FINALE): Kino battles sheep, lays on a hammock, and has a dialogue with Hermes lazily explaining that her ""JOURNEY"" will continue on ""POSSIBLY"" (if they get another season) but if it doesn't she'll just be ""NAPPING"".

...Why. Why save the episode of Kino's backstory for almost the very end when it's in volume 1 of the novel series and it was like episode 4 of the 2003 anime? It becomes even more baffling since the finale episode from 2003 has a character that is sort of a reflection of younger Kino but people who haven't watched the 2003 anime or read the novels won't get that. Additionally, why redo this episode at all if you're not going to end on it like the 2003 anime did? I understand that the sheep story is from one of the most recent volumes of Kino no Tabi and they probably wanted to end on a story from one of the recent volumes but... was that the really best one they could have chosen?

Rather than going out on an emotionally impactful note like the 2003 anime, 2017 goes out on perhaps one of the most schlocky episodes I've seen in quite a great deal of time. Kino gunning down CG sheep, setting an entire meadow on fire, and they even use slow motion!

I really find it fucking bizarre that of all of these episodes, [I honestly enjoyed watching this one the most](https://anilist.co/activity/9977582). And not solely because it was comically horrible but because Kino was actually finally doing something. Actually...




img440()

I don't wish to reiterate anything I already said in that status post about this episode, but I cannot move past it.

The sheep episode is not Lerche doing something weird or awful that goes against Kino no Tabi. No, this story actually is from the novels. Granted, it's from one of the newest volumes, so obviously the story has not been translated so I can't actively compare this episode to the original story but... I just can't help but wonder about it.

After twenty volumes, has the author just completely ran out of ideas? Like the episode did not make this seem like some joke country at all with Kino encountering the skeleton of a man who killed himself after realizing his leg was broken and he was trapped in this sheep hell, and the implication is VERY MUCH that he killed himself because of this.

 

Like when Kino finally seriously starts her war against the sheep, she straight up outright says: ""This is for that man."" Who...? The unnamed skeleton? So Kino who... watched on as another country destroyed the entire food supply of another country completely unphased... is now... claiming vengeance on sheep for an unnamed skeleton she found. What?

img440()

Additionally, there is straight up a ""leave me, I'll sacrifice myself"" moment between Hermes and Kino. Kino climbs down into this chasm leaving Hermes behind after Hermes insists on it, and it seems like Kino genuinely thinks she's actively sacrificing Hermes and will never see him again. But the sheep just outright don't attack Hermes at all and he's fine, and then Kino comes back, murders all the sheep, and then reclaims Hermes and does an action jump over the chasm to escape from the remainder of the sheep whose home she outright caused to become engulfed with flames and filled with the corpses of their sheep brothers and sisters.

What really puts a bow on this whole country/episode is that after Kino and Hermes finally escape and make it to the actual country, a guard asks her if she saw some sheep in the countryside. Because, lo and behold, the reason for the ravenous and violent sheep army is that this country until JUST RECENTLY would force sheep to do battle with each other for the entertainment of the people.

 

Sheep... sheep fighting. Why sheep? No seriously, why sheep? Is it seriously not dogs because that'd be too obvious, or the only way to make your already unlikable character even more unlikable is having her gun down an army of dogs? 

img300()

To be honest, if it were dogs, the serious tone to the episode would be way less silly. But no yeah, people hate seeing dogs die in things, so fuck it, have it be sheep I guess. Nobody likes sheep. Kino can do trick shots blasting sheep back into the flames of hell and running over CG sheep in a car all day long.

Let's not even go into the fact that... like in the original anime/at least some of the early volumes of the novel, Kino does and is actually forced to kill both in defense of herself and just to provide her with food when she's on the road. Like she's actually killed people.

But in the entirety of Kino 2017... she just kills some sheep (oh and I guess the tyrant in the coliseum episode but that shouldn't even count since that's one of the remake episodes). That's it. It's not like I want to see Kino entering crazy and ridiculous gun battles or just her killing things in general. But there were actually some dark or weighty countries or ones with actual conflict...

Yet for Kino 2017 the only thing that comes close is... Kino gunning down an army of sheep. It's absolutely baffling.

img440()




I figured I'd do an entire separate section for these at the start but... I'm now coming to terms that the remake episodes are probably the least interesting reason why I dislike Kino 2017. Because they're quite literal remakes or new versions of stories that were done in the 2003 anime... there's not really much to talk about with them.

Like I probably could actually watch both versions side by side simultaneously and point out all the differences or changes that 2017 makes, and yeah, maybe that'd actually make me even more upset at this adaptation than I already am. But to be honest, I think the very dumb location for two out of the three remake episodes is infinitely worse than any of the specific changes they made to the episodes/stories themselves. The idea of remaking the final country of the 2003 version which was a perfect final episode and NOT having it again as the final episode is just... 

There's no getting around it. It's absolutely idiotic. I genuinely was a bit misty eyed when I first watched the original version of that episode, but I felt absolutely nothing this time around. I didn't see any motivation for why Kino would suddenly want to stay longer in the country beyond ""well it's nice here"" when in the original Kino had gone through some pretty rough countries at this point. Additionally, I should note that this episode is one of the few points of Kino 2017 where Kino does crack and actually show some form of emotion but... it felt like it disappeared almost literally one second later. Like it fucking evaporated into thin air.

 

Hmm... yeah, you know, if I had to choose one, I'd say I definitely believe the top Kino is witnessing an entire town's worth of people dying as a flow of lava just essentially wipes their country off the face of the Earth.

The coliseum episode I was initially fine with them remaking, but now I'm not so sure. Because sure, the original version was two episodes long rather than one, and there was actually a bit more atmosphere and the fighters were a bit more fleshed out when Kino found herself in this dingy underground with all of the other competitors. But really when you get down to it, the only reason why they included this in Kino 2017 is because this is where Shizu is introduced, and becomes essentially one of the few recurring characters of Kino no Tabi. But in the end, despite the inclusion of Shizu, all we get from the final moments of this show is Kino and her fucking hammock despite the surprisingly large focus on Shizu, Riku, and Ti throughout the rest of the show.

Oh, here's a bit of a confession. I skipped episode 11, which is the remake of Kino's backstory up until writing this sentence of the review. If there's anything especially noteworthy or glaring changes I notice while watching it mid-review, I will include them following this sentence. If I don't, it's probably just generally worse than the original's version.

...

 

...Kino's parents were a bit... I didn't like the direction they took with them this time around. I remember them being a bit calmer in the original? I don't think the original voice actors screamed/overacted quite as much as the 2017's version. Like yeah I know in the original/story they go off on young Kino after she tells them she doesn't want to receive a lobotomy anymore but...

Also, wait hold on.

img440()

Kino 2017's eyes are green. But then both her younger self as well as her adult self SOLELY in this episode's eyes are purple.

 

Wait, why? What about the original Kino???

 

...We have to go even further down this rabbit hole. What about one of the manga Kino's???

img440()

...This started out as an observation of solely Kino 2017, but now that I'm looking at them, even in the covers of the actual novels, her eye color is all over the place. Blue, green, purple, gray... why? This is just a small thing I only just now noticed which ultimately doesn't matter too much, because I honestly could care less about Kino's appearance when her character in Kino 2017 is just... a husk of nothingness.

...But apparently I'm an idiot, as this happens way earlier than when my brain first noticed it. Behold Kino 2017, the blue eyes edition.

""Who even cares if one of the most first commonly noticed physical characteristics of our character is completely inconsistent?""




I honestly don't know if they could have ended Kino 2017 any more obnoxiously than they did. After the absurd sheep story, we just get Kino and Hermes talking over basically a mostly still image of Kino lying in a hammock for like five straight minutes (including the ED). Kino and Hermes mentions ""HER JOURNEY"" over and over again and it's like they have no idea how much they should try and hammer it in so they just go overboard with it. But basically they imply ""well we could maybe do a season two but if we don't then oh well... Kino will keep on traveling!""

   

...I'll pass on a season two (that's also brought to us by Lerche) of this, thank you. And you know if Kino 2003 would have ended with Kino explaining to Hermes that she's going to take a nap and maybe, MAYBE if she wakes up, she'll start out on her journey again FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, I would have reacted as negatively as I did when the 2017 version did this. But no, Kino 2003 was fine with actually ending with a little bit of finality. There was no ""well maybe Kino will get a new awful adaptation 14 years after ours but sure yeah, she'll keep traveling"" after Kino drove off on Hermes.

Kino 2003 remains a solid 9 out of 10 for me. Kino 2017 on the other hand... is a 1 out of 10. I really do genuinely believe that this goes way further than ""I hate it just because I liked the original so much"" and that if you tried to watch Kino 2017 and HATED it, maybe do actually go back and try Kino 2003. Like sure the animation is old but everything else is just... so much better.

Otherwise, my general recommendation would be to watch the original anime and if you enjoy it, possibly consider trying the novels out. Because while okay, all of the stories in Kino 2017 are ALL from the novels. The moving country, Photo's story, the goddamned sheep, and so forth. But what I'm thinking is that while apparently, and to be fair I only checked the moving country story for this, the anime is seemingly faithful in adapting these stories...

...Maybe these stories have less of an impact when going through the novels themselves. Because what I really want to believe is that Kino 2017, that Lerche for some reason apart from the remake episodes, FOR SOME REASON actively chose the worst stories of the entire series and shoved them all together in one package along with some remakes of the earlier stories. Like I honestly don't want to believe that the entire series beyond like the last of what the 2003 anime adapted is just... awful.

img440()

I didn't even go into this one, but what even was the point of doing an entire episode entirely of just off cuts? Like obviously they were miniature countries or bits probably scattered throughout the novels but why do an episode of just those? Like oh okay, Kino went to a country primarily of chefs, cooked for them, and then left. Or like a couple of bandits looking for people to ambush and rob both see Shizu as well as Kino and decide to not attack them but for different reasons and that's the end of THAT story. Couldn't... couldn't you have used this episode's spot for an actual country where she did anything that mattered?

You had twenty one volumes of material to choose from and... you're saying that in your opinion these were overall the best stories and most worthy to adapt and therefore that's why you chose them for the first Kino adaptation in fourteen years?

I don't buy it, Lerche. I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

5205,"""the Garden of sinners Chapter 7: ……not nothing heart. (Murder Speculation Part B)"", what a beautiful title. 7th movie of the Kara No Kyoukai series and my favorite out of the 8, is an amazing conclusion to the brilliant series and Ryougi Shiki, my favorite female character in anime.

This movie focuses on Shiki a lot more than anyone else, the build up from the first 6 movies gets a solid conclusion in this movie. The main element of her character, trying to find herself is the main part of this movie. Shiki and her counterpart SHIKI's characters are explained and the loose end left in the first 6 movies are mostly tied by the end of this movie and the view you have of Shiki will also change from the beginning to end of this movie. Her motives, actions everything is explained and her dealing with the loss of her other Shiki is shown here and those parts of the story had great delivery. Other than that, the relationship between Shiki and Kokuto also reaches a beautiful conclusion at the end of their story which I liked the most about the movie. There is a lot going on and rather than writing it here it's best to watch the movie because everything, starting from the characters to small details were very well presented.



Kara No Kyoukai I feel like is a story driven very much by it's characters. Shiki is the pivot of the story and as a result the quality and type of the story depends on her characterization. The way Shiki starts out as someone with someone else that let Kokutou Mikiya into her life and by the end of the story when she loses that part of herself she fears losing Kokutou  and her place in this world. Lio Shirazumi, the antagonist here stalks Shiki and tries to bring her counterpart back but through this it shows that part of her is gone for better and Kokutou being Kokutou would lend his hands to her and love her despite who she is/was. Surrounding Lio, I remember one strongly sexually charged scene. It is nothing like eroticism; rather, it is like watching a butterfly caught as prey as it is being overwhelmed and at the same time, strangely fascinated by its helplessness in facing a certain death which was the most  captivating part of the scene. This series although shines when Shiki shines, it sort lacks in the antagonist department but not the aura of a good antagonistic presence somehow, I don't know how. I wanted more of Araya Souren, he seemed like a very interesting character after that movie 5 and having a big role over Shiki's character but sadly wasn't on the screen enough. At the end of the day, Shiki stole the show here and Kokuto was a great support.

The fight sequences were amazing, expected nothing less from Ufotable. The characters were designed very well, liked the art style and especially the dark and 'night' vibe the whole movie has to it that perfectly fits the atmosphere and premise of this movie. Since everything was so captivating, I really failed to notice a super noticeable OST but I usually liked some soundtracks when I listened to them on Youtube.

Now, after a long essay, something I wanna say is the score was really a hard choice for me, although it had the antagonist problem, other problems were not major or worthy of mentioning and as a result, the good parts of this movie heavily outshines the flaws. And despite being a fairly dark series, it has a happy ending. So I chose to give it a 10/10. Superb movie and amazing conclusion to one of my favourite franchises ever."

""A story dedicated to those trapped by the past.""
-Tagline at the start of each episode

There are a million variations on the saying “the only thing certain in life is that it will eventually end.'' Benjamin Franklin’s quip, also invoking taxes, is probably the most famous version in the west. It’s true, though. The world over, all human cultures are united by the inevitability of death. Those who occupy themselves with a fascination with finality while still living tend to be viewed as a bit odd. In some cultures respected, in others feared, in some, merely looked at with a cocked eye. 

The titular Sakurako of Sakurako-san can in some ways be seen as this trait taken to its logical extreme. Anime (and narrative fiction in general) is built on archetypes. The tsundere for example, is a cartoon reflection of a real behavioral pattern. Sakurako broadly falls into a similar reflection, though a less common one. She is  a ‘mystical woman’, removed from the day-to-day of ordinary life, isolated by her calling. In this case, she’s an osteologist, forensics expert, and amateur (by professionalism, not competence) detective.

img880()

Sakurako is haunted by the recollections of those she’s lost. Most notably her younger brother and her two cats. There’s more than a little indication over the series’ run that her bone-collecting is as much coping mechanism as genuine interest. It is here where the meaning of the tagline that opens each episode comes into focus. As much as any of her “clients”, it is Sakurako who is trapped by her past.

Really, Sakurako is an absolutely fascinating character. Her peculiar, sideways morality is highlighted a few times throughout the show’s run, the woman never turns down a case that could give her access to a skeleton to pick at. Her backstory is drip-fed, slowly, with only small bits and pieces being revealed over the course of its twelve episodes [and only actually becoming clear at the end of its final arc]. I’ve seen her compared to Sherlock Holmes and the comparison makes some sense. Sakurako is intensely antisocial, often straight up rude (ostensible protagonist Shoutarou Takewaki frustratedly “Sakurako-san!”s at her enough times to tell her off for it that it almost becomes annoying), and has keen observational prowess. The process of using which she describes--in a deliciously melodramatic turn of phrase--as “connecting the bones”.

img880()

Takewaki, as mentioned, the other protagonist, is not quite as compelling. This is less damning than it might sound--it’s hard to stack up to a character as memorable as Sakurako--but he’s definitely the weaker half of the duo. Takewaki is pretty ordinary and serves mostly as a grounding rod for Sakurako’s weirder impulses. He also harbors a massive crush on her, which, as the show progresses, turns into a sort of open-hearted admiration. It’s certainly possible to read it as romantic if you’re so inclined, but, it’s clearly intended to be read as a mentor/student sort of relationship. Something that’s actually rather rare in the medium, outside of certain stock shonen archetypes. The two's relationship ultimately helps free Sakurako of her self-imposed shackle to her past, and it's nice to see this sort of thing work out for both parties without becoming romantic.

As for the show itself, ultimately much of what Sakurako-san is about, as much as the character arcs of its protagonists, is the realities of death in Japan. The many ways it can come--by chance, by violence, by tragedy, by simple accident in one case.

Often, Sakurako-san focuses less on the deceased themselves and more on who they leave behind, and how the loss affects them. The show’s halfway point--the sixth episode--features a lengthy scene in which schoolgirl Yuriko and her teacher, Isozaki argue about whether they have the right to track down a woman they believe to be suicidal. The show takes neither side explicitly, not until a number of episodes later, but it is Yuriko--of the position that they not only can track her down, but must--who presents the stronger argument, aided by the fact that we know that she lost her grandmother just a few episodes prior.

In general it is the living, despite the subject matter, who create the tales in Sakurako-san. On the flip side of mourning is those with secrets to keep hidden. More than once, some form of foul play is involved, and the series is not afraid to delve into the ugly gristle that would compel such foul play in the first place. Lots of reputation-based face-saving and desperate grabs at sentimentality on the part of the characters here.

img880()
You get the idea



Despite what this might imply though, the series projects a similar dusky liminality to more overtly-mystical works like xxxHolic and the quieter episodes of the Monogatari franchise. Probably the show’s single most famous element is Sakurako’s “let’s clear up this mystery” sequence, a bizarre, sideways homage to magical girl henshin transformations that would be out of place in Sakurako-san, if not for the fact that Sakurako herself often seems like such a mystic enigma.

img880()

Honestly, for its by-necessity gritty subject matter, Sakurako-san is surprisingly devoid of much that scans as terribly macabre. Sakurako-san finds romance in dirt and bones. Would-be lovers and a mother and child are united in death. A woman frees herself from her past by casting a ring into a river. A depressed salaryman is saved from suicide-by-painting. A grandmother’s tragic accident in the woods is because she wanted to see an inspiring sunrise her husband had painted years before. It is a melancholy but undeniably romantic--even strangely hopeful--worldview, and if allowed to seep from Sakurako-san’s bones into your own, intoxicating. 

That’s not to say it’s exactly relaxing. The show’s final arc in particular dives into much darker territory. A story about a murder egged on by a mysterious, from-the-shadows manipulator who raids dead bodies to steal their sphenoid bones (it is here that the show finally ties its odd fixation on CGI butterflies to something). 

img880()

In what I must imagine was a controversial move at the time, the final episode does not actually conclude this arc, leaving it unresolved. An opaque question mark over the finale, which is, otherwise, surprisingly upbeat--even romantic--given the series, and arc, that it ends.

And indeed, the most surprising thing about Sakurako-san might be how much solace it finds in the unending march of time. 

Sakurako-san seems to have been relegated to the “cult classic” bin by the tide of history, but, maybe that’s fine. A minor hit at most even in its day, the past few years have done little to raise its profile, and indeed the frustrating quibble remains that it seems to have been made with a second season in mind--one that has yet to materialize, and possibly never will. Yet, this flaw aside, there’s very little wrong with Sakurako-san. If you’re looking for something that contains a whirl of contrasting emotion--by turns melancholic, tragic, frightening, joyful, romantic, and just a touch gross, you might want to let yourself fall under Sakurako’s spell too. If there’s a final word on the Sakurako-san, it’s that it’s a life-affirming show that just happens to be about death.

“You haven’t become ashes just yet.”

Anime had potential.... big potential
But they made it cringe. An overpowered main character who will never use all the skills he learned, humans who copulate with ogre and giving babies in 1h span, an eromaniac old ogre, plot holes, some weird attraction to the main character from all other races, and more and more. Some good plots were wasted some missed, other plots cringe af or just main using one skill that we saw plenty of times. Do not know what more to write.................
 other than I wanted to drop it after weird pregnancies and some weird added ecchi scenes. 
Probably it would look better if the plot were about previous life and skills rather to fuck every girl to make her slave and put babies in her..
 It was hard to watch, not even funny, some things were actually good, like rescuing captured human females because he did not want to be like other ogres before, but he made them pregnant anyway, what was that?   Fights were fine, few better than fine. Other ogres had actually good skill and strength progression, they level up in not super fast time and their skills matched their personalities. But still, all this was interrupted by cringe ogre to other races' affections and copulations, that make it cringe...
It is not for everyone, but if you want to waste your time it is the perfect one, you will not lose track of the plot because it is the most basic one, and for sure you watched many other isekai's with that plot. It doesn't shock like Goblin Slayer, it is not even close to this level, ogres there are evil and fuck human females because why not, not like its the only one way for their race to survive, and they say that can fuck with each other...., 
I regret watching this anime, and the main reason is that it had potential, but its cringe and not funny, not even dramatic or scary.

At some moments it was hard to watch, maybe some of you will think it's the worst review focused only on 3 aspects, but there is nothing more in this anime, you get only this straight into your face and nothing more to make you wanna watch it. maybe because it is not good ecchi, not good isekai, not good shonen, not good race wars, the drama is on kindergarten level, the love plot is simple, you're strong so we wanna have sex with you. Like apes strong together but actually is donking kong and ferrets around.

Do not waste time as I did, and this review is not worth it even, because there is nothing more to write about, you do not have any deep plot-twist or complicated character development to write a review of 2200 characters long. It is really hard to point out any other stuff that happened and it is worth mentioning in this anime."
138424,"Sequels are driven by nostalgia, and sometimes that sense of nostalgia diminishes as more seasons of a show come out, and it gets boring. Thankfully, the third season of Takagi-San uses all its nostalgia and themes from its first two seasons, and builds upon them effectively. The quality was as good and consistent as the first two seasons, and the characters are starting to get a bit more development. 

Now, if I may not be so formal for a second, let me just say that AHHH THIS IS SO SWEET! Ok, and there was my scream about how pleasant this show is. Alright, let's get on with the review.

My episodic grading scale: 

Story: /10 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /25 Enjoyment: /15 Thematic Execution: /30

STORY: 6.9/10

Much like previous seasons, this show is very episodic, filled with various skits that build up to a conclusion. I will admit that the earlier portion of the show was a bit of a drag, but the latter portion of the show was great! The narrative more or less stays the same, and the endgame is obvious, and many plot points are predictable, as I predicted two big scenes to happen as soon as I saw what they were trying to do. It's pleasant for sure.

ART: 9/10

I enjoy the simple, yet beautiful art style. The composition of shots is good, and direction overall was well executed.

MUSIC: 8.4/10

Probably my least favourite set of openings and endings, but that's not to say they don't fit the direction of the story.

CHARACTERS: 21.5/25

Pure sweetness! I noticed quickly that in this season, Takagi says way more bold things to Nishikata, and that's a sign of development. Nishikata, while still incredibly dense, at least figures some things out, and he got more exciting to watch as the narrative went along, and sometimes got me all up in my emotions (yes I cried by the way). A common gripe I'm sure some of you have is the side characters. That continues to be my complaint as well, but I think they handled the side characters well and used them more effectively than before, which is a step in the right direction.

ENJOYMENT: 14.2/15

Probably the show I enjoyed the most out of everything this season, it's just very wholesome and gets you emotional sometimes.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 24.5/30

The romance theme here was flushed out very effectively, and it made the story all the more enjoyable. The comedy isn't that great, but it functions well enough. Overall, a definite improvement in emphasizing the thematic elements of the show than any of the first two seasons.

OVERALL: 84.5/100

This was fun to watch, no doubt about it. Story slowed down in the first half, but the latter half made it all worth it. The ending to each season always knocks it out of the park, and for this season, there was no exception. The movie is coming soon, and you bet I'll be ready for that when the time comes!"
21292,"At first glance, one would think that this is a yaoi anime, but even without the ""shounen-ai"" tag, it's not. It's one of those rare romance anime where the main characters are the same gender, but the romance is heterosexual. When I first saw this anime, I thought probably the same thing as anyone else who was unfamiliar with this anime before it aired, ""This is going to be another borderline-yaoi anime, is it?"" Then, I read the description, and my curiosity was piqued. For that reason, I ended up watching it when it premiered, and I must say that it was a fun anime to watch.

Ladies and gentlemen, here is my review of ""Nijiiro Days"".

Nijiiro Days follows four high school boys, Natsuki Hashiba, Tomoya Matsunaga, Keiichi Katakura, and Tsuyoshi Naoe, as they go through their high school lives. One Christmas Eve, Natsuki gets dumped by his girlfriend, and as he is crying about it, he is handed some tissues by a girl wearing a Santa outfit; at that moment, he falls for that girl. He later runs into the girl, Anna Kobayakawa, at school, and he tries to get closer to her while his friends try to meddle in their relationship. Every once in a while, the focus shifts from Natsuki to one of the other three boys as they deal with their own love-related problems; Mari Tsutsui is Anna's man-hating best friend who Tomoya ends up liking, Nozomi Matsunaga is Tomoya's younger sister who has feelings for Keiichi (while Tomoya does not approve), and Yukiko Asai is Tsuyoshi's cosplaying girlfriend.

It's a rather easygoing story with comedic moments sprinkled in here and there. It's really a breath of fresh air, though; after all, all of the main characters are male, but since all of their love interests are female, there is no way one can consider this a ""borderline-yaoi"" anime at all. Luckily, these heterosexual relationships are, for the most part, believable. The one exception may be the one between Tomoya and Mari; I honestly felt more ""hate"" than ""love"" in their relationship, but at the very least, it was given a bit of development. I really liked Natsuki and Anna's relationship, though; it was fun to watch as their relationship grew. However, I really would have liked some more development on the relationships between Keiichi and Nozomi and Tsuyoshi and Yukirin; however, I guess what we get is what we have. (Hopefully, there is more development to those two relationships in the manga....)

The animation, done by Production Reed, wasn't anything too groundbreaking, but for an anime as simple as this one, it's more than acceptable. It definitely had bright colors, and with a title that translates to ""Rainbow Days"", I think that fits quite well. As for the voice acting, the voice actors did a great job with their respective characters. The music was also great, too; I liked every single one of the opening and ending themes. The best one, however, was the third ending theme, ""'I Wanna Be Your Knight"" by Takuya Eguchi, Tomoya's voice actor; it just sounds so cool with an amazing singer to boot!

Overall, Nijiiro Days was a good anime. If you're in the mood for an easygoing slice-of-life anime with romance sprinkled in, this is the anime for you. These rainbow-colored days cannot be forgotten about!"
99940,"Speaking honestly, this is the seventh Junji Ito review I've done at this point.  At this point, I feel like I should just start by very quickly recapping my personal history with Junji Ito. I had no idea this man existed until a good friend of mine told me about [Gyo](https://anilist.co/anime/10417/Gyo) like a year or two ago. A horror OVA about killer fish and sharks with spider legs. I watched that, [thought it was hilarious](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2296), and decided to gaze further into the Itosphere.

img440()

His [short story collections](https://anilist.co/search?type=manga&q=ito%20junji), [Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/manga/30436/Uzumaki), [Tomie](https://anilist.co/manga/30912/Tomie), the [actual manga of Gyo](https://anilist.co/manga/30909/Gyo), and so forth... there are still some I've yet to read, but I'd argue that's mostly because I'm saving what's left for rainy days.

Finally, this new anime adaptation was announced, which would turn out to be an anthology series of a large handful of his short stories rather than an Uzumaki anime adaptation. 

img440()

Personally, I was very happy that it wasn't Uzumaki. As much as I love Uzumaki, I really fucking love Junji Ito's short stories, even if the scores I have the individual collections set as don't necessarily always reflect that. Additionally, an anthology series meant a potentially wide net of his material over his career would be animated. 

There are stories that I don't like, there are stories that I love, and even for the stories I don't necessarily think are very good, there usually are ideas in there that are interesting. I should say right now I've previously gone on record going as far to essentially call Junji Ito the [Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StephenKing) of manga. Which appears on the surface to be praise to an almost hyperbolic level, until you remember while Stephen King is the author of novels such as The Shining, The Stand, It, Misery, The Dark Tower, Pet Sematary, and etc...

...He is also the author of [Cell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10567.Cell). A novel about cell phones triggering the apocalypse because people who use cell phones turn into zombies. Get it? Because people use their cell phones too much and they become like zombies. Get it? If you're going to do a huge amount of stories, you're going to end up having some Cells. It's unavoidable. The point is Junji Ito likewise has stories that I'd qualify as ""misses"", but the ones I love are just so fucking wonderful in my opinion that I'm perfectly willing to accept the weaker ones.

img500()

Hence, this review will be more about how I overall view this as a Junji Ito adaptation. When I reviewed [Yami Shibai 5](https://anilist.co/anime/98978/YamiShibai5) which is an episodic horror TV short, I essentially [went through every single story](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2301). But since this isn't a short and I don't have to dissect every single story because not all of them are absolutely terrible like Yami Shibai 5 or [Sekai no Yami Zukan](https://anilist.co/anime/98442/SekainoYamiZukan), I'll be focusing on my five favorite stories of this adaptation as well as my five least favorite. That's still ten stories out of the grand total of twenty four.




First though, before I get too much further, I suppose I should put forth my overall opinion of this as just a general horror series. 

img440()

There are numerous flavors and types of horror out there. Do not approach this series with Yami Shibai/jumpscare horror in mind. Obviously, Yami Shibai was created with the intention of scaring the viewer. Small little horror stories that more or less often usually end with a jumpscare or a monster appearing and then fading to black. I think there's a place for that type of horror in this world, it's just... so easy to overdo the jumpscares. Especially if you have very loud noises accompanying them. In my opinion at that point, you're not really trying to scare people anymore. You're just trying to startle them.

Junji Ito's horror is... well, there's a good variety throughout all of the stories they selected to adapt with this series. You have the outright dark humor stuff with the Souichi character, there's the weird body horror stuff, supernatural strangeness, whimsical insanity, horrific nightmarish monsters, and outright gory violence. There are also a few stories in here that are more sad and melancholic about death and the lengths people attempting to move once a loved one has died/the dead who wish to be reunited with their surviving family member or friend will go to.

img440()

They are capable of creating a suitable atmosphere with each of the stories they've chosen. They capably managed to make me feel what I felt when I read the original stories, but some of them actually work even better when animated in my opinion. I've been creeped out, I've been disgusted, and it even made me feel emotions at times. But I never jumped out of my seat as a result of being ""scared.""

In addition, I feel like I shouldn’t even have to go into this that much but I will… this is a perfectly acceptable adaptation of Junji Ito’s manga. In the review I did for Gyo I touched upon this because for the anime adaptation of Gyo, they made everything painfully bright and colorful. It fucking sucked. But while of course this anime took a bunch of different Junji Ito manga and added color to the images, they didn’t go overboard with it. It’s still (in my opinion) sufficiently dark. Yes, it doesn't have quite that effect Junji Ito's actual manga has, but they’re not gonna make a completely black and white anime. It's just not gonna happen. This is probably the best we're gonna get. And for me, it's like right at the correct level.



Granted, if they ever animate Uzumaki, I might flip flop on my position here, because I honestly can’t picture that fucking manga in color. At all. Like adding color to all of the spirals and the mass amount of blood… I don’t know why but I think the blood being black actually has more impact than it being red? Uzumaki is a completely different conversation, though to bring it back to the Junji Ito collection with that last statement, I did definitely think “yeah this is worse” with at least Fashion Model and a couple of other select stories. Though, I was still very much capable of enjoying them.

img440() 

The animation overall seems cheapish at various points, but apart from one select story, it never really harmed my enjoyment of this adaptation. In addition, considering probably Yami Shibai is probably the only comparable series to this series, the bar was never set high for me to begin with. Like… maybe there’s some other obscure horror anthology series that’s slipped past by me, but Yami Shibai is probably the only one people still throw around and bring up.

In my heart, this is one of my favorite horror anime almost by default. It's a respectable enough adaptation of a bunch of Junji Ito short stories which before this, I would have been fully willing to assume would never ever be animated.

So with all of that out of the way, let's get into the stories themselves. Really quickly though, I'm going to be including a list of all the stories included in this adaptation and link which Junji Ito collections they're from for easy reference as well as the years. Though, the years may not be accurate or exact for the specific story, as I'm going with the year/year range given to the volumes themselves.

The stories that are italicized are also available in the recent collection of previously published Junji Ito stories, Shiver. Which, like this anime, is a celebration of Junji Ito's thirty years in horror manga.




Let's start with my least favorites first. I need to throw a disclaimer out right away though. Some of these are actually in fact among my favorite Junji Ito short stories. But I didn't particularly like the way they were done in this adaptation or felt that they just cut too much out. Or in at least one instance, isn't even the actual full story. But let's get started.

img440()
To be honest, the adaptation of this was fine. But this is just another one of his stories I feel very ""meh"" towards. Like sure yeah, the image of the guy with all of the holes in his face is cool and creepy, but I remember going ""is that it?"" when I finished this one. There's a cursed thing, and it causes people to be cursed when people are around or in the direct vicinity of the thing.

img440()
[I really liked this one.](https://anilist.co/activity/7997432) Maybe if only because it's straight up just Junji Ito's own personal take on vampires. And while I want to applaud at how the blood-bubble bushes turned out being animated, I just can't help but feel like this would have been way better if they had just not cut so much out from the original story. In the manga, the vampire guy doesn't just let the couple leave after realizing he's a vampire. No, the vampire kids storm the vampire guy's mansion armed with an axe and they just start feeding on the vampire guy's hoard of blood bubble bushes, and the couple escapes amidst the chaos. That would have been great to see animated! We didn't get it though.

img440()
This one isn't so much the adaptation's fault. Of all of the short stories I've read by Junji Ito, this is in fact probably one of the ones I liked the least. There's too much going on, to the point where my mind goes back to when Junji Ito stated that sometimes he actually becomes bored when doing some of his stories. Which I can only imagine is the explanation for this story and like... Gyo. Like if this story were just about the insane aunt and the actual town where instead of roads, people just travel through other people's homes, that'd be one thing. But it starts out with and eventually comes back to this weird guy calling himself Jack the Ripper that can apparently both travel through dreams as well as murder through dreams. Also, this is probably the most censored story out of the entire adaptation. It doesn't bother me that much, but it's worth noting anyways.

img440()
I was very excited when I learned that [Lovesick Dead](https://anilist.co/manga/74767/ItoJunjiKyoufuMangaCollectionHibitonoKowazurai) was going to be included in this. It's actually one of my absolute favorites. But I was under the assumption that they were going to be doing the whole thing. This is one of the weird ones of Junji Ito's collections, where the story is straight up the entire volume. I think they only adapted like maybe the first half and even out of what they covered, they cut out a lot. And there's like a part where a character kills themselves by like cutting their own neck, and it's just like an explosion of blood mist and I clearly distinctly remember thinking ""that looks bad."" I really just don't like blood mist. In anything.


img440()
It's really unfortunate that this ended up being number one on this list. I fucking love the original story, and I think overall, it's one of Junji Ito's more infamous short stories. After all, it's one of the ones that even got a [live action movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NagaiYume). But I think the overall quality of this one is one of the worst of the entire adaptation. Apart from that one frame of where he's really, really fucked up, I also just generally don't like how Mukoda looks in the anime.

Admittedly, despite what I said earlier, it may at least partially be a result of the color.

Apart from when they of course take that close up drawing of him at the end of his transformation right from the manga and just add color to it. Additionally, there was this whole section where he actually describes his dreams, and I'm kind of salty that they didn't include any of that.

img440()




It turns out limiting myself to only five made this one insanely difficult. Like Souichi is genuinely one of my favorite recurring Junji Ito characters of all, and none of his stories are even on here despite the fact I really love two out of three of them included in this adaptation.

img440()
Choosing the story for the fifth and lowest spot as far as my favorites go is hard. There's several more that could have qualified or are equal to this one. Souichi, Greased, Honored Ancestors... but I have to go with this one, even if the manga's version is better. First of all, with both this story and Gyo, I really have to wonder what the fuck Junji Ito has against circuses. Personally, I fucking love the idea of a circus ran by Death himself where all the performers die in brutal and horrific accidents. But in the manga, it's better because we're shown a lot more of the audience's perspective but then... I realized,  we, the viewers with the anime version, ARE the audience. Hence it ending with the ringmaster addressing us directly. It made me feel warm inside that they actually tried to do a thing like that with this one in direct opposition of, for example, what ICLA tries to do with Yami Shibai.

img440()

Also, I should at least mention it, but in this one, there's a part where clearly you can see when the clowns that remove the corpses from the stage run out, like they didn't do all frames of them actually running out there. Cheap animation strikes again! But I'm fine with it. At least there IS animation...

img440()
This is probably my favorite story out of [Fragments of Horror](https://anilist.co/manga/82435/ManoKakera) which I will most likely review one day and fully go into. But I really fucking love the idea of this story, and they captured the tone and everything perfectly. Like the idea of conjuring an entity that resembles and believes it's your deceased family member/relative to deal with the grief of losing the actual person is fucked up, sad, and kind of horribly selfish. Because like when the family has gotten out of the mourning period, those afterimages are still just stuck there for numerous additional years until they finally disappear. The idea is actually really effectively sad. Bridge is the other story of this type of tone included in this adaptation and while I really love that one too, I kind of like Gentle Goodbye slightly more. 

img440()
I have two words for you. Whimsical. Insanity. They could have completely fucked this one up by trying to apply a super serious scary tone to it. But thankfully, they didn't! The idea of this story originates from just a random thought Junji Ito had one day.

""Manga artists are ascetics. You sit on a chair all day, leaning over your desk, and make the tip of your pen move over the paper of your manga pages. The fact that the page is longer vertically is hateful because you have to lean even farther forward when you're drawing the top panels. Your back and hips shriek in agony. It would be so much better if the page were longer horizontally. No, better still, I'd like to hang my upper body from the ceiling. How lovely would it be to leave my body like that and get the work done? This story came from thoughts like these. Servants would control me from the ceiling. And then I'd be able to get my work done with ease."" Junji Ito, Shiver.

img440()

So I of course just now have this permanent mental image of Junji Ito hanging from the ceiling via strings while drawing his manga. I really love how they handled this one. The music, Jean-Pierre, the movements of the Marionette family themselves... I kind of wish they had shown the part where he had seen the people in the ceiling, but oh well. I understand due to time constraints, they can't include literally everything. And this is one of the more forgivable instances of that in this adaptation.

img440()
While I like the [Oshkiri volume](https://anilist.co/manga/74755/ItoJunjiKyoufuMangaCollectionKubiGensou), I kind of really didn't expect to love the Oshkiri story they included in this adaptation as much as I do. Like Lovesick Dead, they don't include the whole story in this adaptation, but I'm willing to give them a pass with Oshkiri considering the entire thing is multiple/alternate universes. Whereas Lovesick Dead is its own linear story. I absolutely loved the rotting and screaming monstrous forms of Oshkiri's classmates from the alternate universe and they're genuinely horrifying. This is a story that fucking perfectly demonstrates the weirdness of Junji Ito. Like is Oshkiri is just a normal teenage boy, he just happens to have invisible dimensional portals around his house, and then when he encounters his evil alternate self, the sole reason why Evil Oshkiri is turning his classmates into monsters is because he wants to make himself taller.

We didn't get to see the rest of the Oshkiri madness (I actually remember it getting even weirder beyond this story), but like... that transformation Evil Oshkiri is forced into. Like oh my god yes. We see his bones extending and his flesh ripping and the screams are just WONDERFUL.

img440()

img440()
What a fucking surprise that the Tomie story is one of the ones that received the highest quality when they adapted it. It's not like Tomie launched Junji Ito's career or spawned like an [eight film long live action movie series or anything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomie). But no really, this is probably my favorite of all of the Tomie stories. And they pulled it off perfectly. From the rapidly quickening descent of insanity and obsession that the artist falls into that takes hold over all the men who become involved with Tomie to Tomie's rage and anger at being depicted like a monster. It's a perfect adaptation of the story. Also, I rarely if ever actually comment on voice actors/actresses in things, but like... the moment I heard her speak. Yeah. Yeah, that's Tomie. It's unfortunate that the Tomie OVAs are most likely probably going to be her origin stuff, rather than some of the more absurd/insane Tomie stories.

img440()

Though, I may be wrong! Who knows! Though, it'd be really weird if they didn't do her origin at all.

Painter itself was like the first Tomie story Junji Ito did when he and his editor decided to basically extend Tomie into her own whole series and as a result, it basically serves more or less as the perfect entry level Tomie story. I'm happy that we're getting more Tomie in the form of OVAs, but with the show itself, I was honestly hyped almost every single week to see what stories they were adapting next.




img440()

Yeah, just kidding. I have to talk about Souichi. I'll keep it short, but I fucking love Souichi both just as a general Junji Ito recurring character and also in this adaptation. Just like how the voice actress who voiced Tomie captured Tomie perfectly, [this man](https://anilist.co/staff/95874/YujiMitsuya) IS Souichi.

img440()

Souichi is basically Junji Ito's walking take on dark humor. Souichi isn't a monster and he doesn't kill anybody. He's just this pathetic kid who chews on nails and fucks with people. All his curses and pranks end up leading into disastrous results, most usually for Souichi himself. My favorite part about Souichi is not only the fact that his family has grown so used to him that they don't even seem to fucking react to all the crazy shit he does, but that in one of the Souichi stories (that happens to be a part of this adaptation), when a true blue monster of the Itoverse shows itself completely unrelated to Souichi himself...

Souichi just shits himself like every other normal individual in the Itoverse who comes face to face with these monsters.

img440()

Unfortunately, I know for a fact that the opinions on Souichi are very mixed, with probably the majority of people not really liking or caring for him but... I fucking love him and his crazy antics. There's not a huge amount of them, but Souichi is personally my absolute favorite recurring Junji Ito character. This supernatural prankster that just roams around cursing people, and usually just gets shit on by his own antics when they backfire horribly.

img440()




They adapted eight out of nine stories from the Shiver collection, and skipped probably my personal favorite all time Junji Ito short story, Hanging Balloons. This isn't actively lowering my opinion of the show itself, but I am somewhat genuinely grumpy (this section was written after mostly everything else and when the show actually finished airing), since this was probably the best/only chance to see the story animated.

I mean, come on. I just wanted to see a balloon headed doppelganger hang someone with a noose. Is that too much to ask???

img440()




Could it have been better? Yes. Could their selection of stories have been better? Probably, but I'm glad that they tried to grab a wide variety of stories, and I truly believe the variety present throughout is what makes this show work. Was it terrible? No. Did it ruin the stories it adapted? No. Was it a Gyo? No, the creators of this or at least some of them, are actual fans of Junji Ito's manga and I got that feeling almost all the way through this adaptation. After all, they didn't make everything stupidly bright and colorful and actually tried to remain faithful to Junji Ito's character designs.

Is my opinion influenced by favoritism because of how much I love Junji Ito and how insanely low the bar for this was set in my mind before it aired as a result of the horror genre mostly being a [joke](https://anilist.co/anime/99698/OusamaGameTheAnimation) as far as anime goes? Definitely. But I don't care. I love this. The Junji Ito Collection is an 8 out of 10 for me, and again, basically by default, is in my opinion one of the best horror anime. Not [THE best](https://anilist.co/anime/7724/Shiki), but that's a different story for another day.

It's certainly the best episodic anthology of horror stories, though. Sorry, Yami Shibai.

I CAN'T BELIEVE I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED. IT'S A FUCKING MIRACLE.

99916,"On its surface, there’s not much particularly special about Asagao to Kase-san. It’s an incredibly pretty OVA, the type that studio ZEXCS seem to specialize in. There is one big thing about it though that separates it from most of those, which is that it's a yuri OVA (based off of a well-known manga in the genre), and not a particularly beat-around-the-bush-y one either. The series in fact, almost starts with a kiss, which is part of an opening montage, set to narration from Yamada (our protagonist), that begins with that cliche yuriism, ”even though we’re both girls…” expertly spun into the setup of a story that begins with the first kiss. By the time the narrative proper starts, Yamada and her love Kase are already dating.

img880()
img880()



If you’re not yourself gay it can be hard to underscore how important that is. Yuri--especially yuri written by men--tends to treat the first kiss and the love confession as an endpoint. The payoff after chapter after chapter of teasing and will they or won’t they. Kase-san has no interest in that, and there’s refreshingly little of the purity dynamics that still define a good chunk of straight-written yuri. This is a romance story, and one that is about a relationship already in progress.

Using old yuri cliches to its own ends becomes something of a hallmark of the OVA as it progresses. Our leads are about as archetypal as they come. Yamada is short, blonde, bookish (her love of gardening is a recurring theme), very femme, shy, and rather innocent. Kase is on the taller side, has short, dark hair, is the school track star, definitely the more butch of the two, and, it’s implied, the more experienced. It would’ve been very easy to write a story where the two are defined by their differences and it pulls them into easy misunderstandings. Kase-san largely isn’t like that, though, for the conflicts the two have (there are only a few, but they’re focal points of the OVA), there is no ambiguity that they both love each other wholeheartedly, it’s such a refreshing thing to see that it’s forgivable when the OVA does occasionally dip into more cliched territory (such as Yamada being insecure about her body when seeing Kase nude for the first time, in the context of a shared bath, mind you). The ending in particular will either make you bawl or grimace depending on how jaded you are. I count myself in the former category, but it’s understandable that that’d not be true of everyone.

Praise must be given to the visuals and sound in this thing too. Both are genuinely gorgeous, characters have a modern look, but they’re incredibly expressive, especially the eyes--each character has colored highlights toward the bottom of their eyes, and they’re beautiful, almost making them (when the characters are particularly emotional) look like jewels, or even jelly candies. 

img880()



The backgrounds are gorgeous too, which would be a minor point if Kase-san didn’t like to cut to background shots as its characters talked, giving the relatively mundane world of the OVA a slightly dreamy edge. The real crowning achievement in the visuals department though is Yamada’s nightmare near the end, faced with the prospect of possibly losing Kase, she imagines herself underwater in a vast ocean, the nagging voice in her head (represented by her redheaded friend, the OVA’s only other real character) spurring her to action in the last minutes of the film. 

img880()
img880()



The soundtrack is lovely too. It tends toward the light and airy, only getting darker when it really needs to (such as during the aforementioned nightmare scene), but the easy highlight is actually the ending song. A sweet, slightly amateurish duet between what sounds like the VAs of the main couple, singing their hearts out about their love for each other, paired with some clever and really charming lyrics (some credit for that bit is probably due to anonymous fan translator Anonyneko, but how much is hard to say). 

“Sweet” is probably the OVA’s defining adjective, if you had to give it one. There’s really just not enough of this. Rock-solid romance stories between girls, backed up with very strong character writing and gorgeous visuals, but at the end of the day the big thing is just how hard you’re rooting for these two by the end of the OVA’s just shy of 60 minute runtime. Kase-san ends with a post-credits scene of its two leads leaning on each other’s shoulders on a train while they talk about flower language, and it’s the perfect ending to one of the best depictions of young love this reviewer’s ever seen in the medium.

101349,"Prologue

Approaching this show is a difficult task. This isn’t because the show tackles harsh subject matter involving the likes of suicide as one of its fundamental talking points. It’s not because the show isn’t exactly good at doing so, either. It’s because I’m still coming to terms with what an absolute shitshow this series has become. There’s this immense swirl of emotions that come about from watching a show crumble before your very eyes, keenly aware that there were signs of trouble from the beginning. Babylon showed promise of being a fascinating police procedural with some of the most noteworthy directing of 2019...or at least that was the case for the first 7 episodes. Unfortunately, the last arc happened. Not only was I unable to accept any of the more idiotic decisions the show had been making as its presentation became blander and more obtuse, but the finale is one of the most devastating trainwrecks of recent years, invalidating almost everything the show had built up to that point.

Part 1: The Rise

Back when the show was about Zen Seizaki and his colleagues being wrapped up in a murder turned mass suicide mystery, the show had some of the best pacing of any recent seasonal. Its ability to generate tremendous cliffhangers was borderline unrivaled, even in the same year that Beastars and Promised Neverland came out. It never spent too much time dawdling on what the audience already knew or on presenting a character’s entire backstory since finding how the cause of a murder and eventually putting a stop to two people related to a string of suicides was at the forefront. Some of the characters that Zen interacted with, such as the morbidly nonchalant Shinobu Kujin and Zen’s first subordinate, Atsuhiko Fumino. Their banter often added a sense of levity to the tense first two arcs, and they’re involved in some of the more shocking scenes of the show.

The music was done by composer Yukata Yamada, the composer for the music of Vinland Saga. He creates several moody piano melodies that add to the show’s sense of gravitas. On top of that, there are some more electronic tracks that morph in ways that accentuate some of the show’s craziest moments and cliffhangers. The track “A Given” which plays during several key moments, is the perfect example of this. Unfortunately, as good as the soundtrack is, it often feels overplayed. Vinland Saga suffered a similar problem with its piano tracks, where the same few tracks are used in almost every episode. Regardless, there are several quality pieces here. The show’s 3 EDs are also fine songs in their own right, particularly 1 and 3. The first song “Live or Let Die” by Q-MHz feat. uloco, is a more chaotic piece while the last ED, adds a sense of finality to an arc that otherwise has none.

As for the visuals, this is Studio REVOROOT’s first full-length project and their second solo outing. The production values are rickety, with awkward CG environments and people scattered all over the place, and very few sequences that have much in the way of good animation. The show often feels jank, and the rough art style with white outlines does not help matters. Despite all of this, director Kiyotaka Suzuki was able to finally let loose after the horrible Psycho-Pass 2 and the decent yet already forgotten FLCL Alternative. The camera angles are often dynamic, there’s the usage of sepia tones and several interesting techniques. Episodes 2 and 7, in particular, have some of the most fascinatingly presented scenes of 2019. The former accentuates the sense of dread and confusion the former is meant to evoke, while the latter further conveys the sense of sheer agony that the main character feels in the final scene of episode 7. It’s a 5-minute torture sequence where the main character, Zen Siezeki, is forced to watch someone get cut to pieces as his ideology crumbles to the helplessly crumbles to the ground after everything he has been through. This is where the show peaks and you should stop, before the direction largely begins falling flat, and the show takes a tremendous nosedive.

Part 2: The Fall

spoilers beyond this point

Where do I begin? Just know that I'm not even gonna go over everything that was particularly off about the show's writing.

The first sign of trouble came at the end of the first arc, when it turned out that the new mayor of Shiniki had proposed a suicide law, making it do that you can commit die of your own free will without penalty since apparently that's actually illegal. He insisted this by having dozens of people gleefully jump off a building. Needless to say, this required a bit of suspension of disbelief.

It turns out that this was made possible by Ai Magase whispering in their ears. There are several, several problems with Ai and her powers in general. 

A. She has offscreen shapeshifting powers. This isn't like with Fujiko Mine and other femme fatales that put on disguises. With those, they generally wear feasible wigs and can be identified by their face if you know what they normally look like. With Ai, despite having long hair, she can easily pull off all hair sizes, and her face can become unrecognizable with how different it is. It's as if between disguises which sometimes get deployed within mere minutes of one another, Ai goes through plastic surgery. It goes beyond having convincing disguises and into the realm of having supernatural abilities.

B. Mere moments before ending his own life, Shinobu tells our main protagonist that Ai can convince someone to uncontrollably want to kill themselves. Even the most steadfast and iron-willed individuals have a hard time resisting, so whatever she says, you do. It's how she was able to get out of interrogation in episode 2, and how all of those people in episode 3 ended up jumping off. As of the finale, it turns out that her saying...anything is grounds for suicide, rather than her seductively whispering a suggestion for you to kill yourself.

What's wrong with this picture? In this seemingly grounded police procedural with no confirmed supernatural elements, it seems a bit asinine for her to be able to pull this off with just her voice. What's stupider is that she doesn't even need to even specify that you have to die. In the finale, she whispers the phrase ""good job"" into the earpiece President Alexander Wood had on with his translators after speaking to a Japanese girl who was considering taking her own life. This was enough to get him to attempt suicide. Ridiculous, isn't it? Even more ridiculous than the idea that her whispering can trigger suicidal urges while her talking does nothing. Sure, whispering can be more seductive, but this is absurd. On top of that, there's a contradiction in the previous sentence. How come the horde of building jumpers in episode 3 kept themselves together and jumped off only on someone else's cue rather than their own accord while everyone else was unable to control their urges? This isn't the biggest issue, but it is still another knock against her whisper powers from a writing perspective

C. Episode 5. In middle school, she was somehow able to walk and talk in such a way that every male she encountered found themselves feeling so unbearably lustful that they genuinely felt raped. Even in the 7 episode grace period, I had a hard time swallowing this pill. Walking seductively is admittedly a thing but this is just tasteless and asinine. Luckily the idea of rape never comes up again, but this was definitely where I started to realize that maybe Babylon might be full of shit sometimes.

D. Ai herself is a rather disappointing character. She’s flash without the fire. She’ll get inside Zen’s head with borderline inane monologues about good and evil, but thanks to the director going ham during those sequences, they’re some of the most entertaining in the show. They obfuscate how dumb and insubstantial her dialogue is, like when in episode 7, she is trying to make Zen think about what evil really is (despite him doing so but I guess his answers don’t align with hers, which we’ll get to) all hile butchering one of his subordinates right in front of him.  All she amounts to is just a person who loves being evil and wants to spread an asinine notion of good and evil around. One of her interactions with Zen reveals that in spite of and because of the villainous acts she is knowingly doing, she believes she’s some hero spreading an important message, doing a service to humanity so they’ll understand what good and evil really are. It would have been interesting if part of Ai’s motivation was for people to be able to understand her, and what it must have felt like to feel almost alien to everyone around her as everyone always thinks of her as a twisted, enigmatic female figure. That sure went nowhere despite the show delving into how she received therapies that ended up being worthless to her and how she finds this plight to get people to understand her version of good and evil to be a just cause.

The other major antagonist, Itsuki, isn’t that great either. While he does get an interesting debate in episodes 6 and 7 where he reveals that he wants to die so his kid can have his heart during a necessary heart transplant surgery that may happen in the future, afterwards he has almost no presence in the show. Nothing regarding his suicide law even gets resolved by the end. Speaking of characters that get shafted in the final arc, the last 5 episodes had the potential to really show how bad Zen’s mental state is after every single one of his colleagues in his field got killed. While episode 8 has him hallucinating here and there, that’s the last time the show does anything particularly captivating. Afterwards, he states his desire vengeance, gets aggy at a recording of her voice, and then fades into the background until the finale. Everyone else who survived the first two arcs gets thrown to the wayside as well, including Zen’s family that have death flags all around them despite nothing happening to them.

Before we get...there, one character relevant to the finale has to be mentioned, as no one else is that interesting or important enough to bring up. Alexander Wood gets introduced via a scene where he monologues his life story to the audience, about how he got a girlfriend, how he became god tier at this MMORPG, how he now has a wealthy family and a kid that’s healthier than he could ever be, and everything. Not only is that a terrible way to introduce a character, but it becomes the first sign that the wonderful pacing of the show would go downhill. Then you learn he’s also the president. I’ll let that one sit on the part of your brain that’s forced to process it. He thinks a lot and is a decent guy. That’s really all there is to him.

Part 3: THE ENDING

You ever think of a worst case scenario for how a promising show you're not entirely sure about will play out, and then wish you got that instead of whatever the fuck you just saw? That's Babylon's finale. It might be one of the worst endings I have ever seen.

Throughout the entirety of the show, there have been two main ideological conflicts at play: the nature of good and evil, and the ethics/logistics of suicide/the suicide law. Episodes 6 had an engaging debate where several government heads oppose the suicide law through the socio-economic, moral/ethical, the extreme scenario and accusations, and and “people naturally avoid death” perspectives. While they may have felt surface level due to them getting one minute to make one point, it was at least able to offer up several perspectives that would logically be used to approach controversial laws.

Episode 11 has world leaders make strawman viewpoints about how “people gain their sense of morality through us leaders so we much teach them that suicide is wrong” while completely forgetting that most people still consider suicide wrong and that no one gets their sense of morality through world, country, or state leaders. The other viewpoints expressed are no better and just result in mindless bickering before President Wood decides that we need to examine the nature of good and evil in order to determine a unanimous position on the suicide law. What follows is the most tiresome deliberation I have ever heard, as everyone just spins their wheels examining the two most common and basic moral quandaries without actually pressing the issue further than the most surface-level ideas barely getting much exploration. My logistics class went further into moral dilemmas and that is a class where we learn about jobs, warehouse jobs, and forklift-driving. This is the epitome of the show’s incessant wheel-spinning on its topics, as even before this point it has already become a cyclical game of “what is good, what is bad, what is justice?” getting shallow, simplistic exploration despite the show constantly acknowledging how complex these issues are.

That whole idea means nothing anyway and is an excuse to wax about concepts the show barely has a grasp on before Pres Alex Wood is called to convince a girl not to jump off a building. Itsuki, who initiated the summit, sets this up. In the last episode, Alex gets a translator and gets to work. The day is saved until it turns out that after this, all of the translators (since apparently there is more than one despite there being only one volunteer) are dead and Ai Magase, who is disguised as someone that was not in the building and was never shown prior, whispers “good job” in good ol Woody’s ear. After this, we never hear about Itsuki or the suicide law ever again. During the convo, SudoWOODo finally comes up with the answers to what good and bad are. 

Good = continue
Bad = end

Let’s talk about how mind-shatteringly stupid this is. If continuing is inherently a good thing, does it remain that way when applied to the act of continuing to murder innocent people? What about continuing to bully people? What about continuing to swindle people, kill animals for the hell of it, gamble all your money away, suffer, etc? Can continuing be used in a positive context in those situations? No. Is continue just the show’s silly and obnoxious way of saying life? No, but that’s the only context being applied to the term in the show. You can apply it positively to say, continuing to prosper, continuing to help people, etc. but the show isn’t smart enough to do so. The idea of ending being a bad thing is just as stupid. Should “end world hunger, end your addiction, end someone’s torture, end the show on a high note, end your career with one great game, etc.” be used negatively? No. Is “end” the show’s shorthand for “end your life”? Probably. Can you apply end in a negative light with ideas such as “end someone’s life, end someone’s career, end your relationship (that one can be positive or negative), etc.”? Yes, but the show doesn’t think of that because it’s too busy thinking it has all the answers to a broad concept.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Ai Magasee, that fucking idiot, wanted to spread to the world. This is what Zen ends up answering with once he and the president figure it out after a standoff where Zen has to shoot Wood in order to prevent him from committing suicide. As laughable as that sequence is, the idea that he has to stop Wood from killing himself after the man had just talked a girl out of ending her own life on international television, is the smartest thing the finale could come up with. After this, it is implied that through this last standoff, despite Zen pointing a gun at Ai and her just pointing a finger gun gesture at him, he dies and she gets to walk off and meet his kids. That is how the show ends, with the most anticlimactic and nonsensical ambiguous ending I have ever seen.

Also, in episode 11, Morning Wood decides that perhaps the key to answering the suicide law debate and the fundamental nature of good and evil is to decipher the meaning of life. This never gets brought up again. The suicide law gets no resolution as we never find out what the decision was regarding the law or anything about what would happen to it either. Itsuki and his new country, Shiniki, just disappear halfway into the finale. Ai does not even get challenged by Zen despite him pointing a gun at her after everything she had done to him and to hundreds of people. The three main conceits of the show, all rendered moot in the span of 10 minutes. None of this meant a damn thing, and all it would amount to is negative answers and Zen potentially being dead without feeling like his rivalry with Magase ever really came to a head. The entire show was just one big waste of time. You could honestly just stop at the first scene of episode 8 and act like Ai drove Zen irreparably insane while she wreaks havoc on the world. It’s about as conclusive as what we actually got, and a lot less stupid to boot.

There is one last thing to mention before we wrap things up. There’s an easy fix to the suicide law debacle, one that is based on what Itsuki wished would happen. The answer is simply to treat it on a case by case basis, making sure to educate people on the ramifications their actions would have on their families and those around them before they decide to off themselves. The more knowledgeable they are of the severe effects taking your own life would have, the less likely they are of committing suicide and the more open and knowledgeable they would be regarding the subject. Not once is this idea brought up in the final arc of the show by any of the world leaders, when at least one politician in the second arc weaponizes this idea.

Epilogue

To all the people hesitant about this show and its writer after the hellfire that was Kado’s finale: you were right to steer clear. Truly this is a case where the ending will overshadow the show as a whole after eliminating any goodwill many had with the show’s first 7 episodes. Honestly, the cover is the most clever and thought-provoking aspect of this pretentious mess, and the “p-word” is a condemnation I don’t use lightly. Spare yourself the disappointment, aggravation, and sense of betrayal. There are a lot of silly moments and twists I did not even go over, and as I was writing this review, it became genuinely difficult to remember the more positive aspects of the show’s writing. The more I think about it, the worse the show gets. For something meant to be more intellectual, filled with more gravitas than your average anime, this is perhaps the most succinctly damning thing I can say about it. Let this be a lesson that if an anime looks like it can go either way, it's probably going south."
4155,"I've long been curious about Strong World for the same reason that I imagine many One Piece readers were: it has the unique quality of being able to boast a screenplay written by Eiichiro Oda himself, the mangaka who delights and horrifies us on a weekly basis with the ongoing adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates and his tendency to never shut up about the breast sizes of the women of his world in his SBS letters pages. If that sentence didn't clue you in, I have something of a...tumultuous opinion of Oda, but undeniably his involvement in Strong World lends it an air of authenticity that drew me in in a way most of the other One Piece films, that wear their inconsequentiality practically as a badge of honor, do not. I already have so much One Piece to get through. Why stop for extra distractions?

More fool me. Strong World is practically the very definition of a distraction: inconsequential fluff that basically acts as a well-presented multi-hour key jangle. 

It's not bad, per se: there's some great moments and fun redesigns for the cast (except for Nami. Please be normal about Nami Oda, I know you never will but please I am begging you), there's laughs to be had and fist-pumps to be made. Most of the cast get a cool moment to call their own, so there's something for fans of each Straw Hat. 

But that's it really. Despite Oda's much purported involvement, Strong World has no real weight brought by his script. It feels like One Piece, sure, but One Piece in a holding pattern, One Piece that isn't doing anything with the characters or the world that moves them along or adds new depth to them. Despite the comic's extreme length, there's precious few times I've sat down to read some One Piece and felt like I got nothing substantial out of it. I've never really felt like the comic was stalled, or spinning it's wheels. Even in it's slowest moments, I always feel like I'm learning more about these people and the world they inhabit in a way that enriches my enjoyment of the experience. 

Strong World has none of these strengths. Despite it's villain's interesting connections to the One Piece world (that go almost completely unremarked upon in the actual film), it is the definition of filler. It is empty-calorie storytelling that doesn't even use it's liminal (maybe??) non-canon space to just do something a bit weird and interesting. What we get here is essentially just a reprise of the (excellent) Arlong arc, but with almost none of the emotional gravitas or weight. Again it's not bad but it's not particularly special either. The most interesting thing I found about it is how Oda's writing did and did not translate to the screen: certainly the character voices are spot-on (for better or worse, Brook please shut up about panties) and Oda's effective impressionistic touches of worldbuilding remain on display here, but the pacing is a little off and weird. I particularly noticed in the comedy scenes: the instant transitions of panels suit work wonders for Oda's comic timing but when actual time of film separates them, they don't hit nearly as well. I've seen precious little of the One Piece anime, so maybe this is a consistent issue, but my overall impression of Oda's involvement was that he wasn't really using the new medium to it's fullest. Ultimately, Strong World didn't really do anything to dispel the notion that the One Piece films are strictly for fanatics craving their next hit of One Piece action, and that my time would probably be better served reading a few more chapters of the very good manga rather than watching a movie where nothing happens.

The prior exception to this assessment was Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island, something I watched because of the sage wisdom of my friends on twitter who love One Piece, and blew me away by being a genuinely incredible film that is maybe the highlight of my One Piece journey so far. I love this film for so many reasons, but one of the chief ones is that it really does feel like it engages with and moves the characters in interesting places. Sure, they get back to where they started at the end, but the Straw Hats went through some shit, man! It's maybe their collective lowest point, having their individual quirks and insecurities be drawn out in ways that genuinely drive them apart rather than provide room for playful banter, and not only is it incredible (and painful) to watch, but also it genuinely enhances the source material, mentally slotting it in. I know it isn't ""canon"" (who gives a shit lol) but key moments, particularly ""Say you want to live!"" and ""Nothing Happened"" would simply not have resonated with me as strongly as they did without having this adventure in the back of my mind, the time where this family was tested to their emotional limits and came out the other side closer than ever. 

You could say I'm being unfair holding Strong World to such a high standard, but I think it demonstrates that you can do something cool and interesting and exciting with this format. But in hindsight, maybe Oda's involvement was the problem from the start. After all, if he has a really great idea, he's probably just going to use it in the manga, right? Maybe the real lesson to be learned from comparing Strong World and Baron Omatsuri is that these films should a space for voices that aren't  Oda's, playing with his world and characters in ways he never would, new visions of the Grand Line and it's many wonders that can stand tall alongside the main series as great works in their own right. Because, for all that this film is perfectly enjoyable, it's also just a pale imitation of the real thing, and when these films are written like this, that's all they'll ever be. With this in mind, if there are any other standout One Piece films that do deliver the things I want that I may have missed in my dismissal, let me know!! 

Or if the Straw Hats wear drip as good as the suits they got at the end of this movie. I'm a simple person, at the end of the day."
126529,"First of all, I am happy they came out with a season 2, the first season was a great watch. However I feel like this season might not be as good as the first one, don't get me wrong I loved it but It just didn't hold my attention as much as season 1, they seemed to go a lot more into the psychological part of the anime especially with the Otonashi incident. That was a good episode or 2 of just talking, it wasn't bad but it was hard to stay focused at times. Speaking of that section of the anime, it may have been in more than just that part but the quality seemed to take a nose dive especially when the the view was a bit zoomed out. Forgive me if I get some of this wrong since I took a break in between the first and second half, but the first half was the highlight in my opinion, the incident involving the wooden doll had both aspects that make the anime good, mystery solving as well as the little bit of action we get sprinkled here and there throughout both seasons, it also introduced new characters that were actually built upon, instead of them just appearing without much backstory. The yuki-onna incident as well was built well, it provided good backstory as well as keeping things interesting even throughout the solving part. It was great to see side characters actually get so in depth unlike what some more recent anime have done. The haunted apartment incident was a pretty good start, it provided some information on Rikka as well as being its own mystery to solve, speaking of Rikka she seemed to disappear in the second half of the anime, she was mentioned a couple times but I thought we were going to see some more of her and maybe build upon her story a little, but it seems that will have to wait for season 3 if that happens to come. All in all I would highly recommend this to someone, especially someone that is into mystery solving, the supernatural and a little bit of gore/horror. It's a good anime to just sit back and watch and do some thinking, It can really captivate you when everything starts coming together and the big reveal is about to happen, it makes you feel so understanding when it all wraps up and the mystery is solved. I do wish there was a bit more action like the fight scene in season 1 with Iron lady(forgive me if thats not her name its been awhile) but it still did have a couple action scenes here and there which is always cool to see especially in this type of anime as its not these big flashy battles but rather calculated and supernatural type fights. 

To summarize; Good anime, you do need to be focused to follow the current event or else you will miss some key information. Great if you are into mystery and supernatural anime, it wraps up nicely, unlike me. The animation quality does tank sometimes but in the end it's still up there with season 1 if you liked that."

Love Lab is the kind of show that could easily slide under anyone's radar. At the time of writing this, AniList reports an average rating of 71% with a ranking of 45th overall for the year 2013. Looking at the summary and tags it would be easy to assume this show is no different from the plethora of mediocre anime in the CGDCT genre. 

But Lo! I am here to say that Love Lab is indeed an exception!

Let me introduce our two main characters: Riko and Maki



We are introduced to Riko, AKA ""The Wild Kid"", as she walks to the all-girls school we spend most of our time. Her nickname comes from her boyish, rowdy personality which makes her popular among her classmates.



Maki, AKA ""The Fuji Princess"", is seemingly nothing like Riko. Her nickname comes from her reputation as a highly respected, mature, and dependable student which in turn also makes her popular among her classmates. 



Our show starts when Riko is asked to deliver something to Maki where she discovers the well-respected princess is actually not who she seems to be -- she's a pillow-kissing loner desperate for love! 



Maki soon comes to believe Riko has a ton of experience with love which she does not deny. Unfortunately for Riko, she's no different than Maki when it comes to love and her lying will have consequences. 

Now coined the ""master of love"", Riko is roped into the student council by Maki to help her research love with her ""expertise"". Along the way we are introduced to new characters and plot developments that gradually increase the pressure on Riko to maintain her façade. What happens next is left for you to discover.

What makes Love Lab so memorable to me is the interactions between characters. Each episode features fast-paced slapstick skits that contrast very well with the underlying themes of guilt and friendship. Characters can be overly-expressive one moment and then reserved the next which leads to interesting dynamics as the show progresses.



I also found the pacing of the show to be very good. Oftentimes I find 13 episode shows fall victim to rushed endings or filler being stretched longer than acceptable to compensate for a lack of content. Love Lab manages to naturally build on its premise with new characters, plot developments, and dialogue that ultimately concludes in a satisfying and natural ending. 



Love Lab does not standout as a uniquely innovative show, however it shines as an anime well-written with memorable characters and dialogue. If you're looking for something to watch that offers relatively high entertainment value, I hope you'll consider this review."
10568,"Ever start watching a show, and as you do you keep remembering a different show that you watched in the past. In this case a show that did those themes so much better, that just sticks with you. Well this is one of those shows for me. I can see the direction this show was attempting to go really clearly, or at least what I think the plan was. It just did not get executed well at all, and in the end falls rather flat. 

So what is that plan that I figure they had. Well to me it seems to be the naive and innocent kid who ends up entering this much darker world somehow. And as the story progresses you see him grow and change, from this naive kid to an adult who is capable of so much more and things you never would expect him to be able to in the beginning. The issue this show has, is it doesn't execute this plan properly at all, and doesn't develop this character growth over the course of the season in a satisfactory way. 

They decided to go with a rather structured show with obvious arcs that got pulled right from the Light Novel it is based on. Each one is focused on a different character and their personal progression. And with these arcs you are supposed to see Narumi grow and change as events in these arcs occurred. But for me it largely felt like he didn't change that much. And definitely didn't change enough to follow through with the events that happen in the final arc of the season. It had potential with these arcs and possible growth, I've seen other shows do the same thing. But this just was not executed well at all. 

Contributing this to odd feeling is the main cast of the show. You are trying to have the main character enter this darker world that is completely opposite the world he inhabited previously. But the characters you are introduced to don't give off the correct feeling for this at all. And don't do the things you would expect at all, and instead spend a considerable amount of time doing very little. Even the name of their group doesn't work well for this, NEETs. The leader is the oddest, being a little girl who is good with computers and solves mysteries using it. Honestly of all the groups, the only one that works well is the gang you are introduced to. And eventually Narumi gets directly involved with the gang and helps them out, but he never goes deep enough to feel like he is changing from it. Mostly because the gang doesn't do anything evil or dangerous for most of the show, and never involving Narumi like they are protecting him. 

Really though, just in general none of this works well. It doesn't feel like this environment is a place that would lead to the changes in Narumi that he suddenly has by the end of the show. Not enough time was dedicated to weaving a dark story that is pushing Narumi to change from innocent to violent at all. Lots of potential, but nothing in execution. 

Outside of this, the visuals in the show aren't anything special at all. Nothing ever stood out to me at all or made me really pay extra attention to it. The music and OP and ED are just fine, didn't really play a major point for me at all. That side of things are just fine, nothing special. 

By the end, I would say go ahead and watch something that did the idea better. Like say Durarara!!, it is one of my favorite shows. And by the end of this I kept getting reminded of that show, that actually came out in a similar time span. Just not much in here that I could recommend, unless you have really ran out of stuff to watch, and want to see a mediocre LN adaption. Hmm, wonder if the Light Novel or Manga are any better?"
7769,"Ryoko Okami is a sixteen year old student, who goes to the very prestigious Otogi High School. She has a strong sense of justice, and is always ready and willing to throw her all into a fight in order to protect herself and others. This admirable toughness, along with her generosity and benevolence towards those weaker than her, serve her very well in the Otogi Bank, a school club that does favors for people in exchange for returned favors down the road.  She often works with her best friend and room mate, Akai Ringo, a girl who’s sweet and charming on the outside but cunning and manipulative on the inside. Together, this team of Wolf and Red strike terror into the hearts of the wicked… All of whom look like stereotypical anime punks.

One day, as they’re walking home from a mission, a mysterious boy from their class follows them, and proclaims his love for Ryoko! His name is Morino Ryoushi, a boy who’s bold in tongue but shy at heart, who gets terrified whenever somebody stares at him. But only if they think the word ‘staaaaaaaare’ while they’re doing it. With his ability to seemlessly blend into a crowd, he gets recruited into Otogi Bank, and now, the three have to continue working together! Well, that’s the set-up… I’ll save the plot for later, because hoo boy.

For now, Okami-san was produced by JC Staff, the people who produced Index and Toradora, and to say that it’s a step down would be putting it nicely. For those who don’t remember it, the animation in Toradora could occasionally look cheap and clunky, like a sketchy pen-and-ink design that isn’t quite finished. In order to make the movement of thew characters appear fluid, they skimp on the artwork, making for a really weird looking result if you go to slow-mo. There are quite a few shows that default to this style once or twice in order to stretch their budgets, like Samurai Seven and Welcome to the NHK. It’s ugly, but taken in small doses, it’s not the worst thing in the world.

Well, Okami-san is presented entirely in this style, from beginning to end, and it’s incredibly difficult to get used to. The backgrounds and landscapes are amazing, but in regards to the characters… It’s like K-ON, but a few drafts shy of the final draft. Yeah, I don’t know what I was smoking when I said the animation was top notch, because this is some of the cheapest, ugliest animation that I’ve ever seen. Most of the time, when the characters are talking, their appearance onscreen will consist of a tiny burst of movement followed by several seconds of still frame. The characters are designed to be proportionally normal and slightly angular, and yet theiir faces are completely moefied, making for character designs that honestly give me a headache to look at. To make matters worse, there are more frozen backgrounds here than in March of the Penguins, as characters who aren’t speaking just stand there, still as statues, errily refusing to even blink.

The dub isn’t terrible, but we are unfortunately dealing with a Jamie Marchi script, and like usual, I can tell it’s her within the first half of episode one. Have you ever had a weird aunt who tries to look cool by saying all the hip slangy stuff that she thinks your generation will be able to relate to, even though she just comes off as ironically charming at best? That’s Jamie Marchi. Thankfully, she shares duties with Chuck Huber, so it’s not as bad as it could have been.

Joel McDonald plays Ryoushi as earnestly as possible, doing a great job in making him likeable. Monica Rial seems to have a great understanding of her character, as she’s able to play every shade of her personality believably. Oddly enough, the one who falls flat is Brina Palencia, who would normally be one of my favorites. I’m going to chalk this up to bad casting, because she never really seems to own this particular character, and you can tell Marchi didn't give her the best dialogue.

The most depressing part of the dub is Luci Christian, whom I have come to consider the queen of voice acting. Whom I would sell a kidney to meet in person. She plays the part of the narrator, who’s job extends far past the intros and outros that you’d expect her to voice. No, she’s present through the entire show, talking our ear off the whole time. She dumps exposition on us, makes rude comments about the characters and their bodies, she drowns out the dialogue, and basically struggles to find some sort of a point for her own existence. Luci tries to make this character interesting, but even with her behind the wheel, I haven’t heard narration this pointless, cruel and infuriating since Pitch Perfect.

So, I didn’t want to go into the plot earlier, and for my reason? Well, the plot of this show is an extensive point of discussion all it’s own. This is the basic plot, in a nutshell… Ryoko is only pretending to be strong, but she’s actually scared and girly on the inside, and it’s Ryoushi’s job to warm her icy heart and turn her back to her normal girly self, so that he can be strong for her instead.

The term ‘sexist’ gets thrown around a lot, but when the plot of an anime boils directly down to ‘woman not really strong, let man be strong for you,’ that’s a pretty big red flag, particularly when it has to remind you over and over again that the main character isn’t actually strong. Yeah, I’m sorry, was she just duking it out in a street fight with several armed older men? Was she just putting on a brave face while a much larger group of them took her down and attempted to violate her? And she’s not strong because she’s afraid and only pretending to be strong? Because she likes puppies and girly novels? Do I even have to point out the layers of bullshit at play here?

Sorry, but fearless bravery isn’t real bravery, it’s just stupid recklessness. Being scared but doing the right thing anyway is true courage. The Olson Twins’ made for TV Halloween movie taught me that when I was a child, and this show still has a tough time understanding it.

Oh wait, there’s an explanation for it. She pretends to be tough because she got violated by somebody in middle school, but when she tried to report it, nobody believed her, and everybody started to hate her for lying. There’s a certain nuance to that… She’s scared and distrustful because she was violated and never vindicated for it, but she acts tough because she doesn’t want it to happen again. Her best friend wants to set her up with a good man so she can slowly undo the damage that was done to her. Makes sense, right?

Well, ignoring the troubling implications that this idea makes in regards to the creator’s opinions towards women, especially in regards to tomboys, I have to ask… Why am I supposed to want to see this change happen? What do I, as the viewer, get out of it?

Okay, for the sake of comparison, let’s talk about Batman for a moment. Yes, I know, they have nothing in common… Ryoko became a kick-ass vigilante because something traumatic happened to her in the past, while Bruce Wayne became a kick-ass vigilante because… Okay, maybe they’re not that different. Well, Batman’s backstory is so well known that every single incarnation of his story has explored it at some point… Except for Brave and the Bold during daytime hours, because we must censor to protect the children… and it ties in perfectly with the development that happens down the road.

Now, I’m not the first person to suggest this, but it would be very healthy for Bruce Wayne to just get over his parents’ death and give up the crime fighting. He could put aside his cape and cowl, and just live life as the wealthy philanthropist playboy he was born to be. find a good woman, start a family, and live the American dream.

So, if it would be in his best interest, why doesn’t it happen? Because if it did, nobody would care anymore. The fanbase would die off, and the only readers left would be the ones holding onto the hope that it’s just some sick dream created by The Mad Hatter.

Similarly, seeing Ryoko giving up on her quest for justice would take away what is, frankly, the only interesting thing about her. Without it, she’s just another generic Tsundere. And yet, her best friends… And some viewers as well… want to see this development happen. Apparently it’s okay for a grown man in a black suit to dedicate his life to being strong and kicking ass, but a teenaged high school girl? Work through that shit!

And here’s my biggest problem with this show. Bigger than my problem with the narrator, or with Marchi’s writing. Remember Ryoko’s best friend, Ringo? These two didn’t meet until a year after Ryoko’s assault. The person Ringo met is, through and through, the very damaged tomboy she’s trying to change. I’m sorry, but if you think that friendship is trying to change somebody into a better person that you think they can become, you’re not a very good friend.

Back in March, I wrote a review on my blog about a little anime called Oreimo, a title that is more or less the shortened version of ‘My Little Sister Can’t Possibly be this Cute.’ Guess what it’s about. But despite all of it’s shortcomings, I praised Oreimo for having a cast of characters that make the effort to try and understand and accept each other for who they are. At least, in the first season.

And now, you expect me to be entertained by some bullshit series where an awesome character’s best friend wants to hook her up with a man so she’ll be more ladylike? And you’re going to look me in the eye and tell me that Okami-san is popular, but Oreimo is despised by people? Are you fucking kidding me? Oreimo’s writing was great until the 2013 revival, but Okamisan’s writing was bad right out of the gate!

For the first six episodes or so, I didn’t mind this show. The chauvinism goes pretty deep, but it was kind of funny a few times, it was mostly harmless, and the annoying narrator was at least making one or two good jokes.

It was at about the halfway point that the low quality of the writing really started to overpower what little good there may have been. It tries to do both comedy and drama, but it never succeeds in creating a balance between the two. It can actually be pretty damn jarring at times. To summarize, Okami-san tries to go to some really serious places while struggling to take itself seriously. They even manage to work ecchi undertones into a CPR scene, for Christ’s sake! After seeing what Ouran High School Host Club was capable of, no anime should ever have an excuse to blend comedy and drama this poorly!

There are too many characters, and the ones that we get to spend time with normally only get a single episode dedicated to them before they fade back into the background. The narrator wears out her welcome fast, and doesn’t tell nearly enough funny jokes to justify her presence.

And if that’s not bad enough, this show actually seems to be terrified of itself. We never see the Otogi Bank actually pursuing a debt, because it’s terrified of making the characters look unlikeable. The constant fairy tale references never really amount to anything, because it’s terrified of not being taken seriously. We never find out exactly what happened to Ryoko in middle school, because it’s terrified of upsetting the audience. We never see Ryoushi asking her out on an actual date, because it’s terrified of exploring how such an exaggerated character would react to normal social interactions. The narrator won’t shut the hell up, because it’s scared that the writing won’t hold up on it’s own.

The writing in general, is really, really bad. It constantly alternates between being insultingly stupid and just plain boring. The amnesia storyline alone is an episode painful enough to skip. The episode where a butler tries to find a bride for his ward is even worse, as he uses it as an excuse to make shallow, despicable remarks about the entire female cast before revealing that he didn’t need to be there in the first place. At no point do the characters ever act like real people.

And the ending… You know what? Throw up a spoiler tag, because I really fucking need to address this. !At the end of the series, a rival school… The respective hell to their heaven… kidnaps several main characters, and just to make things more personal, Ryoko is kidnapped and held hostage by the very man who allegedly did something violation-y to her. I won’t tell you how this is resolved, but I’ll sure as hell tell you how it isn’t resolved. Despite the clear cases of assault and abduction… and others, I’m sure… Nobody calls the cops. Who definitely exist in this universe. Would it be anticlimactic, like the end of Monty Python and the holy Grail? No, because Ryoko is being held captive by the very man who got away cleanly with something vague to her. Yeah, it doesn’t take Dick Tracey to look at this scenario and start wondering if she’d been telling the truth back then.!

For the non-spoiler version… The main villain, who is introduced with a promising bang, ultimately fades out with an anticlimactic whimper, promising revenge for a sequel series that will hopefully never come. Hell, that’s pretty much how the series ends as a whole… Nothing is resolved, and early implications about the village being part of a social experiment filled with fairy tale references amounts to absolutely nothing. I know it’s easy to say that someone couldn’t write their way out of a paper bag, but it really does seem like somebody deliberately was trying to do just that… And failing miserably at it.

Strictly speaking, Okami-san isn’t the worst anime I’ve ever seen. It’s not even on my bottom ten. But you know what? I still hate it. I don’t even hate the anime I once gave 0/10, but I hate this anime. And trust me, there’s a very, very small list of anime that I flat-out hate. It’s bad enough that it’s stupid, full of shit, and blatantly sexist, but the way it approaches the subject of rape just tips the scales entirely against it.

I haven’t seen every anime, so I could be wrong about this, but outside of hentai, rape is a subject that doesn’t exist in the medium. It can be joked about, or threatened, but it doesn’t actually happen, and it doesn’t get dealt with. This is one of the reasons that Now and Then, Here and There is such a rare gem… Any anime that introduces a plot point about one of it’s characters being raped, and actually explores the repercussions and recovery of the attack, can easily be considered a ground breaking series. What frustrates me the most about Okami-san is that by introducing the rape implications in a lazy attempt to explain Ryoko’s character, they actually come really close to pulling this off… Only to pussy out at every turn. They vaguely introduce the subject when needed, then drop it cold and try to make us forget about it until the next time it’s needed. I know it isn’t fair of me to whole-heartedly condemn this series because of what I wanted it to be, rather than what it was, but what it was was no peach, okay?

Okami-san and her Seven Companions was dubbed by Funimation, and can be viewed for free on Netflix. You can also find a lot of other anime on Netflix that don’t suck, so don’t even bother with this festering field full of fairy tale feces. It isn’t well written, it isn’t well produced… It just isn’t well. I gave it a four out of ten the first time I watched it, but now that I’ve watched it twice, I think it’s much more appropriate to give this series a 2/10."
106918,"Lord El-Melloi II is a mystery series that breaks from the conventions of the genre. Specifically, the convention of using the question of “Howdunit” to determine “Whodunit”. When urban fantasy normally sets into this territory, you see writers structure out their magic system to fit within this magical structure. Lord El-Melloi II, on the other hand, tosses convention out on its head and decides to play Calvinball instead.

In the Nasu-verse, there’s a tendency for rules to be made to be broken. Lancer’s Gae Bolg is a sure kill except for when it isn’t. Like in Calvinball, rules changes are rolled out however and whenever necessary, never really contradicting each over, but always coming out when narratively convenient. Consequently, when magic is brought out in the context of a murder mystery, it’s not particularly predictable. Instead, as a viewer, our insights are more related to character motivations than to anything else. Hence, the question becomes not “howdunit”, but rather “whydunit”.

This doesn’t mean the show doesn’t cheat – it cheats like a motherfucker. The Calvinball magic system rules allow them to spring new wrinkles in a case whenever it seems dramatically appropriate, and a significant character pops out of the aether during the show’s climax with nothing to previously establish their existence.

The show follows Waver Velvet, who is now a teacher at The Clock Tower, the academy for magi in the Nasuverse, and is following in the footsteps of his teacher – Keyneth El-Melloi, whose catalyst Waver stole in order to take part in the Holy Grail War in Fate/Zero, and in turn allowing him to summon Iskandar.

Now as an adult, Waver has been changed by his experiences, both with the death of his mentor (douchebag though he was), and now Waver has set himself the goal to rebuild his former master’s class, while also trying to change a mage society that provides opportunities for mages of lesser bloodlines. This leaves Waver with something of a class full of misfits, including some we’ve met in alternative universe works, like Caules from Fate/Apocrypha.

Further, because Waver is socially something of an outsider – he’s been adopted into the El-Melloi family but does not personally possess that family’s clout – this gives him that outsider advantage. He’s a person that people can call on to help resolve situations where things get messy, both magically, politically, and in the case of the mysteries in this show, physically. This is also reflected with his character – he refuses to be identified as Lord El-Melloi, instead insisting on being referred to as Lord El-Melloi II.

The show also starts partway through Waver’s career as a teacher and as an investigator. He’s got a supporting cast around him already, who have their general roles that they play in solving mysteries. Probably the most significant one of these is Grey, Waver’s Watson figure – and also a literal Saberface – for reasons that are somewhat expanded on in the show.

This makes this show something of an interesting mess. The characters are interestingly written, and fans of the franchise – especially Fate/Apocrypha – will enjoy the guest appearances. However, those looking for a satisfying mystery will likely be sorely disappointed."

TYPE-MOON has made quite a lot of polarizing titles regardless of time. But nothing is ever as polarizing as Kara no Kyoukai’s 6th chapter. Now, I’m just going to say this right off the bat Kara no Kyoukai as a whole is one of those anime series I’ve been admittedly defensive towards. While it is hard to get into, the writing and direction still shouldn’t be underestimated. The series doesn’t try to take itself seriously while still becoming one of the deepest and most impactful series ever. But if there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that this chapter is the weakest of them all. It doesn’t hold the same impact as all the other installations do. But… does it actually deserve the slander it gets? Well, enough of this introduction and let’s begin yapping.


img()

This series starts with a new incident appearing after the death of Araya Souren. Kokutou Azaka is now the main focus here. While she was technically a main character in almost every other chapter, she wasn’t necessarily as focused as the others until we got to Ch.6. Azaka studies in an apprentice academy alongside Shiki where she can perform her magic. While they’re at it, though, they’re also on an investigation. Another strange mystery lures in and is trying to lure the main characters into a bad situation. These consist of fairies and they’re not the ones you would normally think of. Perhaps this has to have a connection with the previous magus dealt before. Right off the gate, this is a far more important addition to the series than what others may realize. Sure, this type of story may look off at first but it adds to what makes Kara no Kyoukai in general special in the first place. Each installation has an entirely unique plot line to itself and all of them are special thanks to how they connect their major gimmicks to the central storyboarding of the series.

img()

So again, what is actually something good about this? Chapter 6 serves as a nice bridge between chapters 5 and 7. Since 5 is the story’s climax and 7 is Shiki’s climax, chapter 6 is a nice buildup to the series’ finale. This trilogy had two main priorities and one of them was exploring the dark magic lurking around in the series. Chapter 5 concludes that part since the magus league was the central antagonist that further spread the puzzles since Mahoyo (‘ahem’ chronologically speaking). The other is Shiki and her personal relationship with both the overall atmosphere and her challenges. While this chapter technically doesn’t have much of that, it still provides a nice continuation of how Shiki has an impactful relationship with the chapter-specific key characters, and that brings us to this chapter’s main focus, Azaka. As much as I love Kara no Kyoukai’s character writing, Azaka was pretty bland and was more of a plot device overall, so it’s nice to see her getting the spotlight she deserves after being easily replaceable by any of the major characters involved.

img()

Azaka serves as a unique replica of what Mikiya normally does throughout the series’ narrative which makes sense since both of them are siblings. Azaka’s motivation here alongside Shiki is to find out the culprit behind the school they’re studying in and regain their memories that are stolen. Again, this is quite relevant to the central plot when you consider that Shiki can be clueless sometimes. But sadly, like all of you, it’s time I complain about this chapter. For starters, the exposition could be better. This chapter spent a bit too much time on buildup proportional to this chapter’s length so there’s barely any tension involved. That’s not to say long buildups are bad, I do in fact like them. Buildups in every other chapter in this series are also long but those also get straight to something like drama or action to spruce their stories up. This one felt a bit too much of a slice of life than what it intended to be.

img()

Another problem is that the mystery elements aren’t particularly great. On the surface, the fairies are actually well-made. As mentioned, they play a very important role in the series and they’re connected quite well. One neat detail for example is how Shiki also wants to regain her memories because she mentions herself in chapter 5 that she was a murderer when that’s not really the case for her anymore now that chapter 4 concludes that. But again, compared to every other chapter, they aren’t necessarily used as much. They’re potentially portrayed as gimmicks when this chapter has other things that aren’t really as important. Yeah, they’re important and interesting, but what else is there to these things? They’re mostly (or virtually) used in the later portions where we see Azaka’s final climax which is nice but they could have been applied in other portions as well. Still, though, they’re nice to have in the entire series. They could be complimented more if they’re used more.


img()

Now for characters which might probably be the weakest aspect. First things first, we have Shiki the protagonist and the stoic girl who studies death, and Azaka the sister of Mikiya who is the main detective. Let’s cut to the chase. This movie is absolutely carried by Shiki. To be fair, she has been stealing the spotlight in every single installation, albeit for good reasons, but every other chapter still has a lot of compelling characters to themselves whereas chapter 6 only has one. Now, this is definitely the weakest rendition of Shiki’s character development but she’s still pretty great. She has most of the charm in her other appearances and such. As for this chapter’s focused character, Azaka… yeah, we have a lot of talk about here. Azaka being the main character here is a good thing because she gets more important aspects she should have gotten ages ago and we get to see more interactions with Shiki and for the most part, those interactions are pretty good.

img()

However, that’s also a problem. She’s still the same annoying tsundere she was in all of her other appearances so unless you’re able to stomach her annoying moments, good luck with that. On top of that, though, her relationship with Mikiya is quite off. That’s not to say that siblings loving each other is bad but this relationship is rendered as romantic which is out of place. Add on that she’s still the weakest main character in the whole series and I think she falls short. Still, though, she’s an alright character regardless. I see her as Kara no Kyoukai’s replica of Tsukihime’s Tohno Akiha, both being passable main characters but annoying and not much to offer. Kurogiri Satsuki, the chapter’s focused villain, sucks, though. It’s nice to see another twist villain around but compared to someone like Araya Souren, he’s absolutely irrelevant. Oh, and Ouji Misaya is there, I guess.


img()

Before we end here, the animation like every other chapter is amazing. The movements still remain to be very consistent and over-the-top. The action still looks clean as ever, even if the fight itself isn’t necessarily one of my favorites. The music is outstanding. In fact, it’s probably my favorite OST in this series alongside chapters 1 and 7. The voice acting, while not as good as the others, still has their charms nailed very well. Not a big fan of Fujimura Ayumi as Azaka but she’s decent nonetheless.


img()

So while I do unironically like this chapter, I can fully understand why it’s poorly received even amongst fans of this series. It really has a lot of interesting ideas going for but they aren’t used as properly as they should have been, the exposition is quite off, and the key character of this chapter could have picked up much more development. It’s mostly seen as a stepping stone to chapter 7. But honestly, I was expecting worse. Yes, what they offered is problematic but I won’t lie to you all, I think this was more amusing than frustrating. Now, it’s still Kara no Kyoukai’s worst chapter but it’s not really one of TYPE-MOON’s worst. Compared to the real failures like DEEN/Stay Night or Fate/Apocrypha, the plot still remains pretty consistent and there’s still a handful of character development to be found. So while it could be a lot better with just a few tweaks, it’s still above average."

My experiences with life are quite limited when compared to the majority of the human race. I haven’t lived long enough to claim otherwise. This does not invalidate what I do know and have experienced; it just means that there is far too much that I’ve yet to understand. There’s always progress to be made in life, regardless of how successful one may be. Despite the areas in which I may lack, I do not think it would be improper of me to state that life is a gamble. 

(review contains mild spoilers; it's adapted from my [blog](https://mildmelancholia.com/2021/05/06/the-philosophy-of-tokuchi-toua/))




When I turned 18, my mom took me to the casino. She gave me twenty dollars to wager and mess around with. Anyone that’s been to a casino knows that this amount of money isn’t really enough to work with. My mother and I didn’t spend much time there before we went back home. It’s been a few years since then, so my memory is a bit spotty. What I do remember though is that I came out of there with close to 2-3 times as much money as I did when walking in. This was my first taste of literal “gambling.”

I’ve heard numerous people say, “You always win your first time.” This is often used in reference to how people get hooked on casinos–and perhaps gambling in general. Now, not everyone actually wins on their first time out carousing but some inevitably do. For those [un]lucky few, it can become either a blessing or a curse. After all, if you don’t win on your first try, there is no reason for you to get hooked on it.

As for myself, I never really got hooked on casinos or gambling. Throughout the years since my first win, I have probably been to the casino 5-10 times. As best as I can recall, I have always come out with less than what I went in with. The feeling that accompanies losing x amount of money is one of the more emasculating sensations I’ve ever experienced.

VERY recently, I was having consistent delusions of grandeur. Perpetual daydreams of amassing a fortune out of nowhere wasn’t just a part of my daily routine; it was my daily routine. Not really sure where these daydreams were coming from. I guess I could call it a quarter-life crisis. When it comes to my personal circumstances, I probably have it better than most people. Regardless, I can’t help but find myself wishing that life weren’t so tedious. Constantly looking for an easy way out of life’s problems.


As a result of this way of thinking, I decided to invest a large portion of my money in some meme stonks. In addition, I also decided that I was going to hit it big at the casino. I’m not going to elaborate on my stock portfolio, but I will talk a bit about my time at the casino.

Long story short, I lost $600 over the course of three nights. Each night I went in with $200. What’s crazy about it is that I got down to my last 19 dollars on the third night, yet I came back with a run where happened to almost make up for all of my losses throughout the week. I walked out of the casino and got in my pickup roughly 28 dollars down. Mind you, I was only 28 dollars out, considering what I had already lost up until that point. I don’t know what got into me, but the dissatisfaction I felt in those moments was far worse than when I had walked out the two previous nights with nothing.

As I sat behind my steering wheel, holding that cash in my hand, I thought to myself, I didn’t come here to almost break even. Not gonna lie, it sounds pretty cringe, but that’s what went through my mind at the time. Call it what you will, but this did happen merely weeks ago. I’m literally not even joking when I say that I saw the face of Tokuchi Toua in those moments. Something that he says relatively often rang in my ears that night.

>A low possibility means it’s not zero.



My attempts to capture the nature of this story will always be left lacking, regardless of what I say. I have nothing but praise for it. It is classic MADHOUSE. I can’t really provide much insight when it comes to the anime’s nature as an adaptation, but I will say that it is good in and of itself. As far as I can tell, One Outs seems to be overlooked fairly often by many people. I can only assume that this has something to do with its association with baseball.

I am particularly fond of the game of baseball. Having spent the greater portion of my life in and around the game (playing it, watching it, etc.), I feel like it’s only natural that I would retain some affection for the sport. This may not be the case for everyone similar to myself, but that’s how it is for me. There is a trend that I have noticed throughout the years with those that are removed from the sport–people that may be considered “outsiders” of the game. They always seem to hold fast to the conviction that baseball is boring.


I’m not going to attempt to illustrate the issues with this claim. There is way too much that I would have to take into consideration, in order for me to accomplish that. Even then, it’d be pointless. As human beings, autonomous individuals, we all have different tastes. It’s not rational to expect everyone to equally enjoy the things that we enjoy ourselves. With that being said though, it’s a good rule of thumb for people to go be willing to push the limit of their comfort zones and go beyond what they’re typically o.k. with.

Don’t take the previous sentence the wrong way. All I am trying to put out there is that trying something different may surprise us. We shouldn’t discredit stories based off of the fact that it contains, or even revolves around, something we tend to find uninteresting. In the case of One Outs, I’m referring to baseball and even sports in general. I’m certain that many have missed out on what this work has to offer simply because they overlooked it due to something as petty as that.




When the first episode of One Outs opens up, the audience is introduced to the man known as Hirochi Kojima. At the time of his introduction, Kojima is nearing the end of his legendary major league baseball (i.e. Nippon Professional Baseball) career. Throughout his twenty year career, Kojima has consistently been known as one of the best players in the game. Winning MVPs and batting was no rare occasion for him.

Despite Kojima’s accolades, he has never won a championship. I’m tempted to compare Kojima to Albert Pujols if Albert Pujols never won a World Series title. He’s played for the Lycaons for his entire career, yet they have never had all the cogs in the machine working properly. The team has a history of finishing at the bottom of the league standings.



Prior to the beginning of what may turn out to be his final season, Kojima and a few teammates go on a training camp prior to the beginning of the baseball season. When their pitcher injures his finger and can no longer pitch to Kojima, a couple of his buddies from the traveling entourage begin to search for a new pitcher.

What follows this misfortune is nothing this training camp disaster is nothing short of fortuitous. Call it fate, luck, or whatever you want to really. When Kojima and company stumble upon the “One Outs” game by chance, they find a solution to a problem they didn’t even know they had.

One Outs is a game, a microcosmic form of baseball, where a pitcher and batter duel 1-on-1 with money on the line. It functions as a stasis for gambling. One Outs is a source of entertainment where many people from different walks of life gather at a run-down ball field to observe and wager their money to see the best man win.

There are various ways for the batter to win a game of One Outs. The most blatant form of a win for the batter is by putting the ball in play into fair territory. As long as the ball rolls beyond the pitcher’s mound, the batter remains victorious. In addition, the batter can also win if the pitcher walks or hits him with a pitch.

Things aren’t as easy for the pitcher. There is really only one way for him to win: he must strike the batter out. If a batter does not swing and miss for a strike, the ball must land somewhere in the painted strike zone that is found on the backstop. Under these circumstances, I feel like it is safe to say that the batter has a decent advantage over the pitcher who must throw the ball.

Tokuchi Toua makes his first appearance within the first five minutes of episode one. It is during these opening moments where it is revealed that, as a pitcher, Tokuchi has a One Outs win-loss record of 499-0. He’s never been beaten. Time and time again, he has taken part in the gamble and never once lost…to anyone. As the rest of the episode (and season) plays out, Tokuchi’s nature as both a pitcher and gambler become known to the audience. There is something special about this guy, who seems to be in full control of the game, despite him being barely twenty years old. 




The essence of Tokuchi Toua cannot be summed up with the a brief character description. I’d be more than tempted to state that his character is enigmatic; the nature of Toua is rather difficult to discern. With this being the case, it’s only natural that a few sentences are unable to paint a full picture of the young man that is Tokuchi Toua. Quite honestly, the complexity of his character lies in a number of different factors.

It’s not my intention to capture all of the different aspects of Toua’s personality. I don’t really have the desire to attempt such a feat. This would be neither practical nor wise–as I have yet to finish the manga at this point in time. My own perspective derives from how Toua is portrayed in the anime alone. Considering the fact that the manga hasn’t been adapted to the screen in its entirety, it’d be rather insincere for me to analyze his full character.

img(

Instead of taking a broader look at Tokuchi Toua and his character, I’d rather focus on the examination of his words. Tokuchi’s words are hauntingly quotable; I’d be lying if I claimed otherwise. For anyone that has read or watched One Outs, what I’m saying may or may not make sense. The aforementioned protagonist’s external conduct can be difficult to discern. Judging merely by the way he carries himself, it’d be near impossible to make his intentions known. What I’m trying to say is…Tokuchi Toua is an authentic, genuine character. One may be tempted to believe that he doesn’t really care for much–if anything at all. I’d have to argue that this sentiment couldn’t be further from the truth.



The ability to take risks and accept consequences, regardless of the outcome, is something that carries on into various avenues of life. It’s difficult to measure how wide the chasm that separates those who aren’t able to take risks from those who are. Taking risks is a fundamental component of living life the way it is meant to be lived.

Life is undoubtedly scary, even terrifying at times. Due to fear of the unknown, people tend to deploy themselves head first into comfort. Everyone finds comfort in different things; this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s merely a part of being human. Though, if a person’s desire for comfort turns to excess, it can and will become the ruin of them.

Taking risks, in the eyes of Tokuchi Toua, means letting go of what could go wrong. Holding fast to the possibilities of victory allows oneself to break through the barriers of negative thoughts. Just because there’s a slim chance of success or of winning, it doesn’t negate the possibilities of legitimate victory. Now, this isn’t to say one should sell their possessions and go buy scores of lottery tickets while using Tokuchi’s quotes as justification. Essentially, remain balanced but be willing to step outside the comfort zone and push boundaries.




Another integral part of Tokuchi’s mindset is his unwavering desire to win. He’s a token example of how much our resolve can extend us beyond limits that are otherwise inexplicable. With enough willpower, overcoming anyone and anything that stands in the way of victory is not out of the question.

The competitive nature of Tokuchi’s is best demonstrated in the way he maxes out his own abilities. He gathers all of his eggs into the basket, using them in the most fitting and efficient way possible. Strictly speaking, Tokuchi does not have a strong arsenal as a pitcher. He can’t overwhelm people with his fastball velocity; he doesn’t really have any secondary pitches. What he can do though is place his fastball on a dime. His ability to locate his fastball is next to none; this can be viewed as one’s ultimate exertion of the will.

Tokuchi illustrates that the path to developing such a resolve is not a pretty one. On the contrary, it’s brutal. He compares the process to “trampling over corpses.” If we are to “steel [ourselves],” as Tokuchi puts it, we must be willing to let go of how others perceive us. Caring what others think is of no use. Desiring victory, in whatever form it may be, requires us to be prepared for battle. We must gird our loins.




I know it’s an old chestnut, but it remains relevant. If you want anything done right, do it yourself. Tokuchi Toua would concur and agree with this. Throughout One Outs, he continually preaches and demonstrates the necessity for self-reliance.

When it comes to life, shit happens. Honestly, it just does. This becomes obvious to most people by the time they reach adulthood. Regardless of one’s place in the world, there will always be obstacles thrown in the way that cannot be anticipated. Life throws us curveballs. In these situations, it’s tempting to cast blame on others or try to find someone else to point the finger at. It is in times like these where we need to avoid that impulse, and take a good look in the mirror.

Confidence and humility are not mutually exclusive. I’ve always been under the impression that the two of these attributes are incompatible. At the very least, I feel like having too much confidence will extinguish the humility an individual possesses–and vice versa. Tokuchi challenged this presupposition of mine. He embodies an outside perspective for this dilemma that’s rather uncommon. It’s ok to be confident, not merely for its own sake, but because we don’t really have a choice.

>If you don’t do something yourself, nothing will ever happen. But if you work…If you do something…Something will definitely change.




This reveals the more sentimental side of Tokuchi’s personality. I would never say that he is sensitive, but the moments where he calls attention to the issue of responsibility are probably the closest he gets to letting his guard down.

Despite his youth, when Tokuchi voices his opinion about “responsibility,” one cannot help but be convinced that he is speaking from personal experience. There are two separate instances that come to mind where he specifically touches upon the nature of responsibility:

If you ruined someone’s silver tableware, you must repay with gold tableware. The president of a polluting manufacturing plant must live beside the plant’s chimney. That’s what taking responsibility means. However the people in so-called high positions never see the consequences. When mistakes are made, they will casually bow their heads and apologize. They think that’s enough. Are you one of them too?”

>To take responsibility is to take the pain onto yourself. It means to bear more pain than what others felt because of your mistake.”

This ties into self-reliance, but it remains distinct. It’d be more fitting to say that the nature of taking responsibility–specifically in the eyes of Tokuchi Toua–is the offspring that stems from dependable self-reliance. One who is truly self-reliant (i.e. humbly confident and/or confidently humble) will be capable of empathizing with their peers. This helps tie everything else in, and vice-versa.




All that I have written here is by no means a complete exposé on Tokuchi Toua as a character nor of One Outs as a series. That would be a tad bizarre for me to claim that. My intention with writing this piece is to paint a picture of an intriguing character that I am particularly fond of. If I wanted to make this a more complete work, I’d have to finish reading the original source material. Reading the manga is something I plan on getting back around to and doing as soon as possible.

At any rate, there are definitely edifying words that emerge from the lips of Tokuchi Toua. Although I wouldn’t say that he is someone to imitate completely, I do think he has a solid grasp on the human condition. There is a lot one can learn from what he has to say. His ability to assess situations and bolt himself into action is next to none. Based off of what he himself says, all of us are capable of going beyond our self-imposed limits. He is an encouragement for viewers, in the sense that he calls attention to the necessity of self-realization and proves overcoming fear is within our reach.

I’ll refer to the four points I mentioned earlier (taking risks, the will to win, relying on oneself, and taking responsibility) as “Tokuchi Toua’s Pillars of Human Development.” Kinda cringe, I guess, but it flows nicely. I feel like these pillars / principles are applicable to each and every one of our lives, regardless of who we are or where we come from. If we dare to take these virtues to heart, we will slowly begin to recognize the changes in ourselves–both internally and externally.

At any rate, if anything I’ve said about this subject interests you, I’d highly recommend checking out the anime and the manga as well. One Outs very well deserves the acclaim that it has received, if not more. Not only is it one of the most compelling, entertaining baseball stories I’ve encountered; it’s compelling and entertaining in its own right. What I mean to say is that it is not just “good for a baseball and sports anime.” Nah, man. It’s just good. Period."

As soon as the credits rolled, half the audience stood up and left the venue in confusion. Among the reactions, some said they understood nothing of Miyazaki's vision; some parents were uncomfortable with some of the scenes their children had seen; others said they had almost fallen asleep in the middle of the film. Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka has the virtue of being a clear counterpoint to Miyazaki's previous productions. Like Kaze tachinu, it feels like a conclusion, but the approach is markedly different, deeply personal and riddled with remorse, something that permeates every frame.

Rejecting the surgically constructed sentimentality that might have been his style, Miyazaki offers a more hermetic narrative. A number of critics have pointed out that the film could easily be divided into two very different parts, the first showing Mahito's inner dilemma before the plot turns into a fairy tale in the second half. It seems to me that such a division completely misses the intertextuality that Miyazaki's team has carefully constructed. From the very first minutes, the film encapsulates Miyazaki's career, building an aesthetic bridge between his early work and Kaze tachinu: the realistic sobriety of the drawings in the introduction contrasts with the cartoonish design of the tanks. These are reminiscent of Miyazaki's old designs found in Zassō nōto and Doromamire no tora. Mahito's initial muteness, petrified by his grief, allows the film to progress through his image.



Natsuko's mansion is a fantastic layering of corridors, gardens and living rooms, creating an imaginary geography. Unlike previous productions, where it is easy to picture the world in which the characters exist, Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka is deliberately confusing. The architecture shifts constantly, from a luxurious main entrance to more intimate passageways, from dusty chambers to Western-style furnished rooms. This eclecticism feeds Mahito's hallucinations, whose fever distorts his vision of reality. His nightmares mingle with the idyllic setting of the mansion: this is where the film reveals its intention. In one dream scene, Mahito goes out to hunt the grey heron, but is soon paralysed as legions of fish and frogs surround his body, threatening to suffocate him. At the last moment, a bow-armed Natsuko, flanked by her army of grandmothers, arrives to scare off the animals and save Mahito, who falls unconscious.

This scene serves both to cement the film's transition to magical realism, which lasts until the end, and to play with the imagery of Mononoke hime: the animals mimic the eerie strangeness of nature, while Natsuko takes on the features of Lady Eboshi. In fact, Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka is full of references: the buildings have an intricate architecture reminiscent of The Castle of Cagliostro, Lady Himi's world resembles that of Arrietty, while the domestic scenes use the same grammar as those in Howl's Moving Castle. However, there are noticeable differences. The setting is infused with western influences and lighting design reminiscent of 1980s anime production. The tall pines that rise into the sky as Mahito arrives in the world below contrast with the stillness of the sea. On the horizon is a fleet of different boats, modern regattas rubbing shoulders with older vessels. Clouds dominate the sky, great masses of grey and gold, bathed in the light of an invisible sun. This atmosphere, a fallen and mythologised world, is reminiscent of the American romanticism found in the work of Clark Ashton Smith. The great-uncle's antechamber is very reminiscent of Moebius' work, with very geometric lines and layouts: it is no coincidence that the world below is held together by stackable geometric blocks. In a way, Miyazaki and his team are clarifying the spirit that has run through all their films for decades.



The entire iconography of the magical world of Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka borrows from Moebius's Celestial Venice, while also drawing on the Moebius-inspired aesthetics of Kaze no tani no Nausicaä and Tenkū no shiro. From this perspective, the film is never divided into two distinct parts: it is a single meditation on an entire cultural production. Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka is like a long hallucination or an improvised story – for Miyazaki's grandson – using imaginary material as a convenient framework to tell Mahito's story, just as Koperu in the novel of the same name uses his diary to explore his place in the world and how he can live in it. To a degree, Miyazaki takes on the role of both the great-uncle and Mahito, answering to himself and acknowledging his heritage while letting it soar.

Although the plot presented in the first few minutes may lead the viewer to believe that the film will focus on the relationship between Mahito and Natsuko, and the pain he may feel at seeing his father quickly moving closer to his sister-in-law who is taking on maternal responsibilities, this is not the case. Nor is the issue of war and nationalism explicitly addressed. In fact, while Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka avoids the familiar devices of Japanese dramatic cinema, it does present some elements of an answer, through Mahito's journey into the world below. The relationship between Mahito and Natsuko is initially cold, despite his determination to save her. They meet again when Mahito enters the labour chamber, breaking a prohibition and inviting the kegare into a sacred space. Natsuko's isolation and the many charms decorating the room evoke the traditional cultural habits of satogaeri shussan, imposing a shintō and Buddhist matrix on the film. This scene, which exorcises the mourning of the mother, also serves to reintroduce death and corruption into the film's discourse.



Some time later, Mahito points out that the great-uncle's blocks are not made of wood, but of tombstone, and are therefore surrounded by kegare. This revelation prompts the great-uncle to seek out the pure ones, so that Mahito can continue his work without being haunted by the spectre of corruption. With this interpretive key, we can associate the world below and the wakawaka cycle as using the memories of the dead to perpetuate the living and give the world above a reason to live. More specifically, Miyazaki may be addressing the way in which the heroism of imperial soldiers leads to senseless nationalism and cultural sterility, thus confessing his own tragedy – being the son of an industrial bourgeois and growing up with war as a cultural imaginary. How can he who likes to draw machines of death, and identifies himself with the great-uncle, look Mahito in the eye?

Miyazaki's deconstruction of mythology is also expressed in the portrayal of Lady Himi. Her design is typical of Miyazaki's young heroines, and has been since Clarisse in The Castle of Cagliostro. As much as Miyazaki can be credited with having strong female characters in his stories, her appearance and behaviour reflect a different idea of yamato nadeshiko and may have fuelled the paedophile fantasies of several generations of viewers. Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka appears as a kind of atonement for this mistake: Lady Himi behaves like the classic heroine of a Miyazaki film, but she cannot join Mahito in the world above. Or rather, she is merely an invention of his mind and must return to her true form – the protagonist's real mother – to die in the flames of the fire, shattering the fantasy of Miyazaki's typical young girl. Instead, the film highlights other female characters whose gender expression may be at odds with the director's habits. Kiriko takes on an androgynous appearance in the world below, while Natsuko's eyes in the delivery room blaze with an anger not expected in a Ghibli film, something that the animation and colour palette help to underline as Miyazaki's touch fades into the other graphic styles. Similarly, the soundtrack is more discreet and understated, less iconic, as if Hisaishi is also disappearing with Miyazaki.



Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka is perhaps an expression of guilt and frustration at being presented as the progressive voice of Japan, when Miyazaki is only one – necessarily imperfect – expression of it.The film always seems to resist a singular interpretation, forcing an intersection of viewpoints, references and influences. The destruction of the magic stone – which, incidentally, fell to earth during the Meiji Restoration – is a way of shattering the fantasised coherence of Miyazaki's monolithic filmography. In a slightly cruel turn, Miyazaki seems to delight in drawing parallels between the audience and the parakeets that devour the characters without understanding their complexity. The birds consume what is offered to them, perhaps out of necessity, as in the case of the pelicans, but often without thinking, simply following their leaders. They are content to gobble, justifying their actions by the force of circumstances or the transgression of prohibitions. Could this be a foreshadowing of the public's scepticism towards Kimitachi wa dō ikiru ka, which only wants a conventional film that fits in the rest of Miyazaki's repertoire?

It seems to me, then, that the film is a sententious statement about how his films should be received: the interpretation is left to the viewer, who has to draw out for himself what is virtuous and good in the film and its universe. Miyazaki's work is above all a collective dialogue, choral and moving. It is permeated by uncertainty, regret and dreams. For decades, certain characters and scenes have become protective charms and role models. All this is good in moderation. In the twilight of his life, Miyazaki suggests thinking about a future in which he will no longer be there, swept away by life and his own work. This is not a tragedy, but an open door to another world, where other artists create their own universes. It is no coincidence that the film ends abruptly with the mention of a return to Tokyo. Natsuko is dressed in Western clothes, and the credits scroll over a blue background. The future is coming. So, how do you live?"
20520,"Love stage use rape scene, sexual assault, and manipulations for its plot 
The love stage starts quite interesting. We have a gender intrigue here, where the main character thinks he has fallen in love with a girl who is actually a boy.  Sounds interesting enough?img220() But the show will show you that such a seemingly ridiculous idea for a romantic comedy can be spoiled. When Ryoma learns that Izumi is a boy, he decides to rape him. Yes Yes. He's already getting started but gets hit by Izumi's brother's friend.img220()
 After this incident, Ryoma locks up in a room and cries for several days. Then comes to his brother who knows Izumi has been attacked and almost raped. Only the brother says he has nothing to worry about, starts to blame him for not leaving the room, and it's actually normal for a guy to get horny when they lick his nipples. Brother doesn't mind the rape of Izumi. Better to blame the victim. Then Ryoma stalks Izumi, then apologizes to him. And they start dating. Dating your rapist according to the show is very romantic. And it's okay after that, but one day Izumi sleeps over with Ryoma and Ryoma, and while he is asleep, he starts kissing Izumi many times. The second scene is a complete failure. In the next episode, Izumi tells Ryoma that he can do whatever I want with him. Izumi is exhausted by this idiot apparently and his mental state is terrible. Ryoma kisses him and Izumi lies down, cries, and doesn't move. Ryoma gets pissed off and blames Izumi for taking advantage of his feelings. img220()
Another victim-blaming scene. Then we have the typical crumbs of life again, and practically nothing interesting happens except that Izumi understands that he loves Ryoma, so he runs to his house and on the way, a group of people attack him and try to rape him. Jesus Christ, why is everyone attacking Izumi in this show? It's disgusting. It doesn't come to that and Izumi says that he wants sex with Ryoma. Ryoma is happy and says he won't stop having sex if Izumi changes her mind. And towards the end, Izumi says that he has changed his mind after all and he doesn't want to and he changes his mind, but Ryoma manipulates him and says that he is cute and he wants to know more about him. It's disgusting. From this show you can understand that:
It's normal for a family to forgive the rape of a family member.
It's normal to stalk someone
It is normal to tell a sexual assault victim that they are exaggerating and do not worry
It is normal to manipulate someone 
It's normal to blame someone for your problems and actions

It's not a show is a documentary about the Stockholm syndrome."
100645,"A arte imitando a vida, literalmente

Descobri a existência de ""Akkun To Kanojo"" de forma abrupta e aleatória: Youtube. Logo de início, me interessei pelo senso de humor e fofura dos personagens e do cenário. Fui procurar para vê-lo de forma completa, e não parcial como estava no Youtube. Conforme assistia, uma sensação de familiaridade me invadia sobre o enredo. Quando finalizei o anime, minha mente trouxe à tona do porquê desta sensação: minha vida.
O centro da história é o relacionamento entre Akkun e Nontan. Este anime é absurdamente fofo e engraçado, mas que ainda assim traz aspectos reais sobre o amor, onde os quais vão muito além da esfera cômica e animesca.
Akkun Kagari é um jovem que namora com outra jovem chamada Nontan Katagiri. Sua personalidade é marcada por comportamentos egocêntricos, e de sua namorada, por amorosos e submissos. o humor se dá pelo fato de Akkun não demonstrar seus sentimentos de forma clara para sua namorada, mas sim de forma indireta. Essa ""forma indireta"" é tão intensa que ele se tornou stalker de quem ama, e isso é facilmente percebido em seus lados ""Tsun"" e ""Dere"". Nontan Katagiri, por outro lado, somente detém características ""Dere"". Durante o anime, é utilizado o apelido ""anjo"" para nomeá-la.
Akkun não demonstra seus sentimentos por motivos de ego. De alguma forma, ele aprendeu que amar é uma posição de vulnerabilidade, e que a mesma deve ser evitada o máximo possível. Este papel de alguém ""inabalável"" tem muitas semelhanças com papel imposto para homem real. Não somente do personagem, mas também do jovem (adolescente, criança) que está assistindo a animação. Há uma simpatização pela situação do telespectador, que talvez viva esta realidade. Felizmente, há um aconselhamento sobre esse papel: Quando Akkun alcançar a maturidade, não irá se preocupar com coisas tão fúteis assim, e que as quais impedem de viver seu grande amor. Ele um dia, irá aprender que a masculinidade não depende do exterior (os olhos dos outros), mas sim do seu interior.
Sobre a Nontan, não temos a mesma profundidade. Nontan é uma garota delicada e doce. Em suas mãos, leva o equilíbrio deste relacionamento, já que seu namorado está ocupado demais pensando em si mesmo. Para mantê-los juntos, é amplamente utilizado a paciência, compreensão, e até hiper-valorização dos pequenos (minúsculos) gestos de carinho que recebe de Akkun. Penso na possibilidade de Nontan um dia dizer ""não"", ou até se irritar com seus comportamentos imaturos. Akkun ficaria furioso (não pela situação em si, mas pela ofensa ao seu ego) e a odiaria por anos. Por esse lado, o anime não aconselha em nada para as telespectadoras, caso se encontrem em tal situação. Definitivamente, até Akkun aprender a amá-la corretamente, irá ser uma longa espera para Nontan.
Estas semelhanças entre personagens reais e pessoas vivendo papéis me levam para um questionamento: Existem Akkuns da vida real? Sim, existem. E Nontans? Talvez sim, mas espero que não. Ninguém merece viver num relacionamento com o equilíbrio tão dubitável, e que o qual só daria certo na esfera romântica, em seu lado mais idealizável possível. Pois afinal, a arte imita a vida, e vice-versa."
158704,"Romance is a genre that I always get to relate to. It's that innocent feeling of falling in love with someone so much that you go crazy with them to the point where you go through lengthy obstacles just to talk to someone, and that's no better represented by the innocent feeling of anime romance genres. But romance isn't always bubbles and colors; it's an anxious, lonely journey for a certain individual, and you have this second-guessing nature about whether the one you're pursuing really likes you or not. However,there hasn't been much anime that encapsulates the empty loneliness of romance as its main concept. We have certain anime that explored that concept, such as Kaguya-Sama: Love is War, but that series played with a lot of concepts that were only introduced minimally; Kuzu no Honkai used the concept as its main theme, but that series has execution problems; and other romance series where the concept was only explored minutely.
 
With that in mind, I'm in Love with the Villainess. It offers nothing special with the concepts of hopeless romance compared to what other series have done and could potentially be better, but this is the first time an anime that I have seen has used this concept subtly, and it hits the spot for me. 



In the anime, we follow our main character, Rae Taylor, who is madly attracted to Miss Clair, whom she admires very much. Each episode offers nothing special than other anime, just your usual buddy adventure with Ray Taylor and Miss Claire as they experience their unusual journey in their academy with a light spice of Rae Taylor constantly hyperactively engaging with Miss Claire. This anime from the very beginning has been pretty fun, and it continues to get more fun as the episodes run, but it doesn't shy away from deep topics and dramatic moments, and one element in particular is how the series handles the concept of letting go of someone you love.


 
Rae Taylor is a happy-go-lucky person, but you can hear that subtle sadness behind her voice, and it's especially prominent when the series points it out. Her tone changes, but she still tries her best when she feels like she has been confronted with her loneliness. It is subtle, and it is brillant, and you keep hearing that kind of tone every episode, and once you hear it, you feel this gut-wrenching feeling in your chest, and you actually feel Ray Taylor’s forgone defeat through those lines, enhanced well with the voice actress (JP: Yuu Serizawa; EN: Hannah Aleya) of Rae Taylor, who delivered a wide range of voice acting while making everything subtle.


 
It's not to say that I'm in love with the villainess; it has its own problems. The animation is Janky at best, and it doesn't explore well with other characters that are in the series; they're just there for the sake of plot convenience. But other than that, I'm in Love with the Villainess offers an entertaining tale while offering subtle sadness and contentment loneliness that no other anime has a well-executed concept offered."
16732,"Pros:
- Kamisato Ayaya
- It's very cute and relaxing to watch
- The English is nice though kinda bad

Neutral:
- Another one of those nothing really happens anime

Cons:
- (Nitpick) ""Cinematic"" aspect ratio in Ep. 1
- Feels repetitive at times
- Pacing issues
- No English dub as of 2022

Long version:

What happens when a foreigner moves to Japan and study there? Well, this tries to answer that in a SoL anime. The premise is that Alice went from England to Japan to study with Shino who stayed with them a few years back. 

!The first half of the first episode is set in England and is shown in a very ""cinematic"" aspect ratio. The rest of the season is in Japan except for some scenes in some flashbacks.! After that, it shows their entire year as 1st year students. It's not the most interesting premise for me as it boils down to a group of friends living their lives but with 2 foreigners adding to the mix.

The characters are kind of decent here. The main characters are Shino and Alice.  The former is an airhead that really sucks at English !(even though she wants to be a translator)! and has a liking for blonde (or gold?) hair. The latter is incredibly Japanese though kinda shy. Though MAL and Anilist also puts Aya, Karen and Youko as main characters, Shino and Alice have the most screen time compared to the rest of the cast. Karen is basically inverse of Alice personality-wise. Very westerner in habits and speaks in broken Japanese at times. Aya (AKA Ayaya) is inverse of Shino, shy and a Tsundere. Also is the smartest in the group. Finally, there is Youko. Pretty much a tomboy and that's kinda it. IMO she's the least interesting character.

I prefer Yuru Camp's characters more than this. Maybe because Shimarin and Nadeshiko goes through more character development (especially in S1) than the entire cast of this anime or they're much more relatable than them. The comedy is there and it's passable with fair amounts of hits and a few misses. Unfortunately, there is no English dub of this as of Jan. 2022 though this will be harder to dub than Yuru Camp since it involves both English and Japanese. The English parts is pretty bad compared to western productions but it's pretty neat for them to speak that language well enough so I'll give them credit for that.

The visuals of this is fine. It's not mindblowing for 2013. Finally, I like the music though not top-tier. Very happy and energetic.

This one is a pretty good anime with a relaxing atmosphere and a lack of conflict. It isn't the best in this type of anime now but it's still somewhat enjoyable. If you haven't watched a lot of SoL anime, there are better options available before and after this anime's release that I would recommend before this. I could only recommend this to the fans of this genre."
6205,"Kämpfer is undoubtedly the greatest thing mankind has to offer... Okay maybe not but it's actually not as bad as you would expect. This is my review of a show that probably doesn't deserve a review.

Story 5/10
It took me about 15 minutes to remember what the plot of the show actually was because if I'm going to be completely honest I didn't give a shit about it, I was just there for the tits. Anyways, the only reason this story isn't a 1/10 is because it only exists for the sake of fanservice, The whole idea of Kämphers only being female was made just so they could add some Yuri aspects to the show and appeal to the main viewerbase of the show (Horny Males) and to be completely honest, I fit in that category perfectly and I only have a little shame. The point is that the plot is not good but It takes a backseat to the ecchi aspects of the show


Characters 5/10
The characters are pretty generic for the most part with most of them just being living anime tropes, but I will admit that all of the female characters are pretty hot. The fact that they are tropes doesn't necessarily make them bad characters but as I said in the story section, this show is nothing more than crappy fanservice and it's honestly better that way.


Art 7/10
The animation and the art are good, I don't really have much to say in this aspect because I am not great at discerning how good animation is unless it's really good or really bad. It definitely does not fit into either of those categories but It doesn't really matter because the girls are hot and that's honestly all that matters in life.


Sound 7/10
The voice actors are all good. I don't speak Japanese but I'm sure it sounds fine to people native to the language. As for the dub it's actually pretty decent for a dub to a show like this one but It's definitely not as good as the Japanese voice acting.


Enjoyment 9/10

This is a bit hard to admit but I really enjoyed this anime. I never got bored with the show, the fanservice is top tier and while the ending and the stupid plot twist may have royally sucked It wasn't bad enough to drag down the rest of this... dare I say ""interesting"" experience.

Final Score 6.5/10

This anime is the greatest thing that mankind has to offer currently. It certainly has its issues like the plot and the characters and basically everything except for the ecchi which is average at best but even so It is almost guaranteed to make your pp hard. (I speak from experience) in comparison to other ecchi shows this one is pretty average but I recommend watching it as long as you're fine with some kinky shit like gender bending and kinda sorta yuri which technically isn't yuri depending on how you look at it."
130166,"Leadale no Daichi nite is a bog-standard Isekai full of recycled ideas that it doesn't seem to understand and doesn't want to explore.

That said this series originates from a Web Novel written between late 2010 and 2012 on Syosetu. It was picked up for a Light Novel serialization and Manga adaptation in 2019 ahead of this anime, with an audio book also thrown in there somewhere. The 2010 period puts it near the beginning of the Isekai boom on Syosetu, so maybe it's not as much reusing tropes as it is trying out everything it could think to do with an MMO Reincarnation story to capitalize on new interest.



The series starts with the reincarnation of Cayna into the world of a VRMMO that the terminally ill teenager played prior to her life support abruptly failing, retaining her over-powered game avatar and all of its stats and items. The world of the game is reportedly different from the one Cayna knows, however, as 200 years have passed without player engagement.

Unclear about the developments of the world and whether she might be the only human reincarnation, Cayna shows little interest in answering any of these questions and proceeds to spend numerous episodes aimlessly stumbling into events. The series plays out like a set of writing prompts, presenting a potentially interesting scenario that another isekai might run with and instead ignoring it entirely after a scene (eg. reincarnation depression, NPC sentience and permadeath, development of an MMO skill/item system absent players, players committing crimes and misdeeds). Leadale fails to understand what might make these storylines interesting and instead of presenting its own take on them either ignores the implications or presents the most generic resolution with the weight to suggest that it thinks what it has done should satisfy the viewer.

On top of this it repeatedly fails at humor with inconsistent characters that mostly just scream, bland attempts at ""over-powered"" tropes, and a general misunderstanding of where and when to explain elements of the world - spending time establishing game systems that it won't use and backstory for things that it abandons. Recurring gags of the show are very superficial and lack any variety in their execution (Cayna being hungover, Cayna being abusive to her children, characters surprised that Cayna is over 200 years old).



Events of the series also happen at a blistering pace with what would typically be multi-episode storylines in another show condensed down to a few minutes. Episode titles such as ""A battle, a Victory, a Conversation, and Information"" (ep. 8) are pretty much exact representations of how the show operates with all elements being given equal weight and almost no connective tissue to link them together. The series also suffers from implied significance, hinting at something of consequence in the minute prior to the end of an episode only to resolve whatever it was within the first 2 minutes of the next with the remainder of the episode moving on to something else entirely. A lot of this appears to stem from the Web Novel which was written as contained chapters, most of which lack significant detail or consequence to extrapolate to an episode in length and were instead adapted as-is with a misguided attempt to add cliffhangers when a chapter crosses the episode barrier.

There is a semblance of an overarching plot in ""restoring guardian towers"" that has no described purpose and is given no sense of urgency or importance by the main character. Cayna also lacks any real motivations, and is seemingly disinterested in uncovering more about the circumstances that reincarnated her as well as lacking any real drive to accomplish anything within the fantasy world. 

Amidst this blur of activity is also a rotating lineup of characters that only stick around for a few minutes so that the show can repeat the same gag of Cayna surprising people with some display of power or being (irrationally) upset when they refer to her as ""old."" Surprisingly this element seems to have been significantly played up in comparison to the manga adaptation, which makes Cayna seem less psychotic and more invested in those around her.

The manga, at least in the 10 English-translated chapters I could read at this point, also looks to be a bit more verbose in its explanations of the world and game systems - taking entire panels to explain terminology unique to the world (such as Cayna's ""Skill Master"" title) that the anime adaption instead seems to just throw around as if it's important and something that viewers should already know.



Ultimately the show for me is a demonstrative example of how to apply every isekai trope in the most bland way possible and without any depth. It's a madlibs-style exploration of a fantasy world with minimal internal consistency and an unclear understanding of what draws people to those types of stories. There's some passable voice acting and animation for what I assume is a low budget, but it's ultimately in service of nothing. The fact that this got an adaption is baffling to me; there's nothing here to work with and I would never recommend this to anyone. It's aggressively bland, lacks anything unique, and falls short of even being mediocre. My best guess is that someone saw the success of other, later Syosetu works that have been picked up in recent years and decided that it could capitalize on that trend. Unfortunately, Leadale lacks the hooks that some of those offer and feels like a much less refined story. Further, nothing was done to correct the structural changes inherit in the change of formats so the series comes off as a scratchpad of ideas written daily by an unfocused author and not a coherent episodic television show.

This kind of melancholic story with a thin lead can of course work, but unlike recent shows that can trace their origins to Syosetu like [Kuma Kuma Bear](https://anilist.co/anime/114340/Kuma-Kuma-Kuma-Bear/) (2014), [Slime-300](https://anilist.co/anime/112608/Slime-Taoshite-300nen-Shiranai-Uchi-ni-Level-Max-ni-Nattemashita/) (2016), [Bofuri](https://anilist.co/anime/106479/Itai-no-wa-Iya-nano-de-Bougyoryoku-ni-Kyokufuri-Shitai-to-Omoimasu/) (2016), or even [Infinite Dendogram](https://anilist.co/anime/107420/Infinite-Dendrogram/) (2015) it doesn't commit to focusing on involving Cayna in the stories of a supporting cast or having fun with its cast of interesting characters as a substitute for lacking a substantive overarching plot. Leadale instead teases , likely unintentionally, at bigger stories and rides a muddled line between adventure and comedy without doing either well.

https://anilist.co/anime/107420/Infinite-Dendrogram/

Even within its Syosetu publication era of 2010 Leadale falls short of [Log Horizon](https://anilist.co/anime/17265/Log-Horizon/) (2010) in world building, discussing MMO systems, and creating engaging MMO-focused characters or power-trip fantasy works like [The Irregular at Magic High School](https://anilist.co/anime/20458/Mahouka-Koukou-no-Rettousei/) (2008) that are clearly having fun with their premise and can find an audience that enjoys them for that specific aspect.

https://anilist.co/anime/17265/Log-Horizon/

https://anilist.co/anime/20458/Mahouka-Koukou-no-Rettousei/


Ultimately Leadale is another forgettable Isekai adaptation and in a sea of those it fails to float to the top due to a lack of any notable concepts, ideas, characters, or animation. What was more interesting to me was the level to which Leadale falls short at every idea it introduces and the degree to which it seems not to understand how to execute on its own story in any sort of engaging way."
158898,"Spoilers (super major ones will be marked)

Mission: Yozakura Family is a series that came out in the Spring 2024 season. It ran for 2 consecutives cours and had 27 episodes.
The anime adapted (most of) the first 10 volumes of the manga.
Rather than being a rather straightforward 1 on 1 adaptation. The anime wanted to focus more on the overall story. You see the early parts of the manga kind of screamed “It was getting axed” until it didn’t. The earlier portions of the manga were more Gag centered being more episodic than just having an overall story right away. Having Chapters that didn’t really correlate with the overall story the series was trying to make. The story portion of the manga started to kick in around the introduction of the Tanpopo. So in order for the anime to work SILVER LINK. rearranged certain chapters in order to make the earlier episodes work well.

And because I have to talk about it. Yeah, the anime is a Hulu/Disney+ exclusive. I mean on paper it isn’t really that bad because both are one of the biggest streaming services worldwide, but their problem is that they don’t advertise most of their shows. Like you couldn’t legally watch Summertime Rendering when it was released weekly and then it was dumped on their streaming service months after it ended. Thankfully that complaint has been fixed because the majority of their other exclusives have weekly releases.
Call it “the bare minimum” but Yozakura was one of their better shows they advertised

History

I’ve read the manga since March of 2020 and have been excited for it every since and like any fan of a new manga (particularly of a Jump Manga) you hope it survives and gets an anime adaption. Which it did. I remember how excited I was  because this is one of the first manga I’ve read before it got an anime.
I waited for the day the anime premiered so I could finally see one of my favorite mangas getting animated.

Story 9/10

The story centers on Taiyo Asano, a boy who lost his parents and younger brother as a result of a car crash and as a result he becomes more introverted. However he has his childhood friend Mutsumi Yozakura who is the only comfort in his life left. Everything changes one day in which the School’s Vice Principal Mr. Hirukawa asks him to come to his office. The reason why is that he wants to kill Taiyo because he is close to Mutsumi, however Taiyo’s life is saved miraculously. He wakes up and finds himself with Mutsumi along with 5 other people who are her siblings and all of them are spies, and that Vice Principal Mr. Hirukawa is actually the oldest sibling in the family Kyoichiro who after having an incident which almost killed Mutsumi he wanted to protect Mutsumi from anything. In order for Taiyo not to be killed by Kyoichiro, he and Mutsumi will have to get married because the Yozakuras most important rule is “No killing among family”. And that’s how the story begins.
The series starts out pretty episodic as it starts out with Taiyo adjusting to both spy life and becoming a member of the Yozakuras. One of the things I prefer in the anime over the manga is that each of the family members were given their time to shine. While the earlier chapters did have some sort of them most of the earlier chapters of the manga barely had the “Yozakura Family” part of the manga as it felt like it was just introducing a new character every chapter. The series as a whole starts to get interesting around the introduction of the Hinagiku and leading to the first series arc the Kuroyuri arc in which Taiyo has to investigate a politician named Yoshimasu Kuroyuri. This arc hooked me into this series when I read the manga and made me the fan of this series I am today. The anime nailed the emotional moments and even some of the action of this arc pretty well. The actual story starts to take a turn around the introduction of the Tanpopo in which we discover what actually happened to Taiyo’s family and their plan to steal Mutsumi’s heart for their seed-sowing project. The moment the series finds its identity is around Gerbera in which Taiyo heads to a train looking for the Yozakura siblings’ long lost father Momo who had previously injured Taiyo in order for Mutsumi to transfer her blood to Taiyo so that Taiyo would become stronger.  We would meet Hakuja who was one of the Tanpopo members but also knew Taiyo’s parents and blames herself for their deaths. As she was ill and was on the verge of dying but was saved by Tanpopo leader Makoto Kawashita who injected Hazakura into her but he had also done this with other patients but Hakuja was the only one who lived as the others who were injected died. So as a result he tried to cover it up by killing the Asanos. Episode 20 was the peak of the series, everything about this particular episode was perfect with the animation and emotion being the best parts of this episode.
The battle between the Yozakura and the rest of the Tanpopo was phenomenal with Taiyo vs. Kawashita being the best part. 
Overall the story was really good.

Characters 9/10

I really liked the characters
Taiyo Asano is one of my favorite protagonists ever. Taiyo initially starts as this introvert who’s unable to cope with his family member’s death but thanks to becoming a member of the Yozakuras he becomes a lot more confident and grows as a person.
Mutsumi is generally a really fun and interesting character. She’s the head of the family and while the head is the ordinary person in the family that’s what I love about her.
Kyoichiro is a rather complex character for me to simply describe. While he is obsessive, the mystery of his character is what makes him interesting.
Futaba is an amazing sister. Easily one of my favorite characters.
Shinzo is awesome. At first he just looks like a scaredy cat but his knowledge on weapons and his badass moments makes him one of my favorite characters.
Shion has a laid back personality which I really like. And her hacking abilities are cool.
Kengo is a rather fun energetic animal but can be able to understand people which I think is cool
Nanao is my least favorite of the siblings but that doesn’t mean I hate him. Nanao is solid. I just think the other siblings are better.
Special mention to Keiko and Ban. The grandparents of the Yozakura siblings. Ban is a goofball but is also a solid mentor, while Keiko is more laid back especially when she isn’t dealing with Ban.
Ayaka starts out as this crazy yandere who wants to kill Taiyo but becomes a lot less crazy once she becomes the family maid.
Hotokeyama is a solid character.
I really liked Hinagiku and it was great that the anime gave them a bigger role overall. My favorites would have to be Rin, Momiji, and Sui.
Kuroyuri starts out as this weird politician but the twist being that he wants to kill many politicians as he felt he was betrayed by them as when he was celebrating his daughter's birthday one of the politicians gave her a present which killed her. Kuroyuri was the first great antagonist the series had.
I liked Hoshifuru a lot. I loved his personality and I enjoyed the twist that he was observing Taiyo to see if he was worthy enough to get his spy license.
Me-chan is menacing.
The Tanpopo as a whole are really great antagonists.
Makoto Kawashita is one of those “Love to hate” type villains as he’s really hateable but he’s done so in a well written away, with the twist of !him collaborating with one of the Yozakura family members! in order to eliminate the Yozakuras was pretty shocking.
Nohmen was fine.
Yama-chan I gotta respect his love for dogs but other than that he’s also fine.
I love Hakuja. She’s easily my favorite out of all the Tanpopo members as her backstory was amazingly done. She was an ill patient who desired to live more than anything else, but when she met Kawashita and he cured her by using Hazakura it cost her two people in her life she grew a connection to which were Taiyo’s parents. Her character as a whole was tragic but the conclusion to her character was tearjerking to watch.
Akai is hard for me to perfectly describe. Her backstory is tragic, being about someone murdering her family members and then Kawashita using her siblings’ body parts in order to save her life and give her Hazakura. Akai really has this IDGAF attitude and that’s what’s pretty unique about her.
Aonuma is a character I really like. His backstory was that he was homeless and lived in cardboard boxes along with a woman named Hako who refers to as “Granny Hako”. They don’t get along, but one day when it was cold outside Hako left Aonuma in the cold but when Aonuma woke up the next morning Hako gave Aonuma her coat and leftover food. I also like his ice abilities.
Kurosawa is a rather silent character but his character as a whole is solid.
Cha-Cha is a menace who prides himself on his intelligence and thinks everyone other than him is stupid. Yeah.
Mizuki is another hard to describe character for me. Because he has a rather cruel way of disciplining his adopted daughter Ai in which he traumatizes her by placing his hand on her head. But his backstory involves him living in a town where a disease was killing a lot of people and they could do nothing about it, but Kawashita saved his life. I also felt his death was done in a bittersweet way in which he apologizes to Ai for scarring her as a result of his cruel way of discipline.
I love Ai. She’s a rather fun character to watch and is easily one of my favorite characters.

Animation 7.5/10

The animation is solid. When it’s great it’s great. And when it’s bad it’s bad. The sakuga scenes in this anime are amazingly done like the fight scene with Taiyo and Hakuja. It shows you how much passion SILVER LINK. for this anime.
But there are some times where the animation is rather poor, take episode 24 for example.
Overall the animation for the most part is solid.

—-
Enjoyment 9.5/10

I love this anime. And as a fan of the manga I enjoyed how SILVER LINK. adapted this manga. The anime isn't perfect by any means but the positives weigh out the negatives pretty easily.
A special mention to the voice acting in both Japanese and in English. I love the VAs performances as their characters, my favorite being both Katsuyuki Konishi and Sean Chiplock as Kyoichiro.
I also liked how the anime fixed certain problems the earlier chapters of the manga had as it wasn’t just always introducing new characters for the sake of it and actually focused on the family aspect of the series.

—-
Overall 9.5/10

Mission: Yozakura Family was one of the manga I couldn’t wait for it to receive an anime adaptation, and now that the first season is finished I can’t wait to see more of it now that Season 2 has been confirmed. So overall I enjoyed the first season of the anime and I can’t wait to see more of what SILVER LINK. has to offer."
101261,"“I want to connect, but I want to lie.”

Sarazanmai presents two sides of the same coin. On one side, we have desires; the sense of longing and hoping for a certain outcome. Often considered an innate part of our humanity, they can also be attributed with the darker aspects of one’s personality. They’re the deep secrets we hold to ourselves, not wanting the world around us to know about, and dreading the thought of if they were found out. But as much as the show focuses on desires, it’s just as focused on connection. The world is comprised of all kinds of connections, whether by blood, through communities or even with similar desires. We are all connected in some way to one another… But connections can be broken just as easily as they were formed. And even with a desire to connect with other, can we truly form the connections we want with the desires we hold still intact?

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPf8mCryzM)

“I want to connect, but I want to take.”

Sarazanmai is the latest series of one of anime’s most stylistic and socially-conscious directors in Kunihiko Ikuhara. His ability to tackle thematic topics such as love, adolescence, destiny and power hierarchies through surreal plotlines and symbolism is arguably unmatched in the entire industry. Lauded as a visionary by fans, Ikuhara seems to increasingly escalate the bizarre nature of his works as they’re churned out. Sarazanmai does little to change this notion, taking viewers on a journey that’s honestly hard to describe on first impression. It should come as no surprise that the show can be very difficult to follow at first despite how overtly direct it is in its ideas. There’s such a unique blend of sexual symbols and homoerotic imagery on display that could easily warrant essays analysing just those aspects. But my interest in the show lies more in the characters here, with Ikuhara having crafted in my opinion an oddly compelling character drama in the span of 11 episodes. 



“I want to connect, but it’s not meant to be.”

The main cast of Sarazanmai consists of three middle school students, all vying to protect the desires they hold dearest. The first of the trio to be established, Kazuki Yasaka, also happens to be the most fortunate of the group on the surface. Liked and appreciated by practically everyone around him, it’s not until his more startling hobbies are brought to light that reveals a clearer picture of Kazuki. He’s a child burdened with self-guilt, feeling responsible for crippling his younger brother because of his own selfish wishes, and as a result tries giving him the happiness he felt was taken away. But make no mistake, Kazuki’s actions are made for his own sake, not his brother, show a fundamental flaw in his character: maturity. Kazuki understands his own mind and wishes, but is unable to recognize the minds of others, and without the latter remains wary of the connections he still has. Until he’s able to appreciate others more, his struggle with connection can only continue.



“I want to connect, but you’re so far away.”

Toi Kuji is an interesting case in that he acts as a direct opposite to Kazuki initially. The delinquent to Kazuki’s upstanding persona, he ironically counters Kazuki’s self-centredness through being the most empathetic and mature of the three. He understands the feelings and relationships of others best, and despite some troubles with communicating his own thoughts, connections can be formed with others. But in Toi’s case, it’s not so much about forming them, but preserving them. Toi underneath his mysterious nature and dubious actions does have respectable desires – to save the soba shop his parents owned and to get away from the illegal circumstances his brother pushed him towards. From an early age he was taught of the importance of familial bonds, though under the inkling that it ultimately came at the cost of other potential bonds. However now he arrives at a crossroad between preserving the relationship he has with his brother, or valuing the connections made through friendship more. Maybe more importantly, is he worthy of having these new connections?



“I want to connect, but I can’t be forgiven.”

Enta Jinnai is the last of the three to be enveloped in Sarazanmai’s story, whose desires are probably the most simplistic of the three, but still a core part of his character. Unlike familial love or friendship, the kind of connection Enta yearns for is romantic love, specifically toward his best friend since childhood, Kazuki. But as much as Enta might try to form that connection, his feelings are not reciprocated. Enta can clearly be seen as cheerful, innocent and the one with the least amount of baggage, but overtime it’s readily apparent how frustrated and fearful he is about Kazuki and his situation, at times even hallucinating about what his ideal romantic relationship would be like. A connection already exists between the two, just not the type he honestly wants most. A solution may seem obvious to us as onlookers, but if it were us, what choice would we make? Abandon this desire for unrequited love with someone who has never registered these emotions? Keep these strong feelings bottled up for fear of losing your closest and possibly only friend? Or end up pursuing them, and risk falling in a cycle of heartache as a result.



“I want to connect, so I won’t give up.”

Three distinct personalities all different from each other are brought together through the strangest of ways – being transformed into kappa and having their shirikodama removed from the anus, before having to fight zombies and remove their shirikodama in order to become human again, assisting the Kappa kingdom in their ongoing war against the Otter Empire. The premise is certainly original, but the themes are what take centre stage here. How connections between people are forged, strained and how that pain can affect each other being the most overt example, but for as much as the series shoves connections at the audience, the relationships between the cast are formed rather organically. The way each character’s darkest secrets are revealed after each fight is what leads to the natural bonding in the show. There’s a trust created as they rely on one another whilst holding their own goals that would put each other at odds, a dynamic rarely explored in anime and is reinforced through the explicit symbolism. But these bonds may also speak to the level of trust required in a world not accepting of their desires, with the backdoors of society being the one place where people can freely express themselves. Or perhaps the world is not as it seems, and in reality is controlled by an industry feeding and profiting off our desires through corporate means. Or maybe it’s just saying that it’s ok to be gay. This is both the beauty and difficulty of Ikuhara’s works; always shrouded in so many visual metaphors that it presents itself as a puzzle, almost devoid from the typical standards of storytelling but still encapsulating a myriad of ideas and messages, to where viewers are inclined to decipher the dense tale themselves. It’s not a style that everyone will enjoy, or even acknowledge, but for those who do, it’s part of the charm, something that is constantly gleaming off of Sarazanmai



“I want to connect, but I want to betray.”

Now while I am personally a fan of Ikuhara and this series, there are some glaring issues I have with Sarazanmai, most notably due to how this eccentric tale is contained in only 11 episodes. Ikuhara, as beloved as he is by many, is known for his many tropes, from wacky animal hijinks and overly flamboyant poses, to increasingly surreal and almost gratuitous imagery, to the worst of his traits: his re-use of animated scenes. Sarazanmai features all of these quite regularly throughout its broadcast, to a degree where it can be no longer inviting for viewers unfamiliar with Ikuhara’s work. But speaking for myself, watching so many of his trademarks on display leaves very little room for the show to breathe when it needs to. The director’s previous work, Yuri Kuma Arashi, is the worst example of this. To quote a review for the series: “Watching Yuri Kuma Arashi is like trying to memorize the first 100 digits of Pi. Succeeding might technically be considered an accomplishment, but good lord is it meaningless.” Thankfully Sarazanmai does not become this insufferable, staying a joy to follow moment by moment whilst remaining coherent on top. But the quirks do leave their marks on the series. For a show so based around connecting to its characters, the audience is given little incentive to care for the characters in the first place. Factor in the repetitive tropes, a breakneck pace and a script that beats the term “connection” into your skull, and as a result we’re left with inconsistent development and key events not able to fully capitalize on their emotional impact. I truly believe it would have benefited from having more time available to explore the world, the cast, their backstory, etc. in order to tell a more complete story without rushing to the finish line. But alas, we fans get what we are given.



“I want to connect, but we’ll never meet again.”

Ikuhara’s history as a director is riddled with him having to compromise in some way on most of his projects, whether it be the numerous limitations that faced the production team for Yuri Kuma Arashi, or him completely abandoning his position on the Sailor Moon TV series. But with Sarazanmai, it’s hard to tell if there were any issues the crew faced. Very rarely does an anime emerge with the kind of intensity that Sarazanmai brought in the first episode. At face value, the show is visually stunning, using a multitude of vibrant colours and attractive character designs that immediate distinguish it amongst the crowd. The show also has a knowledgeable understanding of colour theory, with red, blue and yellow used to help define the personalities of the main trio. The series features a surprising amount of action that’s animated very well. I find it extremely praiseworthy that despite MAPPA being credited as the main studio, the first 4 episodes were produced by Ikuhara’s small team at Lapin Track and look no different from MAPPA’s work on the project. The show is like an explosion on the screen, bringing Ikuhara's vivid creativity and imagination to life. 



“I want to connect, but I can’t express it.”

The music for Sarazanmai is fantastic and well-voiced even with how repetitive it can be. Each of the fights feature the same tracks over re-used animated footage of the same dance sequence most episodes. The show takes inspiration from musicals with how it uses a mixture of diegetic and non-diegetic songs that help propel plot and character development, another rarity to be found in the medium. The themes of desires and secrets mesh well with the musical format, utilizing the basic structure and common song format to help give the series a theatrical essence in these moments. The voice acting is also excellent in conveying the appropriate tone, clarity and emotions required from each scene, effectively helping to humanize the characters. The soundtrack was composed by Yukari Hashimoto who also worked on the soundtracks for March Comes in Like a Lion, Toradora, Osomatsu-san and one of Ikuhara’s other works, Mawaru Penguindrum. Yukari has a knack for combining traditional Japanese motifs with modern electronic-style music to create a collection of tracks that’re uplifting in their own distinct way. The opening and ending themes are also bangers if that means anything to you.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWY2y4D1Qks)

“I want to connect, but I can’t.”

Sarazanmai, as much as I may like it, is an anime I find difficult to recommend, simply due to how hard it is to describe the kind of experience someone is in for. And in a way, that’s how Ikuhara’s works differ from the norm. There’s a story to be found and characters to move it forward, but they rely on interpretation to the point where my experience could end up completely different to that of the average anime watcher. But what I will say is that Sarazanmai sums up a bit of every original work from Ikuhara: The structure of a battle closing each episode with meaning behind each foe faced from Utena, the comparison of love and desire from Yuri Kuma Arashi, and the way society works with a shredder to destroy what the world doesn’t accept from Mawaru Penguindrum, all while maintaining its own identity. Sarazanmai is a weird show, but the weirdness is not complicated, as it constantly bears two sides of the same coin. Connection is an important part of the show, and our lives, but the show is also about hidden desires – the embarrassing parts of ourselves we don’t wish to share. The truth is we all have weird parts about ourselves, and we’re afraid we won’t be accepted if we admit those things. Yet in Sarazanmai, admitting those desires allows for real human connection to foster, and there’s something worth fighting for in that.

A SERIES OVERVIEW
(INTRO)


 
The Rascal Does Not Dream Series is one of the most highly rated and beloved modern anime series, scoring #14 for highest rating and #3 for most popular in 2018 (as of July 2, 2024). The series offered a subversion to the usual louder directions anime usually takes with its drama and plotline, but instead takes a step back and provides a more subtle environment with underlying drama tones that keep you gripped to watch. This is coupled with its cleverly constructed and memorable characters that do not feel generic compared to how they were initially presented, along with witty dialogue that keeps you grinning while watching.
 
One of the main hooks this series has is “Adolescence Syndrome."" As the series implies, it is an “abnormal experience during adolescence as a result of sensitivity and instability."" This premise can give you the impression that the series tackles the heavy supernatural aspects and power systems that anime is usually known for, but it took a more direct approach to the inner psyche, using characters’s deeper insecurities and creating an exaggerated outlook on frustration through supernatural themes. Adolescence syndrome is what it is: a ""syndrome,""  something that causes disturbances to the one who has it and the unfortunate who's tangled around it. This unique aspect of the series made it one of a kind amidst the abundance of recent anime. 
 
The series expanded its 13-episode run on its first season by providing three new movies. Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl is a movie that tightens up the loose threads from where season 1 left off while also providing a powerful finale for the series. 4 years later, 2 new feature-length films of the Rascal Does Not Dream Series were released that tackled another satisfying conclusion we didn't know we needed, starting from Rascal Does Not Dream of Sister Venturing Out, for which I have made a review {here} in which I have mentioned that it is a great after-story while also being a great amnesia story. A few months later, Rascal Does Not Dream of a Knapsack Kid was released, which is the focus of this review.
 
With every arc in the series, it tackles a person’s insecurities and how they will address and overcome the problem, but with a series that seemingly closes its opportunities for new major characters to pop up as of now, The previous film didn't even have supernatural elements to merit its “adolescence syndrome,""  so what can this film provide to convince us that this is a proper-fitting conclusion to its original arc? The series already has an answer to it. 

PART 1
SAKUTA'S ADOLESCENCE SYNDROME



Sakuta Azusagawa (Kaito Ishikawa) is our main protagonist who is a student in Minehagara High School. In this school, he had met many people who have their own experience of Adolescence Syndrome including his wonderful girlfriend Mai Sakurajima (Asami Seto), and guiding these characters to make amends on the very thing that started the chaos in the first place. Sakuta is mainly used as a vessel to meet these various characters and help them reach their desired goal. Sakuta is not your usual one dimensional character since he has his own unique quirks especially with his relationship with Mai and his values, and why he wants to help people brings him at a good spot as a lead and heroic protagonist. However, a hero doesn't mean you are free of the flaws of what makes us human, or rather appreciative of the existence of who sees the hero. Even us the viewers sometimes forget that Sakuta is a fully fledged character in this world, and this movie fully acknowledges this.
 
In this film, it focuses on Sakuta’s adolescence syndrome, in which Sakuta’s consciousness traverses across different worlds in his own body in an attempt to find where he belongs. Sakuta knows how it feels to step up and be independent amidst the sudden chaos, and Sakuta understands this most as he felt lonely and helpless where he had to do things on his own, which he later applied to his motivation of helping people who have Adolescence Syndrome, where it can feel isolating to the one who was unfortunate to have it. Sakuta has his life at its happiest. He even has his beautiful girlfriend Mai, who he's head over heels with, but there is another aspect that also took up the majority of Sakuta’s life that hadn't been explored as much, and that is his family and relationship with her mother.
 
In the world of family dynamics, parents are usually the ones who will be the child’s first proper connection with whom they can casually interact, but Sakuta has a rather rough relationship with his parents, especially her mother. It's not like Sakuta is abused per se, but rather a distant, loose connection that can easily be forgotten. The series focuses on this dilemma with pure somber drama as its driving force. Sakuta, who was surrounded by people who valued him deeply, struggles to get that feeling of belongingness towards her mother. Not to mention that Mai is already leaving her high school life behind. 
 
This triggers Sakuta’s Adolescence Syndrome, where he becomes invisible, just like Mai in the Bunny Girl Senpai arc, and a Knapsack Kid around who is willing to take him to his home, or as it seems to be. Sakuta, who is someone who always wants to help people in need, is suddenly alone to deal with his problems by himself between his subconscious feelings and relationship towards his mother, fully embracing that sense of belongingness he had unconsciously sought for a long time. 
 
Rascal does not Dream of Knapsack Kid offered a refreshing and down-to-earth story about the connection between families, and even when the cracks are so big that they become distant, there is still an opportunity to create bridges that connect one person to another. The film is a wonderful drama in and of itself, and you can watch it for what it is, but there is one huge element in the series I didn't get to talk about until now, and that is the significance of the Knapsack Kid.

PART 2
THE KNAPSACK KID (a working theory)



The Knapsack Kid is this person who looks like a young Mai (or what it seems to be) existing between existence and non-existence and who offers her hand in guiding Sakuta home. The film centered this idea even from the title, which eventually became a sideline. It's not a bad decision per se, nor has it ruined the film overall, but most viewers would find it frustrating that the film has a lot of loose threads that were left unanswered (Note: As of July 2, 2024, The Light Novel is currently at Volume 13 in the middle of the college arc, and the overall mystery of the Knapsack Kid remained unanswered). This mystery might get solved in future volumes of the series, but I would like to propose a personal theory of mine that satisfies the viewers of this film.
 
Little Mai is a representation of Sakuta’s inner child, guiding Grown Up Sakuta home.
 
Hear me out.
 
Point #1
Sakuta had a certain childhood where he couldn't remember anything in relation to him as a child or his relationship with his mother. Fast forward to his high school life. Sakuta is head over heels for Mai, and throughout the film, he would just blurt out his true happiness and longingness, which is to see Mai. Adolescence Syndrome is set out as the manifestation of inner turmoils (such as Mai being invisible after seeking to be one), and the Knapsack Kid is a manifestation of Little Sakuta taking grown-up Sakuta back home. It just manifested itself as Little Mai because Sakuta couldn't imagine himself as a child since he couldn't remember much of what he looked like when he was little.
 
Point #2
It wouldn't make sense that Little Mai knows where Sakuta’s home is. Mai only knew the apartment where Kaede and Sakuta lived but not the home where all four of his parents used to live, not to mention that they knew each other in high school. In about 36 minutes into the film, Little Mai makes a comment, saying, “Are you lost, mister? ”and took Sakuta home via the train. A hard cut happens after Sakuta wakes up in another world where everything in its current state is the same and stays the same, but in Sakuta’s family home. 
 
There are a couple of theories in the film that tackle different concepts and perspectives, and you may have a personal theory of your own to make everything make sense. To some viewers, it can be quite cumbersome and a huge turn-off on the series by not providing answers on an already-ended plotline, but that thing is part of the charm of the series as a whole. The series is built around its mystery themes, while at the same time tackling the topic in a more direct way and labeling it as important in the moment. Theorizing about certain events is a natural thing since we seek things to be answered, but it is also okay to leave things as they are or the narrative that satisfies the arc it features. My theory might be right or wrong, but for now, we can close the chapter on the Knapsack Kid phenomenon and accept it the way we want to accept it through our own narratives.

A RETROSPECTION
(OUTRO)



The Rascal Does Not Dream is a series that provides acceptance towards the insecurities that we deal with from day to day and learns to accept and embrace their existence to see the road to improvement. In this film in particular, it is about accepting to yourself that you are not as invisible to people as you think you'd be. There will be some days where we truly feel alone and struggle to find help, as the subconscious feeling of being unwanted by the people we either deem special or unknown suddenly becomes out of reach.However, there will be that one person or a memory of a person that will snap us back and make us remember why we still walk forward all this time.
 
Starting from the first arc to this one, the entire series embraces the themes of mental struggles and mental health and fully embraces them by personifying these emotions and experiences that felt tangible for the viewer with respect, while also having that consistent quality, storytelling, and character dynamics that notions the reason why the show is beloved in the first place. There is already a second season coming with more stories to tell in the light novel, but this film already satisfies that conclusion we didn't know we needed."
20819,"Working!! um anime estreado em 2010 tendo 3 temporadas e um especial para finalizar a obra. Foi animado pelo estúdio popular chamado A-1 pictures, por isso é seguro dizer que o anime tem uma boa animação e um traço bem bonito. Seus principais gêneros são Slice of life e comédia e seu grande triunfo são os personagens com características bem distintas e excêntricas.

A história toda se passa em Wagnaria, um restaurante familiar que possui funcionários um pouco peculiares, a comédia se desenvolve principalmente com a interação deles entre si, como cada um possui características bem únicas, toda vez que interagem acaba sendo algo divertido de se ver, afinal sempre acontece alguns mal-entendidos ou acidentes um pouco desastrosos. No inicio de tudo como alguns personagens ainda estão se conhecendo, o anime proporciona mais a comédia leve e um Slice of life gostoso de se assistir, mas com o decorrer de alguns episódios quando os personagens começam a se conhecer melhor ou terem mais oportunidade de interagir o anime consegue proporcionar um romance, romance esse que só melhora com os episódios.


Um ponto muito interessante que o anime ressalta é que Wagnaria só existe por conta dessas características estranhas dos funcionários, a personagem Matsumoto é usada para ilustrar essa ideia, essa personagem é a que menos aparece no anime, aparece somente em cenas de fundo realizando seu trabalho normalmente e em poucos episódios que ela interage com outros personagens do anime. Isso não é porque a autora deixou a personagem de lado, mas sim porque com ela de exemplo, a autora vai conseguir trazer a ideia do porquê o anime existe.
Matsumoto tende a querer ser uma pessoa normal, que faz coisas normais e como ela acha todos os seus colegas de trabalho estranhos, ela prefere não interagir muito com eles, porém ela leva essa ideia de ser normal ao extremo e isso a torna estranha o que ressalta a ideia de que Wagnaria tem apenas funcionários estranhos, mas mesmo assim ela ainda carrega consigo o papel de ""normal"". E com isso a autora mostra que os personagens que possuem uma personalidade ""normal"" tendem a não ter um espaço na obra, afinal um funcionário normal iria apenas realizar seu trabalho corretamente e voltar para casa (algo que a Matsumoto faz) e a partir do ponto que essa ideia é levantada entende-se que se os funcionários deixarem de agir estranhamente o anime vai acabar. Com o decorrer das temporadas, essa ideia é comprovada e Wagnaria deixa de ser como antes, sendo algo inevitável, porém necessário para os personagens.


Cada personagem é bem único e bem característico, todos são muito divertidos e proporcionam ótimos momentos entre si, abaixo está algumas características que os tornam um pouco diferentes de pessoas comuns:

- Takanashi Souta tem 16 anos e tem uma paixão excessiva por coisas pequenas e fofas e também detesta mulheres mais velhas.

- Taneshima Popura Apesar de ter 17 anos e estar no ensino médio, Taneshima é tão baixa que frequentemente é chamada de aluna do fundamental por seus colegas de trabalho ou clientes, o que irrita bastante ela.

- Inami Mahiru sofre de Androfobia (medo de homens) e sempre soca qualquer um que apareça diante ela, isso é algo bem problemático então seus colegas de trabalho (homens) evitam se aproximar dela e ela evita atender clientes homens.

- Yachiyo Todoroki  é gentil, calma e bonita, porém ela carrega em sua cintura uma katana, que acaba assustando ou intimidando muitos clientes.

- Jun Satou assume a cozinha do restaurante, ele sempre desconta suas frustrações na Taneshima e a chama de baixinha ou faz pentiados estranhos com o intuito de zoar com ela.

- Souma Hiroomi sabe informações de todos do restaurante e as usa para chantageá-los, apesar disso ele não é um cara maldoso e ele também é bem discreto sobre as informações pessoais deles.

- Shirafuji Kyouko é a gerente do restaurante e não trabalha nada, seu estômago é um poço sem fundo e sempre está comendo algo e acabando com o estoque do restaurante.

- Aoi Yamada é uma garota que mais atrapalha do que trabalha, ela é bem desastrada e é muito carente por carinho e atenção.

- Maya Matsumoto aparece muito pouco no anime, porque ela quer ser uma pessoa normal que faz coisas normais e prefere não interagir muito com os colegas do trabalho porque ela acha que todos são estranhos.

- Hyougo Otoo é o dono do Wagnaria, ele está sempre fora do restaurante pois está a procura de sua esposa que se perdeu, sempre que ele retorna traz lembranças para Kyouko e mantê-la de bom humor.

O anime possui uma trilha sonora bem leve nada extraordinária, mas que é bem relaxante pro clima que o anime apresenta. Também possui um elenco cheio de dubladores famosos e populares como [ Kamiya Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/95118/Hiroshi-Kamiya), [Daisuki Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/95212/Daisuke-Ono), [Jun Fukuyama](https://anilist.co/staff/95086/Jun-Fukuyama), [Eri Kitamura](https://anilist.co/staff/95413/Eri-Kitamura) e entre outros... 
A staff do anime fez um trabalho excepcional, em dividir todas as dubladoras das protagonistas femininas para cantarem as Openings, enquanto todos os dubladores dos protagonistas masculinos cantam as Endings isso em todas as três temporadas, a equipe também se organizou no 1º de abril e lançou um [ ONA de 2 minutos](https://anilist.co/anime/10532/Working-Announcement-Specials/) falando que o restaurante Wagnaria iria trocar todos os funcionários para a segunda temporada do anime e esses personagens são de [www.working](https://anilist.co/anime/21764/WWWWORKING/) uma versão alternativa do anime original.

 Working!! é um ótimo anime de comédia e Slice of life, conforme mais você assiste, mais você se apega aos personagens e ao ambiente, durante o decorrer das três temporadas existe uma evolução muito grande dos personagens e dos relacionamentos entre eles. O anime te mostra um ambiente de trabalho perfeito que mesmo cheio de problemas ele é um ambiente divertido e interessante, tirando aquela visão do trabalho ser um obstáculo apenas necessário para ganhar dinheiro e mostrando o quão felizes todos os funcionários são, trabalhando com o que gosta e com quem gosta, afinal praticamente eles são uma família de tanto compartilhar momentos únicos e divertidos entre si.
O anime também mostra como mudanças são necessárias e inevitáveis e que todos os dias são importantes para o desenvolvimento de cada um. Uma cena bem simples, porém bem marcante é quando Souma diz que queria aproveitar ao máximo aquele momento porque ele sabia que um dia tudo iria acabar. Não é uma cena dramática e nem nada ela é até feita com naturalidade, mas essa fala condiz muito com o que a vida fornece: momentos bons que devem ser aproveitados, porque um dia esses momentos irão acabar.

10271,"I'm an indecisive person. Because of this, it's quite hard for me to decide what anime/manga I want to start. So, what I do is, I put a bunch of anime/manga on a wheel, spin it, and whatever the wheel lands on, I watch. One day as I was doing this, it landed on an anime (don't remember which one it is), and I was going to watch it. But then I just felt like I wanted to watch a certain anime instead.
What I'm trying to make clear through this rambling is that watching Kaiji was a huge gamble, and it really paid off. The show is my 3rd favorite anime and 6th favorite overall as of now, and I'm really glad I took that decision to watch it.
This review is probably not going to be all that deep or insightful or meaningful. Maybe it won't even be entertaining. Mainly because I'm writing this just because I'm bored and I want to get the hang of reviewing stuff again. But that's not my goal. My goal is to convince you, the reader, to watch the show. Also keep in mind that this is a review for the series overall (both seasons of the anime, not the manga). So without further ado, let's get into it.


The story is fairly simple. Kaiji is a broke dude who's wasting his life, and is deep in debt. A strange man meets with him and gives him a way to pay off his debts: gambling. More specifically, gambling his life. The main plot of Kaiji is fairly simple, and that's perfectly fine. This is because the plot is nothing more than a setup for the real meat of the show: the gambling. 

Unlike most gambling anime or manga (at least those I know of), Kaiji doesn't specifically focus on one pre-existing game. It doesn't focus on pre-existing games at all. This anime creates a variety of games from scratch and make the protagonist face off in them. I mean what I say when I say that every single game is compelling and thrilling. No, seriously. There is not even a single moment when I got bored watching this show. The outcomes are predictable most of the time (sometimes you genuinely cannot predict the end result though), but that doesn't matter. The suspense of this show doesn't come from the outcome. Rather, it comes from the methods that Kaiji uses to get to that outcome. He comes up with all these crazy strategies over the course of the show, and honestly? I don't think any of them are predictable at all. It really is a joy to watch the events unfold on screen. I still can't believe I got as invested as I did in an arc which is just a dude playing pachinko.


Kaiji is pretty dumb. Not in the conventional sense, mind you. The strategies he comes up with are proof of how clever he is. What I mean by saying he is dumb is that he makes some of the stupidest decisions some times. Sure, he does do some ""noble"" things sometimes, but that is very rare. Most of the time, when it's not related to gambling, the man's an idiot. Sometimes he'll be cocky, sometimes he'll be ignorant, sometimes he won't quit while he's ahead. And that's perfectly fine. Kaiji is a very human protagonist. Because let's be honest, most of us do a lot of dumb stuff most of the time. And Kaiji's no different. He's just an average joe (below average, to be honest) wasting his life and doing nothing. However, when push comes to shove, he uses his brain and comes up with solutions to the problems he faces. Kaiji is pretty much like all of us. Sometimes he's noble, at other times he's a scumbag. Sometimes he uses his brain, and at other times he acts like he doesn't have one. He's not extraordinary. He's just like all of us. He's a regular human being, and we don't usually see such genuinely human characters in anime and manga, which is why I appreciate him so much. 

I haven't really brought up the supporting characters or antagonists much, and that's because they are there for no other reason than to develop Kaiji and showcase his strengths and weaknesses. Tonegawa is a standout character for his worldview alone, and is a genuine challenge for Kaiji. Hyoudou is another standout character, but that's mainly because he's so hate-able. Overall, Kaiji is a fantastic protagonist, and the side characters do their job to support him and showcase him.

Note: I'm not using any unique names for this title because I'm too lazy to make a unique name for Art & Sound Design every time I make a review, I hope no one has a problem with it.

MADHOUSE was the studio in charge of Kaiji, and as always, their work is stellar. From what I've read of the manga, the anime is very faithful to the Fukumoto's artstyle and to be honest, it translates very well. The first time I looked at this show, I thought the artstyle would be a detriment. However, it is very expressive, and expressions are a big part of this show. It also looks weirdly cool, but maybe that's just me.

The sound design is standout. Whoever made the OST for this anime, hats off, because you really nailed it. They have the perfect song for every circumstance, and all iterations of ""Zawa Zawa"" are some of the best atmospheric tracks I have seen in a show. 


Kaiji is one of the most intense anime I have ever seen. The games are all fantastic, the protagonist is very human, the side characters do their job well, the artstyle and animation are great, and the sound design is stellar. All of this together makes for one of the best and most immersive anime. Overall, I would give Kaiji a score of:

Do yourself a favor and watch this show."
570,"Sometimes while consuming media you find something that you can only profoundly respect. For me, Jin-Rou is exactly that. It honestly transcends the muh anime deal and elevates itself to cinema levels, good cinema. This IS a must-watch and I feel like saying some stuff about it, spoilers included.

First things first, this film is visually lovable. Some might find its worn presentation tiresome and bland, but it captures so strongly the feeling of hopelessness and wasted people living in a wasted world of wasted politics and wasted happiness, it's amazing. It's directed by the guy who made character design for Ghost in the Shell, a big friend of Oshii, and his ultra realistic character designs find perfect place in a narrative that is all about how reality functions. It's not easy to use those to their fullest, but whenever you have characters getting frantically holed by huge ass bullets, summarily executed without a blink for pity, you believe in it. It's heavy, and you feel the weight of those individuals dying for a cause. That is without mentioning its attention to detail, and how there is an entire else world going on while our characters casually live their lives. There is always something there, moving, existing, at any given moment. And that is shared with the audience in the sense we are also clueless of stuff that is just heavily implied. Facial expressions, moments of silence, of apparent discomfort, sadness, disillusion, hopelessness. All captured like it should, adding barely more than needed and leaving nothing to be desired. A balanced directing, aware of the perfect timing to cut scenes and progress things, so they can sink in without losing focus and grip on what the film is about. Lightning deserves its own mention. If you don't know what it looks like to have bullets being shot in a shady ambient and hitting their targets, be it metal, concrete or flesh, these guys did their homework to make it as realistic as you can possibly get, and cool as fuck to witness. So yeah, that is all on the visual end. Don't let me get into sound design. If you are into gun porn and gun sounds and steps from troops relentlessly marching towards their prey, oh boy, enjoy it.

But what honestly separates Jin-Rou from a cool looking flick about cops doing cops things is definitely the screenplay. Again, this is great cinema, and if there is one thing that is common to great films is their writing. An inattentive watch for this picture can cause the feeling of indifference, also known as, ""is that it?"". Well, yeah, it has a hell of a slow pacing and its plot is considerably small and simple. But the thing about this movie is that it's a piece of expression, and most people won't bother to know what Oshii was trying to say. He wrote all of this world and characters, characteristic of his worldview, and knowing the guy helped me a lot comprehending all the subdued things that could easily pass unnoticed. At the very beginning, we are introduced to the world of Jin-Rou through an expository documentaryesque sequence that closes with:

""As they were about to join the pages of history, the changing times were about to give them a new and final mission"", referring to the Special Unit. Let's go from there.

Jin-Rou begins by exploring the idea that big shifting moments in our history were determined by small actions, or in this case, small inaction. By not pulling the trigger at the beginning, Fuse becomes a chess piece in a dangerous game of interests that could only end in tragedy for one side. There is also the idea of entering the pages of history in a way most people often don't take into consideration, which is of entering subtly by not being there. History isn't necessarily known, though it's always there, crawling in the corners of our lives. Unknown heroes, unknown villains, unknown victims: that is our history, filled with blood-stained pages. And that is all because what the pack wishes to achieve is the perfect status quo, fighting hard to maintain its existence, always hiding their plots from public knowledge. So this might leave watchers wondering if the ride is worth it, because shit seems not to happen. Well, that is the point of the film. All it's done is an act of regression, to represent post-war Japan's mindset and spirit of never actually changing. Things come and go, movements arise and disappear, blood is shed, and people remain the same. In our world, Japan grew to be what is described in Oshii's masterful Patlabor 2. In Jin-Rou's world, where Nazi Germany won the war and methods of oppression were of common use, the society ignores the Sect's revolutionary acts, as well as the Special Unit's crude repression. It achieves minimal stability and already throws in the towel, being only a section of the government interested in changing things. That change is, however, only interested in shifting structures of power from one side to the other, while remaining ultimately corrupt. Just look at the methods these bureaucrats utilize to get there.

So there is an evident pessimism to the film's political backdrop and message, not a surprise coming from Oshii. But there is more than just that to Jin-Rou. It's also the story of people, and of how much they are worth: nothing. There is a cut in the last minute that I must say, it's one of the best cuts I've seen in all of anime. The idea of cutting to something else is of separating two realities that just couldn't be recorded as the same. There could be a moving camera shifting from one place to another, but only a cut can convey that feeling of 'wow, look how different these two perspectives are'. It is a meaningful cut, and its meaning is soul-crushing. The tragic tale of death, of finality. After crossing a point of warped morality, there is no going back. Fuse is lost, forever. The last moments of that couple are spectacularly shot. There is a sense of objectivity to the scene, like if it's recorded by superior all knowing beings without a moral compass to mourn upon the cold farewell of two murderers from different sides. Both share a dream of belonging, both die in a sense, one remains human, the other shows its true colors. And, reaching the end of this few-seconds long scene, we cut to a man, a wolf, holding a gun, pointed at the two, waiting for yet another inaction of our protagonist to fire and kill both. It's not necessary, of course, but it shows reality as it is like no other scene had before. This is Fuse's and Kei's value. This is what they truly worth: nothing. She is to be disposed of in some wasteland, and he is, despite his talent and skill, as disposable. By choosing the ""right"" side, he lives, although dead inside. Had he chosen otherwise, he'd be over too. Dying as a human, becoming a wolf, it's all the same. All about negating humanity, and by cutting from the tragedy to the routine of dealing with internal doubt and risk by the more experienced from the pack, it separates the movie in two. The tragic tale of two souls destined to cease, and the tale of wolfs casually eating their preys, like they always do; nothing special about it. It's depressing, it's sad, it's hopeless. But it ends. It ends and that is all that matters. What is done is done, Fuse is done for, so is Kei. The pack's position is secured for some time, the danger of termination is postponed until further notice, and things ultimately remain the same in the grand scheme of things, like Oshii wanted to say.

It's dark, it's merciless, and it's striking. It might be boring, uninteresting to some, simplistic to others. The film is what it is, a piece of expression that never felt the need to overstate anything that had going for it. The blatant quoting of Little Red Riding Hood is just a tiny fraction of what the anime is about. If you got caught up on that, you may have missed a big portion of its quality. It's like a solid rock. Hard to approach, hard to carry, hard to take something away from, but it's definitely worth it. Every time I rewatch it, I always think just how powerful it is by doing things that way instead of resorting to a more action packed style, which is more Oshii like. I also think it's much more subtle than anything Oshii has ever done, which I attribute to him not directing it, but instead only giving essential advice, and coordinating the production. Truly masterful. Give yourself a watch."
11977,"Nunca fiz o exercício da comparação direta com a versão de TV, mas sempre senti que o ritmo de Madoka Magica fica melhor nos filmes, acho que a atmosfera condensada em uma rodagem única transforma o filme em algo completamente denso e emocionalmente cansativo, além de encantadoramente melancólico. Lembro que na versão de TV, com o eventual engessamento do formato, além das naturais pausas emocionais que o anime faz entre um episódio e outro parecem transformar a metade da história num momento com menos impacto que aqui. Por outro lado, a cena da Mami numa versão que deu mais pausas emocionais foi bem mais impactantes - apesar disso ser meio difícil de medir, uma vez que eu já sabia o que ia acontecer e, de novo, não estou fazendo uma comparação direta, só lembrando de cabeça.

Mas excluindo comparações entre versões distintas de uma mesma história, filmão absoluto. A história começa e progride num ritmo muito bom mesmo. Acho que a única ressalva que eu faria seria quanto a alguns momentos bem bregas e com uns diálogos bem expositivos bobos, principalmente da Sakura. Acho que ela é uma personagem que eu gosto menos a cada vez que me deparo com ela. Consigo compreender sua função e motivações, mas acho que ela foi inegavelmente mal introduzida no roteiro e não tem o que fazer mesmo. 

Acho que o ponto que mais fez diferença em uma revisita é a brutal solidão dos espaços. Não parece existir um design confortável em nenhum ambiente nessa cidade. As arquiteturas são hostis, com aquele colégio todo de vidro com espaços industriais opressivamente tecnologicos e mecânicos além de lugares com um acabamento gótico, mas sem o ar histórico. Parece tudo apenas pontiagudo, desconfortável, anti-intimidade. Tudo parece propositalmente anacrônico - risos- para causar incômodo, isso quando a arquitetura do lugar sequer faz sentido de verdade. E todas essas coisas são reforçadas pela direção que retrata todas as relações de maneira impessoal, muitas falas são proferidas fora do enquadramento convencional, com as personagens de costas, sem conexão real com as pessoas. A única que encara de frente todo mundo é a Homura e bem, por um bom motivo.

Mas esse filme é inteirinho da Sayaka. Se eu gosto cada vez menos da Sakura quando assisto, gosto cada vez mais da Sayaka. Toda a jornada dela é perfeita, desde a primeira reação ao que tá rolando quanto ao seu final. Ela representa bem demais as inconsistências da adolescência, desde a hesitação em relação ao primeiro amor, o questionamento à percepção de seu próprio corpo até o ponto da completa desesperança e loucura com a falta de uma base sólida para encontrar o seu motivo de existência. Ela tenta se punir e se diverte ao perceber que suas feridas não mais machucam, ela tenta a todo custo manter sua humanidade para divertir-se com a falta dela. É rápido, é um detalhe, mas é também o arrependimento do momento. Muito foda, papo reto. Fortíssimo.

E é cruel demais toda a simbologia de seus poderes terem a ver com notas musicais e água. Ela é moldável e maleável a esse ponto."
210,"Ranma ½ is the father of tsundere and the grandfather of wacky romantic comedy hijinks. Not exactly the best track record, is it? Alas, as a critic, I'm too honest to say that Ranma is a good show. But, odd as it may seem, it is a very enjoyable one nonetheless. Sound confusing? I don't completely understand it either, but I'll do my damnedest.



 Story: Most of us are probably familiar with the general premise of the show. Boy gets cursed such that every time he gets splashed with cold water he turns into a girl, and then proceeds to move into the home of his arranged fiancée. Hilarity ensues. Beyond that, there's not a whole lot to say about the ""story"" of this show, as it's very episodic. For the most part, you can expect everything to be the same at the end of an episode as it was at the start... or, if not, it's a two-episode story arc, and you can expect things to go back to normal after the next episode. More characters (ie, comedy fodder) are introduced throughout the series, but it sticks to its episodic formula up until the very end, and there's no real development to be observed. Spoiler: Ranma and Akane will be just as awkward and tsundere towards each other by the end of the very last episode as they were at the start of the first. Such is the fundamental flaw of much of Takahashi's long-running bodies of work. But, familiar characters and easy-to-follow storylines are king in the world of comedy cartoons, so Ranma is just another victim of the genre, I'm afraid.

 Art: It's an old show, so it's got pretty old art and animation. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as both remain consistent throughout the show's run and don't detract from one's enjoyment of the show. At least, I don't think they should. Fans of old-school animation the likes of Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon rejoice, because here you'll find it in spades, along with...

 Sound: ...that classic 80's/90's cheap-but-nostalgic soundtrack sound. The music from this series is really nothing special—no soaring melodies or epic chords. But prepare for the earworm of those wacky Chinese hijinks riffs to be in your head for a long, long time, because there's no one who's seen this series who wouldn't recognize the music immediately. The Japanese dub is par for the course, and even features Kappei Yamaguchi (Lelouch, Usopp, and many others) singing a duet in about the sweetest damn closing sequence of all time in a set of OVA's. The English dub... varies a bit. The many seasons of Ranma span the transition between the dark ages (Ocean DBZ, Sailor Moon) and the period where dubbing started to be taken seriously (thanks, FUNimation). Thus, the first season or two is a little bit on the shoddy side—albeit still listenable—and improves pretty dramatically as the series progresses, actors become more comfortable with their roles, and some are replaced outright for the better. Despite the inconsistencies, it's still a perfectly enjoyable dub, and my preferred viewing experience.



So what exactly is Ranma's saving grace, then? I've described incredibly cheesy plotlines, dated artwork, and a laughably corny music score. But when you put it all together, what you get is this almost-grindhouse-goofy piece of animation that just makes you chuckle at how delightfully cheesy it is. And as a comedy, that means it's done its job, right? Ranma ½ may not be the thought-provoking pinnacle of writing that Satoshi Kon may have spawned... in fact, it's just the opposite. It's the kind of show that lets you just kind of turn your brain off for 20 minutes and enjoy the ride. Shows that make you think are important, but this can be fun at times, too. If you're the classic anime viewer who likes to reminisce about the good old days of 80's/90's anime, and you haven't seen Ranma, I recommend giving it a watch. It's a fun, goofy ride from start to finish."
146676,"(WARNING: This review contains MAJOR spoilers. Proceed with a LOT of caution.)

Spend enough time around the anime block, and you’re bound to at least hear about anime that have a particular combination of genres: ecchi and harem. The premise of one guy being involved with multiple girls has been done time and time again and will continue to be done, and most of those times, fanservice will be sprinkled into the mix. A couple of my favorite anime may be part of these two genres, but like many others, I have grown slightly weary of them. For that reason, when I came across a screenshot from a certain ecchi/harem anime that had just started airing, I expected it to just be another generic ecchi/harem anime; looking into it, however, led me to discover that it was an original anime (as in, not based on a manga, light novel, visual novel, etc.), and for some reason, that convinced me to watch the first episode. Despite thinking I’d drop it after that first episode, something about it made me feel like there was more than what meets the eye, so I kept watching.

One entire season later, here we are, with me trying not to do a victory dance over being proven that I was right that something was going on with “Renai Flops”.

Although it takes place in a more futuristic setting than most, Renai Flops starts like any other rom-com anime, with our hapless hero, Asahi Kashiwagi, having five different risqué encounters with five different people - Aoi Izumisawa, Amelia Irving, Ilya Ilyukhin, Bai Mongfa, and Karin Istel. When he finally arrives at school, he discovers that Mongfa is his new teacher, and the rest of them are transfer students in his class. To top it all off, these five all confess their love for Asahi and even move in with him. So begins Asahi’s life with these five, with their feelings for him developing more with each episode. Pretty standard setup for a harem anime, right?

Well…. you know what? We’ll get to that later.

First and foremost, I should talk about the technical aspects of this anime, starting with the art. The character designs are pretty solid for the kind of anime this is, the backgrounds are quite pretty, and the animation was nice and fluid. At the very least, it’s easy to see that Passione put some passion into this project! (Cue someone throwing a banana peel at my face.) The voice cast is full of all-stars - such as Ryouta Oosaka and Ayana Taketatsu - who also do a solid job at their roles. The music is probably the best part of the anime, with the opening and ending themes being quite pleasant to listen to; heck, I went out of my way to purchase the opening theme, “Love? Reason why!!” by Konomi Suzuki, on iTunes! One song that stands out in my mind, however, is the insert song that plays during the final episode; as of now, I don’t know the name of the song, but I do know that it’s sung by Miku Itou and that it, accompanied by the scene that it played in, almost made me cry!

Unfortunately, Renai Flops’s story and characters aren’t entirely at the same quality as the art and sound….although that statement might be debatable. At the very least, the first half of the series will take a lot of patience to get through. Not only are there almost all, if not all, of the clichés that can come with an ecchi/harem anime, there tend to be played out in such an over-the-top way that I found myself cringing. There are a few moments that make it stand out among the crowd, but those moments are few and far between. In the first half, the characters are also pretty standard for this type of anime, with not a whole lot to make them stand out among other characters like them. All of this is on purpose, as is made clear later, but even knowing that doesn’t make the first half of Renai Flops any less exhausting to watch.

There is one thing I can honestly praise the first half of Renai Flops for, though, and that is its foreshadowing. From episode 1, there are hints that something isn’t quite right here. These hints range from pretty obvious, like when Asahi fails to remember his “best friend”, to blink-and-you’ll-miss-it-type moments, such as the date on Asahi’s alarm clock inexplicably changing. A conspiracy theorist could have a field day with those hints, and ultimately, by the time episode 7 ends, they would be doing a victory dance over how correct they were all along.

Well, if their theory was that none of your waifus were real, anyway.

To be more specific, Asahi was part of a simulation, and Aoi, Amelia, Irina (Ilya), Mongfa, and Karin were all artificial intelligences. This plot twist is probably a predictable outcome given the anime’s setting and all of the hints that were dropped previously; however, those who aren’t paying close enough attention will be caught off-guard, and even those who are may not be able to predict the full extent. The moment the plot twist is unveiled, the story steadily begins to improve. There is less fanservice, the characters develop in a way that make you care about them more than before, and as I briefly mentioned earlier, there are some nearly-tearjerking moments during the second half. The ending does raise a few questions, but I wouldn’t say it was a bad ending, by any means.

Overall, I think Renai Flops was alright. Fans of the ecchi and harem genres and those who have a lot of patience may find themselves appreciating what it has to bring to the table. Those who don’t like those genres and don’t have the patience to sit through it, however? Sorry, but you’ll probably see this as a flop."
21823,"Many anime have extremely memorable styles that give it a visual punch, but few have achieved it to the level of this show. Without a doubt, “ACCA: 13 Territory Inspection Dept.” is one of the most stylish shows to have come out in recent memory. 

A YouTube commenter once noted that the show felt “very textured” visually and that it possessed a strong attention to detail in regard to “sensual things like hair, cigarette smoke, the countless food items, and the like.” 

Even if the plot may not necessarily appeal to many if not most audiences, the style that the animators use for this short series is nothing short of amazing and worthy of watching just on its own. That is not to say that “ACCA” is reliant on its strong visuals; the plot stands strong on its own and proves to be an intriguing ride from start to finish. However, had it not been for the captivating visuals present on-screen, this show would have likely not been as effective in giving the atmosphere needed for this type of show.

Firstly, given that recent anime is typically an explosive combination of high-paced action and almost schizophrenic visuals, “ACCA” is an outlier in today’s anime market given its status as not only being extremely slow-paced, but also almost devoid of any action. Because the show is a political thriller, “ACCA” may come across as unappealing for many audiences. In fact, it could be arguable that had it not been for the fact this was animated the way it was, this show would have likely fallen off the radar completely.

Taking place in a fictional kingdom divided into thirteen distinct states, the show focuses on Jean Otis, who is an officer who is in charge of observing and reporting activities back to his agency, the titular ACCA. While the adventures of a government inspector sounds rather unengaging, “ACCA” brings political intrigue into the mix as Otis begins to realize his role in the middle of a national conspiracy that threatens to change the entire country. 

Viewers entering this series should not expect any major action sequences. This is a show about political intrigue and maneuvering that is more like “House of Cards” then it is “White House Down.” As a manga adaptation, the show is extremely loyal to its source material, which was a political thriller in its own right. Audiences looking for an intense and high-octane experience will be disappointed. 

Even in its most intense moments, “ACCA” carries on its storytelling gracefully. In the kingdom of Dowa which Otis serves, political scheming is a very clean affair. When the end of the series approaches, all questions that the audience may have will be answered thanks to how tightly written the plot is. There are numerous characters that Otis meets throughout his journey, and almost all of them serve a purpose in the grand scheme of things. Aside from several comedy relief characters (which are a hit-and-miss in terms of their effect), “ACCA” never introduces new characters without them being relevant at the end.

On the topic of relevance, “ACCA” also does not attempt to pad its plot in any way. As mentioned before, the story is very tightly written and it is clear that the author of its source material had a clear purpose in mind. As such, there are few moments where the story seems to be dragging along, and even though the pacing is admittedly slow, “ACCA” always moves forward at a consistent pace that gradually builds up to a satisfying and conclusive finale by the time the credits roll.

This show’s plot is also tied heavily with its visual style. As mentioned before, “ACCA” would have likely not have been as effective of a show had it not been for the strong visuals backing it up. Many shows are carried by their strong visuals in order to cover for its weaker storytelling, but “ACCA” instead uses its strong visuals to complement its strong storytelling, which creates a more memorable and atmospheric experience as a whole. It’s a beautiful combination that makes for a stunning end product.

That being said, the show is not flawless. While “ACCA” wraps up cleanly and delivers a satisfying conclusion, it does so in a way that’s almost too clean that almost seems like the result of an extremely fortunate set of circumstances. There are hardly ever any major setbacks in the plot that change the complete context of the plot save for one major twist near the end of the show. “ACCA” should be applauded for how fluid its plot feels with each passing episode. The show flows naturally and once audiences are hooked onto its main premise, it’s easy to lose track of time as each new development becomes more engrossing than the one before it.

It should also be noted that while no character is useless, many of them come across as being somewhat bland. This is not to say that they are terrible characters, but it is to say that there isn’t really a single character in the show that really steals the show with the exception of main protagonist Jean Otis, who is characterized to be a rather reserved and enigmatic individual. It is hard to tell what he’s thinking at times given his lack of strong emotions, which can be quite problematic for some audience members who may not be used to a protagonist like him. “ACCA” is more plot-driven than character-driven, which unfortunately results in a case of somewhat unmemorable characters. 

To conclude, “ACCA” is a stunning political thriller that capitalizes on its well-written plot and brilliant visuals. While it arguably falls short in the characterization of its key characters, the show is nonetheless a strong anime that will likely stand up to the test of time. Audiences looking for a slow-paced show with plenty of intrigue and mystery will find this to be an amazing experience."
101289,"The Master of Ragnarok and Blesser of Einherjar is a truly humiliating work. It’s so comically inept and earnest in the name of its intended ambitions and atrocities that it becomes endearingly pathetic for a while. I was wholly prepared to come write about how this show was the ultimate waste of time in terms of creating it, watching it, and especially reviewing it. It still is in many ways, especially when it becomes downright insufferable later on, but this deformed gem belongs in the same realm as classics such as Big Order and The Room. I mean, just look at this thing, this clueless, fugly piece of shit!

This show is the penultimate production shitshow! To begin with the easiest of targets, the CGI is as prevalent as it is laughable. The stills are more frequent than bits of animation, resulting in some garbage action and hentai-like sequences. The animated fight sequences aren’t much better, so it’s nigh impossible to appreciate the “action” on any level.. As if all that wasn't enough, the people at studio EMT² created this terrible Ufotable-esque art-style similar to the infamous Chaos Dragon, and they struggled heavily to keep their character models consistently drawn. Shame cuz some of the women are so hot that they deserve much better, at least until you realize what utter objects they all are. That’s when it becomes debatable.

The female characters in this show are borderline humiliating, especially the twin additions to the harem. While they’re at the very least varied in terms of what kind of objects they are and even much of an object they’re characterized as -unlike in Smartphone- they’re still barely effective at best and downright worthless at worst. The best things I can say about them is that they don’t blatantly fall into any archetype and that some of their designs, namely Siegrune’s, are cool and have fun clothing. The later ones are so disastrously infuriating and worthless that after the pink-haired girl showed up, they should have stopped this process altogether and spent more time fleshing out we had. Their leader, Yuuto, is downright hysterical; he is a total piece of shit. Outside of the bitches he collects, patronizes, and still refuses to bone, and this one girlfriend he has at home (along with the few generals and whatnot who are useful), he treats everyone under his ranks with as much contempt as the most reprehensible regime leader villains in anime history. This man will force you to become his slave child or his barely any less subservient little sister, and threaten to massacre your clan if you don’t comply. His mistresses are all either his children or little sisters, which is obviously for the most unashamedly fetishistic sexual gratitude or both him and the intended audience. We’re supposed to treat him like a normal harem protagonist cuz he still has most of their hallmarks, or a decent human being just because he regrets having been worse? Fuck outta here! That’s like saying we’re supposed to pretend any of the remaining side-characters aren’t the most one-note and worthless things ever. Even he knows how awful he is, and some of it isn’t even his fault.

The fact that with all this, they still try to set up moments and entire plot-lines with intrigue, attempt to have character arcs with peak “emotional moments”, and take this show’s story seriously with emotional music and close-ups of women crying in joy or despair to boot, is as rich as it is tragic. It attempts all of that in the name of selling this kind of disastrously nonsensical, badly paced, convoluted, excess, and ill-defined material as something worth getting invested in. They even have several decent fantasy music for the title cards and scenes related to the ongoing war that are often only heard once. When Overlord is just sitting there, cackling in the corner with its superior OP/ED music in the same season this bullfuckery airs, things need to start being re-evaluated. In spite of all this, this show actually tries to indirectly explain the origins of this main character becoming an Isekai protagonist with a single moment of visual storytelling in the opening before eventually elaborating on it. Mad props for the idea, even if the end result was convoluted. For that alone, this thing ain’t as bad as Smartphone, let alone worthy of being called the worst Isekai ever made. 

Obviously, the quest of enduring this embarrassment is not for everyone. Most of its problems are so self-evident that not only are several of them displayed by the title and cover art, but people not keen on wasting their time would be doing exactly that by watching this thing. This blend of ambition, degeneracy, laziness, and ineptitude is a beast meant for only the most skilled hate-watchers to slay. Even I barely survived half of what happened past the fifth episode, and I was having a blast early on and towards the end. For the brave few who choose to embark, and the animation buffs willing to give this a shot, grab a party. and/or alter your state of consciousness first. If you genuinely enjoy something like this, let nothing stop you other than some mind-shatteringly awful filler episodes. All others can pretend this show doesn’t exist; you’re missing nothing of value by doing so."
158926,"For some reason Kadokawa is not very good at promoting their new shows, at least in Western countries they often fall under the radar, but luckily i sometimes see promotions for new episodes on their YouTube channel, as like ""posts"", fully in japanese, so I happened to watch one featuring a guy with bangs covering his eyes and the only text i could read was a magnifying glass emoji. Was it enough? Yes. At this point, i am starting to realize that my love for detective stories is also driving me to its anime adaptation of the genre, and i'm not disappointed so far. 
Apparently, they like to use Sherlock Holmes, as i sense the authors might have been inspired by Conan Doyle's books, and so this is the third time i see him as ""part"" of the show (in this case not in the flesh, but you'll see why). The interesting twist is this ""Deranged"" detective who is the best but was cursed with eyes that force the culprits to kill themselves. He was therefore banned from the greatest detective school and forbid to solve any kind of crimes. But luckily, coming in clutch is Detective Isshiki, or simply Toto, or even Tototo, a not-so-deductive agent, but brave and  pure-hearted, willing to help the others, let's say he's ""the arm"" of the team. 
The duo carries the show: some cases are interesting, especially the long ones, and this little additions of elements such as Ron's weird way of analyzing the victims, or his general ""deranged"" behavior, as well as the need to save those that committed the crimes from committing not-alive, are all well thought. Some cases are a bit rushed, even a little weird a few times, but, hey, you get the ""light"" cases and then the more important ones, you don't really think about them too much, they are never boring and the pacing works, as you get a 3-episodes Case kinda in-between the season, making it the climax of the whole story so far, and you just forget about the rest, if not for some reminders every now and then. As for The supporting characters, they are not just there: they have been developed, we saw both their strength and weaknesses, they add value, which is not always the case for crime stories. I'm referring to Spitz, Amamiya and the super brilliant detective that uses tweezers. 
After this first season I hope good things are coming. The rhythm worked, there are silly moments and more serious ones, i rarely found them out of place. These first episodes introduced a sort of main antagonist, something that can connect all the dots, and there will be a lot to unpack. Second season could work like Link Click, a main story after a season of stand-alone episodes that helped set up the world and the characters. 
Lastly, kinda biased, but coming from the jjk depression arc, i enjoyed listening to both Yuuji and Utahime VAs playing different characters, in a much happier and funnier environment this time."
103221,"The best word I can think of to describe Children of the Sea is “overwhelming.” It’s not so much a movie as it is a whirlwind of sensory experiences, music and sound and color and light clashing and colliding like the tumultuous waves of a stormy sea. It’s a cascading tsumani of pure artistry painted on a stunning canvas that builds and builds and builds until whatever grip of reality you might have once had is shattered and you’re swept away by the sheer explosive wonder of it all. It’s perhaps a more purely “cinematic” experience than any film I’ve watched in a very long time. Certainly, it’s one of the single most gorgeous pieces of animation I’ve ever watched, period. And if you’re at all interested in checking it out- which I think you should- the best piece of advice I can give you is this: don’t bother trying to understand Children of the Sea. Just feel it. Experience it. Let it flow over you and around our and through you and fill every pocket of your mind and soul with its presence. I promise you, you’ll be better off for it.

The story, so much as it matters, centers around Ruka, a young girl who lives in a town by the sea. She’s listless and drifting through life, buckling under the pressure of bullying at school and her parents’ rapidly disintegrating marriage. But everything changes when she goes to visit her dad at the aquarium he works for and makes a shocking discovery: there’s a boy swimming with the fishes! His name is Umi, and he’s lived his entire life raised by sea creatures. He can walk and talk on land, but at this point his body has adapted more to living in the ocean. Soon enough, Ruka is drawn into his lively wake, and they start spending summer break together, along with another seafaring boy named Sora. But it quickly becomes clear that there are much bigger things afoot. There’s a group of researchers studying the boys for unknown reasons, all the animals in the sea seem to be gathering together, and the boys speak of some unknown ritual that the Earth itself is preparing for. And the more time Ruka spends with them, the deeper she finds herself pulled into the mystical power at the heart of it all.

On the surface, you might think that plot setup would lead to a youth adventure story as the kids set out to unravel the mysteries of what’s going on, possibly on the run from those evil researchers. But that’s not where Children of the Sea’s focus is. In fact, the longer the film goes on, the more the plot seems to become an afterthought. In the end, we get few answers to what was literally going on, and it’s pretty clear that we’re not meant to fully understand how or why any of this is happening. It’s all operating on a purely sensory level, speaking through imagery and music just as the highly symbolic whales that populate the film speak through oceanic songs to communicate far beyond humanity’s capacity to understand them. As a downside, that does mean there’s not much to be found in the way of real emotional connection here. The characters don’t grow or change much, most of the relationships and subplots- Ruka’s parents reconciling, a researcher named Jim rebelling against his superiors, Ruka’s antagonistic back-and-forth with Sora- are pretty underbaked, and the eventual climax operates on such heightened dream logic that it’s difficult to parse what, if anything, we were even supposed to take from it. Suffice to say, this is not a movie to watch for the plot. This is a movie to watch for all the stunning imagery the plot exists to facilitate.

But holy fucking shit, what imagery it is. Even from the start of the film, when we’re still grounded in the normal world, the production is gorgeous from top to bottom. Stunning background art, evocative and detailed character animation, a constant sense of sun-bleached, windswept wonder... it’s as beautiful as any Ghibli film, albeit with a slightly more grungy, tactile edge that acknowledges the sweat and dust and grime of the world as it exists. And that’s all before the surreal, increasingly phantasmagoric imagery starts filtering in. The deeper Ruka dives into the world of Umi and Sora, spending more and more time in the ocean, the wilder and wilder the imagery gets. The sea and the creatures within it take on increasingly abstract shapes and forms, colors and lines blur and shift, a heavy rainfall becomes an ocean of droplets racing through the sky, bioluminescent plankton becomes a sea of stars streaking across the sky, giant whales with archaic eyes on their skin leap through the waves, and all rendered in some of the most unspeakably beautiful animation I’ve seen in a long time. Imagine if Mob Psycho 100 had twice the budget and was an art-house mood piece instead of a shonen action series, and you might have an idea of how fucking good this movie looks. And then we reach the climax, at which point everything descends into a near-wordless acid-trip synthetic visual opera, weaving together infinite strands of visual thought in some kind of grand metaphor for the concept of creation and existence itself for twenty straight minutes of pure, unadulterated eyegasm. I had no earthly clue what was going on, but I was nothing short of captivated all the same.

And that’s Children of the Sea in a nutshell: an explosion of some of the most beautiful imagery you’ll ever see animated. Don’t go into it expecting a well-structured movie in a traditional sense, because you’re bound to be disappointed if you do. Go into it if you’re in the mood for something that will sweep you away on a purely sensory level, probably lasting a little too long in the process but never quite overstaying its welcome (seriously, though, I felt every second of this hour and fifty minutes). It’s far from perfect, but it doesn’t need to be: the magic it provides is more than enough."
550,"Yu-Gi-Oh! ""Season 0"" as it's called by some fans boasts quite a few differences from the trading card anime we're all familiar with. For those of you unfamiliar with this version of the show, it features one extra member of the gang who was apparently too moe for the later series, is often much more gruesome than its successor, and sticking more closely to the manga, features all manner of games, including but not limited to an extremely early, extremely simple version of Duel Monsters. Also Kaiba has green hair.

...

Writing: As mentioned prior, this series sticks to the manga more closely than Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters does. That said, things are still toned down from the manga version at least somewhat, so this series falls somewhere inbetween in terms of content. For example, where a villain might be set on fire in the manga, here they're presented a traumatic illusion that makes them think and feel as if they were set on fire. Things like that. Yami Yugi is still Game Batman, though, dishing out cold and brutal street justice to those who are asking for it.

There's a certain charm to seeing the Pharaoh as Chief Badass, rather than the more romantic and human version we see trying to learn about the mysteries of his past in Duel Monsters. While this series does more deeply explore a lot of the early arcs before the start of Duel Monsters, such as the origin of Joey and Yugi's friendship, make no mistake, it is not in the same canon, as the presence of the extra character and punk-phase Kaiba's interactions with Yugi prove. Oh, right, I was critiquing the writing, wasn't I? Overall it's fairly average for a shonen series, but some of the solutions to the games are quite clever and will keep you guessing.

Animation: Not stellar, not abysmal. It's the 90's, what're you gonna do? Yugi's still hoarding the world supply of hairspray, though.

Sound: This series was never dubbed, so expect no Dan Green. The Japanese actors do a fine job of capturing the characters, though, even if Yami Yugi's voice is a bit on the stereotypical side as far as angsty young badasses speaking Japanese go. The music, I dare say, is a strong point of the series, much more unique than that present in Duel Monsters, and with a transformation theme that would have been iconic had this show made it to the west. It's an earworm, that.

...

If you've ever wanted to see a bishonen Two-Face take on the role of Batman and dish out street justice with gambling, you're looking at the right series. The series is as bipolar as can be, from its cute and saccharin school scenes to the dark and gritty dealings with injustice. I recommend it as a fun watch for anyone interested in this kind of dichotomy, as well as (obviously) for fans of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise who want to see the origins of the series in animated form."

So I recently completed the Naruto series and am yet to start Shippuden. I thought of catching up on the movies that come before Shippuden in chronology and decided to watch  Ninja Clash In The Land Of Snow. 

Set during the early days of the anime series, the movie takes place after the episode 101. I dont remember the correct order but I think it's after they convince Tsunade to become the 5th homage as I can see few visuals from that arc. 

The story is a very typical Naruto story, where the team 7 along with their sensei are sent on a mission that turns very serious halfway through. trying to rescue/escort a princess who is in hiding. They try to overthrow a tyrant. naruto uses a shadow clone. he awakens Kurama. and in the end rasengan's the villain. 



oop and how did i forget naruto's famous talk-no jutsu. you know as a kid i was like you, blah blah. 

Also I want to appreciate Sakura in this movie. I'm not one of those people who call sakura trash because I heard that she becomes stronger in Shippuden. but in the shounen jump series, every fight, I wait for her to do something. 
Unlike the series, sakura had decent fights and really good battle IQ in the movie. I hope i see more of this in shippuden. I really wish Sakura used that jutsu in the main series

The visuals and animation in Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow are one of the film’s standout elements, helping elevate the story and action to a cinematic level beyond what fans typically see in the weekly Naruto episodes. The character animation in Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow is a noticeable upgrade from the regular anime series, with more fluidity in motion and an increased level of detail. Facial expressions are finely tuned to capture emotions

Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi are also animated with precision, their fighting styles feeling distinct yet consistent with their characters. Naruto’s movements, for example, are animated with his characteristic recklessness and speed, creating dynamic, high-energy sequences, while Sasuke’s fighting is more calculated and precise, reflecting his cool-headed nature.

However, the movie does have its limitations. The supporting characters, such as Sasuke, Sakura, and even the antagonist Doto, could have been more fleshed out. While the movie focuses heavily on Naruto and Yukie, the lack of development for other key figures leaves some parts of the narrative feeling thin. Additionally, Doto’s motivations and backstory are fairly standard for a villain, which makes him feel somewhat one-dimensional. Despite these shortcomings, the movie's emotional core and the strength of its animation more than make up for any narrative gaps.


All in all, it was a fun watch. even though it's predictable, it gives that nostalgia and dopamine hit for naruto fans. if you haven't watched it, you can go ahead and watch it just for the fun of it."

Baki: Dai Raitaisai-hen directly continues off from the Netflix Baki season, where Baki is poisoned and Retsu has brought him to China to participate in the Great Rai Tai Tournament which only occurs every 100 years. It’s a pretty basic premise but an enjoyable one at that.

Keisuke Itagaki is great for coming up with the most over the top made-up martial arts which always sounds damn convincing. For some this may put them off from the absurd powers certain characters wield. Personally, it’s so over the top and it takes itself so seriously it's hard not to enjoy it. You can tell Itagaki-sensei puts in a lot of thought for the characters he creates. People argue that “oh Baki’s characters are bad because they have absurd martial arts techniques and they’re lazy and boring” I would say otherwise, no one but itagaki can come up with this out of the world of martial arts. 

However, where the story kinda felt boring at times was how they have this build-up on this epic-scale tournament which kinda falls flat for me. Don’t get me wrong, the fights were just as insane as they usually are but the tournament itself didn’t bear any weight to why they were all there fighting. Like the victors become the new Sea Emperor, which has no build-up or explanation to what they are. I know Itagaki could care less about this, because from the way he writes and creates characters, it’s safe to say he just wants to see a good beat down between these crazy characters he’s made.

The overarching narrative of Baki wanting to beat his dad is still very present but not nearly as prominent as the original Grappler Baki manga. That’s the one consistent thing in Baki, and I’m glad they haven’t forgotten that especially since the previous season, it wasn’t nearly as present.

All in all, the story is really just men fighting men to come out on top. It’s a basic premise with crazy characters and I sure as hell enjoyed it. If you’re looking for something deeper, this really isn’t it. Despite my score I know for a fact I enjoyed the hell out of it, I just wanted to be unbiased as much as possible. 



I personally like the art. Crazy over the top muscle with very unrealistic human physiques. The art is the type where either you love it or hate it. It doesn’t look traditionally anime. It’s Itagaki’s style and for me I always like mangkas with unique art styles. A standout in design is Muhammad Ali and Ali Jr. They capture the expressions that Ali is known for, just look at this:
img42%() img52%()
It might not look exactly the same but without a doubt did they capture Ali’s expressiveness and the most important part, the eyes. You definitely can tell it’s Ali by just the expression and look of the anime version’s eyes. I thought they nailed Ali in this one.

My problem with the art comes from the way characters dress, they’re really uninspiring and a lot of the time characters dress really similarly. There really isn’t any standout in clothing of the characters. Itagaki thrives in shirtless battles where his skill in overexaggerating the muscle anatomy. 

Another gripe I have, is the overuse of punch lines:
img()
used previous season footage to prevent spoilers
In the manga it works really well but when they bring that to anime it feels less impactful cause you don’t actually see the fist/kick connect. In certain scenes it works but in others it just feels less powerful.



Thank god they stopped using the PS2 CG. It really pulls me out of my immersion when I see street-fighters-looking-esque characters start throwing hands. It felt so bad and the action in general lost a lot of “oomph”. TMS Entertainment definitely learnt their lesson and played to their strengths of actually good action.

The animation in this way is really good but nothing too groundbreaking, for it failed in having clean straight action. I think there are too many cuts and action lines to express punches and speed. While it is not wrong or bad but personally I felt slightly let down and wished for more long takes and such.



Baki’s development in this arc felt like it had less screen time. But at the same time, I reckon Itakagi did it on purpose. He essentially developed Baki’s character through Muhammad Ali Jr.  I say this because we see a lot more of Junior rather than Baki, especially in the second half. In my honest opinion, I believe Itagaki did it on purpose to set up the killer Episode 12. Itagaki’s great at expectation subversion. Through the simplicity of the story and characters, there are certain plot elements I expected but were utterly thrown out the window and made for a pleasant surprise. I’ll further explain this in the spoiler tag below
!Baki not being really present in the second half kinda shows the disparity between himself and Junior. We see Junior try to really prove his strength by fighting opponents that are essentially stronger than Baki. Only to realize that he’s not that strong. Mainly because he is not able to cross that line. He strives to be the strongest without having to kill that in the Baki universe is impossible. He’s goal is already much weaker in comparison to those who will do anything to be strong but for Baki he does not want to be the strongest, he just wants to beat his father and it turns out that his father is literally the “Strongest Creature” on Earth. By detaching Baki from the main narrative do we see a more inhumane side of him in contrast to that of Junior’s. I thought that was simply splendid.! 

The Chinese Sea Kings in this arc didn’t feel too significant, even though they’re supposed to be the highlight of the entire arc. I felt that if you were to compare the Most Deadly Convicts to the Sea Kings, the convicts had some build up to them and had relatively cool backstories. While the Sea Kings were kinda like punching bags. They were strong, but they didn’t really impact the story that much, they were quite pathetic to be brutally honest. I still enjoyed the fights though, well choreographed and they had cool powers. 

In my opinion the savior to the Sea Kings was the Sea Emperor Kaku. His fight with Yujiro was pretty epic. Two opposites clash. Two ideals going against each other. He’s a wise but really brutal elderly man. He pulls off a lot of what people would refer to as “big brain”. He had a major impact in the story, particularly bringing two individuals together without us expecting it.



I personally thought the Voice acting was great. They all sounded how I expected them to. Except for Junior. I’m sure Soichiro Hoshi is a talented man, however everytime Junior spoke I just could not take it. He sounded so weird in my opinion. It’s one of those things where you dislike something but can’t really tell why. To me it just sounded weird and it always broke my suspension of disbelief. Akio Ootsuka obviously nailed Yujiro Hanma, he really brings out the tough, menacing beast Yujiro is. Probably my favorite VA performance in the entire of Baki. There really wasn’t anything that was too outstanding nor bad, they all sounded good.

I love the OP, the OP is an absolute banger, I’m listening to it as I write this review. My typing speed has increased, my adrenaline has shot up and I want to taste defeat. But in all seriousness Granrodeo nailed Baki’s new OP. It captures and escalates the hype of the show, it really gets me pumped before the start of the episode. But obviously if I was to compare this to Beastful, Beastful is still definitely better but 2 great phenomenal songs.

For me it fell at the ED. The ED doesn’t capture Baki and if I’m being really honest, I forgot how it sounded and had to listen to it again. It just doesn’t suit Baki. If it was a traditional sports anime it would work but this is Baki we’re talking about. It feels like a shounen song with Junior and Baki having a friendly rivalry, when in reality it’s nothing but. For me it was forgettable and not really a good song and even in the context of another shounen sports anime, it just does not feel all that great. 

The OSTs were pretty hype though I would like to point out that it isn’t utilized as much as the previous seasons. I felt like they were holding back in using the soundtrack. But it did feel amazing whenever it was on. No real qualms about it, really good soundtrack to get your blood pumping. 

Foley in this show was pretty mediocre, at times during bloody, gory, and literal bone-crushing scenes, it sounds so brutal and disgusting. Where in others it sounds like they really like the “wshhh” sound effect. I don’t know why I noticed that but I hear a lot of sharp sounds, which isn’t bad, but gets repetitive. Maybe adding variety to the type of sounds may help but overall pretty standard.



Honestly this is one of those shows where you either love it or hate it. It’s really up to the person watching whether they can appreciate the over the top nature of this show. For some it may feel really boring because the fights revolve a lot around made up martial arts. For me I thoroughly enjoyed it. There’s no deep meaning behind it, but it’s a show where you can appreciate the intense action and originality of how these characters fight. If you fancy a good fighting show, this is definitely for you.

11979,"Estou há vários dias pensando no que eu ia dizer aqui e sinto que nada parece concreto o suficiente. Sempre achei um pouco mais difícil para mim falar muito sobre algo que eu gosto.

Costumamos ser atingidos por uma melancolia muito grande ao se pensar num destino, ou mesmo em um propósito na nossa vida. Não dá pra saber se temos ou se é possível de alguma forma lutar contra essas coisas. Somos praticamente ""programados"" a pensar e existir de forma simples. Refletir, abstrair, calcular... Tudo isso são coisas que gastam muito tempo e energia de nós e, por isso, tendemos a simplificar tudo e escolhermos termos absolutos para essas coisas. A partir disso, é muito difícil, até mesmo para nós, pensarmos em uma vida sem propósito, na existência por ela mesma. Afinal, se não existe uma finalidade, para que estamos trilhando este caminho. Por que viver se a morte nada significa? 

Acho que a partir daí que surge a esperança. A força da nossa fé talvez seja o motor mental mais potente que temos... A força que temos para acreditar em alguém e transformarmos aquela pessoa em nosso propósito e nosso destino. Não sei dizer se isso é amor. Às vezes parece algo muito bonito muito poético, mas também existe uma injustiça muito grande em colocar o peso disso tudo em um semelhante seu. Não existe solução fácil. Muitos de nós já amam antes mesmo de saber o que isso significa. Não necessariamente um amor romântico, mas pais, parentes ou amigos. Sequer lembramos quando foi que começamos a amá-los, eles só estão lá quando nos damos conta.

E com tudo isso em mente, propósito, destino, esperança e amor, será que existe algo mais verdadeiro como demonstração do que se sacrificar por alguém?

É tão forte a Homura ter passado por, sei lá, dez vezes o último mês em que conheceu a Madoka unicamente para tentar realizar o desejo dela. Num mundo em que um pequeno e fofo serzinho é capaz de realizar qualquer desejo que você tenha porque isso beneficia a ele, a Homura precisa desafiar a própria estrutura das leis do universo e se condenar ao prejuízo eterno da rejeição e da solidão para realizar o desejo da pessoa que ama, e que nem está mais com ela. É muito mais fácil ajudar alguém em benefício próprio do que ser verdadeiramente altruísta. E é por isso que o destino da Madoka é imutável, ela é o ser humano mais empático que existe. Mesmo sendo o desejo dela não sofrer, ela ainda vai se sacrificar pelas pessoas que ama sem qualquer hesitação. Seja acaso ou seja obra do destino, duas pessoas que se amam tanto a ponto de se sacrificar uma pela outra jamais poderiam ficar juntas. Eu posso mudar de ideia no futuro, mas agora eu acho essa história tragicamente linda.

No fim, o mestre sempre esteve certo. Madoka é umas garotinhas mágicas, lésbicas, peladas e sofrendo."
97917,"A lot can happen in a night, a night where time moves so fast. 

For someone, it might just be a night of humiliation. For someone else, it could be a night that ended gloriously with your dreams come true. For many, it can be a night of adventure. Reality works in some contorted ways. This is further exemplified by the fantastic, reality-bending visuals employed by director Masaaki Yuasa and his team over at Science Saru. The visuals are chaotic, imaginative, and bursting with life everywhere. Everything moves wonderfully and the wonderful designs lend themselves over to both this and the ability to simply expand as they please. Flowers, hallucinations, flames spewing from blazing hot meals, everything is a sheer spectacle that is incredibly difficult to do justice towards.

Of equal spectacle is the narrative. Everything builds off of one another, from small comments in one’s past to events currently happening, and characters you might have not expected to be so reoccurring once their story seemed to have concluded. No matter how absurd, like a tornado blowing fish or a literal literature god who takes book tags and appears out of a book like a pop-up, everything from the first 3 acts pile into one another as one seemingly disconnected story arc weaves brilliantly into another and into the final act once the night has passed. Whereas many bad narratives have the complaint levied on them about how reality seems to bend to the whims of the narrative for no reason, here, that is a physical aspect of the film that brings everything into relevance in completely unexpected and equally glorious ways. It's an incredibly tight circuit of knots of love, alcohol, plays, betrayal, sickness, literature, and world views. 

The characters are all as lively as the visuals and bring the chaotic story to life with pinpoint precision. From the raven-haired main girl just strolling and taking challenges throughout the night with friends, to the coincidence-manipulating young, hopelessly romantic lad who takes each opportunity to seize his opportunity with beach task ahead, only for it to not pay off as intended until much later than he expected, we see all sorts of colorful characters tie into each other as time moves differently for everyone, sicknesses and a play are passed down to everyone, and we see both the joy of taking risks in the name of fun and love, and the idea of how everyone is connected in some way in any community. It is glorious to absorb, even if it moved at a daunting pace that matches how short the night is and how much time can really fly.

The music, composed by Michiru Oshima, is wild, carrying a sort of gung-ho attitude to it. It's a fairly good soundtrack, with some equally well-done musical songs for the play that takes center stage in the third act of the four act film. The only decisively weak part would be the ending credits theme, ""Kouya wo Aruke (荒野を歩け)"" by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION, which, while not bad, is a forgettable track with vocals that feel weak; it is arguably one of his weakest tracks.

Ultimately, this film is a bombastic joy that exemplifies the wonders in life, in one night and a day of aftermath. This film encourages you to not always dwell on how everything can go wrong and sometimes just take the leap of faith, and it encourages you to look back on not just your life, but on the small, fun adventures you take in a day or an evening. On that same vein, you should jump into this film head first and reminisce on its brilliance, messages, delivery of those messages, and its wonderful method to madness. And once you’re done, be sure to join me as we dance the dance of the sophists."
131019,"This was honestly amazing, enough to say that I watched it all in 2 days, except for the last episode, which for me doesnt happen often. 

The story follows Lev and Irina, Lev a human who dreams of going to space, and Irina, a vampire who also dreams of going to space. They both will do just about anything to achieve that dream. Irina is going to be the first “person” in space, putting Russia in the lead. She will set the example for the humans who will come after her, and Lev is going to prepare her to do just that.


Characters
The characters for me were amazing, although I think just about every character is amazing. Sure they were your normal characters that you see in just about every anime, but Lev, Irina and the rest just felt a bit different. They were very well expressed and a lot of the stuff that you expected to happen, didn't. Like you know normally… a girl falls and somehow the dude moves at the speed of light and catches her…and they're instantly in love? Well at least in my opinion that didn't happen at all here, which was quite surprising. So I would say that there was definitely effort put into them, to make them different from your normal character, but they didnt over-do it, which was good. 

Story
I liked the story quite a lot, the concept was really interesting and they did a job making it “come to life”. Space has always been quite an interesting thing for me, and I’ve always loved learning about it, so maybe I’m a bit biased. So while I would say there were some aspects they could have improved it was overall good. I was definitely expecting it to feel very rushed at the end, but luckily that didnt happen, and they did a good job keeping the pace of everything. I honestly especially liked the underlying romance, because while it wasnt a major theme, it was definitely there. And as the story progressed you could definitely see it playing a more prominent role but still not taking over the whole show which I thought was pretty nice. 

Music and Animation
The animation wasnt anything too special. I was definitely hoping for more since like its space and all. So I mean it didnt really ruin anything, but it wouldve been better if they had better animation. The music on the hand was definitely pretty good. The ED was amazing and definitely fit the anime. The OP was pretty good too, although it didnt compare to the ED. And the regular music was pretty good too and for the most part they did a good job matching it with whatever was happening.

Overall
Overall I liked it alot, and its definitely one of my favorites and I hope the manga and LNs whenever I read them turn out to be just as good. While it could have had improvements I feel like it still matched what I was expecting which wasnt that low of standards. So I would say that a story like this was definitely worth my time and I have no regret of watching it."
100749,"Mamoru Hosoda's fifth animated feature, Mirai, may seem a bit more small scale compared to his earlier movies such as  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,  Summer Wars, and  Wolf Children, but it's no less mesmerizing. To anyone unfamiliar with these aforementioned films, I do recommend them highly -- they're all magnificent movies, almost the equivalent of Hayao Miyazaki's work. Mirai isn't quite that, but it's the next best thing.

The film tells the story of a pampered little boy named Kun, used to his parents catering to him all the time. So much so that when he gets a new sister, Mirai (which means ""future""), his parents start neglecting him, and of course, he gets jealous. He behaves like any kid in his situation would. He throws tantrums, he bawls, he says nasty things, and at one point, even throws one of his toy trains at his sister. ""Your attitude stinks,"" says another character in the film, quite accurately.

At the peak of every outburst he flees into the garden where a tree is growing, at which point the scene changes to a different location where he meets members of his family when they were younger -- including the pet dog(!), as well as, most mysterious of all, his new sister as a teenager. These close encounters send Kun on flashback journeys where he must learn to be more appreciative and caring and stop acting like a spoiled brat. (In a way, this is sort of like ""A Christmas Carol"" for 4 year olds, but not feeling ""dumbed down"" in the least.)

Hosoda handles this story with just the right touch of tangibleness as well as his occasional trademark moments of surrealism. However badly Kun behaves, he remains a very relatable character throughout -- in fact this might be the most realistic portrayal of any such boy I've ever seen in any animated feature. And of course, the animation, as mentioned, is nothing short of gorgeous, complete with a mix of CGI and hand-painted backgrounds -- a rarity in animated films these days... even in Japan. (Hosoda laments how rare this style of background art is becoming and is quite vocal for its support, and rightly so.)

MIRAI is also a surprisingly funny film -- one scene in which Kun and two new friends of his have to put away some dolls without Dad in the room suspecting in particular is hilarious. There's even a brief episode in which Kun tries to ride a bike for the first time -- without training wheels! The results go as well as you'd expect, resulting in yet another outburst as well as a visitation, after which he gets a second chance. There's even a frightening climax at a train station, although I dare not reveal more about it at the risk of spoiling the story.

If you're a fan of Japanese animated features and Hosoda's work in general, Mirai should be a great one to check out. It's accessible to children and adults, and easily superior to many other Western animated features released in 2018, notably the over-bloated Ralph Breaks The Internet.  It deserved its Oscar nomination.

Adding to an already great movie is an even better dub provided by the folks at NYAV Post, with top notch directing by the always reliable Mike Sinterniklaas and script adaptation by the similarly talented Stephanie Sheh. This dub, like the similarly grand Disney-Gkids-Ghibli dubs, features a cast of noteworthy names such as John Cho, Rebecca Davis, and Daniel Day Kim. Surprisingly, too, Crispin Freeman -- yes, that Crispin Freeman(!) -- has a brief cameo, and it's always a pleasure to hear him. The real triumph of the dub is, as per usual in a NYAV Post, the casting of the kids. Young Jaden Waldman does an absolutely excellent job at rendering Kun, effectively conveying his mood swings and giving him a lot of appeal in spite of this character's sometimes unlikable personality. (Only issue is that he screams a bit too much, but on the other hand, it makes sense considering the circumstances.) I've always appreciated hearing children voice children -- as evidenced in my praise of the dub for ""Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water"", and it's a pleasure to see that there are dubs doing this practice today, Mirai being one of them. The lipsync is also spot on with well timed and written dialogue -- a difficult task for any scriptwriter, but it's done well here.

Mirai marks yet another glorious achievement for Hosoda, all the more so because he bases it on a personal story. It's often been said that some of the more inspiring features sing best when the writers write from their own experiences. This is no exception. I look forward to seeing what this director does next."

My mouth’s watering just looking at it

Bentou no Gokui (literally Bento Battle) is an unaired episode of Toradora. It’s mostly a fluff episode; Kitamura brings an extravagant bento box made by his grandmother. Seeing this ludicrously lavish lunch makes Ryuuji feel inferior, so he retaliates by trying to best Kitamura’s grandmother’s cooking.

I watched Toradora on via its Blu-Ray, so I naturally watched Bentou no Gokui after I had finished the series proper.

And let me tell you, don’t skip out on Bentou no Gokui despite it being an OVA with little-to-no bearing on the plot. It's good stuff. It’s actually better than the series as a whole.

Okay, okay, hear me out before scrolling away. If you read my review, you’ll know that my biggest gripe from the series came from the beginning. Without this difference in quality to bog my perception of it down,  Bentou no Gokui is optimal Toradora! The characters were all pretty funny and Ryuuji was surprisingly deep despite this being a fun little episode about cooking. Taiga wasn't an annoying tsundere in this episode, thus lifting the barrier to entry for the early episodes for me. While my favroite episodes of Toradora! were the dramatic ones toward the end, I loved this one as well

Honestly, it’s the perfect episode of the “comedy” side of the romantic-comedy Toradora! The animation and facial expressions helped convey the comedy and the absurdity of Ryuuji’s “rivalry” was a riot. I consistently laughed throughout the episode. I can’t recall any other episode of Toradora! that had this effect on me. For this reason, I consider it the funniest episode in the show. Despite this focus on comedy, it’s still sweet, too. The romance is wonderfully apparent and it made me feel warm inside. Bentou no Gokui was the perfect blend of comedy and romance. While it wasn’t the most romantic episode, it’s romantic enough to be good. The episode, tonally, could fit well in the middle of the series, prior to the School Festival Arc.The music was superb as always.

The perfect OVA if you’re a fan of Toradora! and can’t get enough. Honestly, I think it’s pretty good for newcomers as well. I didn’t see anything too spoiler-y, and it’s honestly a better exposure to the series than the first episode is, in some ways.

8.5/10

172258,"Background, to give you a perspective:

I have caught up with the manga before season 2 was beginning its airing.

I Really Really Really Really Really (pun not intended) love this series to death ever since season 1, and when this season was announced, I was SO EXCITED, considering the fact that my friends kept on reminding me just how much this season will have in terms of PEAK.

One Last Warning: This Review MIGHT include Spoilers.

Animation: img20()

THE FUCKING GALL of the animators dude, you have to understand whatever the shit that happens in this series, almost every ecchi scene is left uncut, long, and uncensored, and even some unintentional ones are put in the mix, WHAT ELSE YOU POSSIBLY WANT? (obviously not gonna show them but you get what i mean)

in all seriousness though, the animation in general is so spectacularly made, every scene just looks so damn beautiful, and it differentiates the girlfriends more than enough to not make them feel ""samey"", and honestly, still my opinion the best part of this whole series. 
img1000()

Characters: img20()

Before talking about the newer characters, i want to talk about the existing ones, only some select ones (Summary on how i feel on the characters are on a tier list).

THE SPEECH IS NOW ANIMATED! WAHOO!

Karane Inda.

She's notable due to the ""Tsundere Lost"" arc, and it's honestly by far the best part of her character, since she really wants to show every emotion she has for Rentarou, but couldn't quite confidently show it without the constant hostile (in a good and funny way) mask that she has to have at every waking moment, and to see the entire Family trying their HARDEST to make her return to what she is normally is so addicting. 

[The concept of removing a character trait that makes a char special is honestly such an amazing idea and always executed well in my eyes](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/CantoVII:TheDreamEnding), and this is no exception.
img1000()

Final one is Shizuka.

the Karaoke part (Episode 7 First Half) shows Shizuka being confident, for the very first time, in a while, she express her joy and love in her OWN VOICE, and the voice actor for her sang AMAZINGLY.

So cute in fact, that it literally causes everyone to go INSANE. 
img1000()

Enough of the old characters for now, let's talk about the newer ones added in the cast, starting with Kurumi Haraga. 

She is very hungry and has a complete craving for every single pack of food she sees, not the most unique but still extremely charming in her own right, her sheer nearly bottomless stomach has been shown in the most extreme of tournaments (At episode 2, that is). 

My personal thoughts are quite simple: I wish i could eat as much as her, and a lot different food than her, again, still quite enjoyable in every moment she's in.
img1000()

Next up IS SURPRISINGLY, Mei Meido.


A completely loyal and (not blind) Maid, used to serve Hahari, who was (i believe) her master, with a VERY tragic backstory that makes her all the more memorable, and just look at her goddamn eyes. 

img1000()
this gets me every single time. 

Rentarou's process of trying so hard to make her NOT obedient always give me chills. 

Next is in my opinion, one of the best characters in this season, Iku Sutou.


Voiced by the majestic Rie Takahashi, she's a very stoic, and masochistic girl, the VERY definition of ""No Pain, No Gain"", and she has a firm belief of that statement UNTIL THE BITTER END. I really like this character and it's just because of her sheer determination to moving on even if it's very painful, it's like she's LIMITLESS for pain 

Her intro is my favorite one (my friends are synonymous for saying ""Iku Head"" because of the fucking camera angle faces Iku from behind when she massage's Rentarou's legs, AND I COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING EVER SINCE)

I still have dreams about Iku Head to this day, wonderful character, and she's my main inspiration to do sports (even if it's just a little bit)
Her being aroused over Rentarou having another girl (Nano) is her only bad quality, but it only happened once so it doesn't matter that much. 

img1000()


THE MAJESTIC, GOREGOUS, AND RULING GODDESS OF BEAUTY HERSELF!, MIMIMI UTSUKISHISUGI!


Another favorite of mine, the way she makes her beauty become the Way of Life for her is always so damn... shall i say, NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL!, and her initial conflict with Nano (Nano doesn't give a shit THE ENTIRETY of it) is so comedic and wonderfully executed.

She is always flexing and is completely narcissistic and that's the best part of her, SHE'S SOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE!, the sheer beauty combined with her voice just OH MY!, makes my heart throb. Her fucking aura/glow from just here mere presence is one of a kind and she ALWAYS stand out before anyone else. 

2nd favorite of this season/batch of girlfriends and deserves that spot more than any other.

img1000()

And a complete contrast to the overly confident, Kakure Meme. 

A different kind of Shy, one to make her look completely different than Shizuka despite sharing the same concept, she is a sewer, but also runs away in any engagement, even when it's just one other person in her vicinity, her constant hide and seek games are still so extremely exciting to see unfold, and even when she KISSES Rentarou.

Some people may call it ""running out of ideas"", but i personally call it ""A different change of pace"" when it comes to her.
img1000()


TL;DR Summary of my thoughts on the new gfs on a tier list. 

img1000()


Story: img20()

Good story, INSANELY fast pacing, and a lot of funny moments happening, that's about all.

The world surrounding Rentarou and the School is while enclosed, still full of life.

Every single random anime reference got me shedding in tears LOL.

Overall thoughts

GO FUCKING WATCH IT!, ISN'T IT TOO OBVIOUS? there are so much to like about this series, if you want good characters you'll find it, want a good harem, you'll also find it too.

Near, perfection."
101,"(English is my 3rd language so ignore the obvious mistakes I make while writing)

Air was a well thought out anime, which had a lot of potential under its sleeve, but the hopes of it becoming a great series were shattered brutally.

In no ways was watching Air a waste of time, infact if you are looking for metaphoric poetic anime based on raw human emotions, then air is definitely worthwhile. The dialogue in this show is damn good as well, and each word uttered has some kind of deep meaning to it. Air although is a clearly messed up and infuriating show at times, it does have lot of redeeming qualities. The characters are well made,even if they are kinda generic, the animation is stellar, and the summer blues and raw emotions humans feel are portrayed really well, throughout the majority of the episodes. Again I'm not saying the characters received whole lotta development, but they felt lively and real to me.

Also air's overall premise is quite great as well,since it tells the importance of family and relationships.
BUT now lets focus onto the negatives:
1. Air's Story is too vague to be conceivable and the audience is left confused, since they can't really grasp the overall story and plot of the series. The story is so confusing that it took me like an eternity to get the fact that our MC was ill.
2. The Characters in Air and their respectable Arcs, aren't shown the way they should've been and after exploring the story of the side characters, they just vanish in thin air not to appear again. The anime started of really great and charismatic and it lasted the way for the first six episodes after that it went downhill and our major protagonist was downgraded to a goddamn crow.. yes a crow!
3. Although air is vivid and surreal, and its quite unique in its concept.. at the end of the day, its a sob story, which appeals to a certain demographic.
4. The end is simply frustrating, and one episode towards the end was a recap. I guess, the producers would've just added an extra episode.


ALL IN all, Air is an ambitious peice of art, which couldn't hold up to the viewers expectations, its aesthethically great and serene, but the story is too confusing and it has a lot of inconceivable subtle details scattered throughout its episodes which never get a proper explanation. The characters are great, but their stories are severely mishandled and most of them are fillers. And the other half is not properly written and rushed; contradictory to its first half. If they would've extended this series, explained the plot neatly and if the characters wouldn't have been downgraded (also if the end wasn't annoying af) then this anime would've been great.

MY OVERALL SCORE- 6.5/10
Enjoyment Level- 1st Half - 7.5/10, 2nd Half 5/10"
20635,"In previous reviews for Dragon Ball Z and the first season of Dragon Ball Z Kai, I mostly talked about how much I love the series. But I was also willing to look past the nostalgia and criticize the parts that I think some Dragon Ball Z fans hype up a little too much—especially in sagas like Frieza’s and, even more so, Cell’s.

For this review, I want to go over a saga that’s widely considered the worst in all of Dragon Ball Z—possibly even the worst in the original manga—the Buu Saga. I won’t deny that this arc has flaws. This was the point where it became painfully obvious that if you weren’t a Saiyan, you weren’t going to be useful. Toriyama didn’t even attempt to make non-Saiyan characters relevant. Even Piccolo was relegated to being a temporary mentor.

That said, I think some of the early Dragon Ball Z arcs are put on a pedestal a little too much, while the Buu Saga, at least to me, gets way too much undeserved hate. The Buu Saga is still enjoyable and important—not just because the Dragon Ball series needed a proper ending back in the ’90s, but also because of its influence on other shonen series and even future Dragon Ball content.

One thing I want to praise right off the bat is what I like to call a tone correction. Starting with the King Piccolo Saga, Toriyama shifted Dragon Ball into a more serious direction. This led to some of the most memorable fights, deaths, and character development in the series. But by the time the Cell Saga came around, I was getting sick of every villain just being ""the strongest being in the universe"" or ""wanting to take over the world."" There are only so many times you can do this before it gets old.

Thankfully, the Majin Buu Saga broke that cycle. As the series got more serious, it felt like Toriyama strayed from his original vision—Dragon Ball started as a gag manga. While Dragon Ball Z had some amazing fights, I found myself missing the fun and comedy when doing a full rewatch. The Buu Saga managed to mix the serious tone of DBZ with the goofy humor and magic elements of classic Dragon Ball.

I also think Buu’s origin makes way more sense than the random androids in the Cell Saga. The idea that Majin Buu is a super-powerful villain who has existed for millennia feels a lot more natural than ""Dr. Gero made some robots that somehow surpass Super Saiyans.""

Now, I’ll admit Buu having like five different forms was a bit overkill. But unlike the Cell Saga, where villains kept getting swapped out, Majin Buu remained the main antagonist the entire time. And at least in my opinion, the justification for his changing forms made more sense in the plot—even if it was obvious that Toriyama was figuring out Buu’s final design as he went.

Unfortunately, a lot of secondary characters like Piccolo, Krillin, and Yamcha were completely sidelined. The only exception was Mr. Satan, who surprisingly became an emotional buffer for the good version of Buu. But despite that, the Buu Saga had some of the most important character development in the entire series.

The most obvious example is Gohan. I’ll admit it’s disappointing that he didn’t get the final kill like Toriyama originally planned. But even back in the Cell Saga, it felt like Toriyama was forgetting that Gohan started off hating fighting and only kept going because bad guys wouldn’t stop showing up. If anything, the almost decade-long time skip between Cell and Buu, with Gohan getting “lazy,” makes perfect sense. He got rusty. Looking back, him regaining his power through an old Kai unlocking it was convenient, but at least 24 hours of non-stop meditation and dealing with weirdness gave him some effort to put in.

Vegeta, though? Hands down the best character development in the entire series. He got a little bit of it at the end of the Cell Saga, but for most of DBZ, he was just an unlikable jerk with a few cool moments. The Buu Saga showed him having a midlife crisis, starting off chill, then regressing, and then ultimately getting the best redemption arc. And I still think the way he helped end Buu was one of the coolest villain defeats in all of Dragon Ball.

But the biggest surprise? The fact that Fat Buu and Mr. Satan of all people got character development. This was a huge subversion—Dragon Ball hadn’t given a villain meaningful development since Vegeta, and even that happened by accident. With Majin Buu, it was clearly planned from the start. And Mr. Satan? The annoying joke character from the Cell Saga actually became likable. His arrogance was played for good instead of just being obnoxious.

The Buu Saga also introduced a ton of major concepts—fusion (both Potara and Fusion Dance), Super Saiyan 3, and even little kids turning Super Saiyan. Yeah, Super Saiyan 3 became kind of a joke in later series, but at the time, you could tell Toriyama wanted it to be a high-risk, high-reward form. And while fusion rarely actually defeats the bad guys, there’s a reason it’s still used in every single piece of Dragon Ball media. It’s just that cool.

And finally—after being hyped up for so long—the Spirit Bomb actually worked as the finishing move. It was so cathartic to see an old ability that should have been a game-changer actually function the way it was supposed to.

Now, as much as I love this saga, I can admit the flaws.

Gohan’s power-up was great, but his character arc was inconsistent and clearly rewritten on the fly. The high school segments were fun, but they dragged on longer than necessary and probably felt weird for fans used to Goku’s adventures.

Majin Buu constantly changing forms was fun, but it also felt like Toriyama was struggling to finalize his design—just like with Cell. And even he couldn’t keep track of which version of Buu was supposed to be the strongest, so you really had to pay attention. His regeneration powers were also way too OP. It was clearly just a way to drag out the saga because, realistically, with how strong the characters were, this arc could have been much shorter if Buu wasn’t regenerating every five seconds.

Like I mentioned earlier, Toriyama didn’t even try to make non-Saiyan characters relevant anymore. And while I personally don’t mind Gotenks and even find him amusing, I get why people were annoyed that two little kids were one of the main forces against the final villain—especially when we’d spent years watching serious, experienced fighters take on these threats.

There was also a ton of wasted potential—like Dabura and the whole Demon Realm, which it took decades for Dragon Ball to finally explore in Daima.

I haven’t talked much about the Kai version of the Buu Saga because, honestly, there’s not much to say. By the time Buu originally aired, there wasn’t much filler outside the high school arc. Kai trimmed that down, which made it a little less annoying for people (including me) who just wanted to get to the tournament.

At the end of the day, though, I think the Buu Saga is incredibly overhated. Sure, there were ideas that could have been refined, and a few characters definitely deserved better treatment. But the number of important concepts it introduced, the nonstop entertainment, the amazing character development, and the most satisfying final villain defeat in the series?

I don’t know—I just think the Buu Saga at least stands on par with the rest of DBZ. And for me? It might just be the best."
5300,"I watch SoL Anime for comfort and relaxation. Seeing a bunch of happy characters being happy in a rather laid back setting, makes me happy but whenever I finish any SoL, I always feel a bit empty. A realization occurs that everything I've watched & experienced so far is just a temporary feeling that'll fade away sooner or later. That's because many of these SoLs never had a long-lasting impression on me. They may have an original concept, they may have some well written characters, they may have or do something that I might love to appreciate, but many of them didn't convey anything that touched my soul. But among those very few titles that did, [Natsume's Book of Friends](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsumes-Book-of-Friends/) is one such favourite of mine.

Upon my [first introduction](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsumes-Book-of-Friends) to the series, I thought it was a great Iyashikei. It has all the right elements to make for a relaxing watch. A rural setting, a kind protagonist solving troubles of both humans & demons, cute mascot cat, fairly well written characters and an episodic storytelling well managed with its cozy art style, beautiful backgrounds and soothing OSTs, but that's just it. It was good and great but nothing really special. Very little consideration was given to the character development and the overreaching plot/main mystery of ""Yuujinchou"" moves at a snail pace. But what's really special about this to me is what the series always encapsulates.

Everyone has their moments of highs & lows in life and sometimes, we just wish for someone to be there; someone who cares for us. Every episodic story in every season of Natsume always highlights this warmth in interacting with someone who cares for you, and that's what is truly special about this show. It shows Natsume growing out of his anti-social, self hate personality triggered by his parents death and being labeled as a weird kid, into a kind & open hearted person who starts to accept himself and others into his life.
And I like to say that I love the sound element very much. I really like the soothing melodies in their calm and heartwarming moments, or it's more intense or dramatic moments, but what I really love about the series are the Ending Songs.


Aishiteru
youtube(https://youtu.be/N2iMEuegc98)

I always listen to these ending songs after completing each season and while I usually avoid exaggerating but I've never heard such a heartwarming song as ED2, and the fact that the song is titled Aishiteru - ""I Love You"" just fills me with so much joy. Many thanks to all the staff who worked on and keep working on such a lovely show.

A personal favorite which reminds me of people who care for me and that I have to treasure them.

As of me publishing this, it has been exactly 8 years since the release of Space Patrol Luluco, on April 1st 2016, and at least 2 and a half years since I started writing my first draft of this review. Despite the date, I’m not joking when I say that this is my favorite anime.

To put in perspective how much it stuck with me, I had a lot of fun by searching and reading as much as I could find about the anime: episode discussions on different platforms; interviews with the staff, from almost a decade ago to this day; Trigger’s Q&A sessions, [Tattun](https://anilist.co/staff/136901/Tatsuru-Tatemoto)’s posts on 4chan; and every interesting trivia I could find on random blogs and forums, and at this point I wasn’t even thinking about my review yet. Once I decided to write about SPL, I still spent a lot of time (re)reading everything, not just to take notes, but also because I was still having fun with my “research”. 

Due to some recent happenings irl I rediscovered my old drafts, so I went back to this review that I still had as private since November 1st, 2021. This time I tried my best to rewrite and reorganize my thoughts, while also including more info I found recently (like a summary of the anime’s audio drama, more on that later). There are still some parts I want to polish, and I’ll keep updating this when I can, but after all this time I’m mostly fine with what I wrote. Let me warn you though, rather than an objective and proper review, this is the story of my own search for my Ogikubo, an attempt to understand and explain why I love this short anime so much.
- - -
Intro
Space Patrol Luluco is a short series (13 episodes, each of them 7 minutes long) made to celebrate Studio Trigger's 5th anniversary.
This show is not only a love letter to the studio's history and projects, but also a ""thank you"" to every fan of their anime. 
It’a story about first love, what it means to be normal, and anime itself (with a bonus dose of JUSTICE!); that offers interesting insights into the staff’s thoughts and “philosophy” with its unexpected yet heartfelt message.

While I wanted to keep this review mostly spoiler-free, that would make talking about the message of SPL impossible, so if you don't want any previous knowledge about the show I'd suggest to either read only this section, the general thoughts and the TL;DR at the end, or simply go in blind and then come back.
In fact, as much as I love this show, this isn't something that I'd blindly recommend to everyone.

Due to the huge amount of cameos and self-referential humor, one of the main points of criticism towards this short is that it's essentially a glorified Trigger advertisement. While I understand where this comes from, I have to disagree for a few reasons:

First, according to both the Trigger panel at Anime Expo 2016 and a [short Crunchyroll interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl2RwW9Iys) with the creative director [Hiromi Wakabayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/107673/Hiromi-Wakabayashi), director and studio founder [Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/Hiroyuki-Imaishi) wanted to do a ""comedic short anime with a sci-fi theme and a family-oriented story"" even before Kill la Kill, and so when the studio had the chance to make a short anime, he insisted on doing Luluco (to the point of “throwing a tantrum”). This means that at least to some degree the core idea for Luluco was already there, while the cameos were thought of and added in a later moment, and I also believe their inclusion fits perfectly with one of the main themes of this short (but more on that later). 
 
Second, Space Patrol Luluco is not meant as an introduction to studio Trigger, but as a celebration of all their previous works, from their first one  that saved anime [Inferno Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/16774/Inferno-Cop/) to the at the time airing [Kiznavier](https://anilist.co/anime/21421/Kiznaiver/), and everything in between, even stuff like their shorts for [Japan Anima(tor)’s Exhibition](https://anilist.co/anime/20947/Japan-Animators-Exhibition/) or the [Trigger Girls announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20150709080718/http://www.st-trigger.co.jp:80/news/20150401.html) later confirmed to be [an april fools joke](https://twitter.com/triggerinc/status/583587553145556993). Given how the studio was founded by ex-Gainax employees, there are also plenty of nods and subtle (not really) references to the older anime they worked on.
Of course, there's more to SPL than the sum of its references, but again, I'll talk about that later.
 
To put it simply, if you are already a fan of Trigger's works, you are part of the target audience, and this is a must watch you'll probably appreciate SPL too.
However, this also means that if you tried to get into their anime but ended up disliking them, you (probably) won't like this either.
And finally, if you've never watched anything from Trigger, this is probably not the best place to start, since you won't be able to fully enjoy the various references and cameos and the reason for their inclusion.  
Here's a list of other animes referenced to various degree in SPL that I recognized, some of which are plot-relevant:
 
!
Previous Gainax works like [Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Gurren-Lagann/), [Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/Gunbuster/) and its sequel [Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/Gunbuster-2-Diebuster/), [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/), [Panty and Stocking](https://anilist.co/anime/8795/Panty--Stocking-with-Garterbelt/) (mainly for the artstyle, but also for a sequel(?), more on that in the last section) and [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion/);
 
Previous Trigger works, including KLK, Inferno Cop, LWA, Sex and Violence with Machspeed, Ninja Slayer from Animation and Kiznavier.
 
There are probably other references that I missed, if you know some please tell me and I'll add them.

 General thoughts


youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjADMUDl7Pw)
Kor - Space Patrol Luluco is literally perfect, and here's why
> Luluco is a gem, and precious, and I love her, she's the best...
And Luluco the series is a gem, and precious, and I love it, and it's the best.


This anime is divided into “seasons” made of 3 episodes each plus the finale, you can think of them as mini-arcs that lead into each other.
I haven’t been able to find a reason for this split, except for a fan theory that I really love and will accept as real: both Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill had some noticeable animation problems during their 4th episode, and after initial complaints it became sort of a meme to joke about for fans of the shows. So, how does SPL avoid repeating this? By getting rid of its 4th episode.
It's genius, and given how the studio seems to interact with its fandom, I wouldn’t be surprised if they knew about the joke and responded in this way.
 
That said, in this review I'll follow the different seasons, briefly talking about the elements introduced by each of them, without focusing too much on the actual plot of the show for the first half. Major spoilers are tagged (mostly stuff from S3 onwards), but there are minor spoilers all over the place.

Talking briefly about the visuals, the anime has a simple yet colorful cartoony artstyle, similar to P&SG, that often lends itself to exaggerated reactions, or to be adapted to fit other styles to make a reference.
img49%() img49%()
img49%() img49%()

The animation is somehow both limited and frenetic, working perfectly to enhance the various jokes and visual gags. And while the fast and chaotic pacing of the anime is one of its biggest strengths, allowing it to fit a surprising amount of information in every episode despite their short length; SPL knows when to slow down too, giving the characters and their interactions the time they need. Of course, there are also genuinely well animated cuts everywhere, like transformations and explosions, or the more important scenes towards the end.
img66%()

The OST may not be that memorable outside the anime, but that’s not really a flaw since it’s due to the anime’s short nature. The tracks themselves, in fact, are perfect fits for their respective characters and the scenes they’re in. For example, Luluco's theme encapsulates her childlike innocence, while Nova's theme represents his alien and mysterious nature.
The OP and ED songs deserve a special mention, because they are perfect for this show: [CRY MAX Do-Heijitsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXBF9cSnYT4) by Fujirokyu is fun, wacky and energetic, and the use of different parts of the song for the different seasons adds both a sense of progression and another level of chaos. It’s the kind of song that makes you want to scream it loud while you sing it, as you can hear both [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vspnSRGhA4) and especially [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNw-HpNABTg).
[Pipo Password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa0Jt1jh6I) by Teddyloid and Bonjour Suzuki is the complete opposite, being a calm and peaceful song that reflects the innocent and wonderful feelings of Luluco’s crush for Nova. It also works as an amazing insert song for certain romantic scenes, and the same can be said for its louder and hype-inducing [Silent Planet remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r6-segWaSk) that plays in S4E3. 
- - -
 
First Season

The anime starts with Luluco presenting herself to the audience: she's an average, ordinary middle school girl who simply wants to enjoy a normal life. However, this is harder than it seems, because she lives in Ogikubo, a city that Japan had to sell to help its debt and thus became a space immigration zone, where humans and all kinds of aliens live together.
Her father Keiji is a talented officer of the Space Patrol, a police force who fights every form of space crime. He really cares about Luluco and does his best to ensure she lives a normal life, despite their abnormal circumstances.
 
After something happens to her father, Luluco panics and brings him to the Space Patrol office, both to report for work and to ask them for help. We then meet Tengen Toppa Inferno Cop Chief Over Justice, the commander of the Ogikubo Space Patrol branch, and his (silent) secretary.
After a fun exchange between Luluco and Chief Over Justice, he asks her to work for the Space Police to pay for her father's treatment and gives her a space patrol suit.

Best flaming skeleton guy after Inferno Cop. JUSTICE! 
 
It's already evident how much Luluco cares for following the rules and not standing out. As she says, ""normal is best"". Of course, her wish for normalcy is short-lived, ended by her auto-mode suit starting a transformation sequence in the middle of her midterm exams. And if that wasn't enough, !her suit forces her to undergo a new embarrassing yet hilarious transformation, the Judgement Gun Morphing, in order to stop a fellow classmate who's space-cheating the exam. The consequent explosion destroys both her classroom and her normal life, and then the episode ends.!
 
The next two episodes complete the main cast by introducing two new members for the Ogikubo branch: AΩ Nova, a mysterious transfer student from space; and “Save the World” Midori, a classmate of Luluco who is secretly the boss of a space-shoplifting gang.
Nova quickly becomes Luluco’s first crush, due to his pretty looks and his mature and competent behavior.
Midori is more of a supporting character, with her being smug, selfish and always ready for a snarky remark.
Another small yet fun bit of characterization comes from their transformations: Nova smiles calmly during his cool sequence, having the situation under control in a complete contrast with Luluco; while Midori transforms in a simple and lazy way, as she doesn’t really care about the space police stuff, but she still keeps her trademark smug smile. 

And going back to Luluco, these episodes give us two important pieces of information: 
!First, she is the one who wants to be normal. Aside from her father, there’s no external pressure for her to be normal, and even he is never portrayed as strict and/or overbearing towards her, despite him being overprotective. This self-inflicted problem is the center of Luluco’s character, as from the first episode alone we see that she can’t handle abnormal situations: she either panics and makes things worse (breaking her father when he gets frozen) or tries to ignore the problem, which can also backfire (bringing her frozen dad to report for work first, or going to school after enrolling in the Space Patrol). Of course, this also reflects on her first crush on Nova and how it develops, with Luluco often failing to act on her feelings throughout the show.
Second, despite her obsession with being normal, Luluco is actually fine in the abnormal Ogikubo. Not only is she friends with her alien classmates, but as we see from her walk in town with Nova in S1E2, she doesn’t find the town strange, nor the fact that humans and aliens are living together. She even admits she can’t tell who’s an alien and who isn’t, which Nova finds amusing.!

- - -
Second Season
 
Once characters and setting are established, we get the Ogikubo branch’s first actual space mission. After some Armageddon references, it’s time for the introduction of the antagonist of this new arc, who sets things in motion for both the plot of the show and Luluco's character development: !Luluco's mother, the Space Pirate Lalaco Godspeed.!
 
img225()
Fun fact, her cape is made out of life fibers.
 
Her arrival is soon followed by a flashback sequence in S2E2, that explains why Luluco is so ""obsessed"" by the idea of being normal: ! when she was younger, her parents often got into fights, until Lalaco left her and Keiji after a shootout. We never get the full context, as we can't hear what Lalaco was saying before leaving, but it's clear that Luluco's wish for normalcy comes as a result of her family's situation and her mother's refusal to ""talk things normally"".
Now, if only there were some additional material about Lalaco's past... oh well, more on that later, as the flashback is to be continued! !

In her obsession for freedom and complete disregard for laws, rules, and JUSTICE!, she represents the exact opposite of the normalcy Luluco desires. This is the first time someone directly confronts and rejects her wish, and said confrontation quickly turns physical, as the Space Pirates attack.
 
We then get one of the most hilarious fights ever, with references to Kill la Kill, Inferno Cop, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Ninja Slayer from Animation all condensed in a minute and half of awesome absurdity.
 
img550(
Domo hajimemashite, Space Pirate Waifu desu.

When the fight ends !in a draw!, the Space Pirates are able to space-shoplift the entire city of Ogikubo, putting it on sale for some sort of space-ebay, and proceed to also kidnap the still frozen Keiji, since he’s the only one who could stop their plan. 

Luluco intervenes, !trying to save her father and stop her mother, but Lalaco is disappointed by her getting in her way and desiring to stay normal. She tries to attack her, but Nova blocks her punch, which in turn makes Luluco’s crush even bigger.!

In the next episode, the Space Patrol manages to partially awaken Keiji, and with his help they are able to reach the pirates ship. In the consequent fight for Ogikubo, however, space itself gets distorted, sending them to some random point in the universe.
- - -
Third Season
 
After the events of S2, the Space Patrol has to travel the universe in search of Ogikubo. And here comes the first big spoiler:
 
!
As the Ogikubo branch visits various planets based on Trigger’s previous works, it is confirmed that all of their original anime share the same universe.
!
 
This is the perfect setup for the comedy antics we see in these three episodes:
 
!
We have the Thread-Ball planet KLK-X in the first episode, which is completely made out of life fibers. The entire episode perfectly adopts the KLK style, from the huge, red text walls that appear in front of the characters, to the glorious [Don't Lose Your Way]() that starts playing as the cast defeats the villain.
 
Then we have Magic Planet LWA-∞, which is the setting of the Little Witch Academia anime (it's worth noting that when SPL came out, there were only LWA's pilot episode and the movie). Here Luluco and Nova have a fun (and dangerous) encounter with [Sucy](https://anilist.co/character/81699/Sucy-Manbavaran).
 
At last, we have Badger Planet SVM-Z, which is based on Sex and Violence with Machspeed, a stand-alone episode made for [Japan Anima(tor)’s Exhibition](https://anilist.co/anime/20947/Japan-Animators-Exhibition/), which makes it one of the most unknown Trigger works.
!
 
The third season is definitely the densest and least subtle in terms of cameos, and thus many argue it is also the weakest story-wise. The references become a central point of this season, and it’s understandable that it can be too much for some of the viewers. However, this does not mean that there is no substance to this small arc, nor that the self-referencial fanservice takes the place of the character arcs and themes of the anime.

In fact, while all of these references keep popping up, Luluco's character arc continues to develop.

In S3E1, Luluco completely ignores the villain-of-the-day's monologue while she worries about who Nova could be seeing in his vision. Towards the end of the episode there's also another little scene between Nova and Luluco, where he talks about how the villain might've been motivated by loneliness, and how ""the hunger in his heart could only be satisfied by love"" (foreshadowing?).
The next episode starts off with Luluco trying her best to strike a conversation with Nova and then worrying about what could happen if Nova was found by some other girl during this mission. After a certain misunderstanding I won't spoil, Luluco is still thinking about what's ""normal"", and so she asks Nova for an important favor, that as we can see means the universe for her. However, Nova still ""doesn't mind either way"", and even if he complies with her wish, he brushes her off afterwards.
In S3E3, Luluco goes on a mission on her own and, after asking about Ogikubo, she openly talks about her love troubles and asks for help despite her embarrassment, which is very different from her attitude at the start of the series. After a big incident happens Nova comes to save Luluco again, and this makes her fall in love even more.
 
The last episode of the season also seemingly brings to an end the search for Ogikubo, as while Luluco was on her mission the others were able to locate the city, which somehow ended up at the Space Patrol Galaxy Command HeadQuarters. 
Once they arrive, they are surprised to find a huge amount of personal Ogikubos, but there is no time to question it, as they are approached by the Space Patrol Commander-in-Chief. He congratulates everyone for their effort to protect the city, and gives a reward to each one of them.
The season then ends on a happy note, with a group photo of the Ogikubo branch celebrating and Luluco hoping to finally go back to normal... Right?

- - -
Fourth Season
Now, if this anime ended with the third season, I would have probably rated it around an 8 out of 10 and moved on without thinking too much about it. A fun and absurd show with many references to other anime I love, and that would be it.
But in true Trigger fashion, there needs to be a plot twist towards the end, and Space Patrol Luluco keeps following this tradition.
Heavy spoilers ahead; again, I'd recommend watching the show without knowledge about these twists.
 
!
img550()
You know, Lalaco is right.

After their arrival at the Space Patrol HeadQuarters, the main cast gets rewarded for their efforts, with Luluco getting Ogikubo back. However, instead of this being the happy ending, it is revealed that a Blackholeian took control of the HQ, and that Nova is directly under his command.
Nova steals Luluco's Aflutter Gem, the heart-shaped jewel seen throughout the show and in the ED, that is now revealed to be an actual, physical object. Nova offers it to the Blackholeian, who then explains his plan to both the characters and the audience.
And this is the moment SPL addresses one of its main themes, Luluco’s crush on Nova, only to sucker-punch her and the audience via the Blackholian’s monologue. 

img550()
  

After having stolen everything valuable in the universe, including Ogikubo(s) which is the most precious, he tries to find the most worthless object to steal, and it can only be created in the same valuable Ogikubo by an emotion just as worthless: the superficial and empty first love of a middle-school girl.
He then reveals that Nova is a Nothingling, an alien race incapable of having emotions, and that he put the boy in the Ogikubo branch to make Luluco fall in love with him, thus creating the Aflutter Gem.
Then, he concludes his monologue by shattering the love gem, while Luluco dies from the shock of Nova's betrayal.
!
 
SPL takes the theme it was building up since the very start and turns it into its most relevant plot point by shattering it in the face of its characters and its audience, revealing this was the intention all along. And with this tone shift in S4E1 we go into the next episode, where even the OP lacks most of its colors.
 
!
After the OP sequence without Luluco, S4E2 starts with her in hell, thinking about her (short) life, her friends and family, until she remembers Nova's betrayal and notices the gap in her heart.
And while she wanders through hell (and reaches [Trigger’s real studio in Ogikubo](https://tokyo-animediary.blogspot.com/2016/06/luluco-and-ogikubo-uchu-patororu-ruruko.html)), she happens to meet a certain someone.
 
img550()
Trigger saving anime again
 
This starts one of the best moments in the anime: a surprisingly normal conversation between Luluco and Inferno Cop.

The dialog starts off fun, and we learn Inferno Cop used to be a member of the Space Patrol under Chief Over Justice, but it’s a calm and slow scene. It’s not quick-paced like the earlier episodes, nor loud and nonsensical as the Inferno Cop anime. There’s no space for the usual reactions, and despite the relatively light-hearted start, the heartbroken Luluco cuts the conversation short, telling Inferno Cop she has just died.

During this pause, it’s easily noticeable how there’s no soundtrack: the only thing we can hear beside the characters is the flame Inferno Cop is cooking on, that keeps on burning in the background.
After Luluco points out her recent death, she then reflects on her last moments and blames herself for trusting Nova, thinking that it’s all over.

Inferno Cop, however, denies that.
After all, he died a bunch of times and came back to life every single one.
 
Inferno Cop senpai, the protagonist of Trigger's first and most absurd anime, fully takes the role of a mentor and motivates Luluco to go back, essentially addressing the second main theme of SPL: what is the meaning of “normal”.

First, he answers her question about JUSTICE!, by telling her that normally justice never dies. And after a small cut dedicated to the everburning flame of JUSTICE! rising higher, he continues by explaining that “normal” is something we decide for ourselves. His advice is to neither obsess about standards and expectation, nor to embrace the chaos by completely disregarding any rule; it’s about accepting that both Luluco and the world around her are more abnormal than she initially thought, and rather than following the idea of what should be normal, she has to decide it for herself.
Then, when Inferno Cop asks her about Nova’s lies, Luluco realizes that he actually never lied to her. Nova wasn’t the person Luluco thought he was, she assumed Nova was on her side, but she never asked him how he truly feels.

And yet, all of this does not make her first crush any less valuable. Her love may not be deep nor mature enough, but it is still precious and powerful.
The realization makes her feelings burst again, the color comes back, the hole in her heart full again.

Inferno Cop then points her to Hell’s exit stairway, reminding her that conveying her feelings is the most important part, everything that comes after is a bonus.
!
 
Now everything is set for S4E3's final confrontation confession.
 

!In what can only be described as a miracle of JUSTICE!, Luluco bursts back from her grave, and is ready to go find Nova. Lalaco arrives on the scene, having noticed her death in the previous episodes, but is pleasantly surprised to see her back to life. She is even more surprised by Luluco’s growth and newfound determination, and happily accepts to help her confess by lending the Space Pirates ship.

 Look everyone, she did the thing!

Luluco then locates Nova and interrupts his monologue to put him under arrest and finally confess her feelings, but she also gets interrupted by the Blackholian.
He tries to steal her Aflutter Gem and break it again, but Luluco just creates another one.
And another one, and so on, every gem bigger and stronger than the previous, while the Blackholian gets increasingly more pissed.
The power and sincerity of her love makes Nova gain a heart, and with the Big Bang of his newly born feelings mirroring Luluco’s, he accepts her confession.!

Final Season - Final Episode
Trigger isn’t exactly known for its subtlety, but here? It gets thrown blown out of the window. We got another twist at the end of S4, but there is still time for a couple more. In a single 7 minute episode credits included, by the way.
!
Due to the Blackholian’s contingency plan, Nova gets incapacitated, forcing Luluco to fight on her own. In a surge of emotion, Luluco snaps and undergoes another transformation. She absorbs the entirety of her and Nova’s “pink lovey-dovey aura”, getting a slight variation of [Nono](https://anilist.co/character/2058/Nono)’s ahoge in the process.
As Lalaco put it, she has finally pulled the trigger.

She is now able to manifest her feelings as a weapon and fight almost on par with the fully transformed Blackholian, but he still gets the upper hand and manages to corner her.
In an attempt to save Luluco, Nova offers himself as a bullet, with his micro blackhole reacting to the Blackholian so that they you-know-what each other, distorting space and sending both of them in another dimension. He also reassures Luluco, promising her that they will meet again, and knowing that Nova would never lie to her, she pulls the trigger.  
img49%() img49%()
Sasuga Trigger, subtle as always

In the aftermath, Keiji goes to reassure Luluco, telling her to keep chasing Nova and arrest him again, as normally she’s supposed to introduce her boyfriend to her father.
So, in the very last scene before the end credits, Luluco goes off into space to search for Nova, embracing her new normal… and her new role as [Trigger-chan]().

Yes, the official studio Trigger mascot. The one character that existed since the studio’s foundation. The same one from the Trigger Girls april fools I mentioned more than 10 google doc pages ago. The girl who pulled the same trigger as the studio’s logo, whose ahoge resembles a trigger after her transformation, who travels across space and dimensions on a gun-shaped motorcycle and sits where the trigger should be.

Luluco IS Trigger.

!
This is not just another reference like the others, but a much bigger deal that allows us viewers to add a new layer of interpretation to this anime and understand better the vision of the people who worked on it.
!
There is an interesting article/analysis [here](https://wavemotioncannon.com/2016/07/02/luluco-imaishis-refusal-to-make-normal-anime/) that goes a lot deeper in this direction, but to summarize:
- Luluco being Trigger implies that her father Keiji represents Gainax, with both its important legacy and its broken state;
- Nova represents the “boyish projects” the staff at Trigger loves, or if you prefer food metaphors, the “decent burger” that they’re confident in making (and it’s bad for you), according to [a 2022 interview](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2022-11-28/studio-trigger-hiromi-wakabayashi-and-shigeto-koyama/.191887) with Wakabayashi and [Shigeto Koyama](https://anilist.co/staff/126243/Shigeto-Koyama);
- Lalaco is the idea of classic anime, like what the people at Gainax loved and grew up with, the influence of which carried over at Trigger;
- the Blackholian is the kind of person who not only regards modern anime as worthless, but in his arrogance and cynicism ends up denying everything as shallow and pointless.

This also fits perfectly with the planets visited in S3 being from their previous anime: the description of all the personal Ogikubos and their presence at the HQ implies that they have been space-shoplifted because of their value (or lack thereof, according to the Blackholian). Those “planets” are Trigger’s Ogikubos, they are the “places” where the studio comes from and where they belong, thus they are valuable and precious.

Nilkad Naquada - You're WRONG About Space Patrol Luluco
> The last 4 episodes of the series are the animation equivalent of Hiroyuki Imaishi standing up on a table and screaming at the audience about his worldview; it's loud, it's bombastic, it's not remotely subtle, and somehow everyone seemed to miss it.


And as much as I agree with the quote above, it's important to add that it's not just about Imaishi: as Wakabayashi states in the [2018 reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7zmqwi/iamhiromiwakabayashiacreativeproducerof/), ![he was the one to propose the idea of Luluco being/becoming Trigger-chan](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/8cs6uv/comment/dxhcrf0/).!
We can safely interpret the ending as the entire studio defining their normal, proudly celebrating their short yet rich history; their love for their past work and prior influences; and finally space-driving into the distance, towards the next fun adventure. 

And speaking of the future...

- - -
 
To be continued?
The story of Space Patrol Luluco doesn’t end with episode 13: there’s an almost forgotten [audiodrama](http://luluco.tv/archives/news/audiodrama) included in the japanese BD release that contains four tracks:
- [Season 0 Episode 0](https://justice-is-over.tumblr.com/post/151579532311/sp-luluco-mini-drama-translation) is a fun prequel about how Luluco’s parents met and fell in love, expanding on ! the brief flashback from S2E2 and adding more context behind Lalaco's actions and her relationship with Keiji;!
- Season 1.5 Episode EXTRA, taking place between S1E3 and S2E1;
- [Season 3 Episode 2.5](https://twitter.com/shiimai/status/771382073743532038/photo/1), that takes place during S3E3 and is about Midori’s past and her family, revealing that her mother is a runaway princess from a planet of space eco-terrorists;
- Final Season Episode ∞ is probably the most important one, as it happens some time after the ending of the anime. It is about !Nova and the Blackholian, trapped in space(?) after the you-know-what. In [this summary](https://justice-is-over.tumblr.com/post/151591031946/character-bginfo-revealed-in-the-mini-dramas) we get some info on the Blackholian’s past and motives, while in a 4chan thread with a now defunct link to the raws, a post adds more information on Nova, who apparently managed to escape in another dimension to search for Luluco. (As much as I'd want to leave the link here, the infamous hacker's peculiar choice of words in said post would violate AniList Guidelines.)!

Then, as a fun side-note there’s also the [Inferno Cop clip from Anime Expo 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b09SuPOaCRY) that happens right after that scene in S4E2: !Luluco escapes hell, and we see Inferno Cop’s thoughts about what just happened. 
Then he gets out of hell to go party in New Jersey, loses a fight against Donald Trump, and sings the american anthem (not really) with him and Lotte, all in about three minutes.

Trigger saving anime (and the USA)!

As far as proper sequels go, in 2017 Wakabayashi released a P&SG doujin for Comiket titled Cemetery Hills: Geekboy Homecoming, translated on 4chan (again, cannot leave the link here), that not only acts as an unofficial P&SG sequel, but also as a SPL one, due to !the arrival of Nova on the scene. We don’t know exactly how much has passed since the SPL ending and the audiodrama, but in one of the Gainax endings© of all time, it is now revealed that for some unknown reason Nova lost his memories.!

Both Wakabayashi and Imaishi have also stated that they would like to make a sequel !and/or an anime about the other Trigger Girls! in multiple occasions, with Wakabayashi [adding that Imaishi and Amemiya were debating who should direct it](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2022/anime-expo/studio-trigger-live-drawing-and-q-a-panel/.187173#gallerycwv11).
However, during [one of their twitch stream from last year](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1786013841), Wakabayashi admits that, despite them always wanting to do a sequel, there is sadly not much demand for a continuation, so unless there is ""some visual cue or some sign from God"" the studio will likely focus on more important projects (at 01:30:24). Later in the same stream (at 02:47:10), Imaishi confirms again that he wanted to do a (proper) S2 for Luluco, but he has to agree with the previous answer.

For now at least there’s the official [Art of TRIGGER Space Patrol Luluco artbook](https://trigger-global.ecq.sc/book/trg-os-aot-001.html), that can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05IFfmowc). Not only it contains info about the initial proposal, character drafts, and staff commentary; but also an illustration from Imaishi set 4 years after the end of the anime !that gives Luluco and Nova a well deserved happy ending:

And despite the lack of SPL-related news for Trigger's 10th anniversary, there are still many cameos in later projects, such as: ![Luluco and Nova appearing together in the background of Kiznavier's last episode](), which was confirmed to happen off-screen during the 3rd season; the real Akane being a Trigger fan [with a Midori plush in her room](https://twitter.com/MachDent/status/1076969990484570113) (this also gives new context to the many other references in SSSS.GRIDMAN); Tetsu Inada saying that Alexis Kerib is actually [Chief Over Justice gone evil after thousands of years of multiverse journeying](https://twitter.com/SieteSeventh/status/1100457600175362055), which fits with [Shigeto Koyama](https://anilist.co/staff/126243/Shigeto-Koyama) being credited for Justice design and Alexis design; a [Midori illustration from Imaishi](/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20231011035626) in which her 25yo version looks similar to [Rikka’s mother](https://anilist.co/character/127593/Orie-Takarada), who also has an earring similar to Midori’s 3rd eye and shares her VA; and [Lucia chatting with the Ogikubo branch in Promare](https://twitter.com/triggersupport/status/1311338256517263365), which many have interpreted as a tease for Lucia being [Spring](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?page=1&tags=spring%28trigger%29) (she doesn’t have a character page on AL, so here’s some cool art).
While there is no cameo in the [GRIDMAN UNIVERSE](https://anilist.co/anime/142684/GRIDMAN-UNIVERSE/) movie, it still shares with SPL the theme of embracing the importance of stories and escapism, and how valuable their positive influence can be. And with Trigger getting the rights to TTGL and especially P&SG, there is at least a non-zero chance for a reference to Cemetery Hills in the upcoming second season. Overall, given the studio's interest for a SPL sequel, a Spring/Muzzle series, or an entirely new project, there's still a lot of [space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRs0OqV4uSc) for a Triggerverse anime, and I'd love to see it.!

Final Thoughts & TL;DR
 
Space Patrol Luluco is a short celebration of Studio Trigger's 5th anniversary, [created by ten people on lower budget](https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/features/2019/6/3/the-road-to-promare-trigger-staff-discuss-the-anime-studios-history) while most of the attention was on Kiznaiver, which was airing in the same season, and on the Little Witch Academia TV anime, announced right at the end of SPL.
However, this short perfectly accomplishes what it's supposed to do: tell a simple and fun story with the crazy and energetic style Trigger is known for, with plenty of heartfelt references to the previous works in the studio's history and a relatable and genuine message that doubles down as the studio’s manifesto; and that was all I needed to fall in love with this show.
 
This is my first review, and I'm also a non-native English speaker with no proofreader, so please let me know if there are any grammar/formatting mistakes I might've missed. As for the rating, since I have to put one but AL doesn't accept JUSTICE! as a valid score, I'll have to opt for a more modest 100/100.

15085,"-Minor spoilers

A spark of consciousness ignites, and as you open your eyes, the darkness fades, revealing a blurry, out of focus face. As your eyes adjust to the light, you can see concern giving way to relief in the expression of… Who? Who is this person standing over you, and why is she wearing such a funny costume? She calls out to another person in the room, stating “She’s awake,” and you take a second to wonder where you are. This isn’t the first time your mind had to catch up with you when you woke up somewhere unusual… Or is it? It certainly feels like you’ve been through this before, but have you? And has it ever taken this long to fully regain consciousness?

You start to think about getting up and going home, only to realize with a sudden shock that you can’t remember where you live. Do you live alone in an apartment? Do you still live with your parents? Who ARE your parents? And for that matter, who are you? Just as you’re noticing that you’re wearing the same funny costume as the girl who woke you up, you hear male voices in the room, and two very attractive guys… One blonde, one brunette… Show up, and begin to fawn over you. One of them acts a little coldly, as though he’s trying to keep his emotions in check. The other starts to worry about you openly, almost as if he’s been in this position many times before. What is your relationship with these strange boys? Why are they dressed like strippers from Wonderland? One thing is certain… You can’t let them know you’ve lost your memories. Because banana.

Amnesia was produced by a company called Brain’s Base. I had not hear of this company until today, and if my Facebook poll results are any kind of evidence, you probably haven’t either. That’s a real shame, because they’re actually kind of amazing. They’ve put out a lot of highly visually impressive shows, such as Baccano, Penguindrum, and Durarara!! One of my favorite ways a company can achieve visual splendor is by carefully and skillfully allocating their budget so that not a single cent is wasted or wanted for. Amnesia is actually a perfect microcosm of their work, insofar as the fact that it has a lot of money to spend on big-budget special effects, intricately detailed and deliberately lit backgrounds, and an attention to detail that carries over to an outstanding sense of quality control.

The human characters don’t move much, but the movements they make are just fluid enough so that no viewer should ever have to complain about them looking cheap. It also helps that the series had a really smart sense of visual direction behind it, and unlike a lot of shows, the 2D and 3D animation complement each other perfectly. One thing people may complain about is something Brain’s Base had no real control over… The character designs. While the art style and the anatomical qualities of the human characters may be pleasing to the eye, this series completely jumps the shark in three areas… Hair, clothes, and eyes. I alluded in the plot synopses that each male character in our heroine’s harem is designed with a different suit from a deck of cards in mind. There’s a hearts boy, a diamonds boy, a clubs boy, a spades boy, and even a Joker boy. Oh and there’s also a boy only she can see, who looks like the Homestuck version of Peter Pan, if you can believe it.

If there’s one good thing I can say about these character designs, it’s that if you cosplayed one of them, you wouldn’t be confused for any other show… unless somebody really thought that Wonderland had a Chip’n’Dales club. Each boy is adorned with the symbol of their respective suit, as well as different styles of leather jackets, including a hooded variety, a turtleneck variety, a too-small variety, and a duster variety. Of course, because reverse harems do occasionally follow the rules a of regular harems, they’re also color-coded, mainly through the artificial coloring in their male scene hair. They also never change clothes unless they’re at work, meaning that they wear these weird get-ups in public, day after day, without fail. Yes, this is common in some anime, but not in slice-of-life anime, damn it!

The music is nice at first, but it can become wearisome really quickly. It’s mostly piano, and as pretty as it might be at a glance, it becomes repetitive, much like your typical visual novel soundtrack… tunes are meant to be played for long periods of time in the background while the player reads through dialogue and occasionally makes a choice, and that style sadly doesn’t translate well to animation. The opening, on the other hand, is outstanding. The song is called Zoetrope, and it’s a ice listen regardless of whether you’re watching the video or not, but combined with the on-pace video does a much better job of making the main character and the main plot of the show interesting than ANYTHING in the actual story does. It goes through the tired cliche of showcasing all of the Harem character profiles, but it does so really quickly, instead spending the majority of it’s time showing the heroine lost and confused in a dark abyss full of phantom playing cards.

The English dub was done by Sentai filmworks, and I really want to try to be nice about this, because the cast was obviously trying their hardest with the material given to them. It’s hard to like any of them, not because they performed badly, but because there wasn’t really any room in the show to perform well. Add to that a cast who’s biggest name is Christopher Ayres, and you have to wonder just how many of their biggest names must have looked at the script and refused outright to have anything to do with it(And if this IS the case, God bless Emily Neves and Jay Hickman for having the decency to at least take bit parts). I’m not sure why they bothered dubbing this anime in the first place, since there’s really nothing any American actor could add to the experience.

Maggie Flecknoe is our main character, presumably because she’s the only actor they had who’s bland and easy enough to overlook that they knew a nameless character with no agency or personality wouldn’t make her look any worse. Not surprisingly, she also played the hapless female lead in Diabolik Lovers(She’s also further proof that Log Horizon could get a good performance out of literally anyone). Her role never demanded any big emotional commitment from her, and like a true paycheck-desiring trooper, she didn’t bother trying to give it one. Houston Hayes and Chris Ayres actually got to put some emotion into their roles, even if that emotion began and ended with “I’m pissed off at you.” Shannon Emmerick didn’t do a bad job with the cutesie Ryuksie character Orion, but then again, playing young male voices is kind of her only viable career option, so let me ask once again; “How many A-list VAs turned this series down?”

Considering Sentai has to be picky with which shows they dub and which ones they don’t, and considering how they’re able to take one look at a piece of shit like Detroit Metal City and say “ehhhh, maybe not this one,” I’m honestly surprised they put forth the money to put this series out in English… On Blu-Ray, no less! I mean, I’m sorry, but this is one of those rare occasions when the type of story being told, and the kind of character tropes being portrayed, there really isn’t any real American equivalent to the material. They probably should have released this one in Japanese only, and yeah, that’s also how you should probably view it. One Luci Christian role… Just one… Could have justified it enough for a recommendation.

I’d like to begin the meaty portion of this review by running down the wonderful cast of characters that are featured in this gem. Let’s start with the main character, named… She actually doesn’t have a name. When she wakes up with amnesia, she never asks anybody for any details about her life, which means that through the entire anime, we never learn her name, her family status, or even how old she is, which would be unforgivably creepy if a quick look at wikipedia didn’t list her as an 18 year old college freshman. She’s listed in the credits as ‘heroine,’which is a laugh, because ‘hero’ and ‘heroine’ are titles you’d give to characters who are active, show positive qualities, and have some sort of agency in their lives, whereas Heroine-san seems to be the personification of the term “Just go with the flow.”

Much like Mayuri from Steins;Gate, the world is trying to kill her, but unlike Mayuri, there’s actually an in-universe explanation for it(which I won’t spoil). She dies in each world she’s in, mainly due to the fact that she likes to run out into the street without looking first, although the fact that she can’t swim may also play a factor. Of course there are other possibilities, like Orion’s suggestion that if she doesn’t stay close to people at all times, she may forget how to breathe. A suggestion she takes seriously. Yes, a college student doesn’t know that breathing is an involuntary action that even babies do. Orion also convinces her that it would be a bad idea to tell the people in her life that she has amnesia, because like I said earlier, Banana. The only conscious decision she EVER makes is picking a lock to get out of a cage, and the only reason she does that is so she can get back to her apartment and find proof that she loves someone in order to stop them from raping her. Because that’s how rape works? She has literally no standards for dating other than “must be hot bishie,’ and to prove it, let’s see just how charming her princes are. And trust me, each one is worse than the last.

Her boyfriend in the first timeline is Shin, represented by the Heart suite. That’s actually kind of appropriate, because while none of these guys are ‘best choice’ material, I’d consider him the ‘least awful choice.’ He’s a year younger than the heroine, and he has a chip on his shoulder from society shaming him for the accidental sins of his father. He cares about her, and his main issue is with jealousy… Not a good trait to have, but a believably human one, and one that I actually would have liked to see fully worked through. Unfortunately, Heroine-san falls off a cliff and jumps to a new timeline, where she’s dating Ikki, a much more boring character who’s life has been tortured by what I’m going to call the PG rated version of Dane Cook’s curse from Good Luck Chuck. He wants her because she’s immune to his charm, and the girls who ARE obsessed with him provide a constant source of antagonism for her throughout the course of the series.

Next up, very briefly, is Kent, and if there’s an offensive stereotype for asexuality out there, he’s it. I know lots of women fall for the stoic guy with glasses… Kyoya from Ouran, I feel your pain… But they tend to have actual personality traits, like pride, or condescension, or something. Kent doesn’t have even the most basic of emotions, and every single coupley move he makes on Heroine-san can be drawn back to advice he got online or in a book. I actually AM asexual, and no, we’re not like that. We have human emotions. We understand basic human interactions. Kent is not a realistic person, which makes it extremely hard to not only relate to him, but to figure out what Heroine-san saw in him as a potential lover in the first place.

Then we have Toma, one of the most disturbingly popular reverse harem options ever. Do you remember how in the wake of Chris Brown beating up Rihanna, there were flurries of women online claiming it was okay, he could beat them too if he wanted to? That’s Toma’s fanbase in a nutshell, so let me just run down what this hopeless romantic did. There are going to be minor spoilers here. He realizes Heroine lost all her memories, so he lies to her and says they’re dating. This is already horrible, but we’re not done. He drugs her without telling her, which she has no reaction to, even when Orion warns her about it. He then sticks her in a dog kennel… Yes, it’s a cage, but it’s also a dog kennel… and claims he’s trying to protect her. Her only reaction to this is “This isn’t you… you’re not like this…” Uh, yeah, sure, keep telling yourself that. And then, like I said, she breaks out and finds the diary on her previous self in this timeline, and it coincidentily says she loves him, which prevents him at the last second from raping her.

They make googly eyes at each other, and then in the very next shot, she’s in the hospital with a broken leg, with no explanation offered as to how it happened, and even though I know she has a knack for getting run over, I’m going to assume he broke it to keep her from running away again. Yeah, remember that romantic scene with the sledgehammer in Misery? Something like that. And then we meet the final boy, Ukyo, who’s a literal murderous psychopath with a Jekyl and Hyde style split personality, and… Can we just stop now, and admit that all of these characters are awful? Can we just all agree that this is the most unlikeable cast of main characters since The Devil’s Rejects? Like I said, Shin had potential, but honestly, he wouldn’t look nearly as appealing if he didn’t have the rest of them to compare himself to. Nothing they do registers with Heroine, nothing ever alarms her, nothing ever convinces her to avoid or refute them, and Orion isn’t any better as he just spends the series dumping exposition and giving her terrible advice.

Okay, so if the characters are terrible, how’s the plot? There is no fucking plot. Nothing that happens means anything in the grand scheme of things. As a matter of fact, you could easily skip the first four story arcs and go right to the fifth without losing anything important. The point of this series wasn’t to slowly unravel an intriguing mystery, or gradually learn more about our main character through several shocking plot twists, it was to fit every single story path from the original game comfortably into the series so fans of each one could get their jollies off at some point. It’s like the story structure of Clannad, except in that show, every arc had some sort of central purpose going forward. The only point each arc in this anime has is to make the love interest of the previous arc look more appealing by comparison.

Or maybe the point is to make them more appalling? I don’t know. I don’t understand the appeal of dangerous or possessive lovers. Yeah, Yuno from Future Diary is hot, but I still wouldn’t touch her with a sixty foot pole. Maybe I just don’t understand the whole masochism thing, or maybe I just don’t get the appeal of being controlled, because apparently these characters are considered legitimate sex symbols on Japan. Even the subject of caging, which the Japanese voice actor himself apparently found weird, can still cause half a room full of women to go crazy for him. I guess I can give a pass to this show when it comes to fans who know that what they’re watching is an unhealthy escapist fantasy that would be unsalvageably horrifying in any sort of real world context, but because I don’t like to over-estimate people that I don’t know, I’m going to have to assume there are impressionable young viewers out there… both male and female… who may catch a bad message about abusive relationships, and I can’t forgive that.

Amnesia is available from Sentai Filmworks on both DVD and Blu-ray. It was originally really expensive, but can normally be found for low prices at certain Rightstuf sales. There are about six different entries in it’s visual novel franchise, and while I don’t feel like listing them all down, a few of them are available as imports to Playstation Vita. The series can also be viewed on Crunchyroll.

Amnesia is the perfect example of a show that just gets worse and worse as it continues on. I originally didn’t think too poorly of it, as I’d been pre-warned about some of it’s early flaws, and the way it played to popular dating sim character tropes, so I was at least expecting to enjoy it on a so-bad-it’s-good basis. What I actually got was a series that was so devoid of energy and passion that I found myself dozing off through most of the episodes. And yet, as boring as it was, it’s a surprisingly dangerous series, in the same ballpark as Popotan, albeit with a different message and much more commendable animation. Amnesia could easily teach young girls that toxic behavior is forgivable in a man as long as he truly loves you, especially since the main character is specifically designed to be a lego brick, and thus have no name or personality so that any viewer can imagine themselves in the role. I even found out very recently that fans of the original game hate it, and that’s saying something. I give Amnesia a 1/10."
13535,"Pretty, rich girl Ichiko has been blessed with an inordinate amount of good fortune, so much so that she’s actually sucking the fortune from those around her. To correct that massive imbalance, god of misfortune Momiji is sent to the human world to balance things out —but Ichiko isn’t willing to cooperate.

This was…really dumb, but often entertainingly dumb.

The base story is simple: once Ichiko and Momiji meet, most episodes fall into a familiar pattern of 1) Momiji coming up with some way to steal Ichiko’s energy, and ruin Ichiko’s life/happiness as much as possible, and 2) Ichiko mostly thwarting this somehow, while also becoming a slightly better person and making friends



(Poor little rich girl is actually very lonely, whodathunk.)

The show avoids having an idiot plot not just because of the zaniness, but because Momiji opts to take the most painful and/or inconvenient ways of approaching the “reduce Ichiko’s fortune” goal, so Ichiko cannot be persuaded.



Very fun: Momiji is full of references to other anime, frequently masquerading as other characters
 



However, the series is obsessed with boobs. Ichiko’s got big ones, and gets dubbed “Titchiko” by classmates. Momiji is flat-chested and this is used to mock her.

And then we have Bobby, a traveling monk and the lone black character, who is useful about twice (giving Ichiko helpful magical items) and then spends most of the series being a pervert, because “haha man likes to grope high school girls” is…not funny, but someone thought it was.



The show is at its best once it settles into a rhythm of Momiji thinking up some new scheme to drain Ichiko’s energy, and Ichiko channeling her frustration and anger into not just thwarting Momiji, but actively attempting to beat her. (The tennis match in episode 9 was ramped up to eleven, and is a personal favorite.)

Overall it had some really funny moments, and I’m disappointed there isn’t a second season (although it ended fine, no cliffhanger, but clearly could’ve continued; it came out in 2012 so hope for a continuation is gone). But the boob comments and pervert-as-a-personality-trait aren’t funny, and also make this unacceptable for playing at work.



Verdict

English dub? Yes, by people who sound like they’re having a lot of fun

Visuals: Nothing standout, but Momiji’s frequent visual references to other shows are VERY fun.

Worth watching? Depends. It’s got its funny bits and I enjoyed it overall, but it’s also NSFW with its boobs obsession (and Bobby, overall)."
99131,"The cute girls genre recieves a fantastic addition with Comic Girls, an anime I definitely didn't expect to be as good as it ended up being.

This story is focused on a group of girls who love manga and either draw one professionally, or are trying to get a series published. This proves to be difficult for our lovable protagonist, Kaos, who honestly is just awful at it, and goes to live in a dormitory for female manga artists where she meets the other main characters of the series, hopefully getting inspiration from them.

Comic Girls uses the setting really well to provide a fantastic comedy both via the characters and the use of the manga elements. This anime doesn't focus on the profession like series as Bakuman or Shirobako do, but it's still quite informative and, most importantly, succeeds at using it for the comedic value it wants.

There are four main characters in this story: our protagonist, Kaoruko Moeta (pen-name Kaos), who is an absurdly likeable and quite relatable girl who seems to be in constant state of panic, but is also a hard worker that you will want to adopt and protect, Tsubasa, a tomboyish girl who draws shounen manga and puts herself really seriously in the mind of the characters she creates, Ruki, who loves drawing cute things but ended up discovering her true skills at drawing lewd stuff instead to her embarassment, and Koyume, a cheerful shoujo manga artist and doughnut devourer who can't draw guys. Their personalities balance well and make for a lot of entertaining situations, and together with fantastic (and also quite touching at times) episodes focused on each character I ended up very attached to them. The number of secondary characters is pretty short but they do well when they appear and add to the fun that comes from this anime.

The art style and character designs of the series are very visually appealing, with lots of nice character reactions and well done use of the camera angles, studio Nexus hasn't done many things yet but I would be totally in for them doing more series in the future because they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. The music on the other side is nothing memorable but fits well for the tone of the scenes, the opening and ending themes are two good songs by the VAs of the four protagonists, with the later having some really nice transitions into it at the end of some episodes.

Comic Girls is a fantastic series I enjoyed a lot and I really recommend to watch to any fan of the cute girls genre, or for anyone looking for a comedy series to watch, because this one delivers hard."
8557,"For decades, mankind has taken the vast, epic ocean environment for granted. As our technology has advanced, so has the scale our pollution, with oil, garbage and toxic waste killing millions upon millions of innocent aquatic life forms. But now, the world below the surface has finally taken enough abuse from the world above, and they’re sending their most powerful, most terrifying soldier to deal with us.

All 1,000 of us.

Okay, so it’s information may be a bit dated, but it’s desire to enslave us and force us to pay for our crimes is no laughing matter. She’s coming, and we have no choice to prepare ourselves… For the most adorable invasion of mankind since Night of the Lepus.

Yes, it’s not Godzilla, it’s Squidgirl, a vertically challenged moppet who looks almost human, save for the series of blue tentacles that make up her hair. Or Ika Musume, as Japan calls her. She comes ashore one day, bursts into the Lemon Beach House, and announces to the first gathering of humans she sees that this world… And all the people in it… Now belong to her!

Unfortunately for her, this declaration is met with laughter, and she soon winds up working a low level job at the very beach house she just threatened. Like Ika, this beach house is owned run by a small family of siblings… They have no parents, because it’s an anime. The most important of the three is Eiko, a high school student who acts as a foil for all of Ika’s hare brained schemes and delusions. Takeru is a little boy who… genuinely acts like a child, surprisingly. He gets along very well with Ika, as he’s more than willing to play along with her. And their oldest sister, Chizuru… Well, telling you about her personality would spoil one of the greatest moments of the series, even though it happens in episode 1, so I’ll just leave it at ‘she’s awesome.’

The animation is nothing special, but it’s a little above average by Slice of Life standards. There are a lot of key frames, but when it wants to impress you, it will not hesitate to do so, saving it’s budget for moments that really need it. Yes, the allocation of the budget may be a little too noticeable for some people, but you can’t argue with results, because whenever there’s action or physical comedy going on, there’s really nothing to complain about. Aside from the main character, the character designs are a little on the bland side, but they still have kind of a natural feel to them. Well, natural by anime standards.

And speaking of our hero, the animation style works particularly well in favor of the Squid Girl herself, whose various cephalopod abilities make up the bulk of that action and physical comedy. For a good idea of how her tentacles work, think of her as a really mean parody of Lucy from Elfen Lied… the four deadly vectors have been swapped out for ten mostly harmless hair-tentacles that seem to have even more impressive abilities than Ika herself has. They’re powerful enough to break through a wall, strong enough to lift heavy objects, and fast enough to create a sonic boom, yet they’re also delicate enough to thread a sewing needle. And they can seemingly stretch indefinitely. On top of this, she can breathe underwater and use bioluminescence to glow in the dark.

And yet, beyond these abilities, Ika herself is… Well, I don’t want to say stupid… Perhaps ‘naive and gullible’ would be better. Her knowledge of the human world seems very arbitrary and inconsistent. She’s able to do complicated math problems in her head, but she doesn’t know that she can’t eat the images on a 3D TV. It’s odd, but hey, it’s an episodic children’s show. Even My Little Pony had problems like that. And for what it’s worth, while Ika may be a little inconsistent, she’s a very entertaining little pain in the ass.

As enjoyable as the title character may be… Your choice of dub or sub will influence this, but more on that later… I can’t really say as much about the supporting cast. I wouldn’t go as far as calling them bad or unlikeable… Okay, maybe a few of them are… They’re just not all that interesting on their own. They’re mostly used as props for Ika to interact with, and to be fair, this is done to great effect. They support her, as a supporting cast should, but none of them ever really stand out, as they either get too little screen time to justify their presence or so much screen time that their best qualities become Flanderized. The only one that ever really rubs anybody the wrong way is Sanae, Eiko’s childhood friend, who has a lesbian crush on Ika… Which would be fine, if she weren’t so damn creepy and obsessed about it. Honestly, she’s the only real element of the series that I wouldn’t call kid friendly.

The English dub, for the most part, is pretty underwhelming. It’s a parade of no names and small timers, with the only big actors being Carrie Savage and the increasingly impressive Christina Vee. for the most part, the performances are either bland or adequate, although nobody really bombs it. What really surprised me was the performance behind Ika, who’s played by Christine Marie Cabanos. I’ve never really liked her as an actor… I thought she was miss-cast in K-ON!! and Madoka Magica, and while I didn’t mention it in my review, I freaking HATED her in Oblivion Island. But here, she was actually kind of good. She won’t be winning any Oscars any time soon, but her “every ridiculous thing I say sounds completely normal to me” delivery was a pretty good approach to take.

The Japanese track is infinitely better than the dub, however, and Hisako Kanemoto blows Cabanos completely out of the water. Actually, the performances are better all around, even if you can’t understand the language. Which I can’t. The dub isn’t horrible, and it should be enough to please those who insist on watching it, but unless you’re eager to hear a barrage of fish-related puns, the Japanese track is definitely recommended.

I mentioned earlier that, aside from Sanae, this show is pretty kid-friendly, and I meant it. The stories are simple enough for a kid to comprehend, without ever really feeling too dumbed down. It’s episodic, split into threes like a Nickelodeon cartoon, but there’s still a sense of progress and development with the characters. It’s set on a beach, so there’s naturally a lot of scantily clad bodies walking around, but aside from that, there’s barely any traditional fan-service at all. It’s the story of an incompetent Invader losing touch with their origins as they adapt to human culture, and while we’ve seen that about a million times, it’s done pretty well here, with the constant otaku pandering that almost ruined Sgt. Frog left completely out of the equation.

The writing can get corny, and the characters can get a little stale at times, but it still smells of genuine effort and imagination. It never stays in a rut for too long, and there’s always a good laugh waiting around the corner. Actually, the writing in this show is a lot like the animation… It;’s hit or miss, but when it hits, it REALLY hits, and it doesn’t always need to rely on comedy to be enjoyable. There are some surprisingly touching scenes, including a chibi segment in episode five that’s so brilliant and creative that, with different music, it probably wouldn’t feel out of place in a Fantasia movie.

Squid girl is available from Media Blasters, surprisingly. They’ve released the first season stateside. You can stream it legally on Crunchyroll, buy the DVDs on amazon, or just watch the whole thing for free on Netflix. There’s a second season, but it hasn’t been licensed, and I haven’t seen it yet. I will see it eventually, and when I do, I have some pretty high hopes for it… I want to see Ika’s home world be explored and explained a little more, I want a few certain characters to get some more screen time, and I want a few other certain characters to die in a fire.

In the end, Squidgirl is kind of a mixed bag. It’s a bit of an underachiever in almost every category, but it still makes for some great light-hearted, mostly family friendly fun. I guess the base breaker for most people will be Ika herself., seeing as how the best points of the series Some of you may find her unconscionably annoying, and I can understand that sentiment completely. This show is not for you. For the rest of us, myself included, she is nothing sort of adorable and charming, and if the rest of the cast has to act as her props, then good job… This show is hilarious. It’s not one of the best comedies out there, and repeated viewings over a short period of time may leave you feeling cold… Once or twice a year at best is advised… But for what it is, I loved it.  I give Squidgirl a 7/10."
133175,"When a season begins, i usually watch the first episode of every anime, and mark down those i want to watch. So it was, at first, a pleasant surprise to me when i begun watching ""The Down of the Witch"", and thought to myself ""hey, i think i recognize this..."" and then i discovered it was a sequel-spinoff to Grimoir of Zero. 
Back then i really liked it, even with its problems. Although its adaptation made things kinda confusing to grasp, Grimoir of Zero's worldbuilding was one of its strenghts. Which made it feel fresh and cool, compared to other fantasy anime. Even now, i still think Grimoir of Zero worldbuild was one of the best ones i've seen. Not only that, Although it had some pacing issues, i really liked how its story was a closed cycle, and left little things unfinished. 

So, even though The Down of the Witch aims to be a fresh experience, it inherits a lot from it's predecessor. Now, since i didn't read any source material from this, i ask myself who is it to blame? The writer? The studio? The answer is probably both, and i will try to address them separatedly.

The first main problem i got with this is how this sequel-spinoff continues the mistakes of its predecessor in therms of pace. No, actually it improved those pace issues. Even if you are paying full attention, it is sometimes hard to understand what is going on. I can only imagine how hard it was to watch from people who didn't watch Grimoir of Zero, because at least i had the explanation of how magic works in this world from it's previous setting. Here everything is thrown at your face, and you don't have time to process information before another thing happens. 
Another issue is with how the story was built, to begin with. It feels like a rollercoaster. I will not spoil anything, but let's just say NEVER BELIEVE IN ANY CONFLICT. Everytime something serious happens, it is suddenly undone. This anime should be called The Blue Balls of the Witch, because it ALWAYS solves its conflicts in the most disappointing way possible.
To make things worse, you kinda get jebaited in said conflicts, because the anime uses a LOT of unconventional chock value scenes. I wouldn't say it is gore, because the animation is too bad to make you unconfortable, but when you see people losing their limbs, even if they don't bleed at all (yes), you get jebaited to think that the situation is serious. No, it most likely isn't.

I can't stress this enough. I almost dropped this because of how many times this show raised my expectations and then proceeded to, yet again, blue ball me to the ground. If i could fix only one problem of this anime, it would be how it irresponsably plays with the viewer's expectations to deliver NOTHING. This is a problem that i see in many titles, but here it is evident: you NEVER promise the viewer something if you don't plan on keeping that promise.

Now, lastly, i wanna go back to grimoir of zero for a bit. Remember it's worldbuilding? Here it is nonexistant. Remember the relationship between Youhei and Zero? Here it is almost non-existant. Remember Albus personality? Forget it, because here it was remade entirely. Everything good from Grimoir of Zero was left behind. I know they are supposed to be side characters now, but honestly, it felt like i didn't know these characters anymore.

Now i feel compelled to talk about some of it's good sides. For a typical amnesia main character, Cervil isn't that bad. His backstory is interesting, and there is some development that was unfortunately overshadowed by the bad pacing issues. Holt and Coudeau make a good fill for the team, and aren't as annoying as i thought they would be. Roux steals all the attention to herself, and actually carried the show for a good part and i don't like how she is still the sexualized lolibait character. 

Overall, there is a lot of wrong things with this anime. I can't recommend it for anyone unless you really liked Grimoir of Zero. And even then, some bits of it actually kinda ruined my view of Grimoir of Zero as a whole for me. It is a failed attempt to make a spinoff, and should be viewed as an example of how to make a bad anime out of a good setting."
130050,"Hard to really write a review without spoilers though honestly even with spoilers, it's a predictable plot. Now with that being said, is it bad? No, I really enjoyed it even though I can figured out the plot within basically the first 5-10 minutes of it. But anyways, here's my quick review and summary of it, also along with the lesson it taught. 

Summer Ghost starts with three friends meeting together, now we won't understand this meeting until later on but if you pay attention to anime, you can figure it out. 

img()

The Summer Ghost is a girl who by them lighting their fireworks, she will appear. Now I didn't really research the significant of this but I'm just assuming it's something to do with how Japan usually ends their festival with fireworks where usually closes out the summer. This is just my personal opinion, don't quote me on this. 

We are introduced to our three friends (Tomoya, Ryou and Aoi) who are searching for the Summer Ghost (Ayane). 

img()
img()

The thing about these three friends, they are all strangers who met online with something in common, wanting to meet Ayane. And before you wonder if this is a horror anime, no lol... 

Each friend comes with different burdens and are in different parts of their lives. Though all of the same age, each struggle with something different. OKAY from here on out, this will be SPOILER WARNING! 
img()

All four of them are at different part of their lives... 

Tomoya - basically our POV character. He is someone who has a future but too scare to face the future. He's someone who doesn't want to look ahead and rather stand behind. Which was illustrated nicely in the beginning. 
Ryou - someone who has so much ahead that he looks for but have so little time. Someone who wants to move forward but knowing he is limited on time. 
Aoi - someone who is dealing with the present, being bullied and wanting to commit suicide. She is someone who is trying to overcome her everyday hardship. 
Ayane - someone who has neither a future or a present, she is someone who is already gone. 

The basic of the plot is simple really, it's about learning to face what's ahead no matter how tough. That we just have to look up and see that there are those who knows our pain and there to share it with us. That those who are gone, those voices we can no longer hear. As someone who has lost a friend at a young age, this hits pretty close to home. 

It's really focus mainly on Tomoya learning to face that he needs to not be afraid to step forth to the future. And with Ayane help along with Ryou and Aoi, he learns to take that step. To not hate his life and seek the future. Each of them faces their own problems. 

The ending is bittersweet... I won't spoil it but it's pretty simple really to pick up on it. It's a nice overall anime and I will say the music was gorgeous. What is it's biggest flaw and lacking? I didn't really like the coloring and character design at times. Since I had a hard time trying to figure out was that Tomoya or Ryou. 

It's a short movie, if you have time, it's worth an watch. If you enjoy these type of simple theme anime like me, you'll enjoy it. If you don't, then it isn't really for you. It got it's message across nicely and simply. So as they say... ""Seize the Day""

Because eventually... summer will end... those who once were here will someday be gone. So cherish the time we have with those around us. You never know how long these moments will last. 


This is just a personal story - don't click here unless you want to read it - also a spoiler for the ending 
!Sometimes I think back to my last moment with my friend not knowing that would've been the last time I saw her. Would I have changed the words I said? 
My last words to her (I was still living out of state for school and we met at a different state for a sports tournament)

(She was sick and wanted to watch her brother play in the tournament. I stood by her side she has always been by my side when I needed a friend. She couldn't muster any words as she was so pale and weak. Regardless, she wanted to be there and I can only hopeless stand there trying to talk to her as I've always have. And before I left, I patted her on head and said these words)
""I love you, I’ll see you back home next week.""

Not knowing that next week when I saw her was because of her funeral (she passed away that night when I left). So yeah though a sad story, made me realized how short our time can be on this earth. No time to live in hating our lives, hating others, and wondering why we were ever born. Instead love each other and know you can be the difference in someone's life. 

Because soon enough as the movie ends... our time with them too will end
img()!




Just as those who are gone can no longer seek the future or live in the present, they are a thing of the past. Those of us who are still here, the sky is the limit as they say. Learn from your past, live in the moment, and run towards your future. 

Score - not exactly sure what to give it, but for now, I'll just put 9/10 since I really enjoyed the theme, the music and the simple beauty of the plot. Maybe it's a 8/10 but whatever, if I change my mind... I'll change it in the future.

4975,"Warning this review may contain spoilers.


First impressions, so we got a super natural marrder mystery going down with harem elements going in the background. Sounds interesting enough.


Story,5/10 

So the premise and setup of choas head is pretty simple for the most part because in one way or another it's has been done before a lot of time.
You know Like we have the main character living his Madame life. There are some mysterious murders that have been going down in his local area. He doesn't pay attention to these things and then out of nowhere he is then quickly dragged into the middle of it.
with him now trying to figure out what has been going on and finding out that things are more than they appear and him also finding out that he's got got super natural powers that give him the ability to make his imagination real and along the way finding out that there some girls who also have the same power as him. 

Which now in retrospect this kind of thing has been kind of done before and some times better in the choas head case. 
Now I am not saying that choas head is bad in any way. Because I thought it was quite interesting for what it was because it tackles some interesting concepts, like how realty can change so quickly or how you shouldn't trust everything you see and how do you describe the concept of something that as real for not.
Which is really something you don't see that very often.

But the problem I have with chaos head as a whole is that it's presentation was very disappointing in quite a few areas. I am pretty sure and don't quote me on this I am pretty 
sure that the presentation in the visnel novel that this was based off was a lot better. But problems I have for one is that the pacing is very fast. 


From a nartive stand point it feels like to me that it's hip hoping to every major plot point in about 12 episodes. 
Which kind of kills all build up and because of the small amount of episodes the show never had time for cool down moments or side story's to help flesh out the setting. 

One of the things that the anime did get right when it came to presentation was the creepy atmosphere because this a story about mystery and murder.

Now another problem I had as the ending because it was very wft and it is one of those open endings where you don't know what really happens next. 


Characters, 6/10

The main character taku was some what interesting.
Like his personality wasn't that special because he was a shut-in otaku who really doesn't have much of a personality. But what made him interesting was his mental problems which his ability kind of made it more fun because you don't really know if any off the things that he is seeing are real or something that he is thinking off.


The side characters.
Where also kind of interesting in way as well.
Because they all had something interesting about them.

like for example one of the characters mostly speaks in cryptic word play.
A different character who was also interesting as a girl who only speaks using ner mind. 

Even though there personallys are genetic as hell.

One problem I found was the character relationships.

Because of the pacing and ep count we never these characters come together naturally.

Now You could say that to some extent that they became closer together because they shared a common enemy that was a huge threat and because of that they became closer.
But doesn't really justify the fact that some of where some what close to him even though thay had only know him for a short time.


Art, 6/10

Now animation for choas head for the most part looks very nice for the most part.

It has some very nice backgrounds.

It also has a nice colors as well.



Sound, 6/10

The quite liked the op and ending themes 
They where quite nice to listen to.
But they not really worth looking for.

The ost well kind of lacking for the part on its own. 
But it did bring the right atmosphere to every scene that showed up in the anime.


Enjoyment, 6/10

Well on of the things I quite liked was the idea behind it. 
Because on Paper this would have been a really good idea if it was presented better.
I liked it's idea of realty being contently put in a state of Mind fuck.

I also quite enjoyed the creep atmosphere.

But pacing and ep count did put a major dampening of how I enjoyed is show. Because 
While watching this show it really did feel that it was missing something more to it.



Overall, 5/10

If your into v.n anime adaptation then you will probably like it even though it feels a like fan service for v.n players.

But if you not into gennic story's in general and you do t like gore or maid fuck then stay a way. 
But you like the idea of choas head.
Your probably better off playing the game."

SPOILER FREE REVIEW

I had low expectations for this anime when the season started. However even though it's neither the best, nor the worst, it's still decent. The title... summarizes pretty well what's happening in the anime. There are cringe moments, ok moments, and that's all. Even though it's not an anime to be taken seriously, I found it interesting enough to watch weekly. Actually, I kind of enjoyed watching it every week. Why? Because in my opinion, it's a stupid, yet fun anime. You could call it ""maybe fun to watch"".

The Premise - 6/10



img()

An old, rich grandpa finds his high school soulmate (basically an old grandma). Their nephews, by ""coincidence"" are in the same class and they are blackmailed into getting married by their grandparents because they believe they should experience the love they couldn't when they were young like them. The main character's grandpa buys them a house, they are forced to move in and that's where the story starts.

img(

The girl starts off as a tsundere and slowly opens to the main character. Even though she seems stupid sometimes, I find their relationship to be quite funny. The main character is this ""cool"" and smart student who always gets top grades, being better than her without effort. That's why she starts off as someone who ""hates"" him.

The Animation - 7/10



It's a basic, not flashy animation, exactly what you need for this kind of anime. The character designs aren't particularly unique, but they're good enough. I genuinely enjoyed looking at this anime, even though I don't remember a moment where the animation shined. Overall, it lacks fluidity, but remains consistent throughout the series. 

The Characters - 6/10





Houjou Saito is the male protagonist, being more laid back and doesn't really have a visible character development. He just becomes more attractive in the female lead's eyes and is kind of there for the sake of the plot. He is the usual smart student who doesn't put any effort into his studies, but somehow still nails any single one of them. He has a superior complex and shows signs of liking the female lead too.



Sakuramori Akane is the female protagonist, being introduced as a tsundere, but slowly starting to grow feelings for Saito. Her character development is... there. She starts by fighting with the male lead and eventually shows a variety of emotions, like jealousy or shyness. Even though she is almost a bland character, she is also the reason why this anime is stupid enough to be fun. 

There are other characters too like Akane's best friend, her little sister or Saito's little sister, but I didn't think they were worth mentioning.



Their relationship leans more towards comedy than romance - it's somewhat platonic at first, but progresses gradually (despite them already being married).

For me, it's a rom-com fun to watch as long as you don't look for something wholesome, very good story wise or unique. It has a mid premise, with some mid characters, that you'll probably not remember for something special, but even with these drawbacks, I found it a good watch.

So...

If you're looking for deep romance or serious storytelling, this ISN'T FOR YOU, but if you want a lighthearted, ridiculous rom-com with some funny moments, give it a shot!

I also have to say that this anime has its ups and downs, sometimes it becomes weird, sometimes it's tolerable, and other times... I don't know what it is."

""Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever.""

Lakeside Park, Rush



What connects people through time? Here's a suggestion: memories. Memories of the days you spent together, right? If I look at a photo on the mantel of my friends from high school, a lot of things flash into my mind - and most of them are memories. Makoto Shinkai is a filmmaker very much concerned with memory, and connection. This movie's an exploration of those basic themes. But also at stake are things like the interaction between friendship and time. Things like longing, and things like love. Make no mistake, this is an emotionally mature movie. 


And, I think, one worth watching. By the end of this review, I hope that you'll agree with me. And if you don't? Oh well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.


>""I always have the feeling that I'm about to lose something"" - Story and Characters



The story, such as it is, is frequently confused, but always minimally comprehensible. It may have been just me, and I suspect it was at least slightly contributed to by the insufficient character designs, but at times I forgot who the two main male characters were, or confused them for the other. With that said, the best part of this movie, by far, is the first thirty minutes or so, before the time-skip. 

I want to be clear: this movie's biggest shortcoming, by far, is its characters. If you cannot tell two of the main characters apart, that is a serious problem. Especially when there's only three. I appreciate the attempt to keep the setting grounded by not surrendering to the temptation to have wacky character designs, but given that the setting is hard sci-fi, every other line is technobabble, and the plane looks like it should be completely unable to fly (especially because there are modern plane designs as well), this is perhaps an acceptable line to cross.

The first part of this movie is fantastically atmospheric and evocative, and it's somewhat of a let-down to see it collapse to a sort of generic sci-fi plot near the middle. Near the end, though, there's some wonderful sound design and cutting to underscore the climax of the movie, and in the middle there's a dream sequence between (I think) Hiroki and Sayuri where their hands touch in a manner which will remind anyone who's seen Your Name of that movie's climatic Katawaredoki scene, which is exceptional, if not quite as good as Your Name's iteration on it.

On the whole, I'd say the story does what it needs to in this movie. It's not boring by any means, but it's definitely slow-paced, and not as tight as some of Shinkai's later work. However, it delivers the characters to the situations and backgrounds where Shinkai's real expertise shines, and I'm always impressed by Shinkai's eye for the quiet little moments in the middle of celestial beauty.

Thematically, it's fine, I guess. Shinkai does literally spell out that the Tower represents what people want, which would have been best left silent since it was extremely obvious from the shot framing and the way in which it's referred to in the dialogue. 

>""The scent of a different universe"" - Art, Animation, Direction



This is a very red movie, as opposed to Shinkai's usual blue or green. That's because the sun seems to always be setting (when it's not straight overhead), which lends a rather sad feeling to the whole piece, and a sense of ineluctable slipping from connection. There's less control over colour as there might be in some of Shinkai's later work, but there's still some very impressively composed shots, mainly with some sort of celestial beauty behind, with the characters in the bottom third of frame.

That kind of composition is common to almost all of Shinkai's work, and it always serves the function of minimising the characters and foregrounding the backgrounds - a wise choice, when you're as good as backgrounds as Shinkai is. Makoto Shinkai's strength as a filmmaker has always been how good he is at establishing tone, and the set of moody and wide-angle shots that he strings together to evoke youth are very impressively done. Whilst there's slight overuse of fade transitions, it's hard to deny the nostalgic beauty and slight tinges of magical realism to the early shots in the movie, especially those involving the tower.

The best part of this film, as I said earlier, is definitely the first part of it, where all these strengths congeal together to create a feeling of longing that anchors the rest of the movie in reality.

The character animation sometimes leaves a little to be desired, but there are some very solid wave and explosion effects, and it's definitely a lot better than some of Shinkai's other work, and characters have very defined visual personalities.

Tangent: I really enjoyed the visual quote of a shot from End of Evangelion near the very end. You'll know what it is when you see it.

>""Those words had a strange effect on me.""- Music and Sound



Sound ranges from sometimes slightly undermixed, with soundscapes that feel a little flat, to very good. Especially excellent is the way Shinkai's mixing creates a feeling of detachment in the better scenes earlier and later, where things that should be very quiet are loud and things that are loud quiet - a way of reinforcing the ethereally unreal tone he's after.

Tenmon's soundtrack is mostly just ""OK"", but there's a heartbreaking little scene set to a (technically diagetic?) violin piece where we cut rapidly though an empty school, and it's hard not to feel a little surge of shivers down the spine as the piece swoops and soars. Ai Kawashima's closing song (which also plays over the last few minutes) is pretty good, although it hasn't become as popular as some of the other songs Shinkai's put in his movies. It's an emotionally fraught final 10 minutes, punctuated well by the insert song.

Shinkai has always had a good sense for rhythm in his movies, specifically the rhythm between dialogue, cuts, and the music. That shouldn't be suprising since he's often maligned as a ""music video director"", but it serves him well here.

>""...as long as I don't lose those memories, I think I might be able to keep a grip on reality in the future."" - Final Thoughts



This movie, unlike any other in Shinkai's ouevre, really highlights where he's strong. It also highlights where he's weak. Where he's strong: in constructing tone and atmosphere, and setting up for one perfect little moment with the interaction of light, framing, backgrounds and plot. Where he's weak: the dialogue is pretty clunky at times, he's weak in establishing character (less recently), and he's weak in setting up a plot that fundamentally you buy into.

But in this movie, as opposed to some others (Children Who Chase Lost Voices), the scales are tipped, I think, toward ""good"". This is a good movie, but because Shinkai's weaknesses are (a) foregrounded and (b) not as alleviated as elsewhere, it's not as good as it could be. But it is a movie that is worth watching, not only if you are a Shinkai fanatic, but also if you want to see what is more or less an elementally moving story.

Because the last shot, near the end, where Hiroki walks away from the crumbling Tower as Ai Kawashima's voice rings out over Tenmon's gentle strings and piano notes, is exquisitely, and genuinely, touching.

\- Pointy"
108891,"Note before the start: This obviously has some spoilers. The review is from MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, everyone will appreciate and see something else, by this review i wish to give you a new look on the anime :D, feel free to let me know your POV... everyone is unique and values something else more than others.
.
Intro
For me personally Kono Oto Tomare is something that was more enjoyable than Your Lie in April or Oregairu. Now I don't want to downgrade these amazing animes, but I really feel like this anime gives you a lot more to take from it than the other two do since they have more characters and also were not afraid to focus on more than one or two things like Oregairu and Your Lie in April felt... I think this is just a better anime overall :D. 
Enough of the intro talk, I want to talk about the characters here where I feel like I can share more than talking about the plot itself. 
Chika Kudou
Chida Kudo is one of the main male characters from the Kono Oto Tomare series, he is interesting and catched my attention mainly later in the anime where you find out about his past and we could also say a tragedy with the kotos of his grandpa, this is something which actually isn't shown as much as in manga, but if I talk only about anime, Chika really made a big jump, first being someone who looks like he is just destroying everything without having anything of a value, to a person where he values the people around him and never leaves them alone in a tough spot. He is also also an extreme hard worker – this is something that had an impact on some other characters which maybe at the start of the anime weren’t THAT dedicated and hard-working.
Satowa Houzuki
Satowa Houzuki is one of the main female characters from the Kono Oto Tomare series. Satowa in her past played a lot of koto. This was because she was from a koto-playing family. With that said, her past with it isn't pleasant, her mother was very toxic towards her – that had also reasons, but, well, for young Satowa, she just couldn't really see the full picture at the younger age, and it also didn't change the fact that it left a mark on her. She is left all alone with hate towards Koto and very reserved, she felt like she didn't really belong anywhere, this is where the Koto Club and people in it change her, for example she hurt Chika Kudou by saying few things like ""why is someone like you playing Koto"" and well you can imagine Chika because of his past took it very personally and badly. This was one of the big turning points for the evolution of Satowa Hozukis character, Chika forgived her and also defended her behind her back instead of insulting her. This because of Satowas past meant a lot to her and just deepened the trust and bond between her and the Koto Club.
Takezou Kurata
Takezou Kurata, he was the first main male character to be shown in the anime, a very soft and not really confident guy which was the only koto club member at the start, I'm gonna skip the past here to the present, thanks to everyone support around him, he grew as a person, becoming more confident and also honest, since he was the leader this gave the club a really nice image I would say for the people outside of it. I feel like he was one of the characters which in some later stages of the anime really helped with keeping everyone together. What I mean by that is that he was able to make other characters open up more and accept them politely, a nice development and if we get season three, I will be looking forward to seeing more of him... I believe he has still a lot of uncovered potential as a character.
Hiro Kurusu
Hiro Kurusu was at first a veryyy very toxic character. I thought she would stay that way, she tried to basically push everyone against each other in the koto club – but since at the time the clubs mood was set nicely, no one fell for any of her tricks, and they surprisingly to me welcomed her warmly as a member of the koto club. Now why would Hiro Kurusu do something like this, she was affected by her past friends, which basically did the same thing, ditched her and then started creating rumours around her, the fact that the koto club accepted her despite at first being we could say attacked by her efforts to break them, it was one of the big moments which really helped the koto club and their friendship in the long run.
Maintakeaway
So the takeaway here is really simple, friendship. I really liked how the anime showcased different kinds of traumas or negative events which affected the characters here and how there was always friendship included as one of the main, if not the main thing to solve the issues. I also cant forget mentioning the music - I didn't have a clue what koto is before the anime, and now I just like to listen to it from time to time, if you add up the character development, the plot and its twists, animation and also the music, I just feel its safe to say this is one of the best music romcoms to be seen. 

Thanks for reading"
140501,"To be fair, I was not really paying attention to the anime when I was watching it. And, in all honesty, if Anilist's review requirements does not have a minimum number of characters, I probably would be writing a few liners since that is all I could think of in this anime. But here I am, deciding to take up the challenge to try and meet the minimum requirement and give a proper review to this anime that I half-paid attention to.

img620()
(GIF Source: Tenor thru' Google Image Search)

First of all, the synopsis of the series is pretty much what this anime is all about since there is no clear direction to where this story is going. Yes, sure, the protagonist woke up 1000 years later and tries to fulfill his promise to a dark goddess that he would find her after he woke up. But that doesn't seem to happen in this anime. 

It has been established from the start that Leonis, the protagonist, has a mission to fulfill after his slumber for 1000 years. But due to the change of the world, it is understandable that he has to adapt to the evolved world while fulfilling his mission of finding the dark goddess. While the first couple episodes were understandably about him trying to make sense of the new world, the rest of the series is just... gibberish. Like it was just battle after battle with no clear reason as to why they are happening. 

Of course, I am not saying that monsters, or Voids as they call them in this world, has to be intelligent and give a clear reason to why they are attacking, but the battles that ensued in this anime just doesn't make sense. The only one that seems to be clear is the last battle of this season.

img640()

Another reason I feel this anime is not going to be worth a watch is that the series failed at one thing. That is, they failed to make good use of the school setting.

Sure, your only sanctuary is within this man made floating island and you got to be alert at any possible incoming attacks. Yet, the world is set in an era where technology far surpassed what they had during Leonis' time 1000 years ago. Don't tell me they are incapable of predicting when an attack could possibly happen? 

And anybody who watched anime with a school setting, there is always going to be a festival of sorts. Be it a cultural festival, or a fantasy festival created solely for the series. Many of the other anime that has a similar setting as Seiken Gakuin has a festival that involves friendly competitions of sword fights or magical fights. 

One example would be from The Eminence in Shadow, Bushin Festival Student Preliminaries. 

img640()

Another example would be from a much lesser known anime, Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan, the Mistgun Tournament. 

img640()
(Picture Source: The Movie Database thru' Google Image Search)

Yet, in Seiken Gaukin, it seems non-existent. Another point to make is that the studies of the student doesn't seem to be existent as well. It feels as though the students in this school are free to do whatever they want except attend classes, which is quite unrealistic if they are trying to make a school setting. 

Overall, the story line of this anime needs to be clearer and the creators has to look into making good use of the school to make the storyline interesting. Moreover, certain things needs to be addressed such as why were the heroes of the past are now the enemies? There are possibly a lot of issues in this anime that needs to be addressed to give a clearer picture of the series but it failed to do so. All I see the creators doing is trying to, as usual with modern anime, unnecessarily sexualise the female characters."
101045,"The person you see across the net is nothing but but a reflection of yourself. Your opponent has put the same work and effort to reach till this stage. And he won't back down easily, and neither will you. That's what Hanebado! was about.....I guess. Or that is what it was hoping to be but it failed miserably.

So Hanebado starts strongly with a match between the two protagonists leaving the viewers with the question ""Why do i work so hard for something"". It was a match between Hanesaki Ayano and Aragaki Nagisa where the technically gifted Ayano just steams over Nagisa winning the second set 21-0. Nagisa was hugely effected by this result as she had started questioning her abilities. And to make matters more interesting, When Nagisa is in her second year of high school she gets a new junior player who enters her badminton club. And guess who? It's Ayano. Though Ayano didn't want to get into the Badminton club but was forced by her friend and the new club coach who saw a lot of potential in her. Ayano had left Badminton after the tournament in which She and Nagisa had a match due to some personal reasons. Reason which traumatized her till date and made her wonder ""What do I play Badminton for"". Now Hanebado continues from here to the journey for both Nagisa and  Ayano to get over their traumas and find the answer to why they play badminton.

The Plot looked promising and was well portrayed at the start of the anime. A bit overdramatic but it looked like Hanebado was going to be the dark horse of this season. But then as the story progressed and we got to know more about Ayano's past , the plot started to feel overexaggerated. And then we got the Dark Ayano and though i liked that character of her, from a story stand point Hanebado was going downhill.

Though the story was pretty mediocre I still enjoyed Hanebado for i have played interschool Badminton and an anime based on the game would ofcourse arouse my interest and for the most part as far as badminton is considered hanebado was good. It sometimes went into the details of how to deal with a stronger opponent by playing at your tempo and being unpredictable. And it also showed the reality of that most of the times technique does win over passion. The Art Styles was great and I would recommend people to check out this anime just because of that too. The creators put in a lot of effort making many frames for a single scene because the matches looked fluid and smooth and were a treat to watch. The music was fine. The OP was good but nothing worth noticing. Though i would say the music did play part in overdramatizing the show.

So Overall Hanebado was an Anime for which I had high hopes for after the first few episodes but it didn't live up to them. It was Enjoyable I'll give it that but sports anime usually are enjoyable. But I might still recommend it because of the amazing work done in the match scenes where the staff must have worked their ass off to keep up such a high frames per second ratio."
147571,"Despite all the hate it rightfully received, I really enjoyed the first season of In Another World with My Smartphone. The English dub of the first season brought self-awareness to the characters, injecting some much-needed humor into an otherwise insipid storyline. This season, that spark of life from the English voice actors is sorely absent. Everyone goes through the motions, counting the days until their paycheck arrives.  

Season 2 is purely an abysmal descent into the depths of mediocrity, doubling down on its repulsive misogyny and complete lack of creativity of its predecessor. The episodes are a disgraceful showcase of women reduced to objects. 

To start, we should get the animation out of the way—or should I say, the absence of it? Instead of breathing life into the action, they serve up mind-numbing still shots that make a snail’s pace look like a Formula 1 race. Who needs fluidity when you can have a slideshow of stagnant scenery? And the art? It’s a mishmash of confusion and chaos. Character designs morph into distorted monstrosities, mocking the very notion of artistic coherence. You’ll be playing a game of guess-the-character as they transform into unrecognizable blobs before your eyes.

But hold on, we can’t overlook the anime’s defining trait—the abominable off-model faces. When our forgettable protagonist Touya and his harem dare to look sideways or tilt their heads, brace yourself for a roller coaster of contorted faces. Their faces twist and warp into grotesque abominations as if the animators collectively were overworked to exhaustion. It’s as if they took a lesson on character design taught by deranged Dadaists.

One example of their inept compositing is when the characters use their invisibility power. Instead of employing subtle visual cues to convey their appearance, the compositing team opted for a shockingly horrific eyesore. The resulting effect is a jarring combination of poor color grading, sloppy filters, and clashing layers. The characters appear as if they were hastily copy-pasted onto the scene, with no regard for proper lighting or integration. 

Now, let’s take a minute to summarize the story—equal parts mind-numbingly dull and painfully predictable. In this pitiful season, we witness Touya’s shameless pursuit of multiple engagements, and his harem of indistinguishable girls expands. The show stumbles through a series of contrived scenarios, presenting forgettable female characters solely to satisfy our protagonist’s romantic interests. Along the journey, we bare witness to coerced relationships, absurdly imbalanced power dynamics, and the relentless sexualization of women, all woven together in a quilt of tastelessness. The only time he rejects a girl is when a child flirts with him—her father offers her hand in marriage, but Touya respectfully says, “Wait until I AM eighteen.”

This season fails to rise above the cesspool of misogyny established by its predecessor. It revels in reducing women to objects of desire, forsaking originality, and engaging storytelling. The abomination continues with episodes that range from cringe-worthy to appalling. We witness the main characters frolicking in a hot spring, girls non-consensually kissing Touya, and unnecessary fanservice while dismissing any semblance of storytelling or character development. The plot introduces female slaves, miraculously transforming them into “employees” for our esteemed hero. What a good guy! And let’s not forget the fascination with Yaoi-themed books because nothing says respect for women like reducing them to objects of fetishization. 

And what about the humor? Prepare yourself for a tidal wave of juvenile jokes and stale innuendos, the sort that could only make middle schoolers laugh. The writer’s misguided attempts at humor only amplify the show’s overall pitiful quality and reinforce its grim treatment of women.

Political intrigue in Smartphone, or so it's meant to be, dissolves into a mishmash of forced engagements and the protagonist’s relentless pursuit of romantic conquests. The show’s obsession with accumulating wives and establishing kingdoms reaches nauseating heights, reaffirming its status as a prime example of the harem genre at its most repugnant. The plot, if it can even be called that, lingers in a wasteland of predictability and worn-out tropes. The dialogue is contrived, lacking any depth or meaningful exchanges. Instead, we’re subjected to a parade of vapid interactions and vacuous relationships centered solely on gratifying the self-insert protagonist’s ego. 

In Another World With My Smartphone’s second season is a seething pile of excrement. Its abhorrent misogyny, creative bankruptcy, and absence of character development make for a hilariously awful twelve episodes. Protect yourself from this animated accident and seek out series that treat women with a modicum of respect, subvert stereotypes, and offer engaging stories worth your time."
113950,"When it comes to sequels there are only a few out there that I can say with the utmost confidence, outshine their predecessors by miles away. There is The Dark Knight Rises, The Empire Strikes Back and even Shrek 2. And now SSSS.Dynazenon has fallen into that category for me.



When thinking of Dynazenon, I can't help but compare it to its predecessor, SSSS.Gridman (2018) which was the first installment of the Gridman universe. As someone who liked Gridman I can totally understand why some people might have not liked it as much as others. Because truth be told, even I found myself forgetting about the anime a month or two after it ended. And I was pretty much indifferent to Dynazenon when the anime was first announced. However, once Dynazenon began airing, I found myself enjoying it significantly more than Gridman and my love for the anime grew exponentially each week. Dynazenon is bigger and better, as it improves on Gridman's shortcomings tremendously. It shows that the staff really put care into this series, taking everything they learned from Gridman, tweaking the imperfections and applying it to Dynazenon.
━━━━━━━━━▼━━━━━━━━━
The following contains minor spoilers for both Dynazenon and Gridman

The story revolves around our five main characters: Yomogi, Yume, Koyomi, Chise and Gauma. Each person of the group (except Chise) pilots a part of Dynazenon led by the chaotic king, Gauma. Together they form the giant robot, Dynazenon and fight kaijus that threaten to destroy the world. Each character is eccentric and unique in their own right, which makes them play off of each other quite nicely. Their interactions are like a breath of fresh air since it feels natural and authentic. They're lovable, charismatic, and simply feel more human than Gridman's cast. That's not to say Gridman's cast isn't good – because they are – but they lack in comparison to Dynazenon's ensemble. The main reason for this being the fact that Yomogi and co. are much easier to relate to since their entire character arc does not revolve around just fighting kaijus. In Gridman, the cast lacks development outside of Akane. We never really delve into the lives of Yuta, Rikka, and Utsumi since they're always focused on stopping Akane from destroying their home. This is probably the reason why Gridman was not as compelling for many.



On the contrary, the members of Dynazenon each deal with their own personal issues such as loss, love, depression, incompetence, isolation and regret - which they slowly begin to overcome as the story progresses. This makes for some excellent characters development that eventually ties up beautifully in the end. 

In terms of growth, the spotlight specifically shines on Yomogi and Yume who receive the most development throughout the entirety of the anime. Both are trouble kids, going through their own hardships, but after being brought together by Dynazenon, they start to form a bond and their view of life begins to change. The plotline with Yume and her sister is by far my favorite arc in Dynazenon. Seeing Yume go from a cold and distant person to someone much friendlier who learns to rely on those around her was absolutely wonderful, and it would not have been possible without Yomogi's kind-heartedness, as he was always at Yume's side, supporting her every step of the way. There relationship is sweet, awkward and genuine. It's adorable seeing these two interact and care for each other deeply. Without this fantastic duo I probably wouldn't have been as invested in Dynazenon as I am now. They are just that good.



One thing that stays consistent with the sequel is the beauty of the visual storytelling, animation and art which is elevated with the upbeat tracks thanks to Shiro Sagisu (Evangelion, Gridman). He has killed it once again with the soundtrack, which ranges from mellow to radiant, really immersing the viewer in the most pivotal moments of the anime. 

And I can't forget to mention the kaiju battles because it's not mecha anime without the giant robots clashing with huge monsters. I must say it was much more amusing seeing each cast member have a role in fighting the Kaiju Eugenicists compared to Gridman, where RIkka and Utsumi stare and a computer screen while Yuta does most of the work. The Kaiju Eugenicists are a chaotic fun bunch and good antagonists that fit the more lighthearted tone that Dynazenon initially has, but we also see them grow and turn serious as the stakes become higher. The mecha combinations were also much more creative, and gratifying to watch. Hearing the Dynazenon theme play as everyone combined into one for a final attack was always thrilling and had me grinning ear to ear from excitement. I've seen people compare Dynazenon to Power Rangers but I sadly can't make that comparison since I've never watched Power Rangers (sorry). However, I can say that Dynazenon has that Saturday morning cartoon vibe  – even though its on a Friday – and reminds me of the weekends where I would wake up super early around 6 or 7 AM just to catch the newest episodes of my favorite shows.



I don't really have any complaints other than the fact that Chise's backstory wasn't expanded on after episode 10. It just seemed like there was potential there for a great character arc that would tie into the Dynazenon story, so I thought there might be more. It didn't affect my enjoyment at all though since I still love her. Dynazenon was simply that good from start to finish.

Do I recommend watching SSSS.Dynazenon? Absolutely. I found it quite absurd that not many people were talking about the anime since it was basically one of the best shows airing this season along with Megalobox 2. I totally understand why some people might have not liked Gridman as much as others. Perhaps the story wasn't as engaging as one would hope or maybe the mecha genre isn't appealing at all. Whatever the reason may be, I definitely encourage you all to give Dynazenon a chance. As I said before, Dynazenon is a polished version of Gridman, having refined the flaws of its predecessor and all in all, it was such a delight to watch. Overall I rate it a 9/10 but based on pure enjoyment it's a 10."
21567,"A lot of things in Mayoiga are bad, most of them  are awful and one is good. Let's skip the banana and let's get right into the ananas. In other words, I won't waste our time with detailed complaints, so we will go through the bad shit fast.

Characters are better of dead. Unlogical and empty. Spotting the main character in the first scene was just as easy as I predicted. Just focus on the most usual and ordinary brunette guy and yay! It's him! There is very few good aspects of the characters. They are not funny and especially not deep, I was not able to relate to them at all. What did I say? Very few? There are NO good aspects. Case closed.

Story doesn't know in which direction it wants to go. From lighthearted slice of life to mystery to horror, back to mystery and then to romance - in any way and even in my highest spirits and unbeatable optimism all I can say that was good were rare exciting events, mostly in the early episodes. Ending did not bring any mindblowing facts and plot twists, not even any backstory is worth mentioning. Nah.

The music is just like our protagonist - boring and once you've watched the 12th episode, you'll immediately forget everything about it. On top of it all, the animation is nothing to brag about. The monsters are of a laughable quality and the artstyle is rather annoying - but that is just a matter of a taste.

So, where is that one good thing about this anime? It's the concept. The pure idea, the skeleton of the plot, the base. How people react to reality's brutality, mental disorders and psychological scars, how trauma can take a form and haunt person down. The execution was poor. But the thought? I'd have loved to see this done. Just totally differently.

In the end, there is not much to be said. Anime as a whole was disappointment. Every attempt to create the right atmosphere despperately failed. Even then I held expectations for shocking reveals in the last episodes which did not come to happen. As plain as it started it ended."
12115,"I noticed that nobody made a review about any of these movies yet so I'll try my best to talk about all of them. 

When it comes to Berserk adaptations the order usually goes as follows: Berserk 1997, The Berserk Trilogy, Berserk 2016. The reason for that is most likely that 1997 has cut the least amount of story while also being visually appealing. Berserk 2016 is infamous for its horrendous CGI animation and the Trilogy is.. ok? At least, that's the impression I had before actually watching it. Well, I really enjoyed all three movies and here's why.

img520()

First of all, it looks beautiful. The 2D scenes look miles better than the 97 adaptation and the animation is really good too. Unfortunately a lot of this is overshadowed by the use of horrible CGI in some really important scenes and it gives the entire trilogy a pretty bad reputation. That said, the use of CGI gets a lot less frequent in the third movie which I definitely appreciate, but it doesn't change the fact that you do notice the CGI and it did ruin my immersion at times.

Next, the story. Compressing 90 chapters into just 3 movies, or roughly 5 hours, is obviously not gonna be a simple task and you can tell that they had to cut a lot of story and character development. Aside from the CGI, I think this is the trilogy's biggest problem. It just doesn't hold up in terms of story when compared to the manga or the 97 adaptation . They tried their best to include the most important scenes, but there's just too much that wasn't able to make it in the trilogy, resulting in a very rushed story. Berserk is all about the journey and experiencing Guts' and the other main characters' hardships alongside with them, but this movie just isn't able to convey that feeling because of the previously mentioned reasons.

img520()

However, I think the third movie does an amazing job at conveying the horror that is the eclipse. You can feel Guts' emotions, anger and pain while seeing him struggle to save Casca and the other members of the band of the hawk. As I said before, the use of CGI in this movie is at an acceptable level and it looks a lot better on monsters than soldiers and human faces so it didn't bother me nearly as much as it did in the previous movies. Also, the eclipse takes up a lot of screentime so I'm really glad they didn't rush that part. 

Lastly, I want to talk about the sound design, which is really good. It's nothing special but I think it's at least worth mentioning that it's not nearly as bad as the 2016 adaptation. The english dub is really good and has a lot of the same voice actors as the 97 adaptation plus the music also doesn't disappoint and uses a lot of themes from older Berserk songs which I think is great. 


So in conclusion, I think the trilogy fails as a proper adaptation, but if you just want to re-experience the golden age arc animated or want to see a shorter recap, which is the reason I watched it, then this is it."
176273,"An absolute love letter to the cheesiest corniest most beloved beautiful story telling tropes and beats in all of anime. One of the best anime original anime I've ever seen and one of the best anime I've seen in a good while. Solid 9/10. It would have been a 10/10 Masterpiece it played the story too safe. It was predictable a lot of the time and very by the book. You could follow the three arc structure it had going episode by episode which while could be intentional seeing how the show was based on a movie within the story. If that was the case then bravo for such meta storytelling. An absolute love letter to the cheesiest corniest most beloved beautiful story telling tropes and beats in all of anime. 
The characters were phenomenal. Some more than others. Memmeln felt very under utilized despite having her own personal tragedy and character growth but it was so short and felt like too easy of a change for someone with such deep seated anxiety and issues. The Bird Director was probably the biggest disappointment. She was neither an ally or an enemy. Just a random inclusion despite being such a significant figure when it came to ""A Tale of Perishing"". Her inclusion had a lot of potential as an antagonist but it never went anywhere and frankly if was removed all together nothing would change. Luke, Unio, Justice, and of course our heroine Natsuko win the gold star for not only being just great characters but each having their own well rounded character arcs and development. This show was not carried by the plot or the references to other anime, but these characters. 
Shifting to the plot, it was very by the book. A character like Natsuko struggling with pressure that came with success and her own shortcomings sent to a world where she is given god like powers and omnipotence as she struggles to use said powers and knowledge to change a fate written in stone. She did everything she was supposed to do for a character. She struggled, grew, evolved, and in the end over came her short comings established in the first episodes. It was well executed, handled, and animated with incredible skill and grace. It was also safe. Nothing really stood out about her character or the story as a whole. The anime reference and easter eggs were a nice touch for any anime fans but overall the plot was standard, safe, and predictable. Everything from beginning to the last scene was exactly what one would expect from a series like this. It was amazing, beautiful, and exciting to watch as well. 
In a lot of ways, Zenshu's predictability is part of its charm. It truly is a love letter to the 3 arc structure of story telling and all those movies, shows, and stories that follow it. It was not trying to rewrite the rules because it was celebrating them. This series is a celebration of anime and animation."

Welcome to my review of the highly acclaimed movie ""gintama: the final""  where I will be trying my best to give my thoughts and opinions on the movie and the series as a whole which sadly has to include spoilers to demonstrate my points.

img1000()
IMG1000()

The beginning of this movie starts with a summary of the main events that have occurred in this show over it's 15 years of existence in this medium with the use of a dragon ball Z parody. This was done in pure gintama fashion, even in a movie that was supposed to be serious and tie all the loose ends of the show, sorachi hideaki still managed to create humour even in the dark moments that were about to befall upon us which is a skill that only the truly elite have. Over the course of this movie and even early on we constantly see all of the cast of characters like gorilla, otae, kagura, shinpachi, kyuubei, the shinsengumi, sachan and tsukuyo helping the odd jobs fight their way through the terminal. This is one of the many strong points of gintama as a whole and this movie in general, no matter how great the trouble the odd jobs face, their friends always come to their aid which just enamours me to no end. 

Sorachi strikes again, roughly 1/4 into the movie, sadaharu recovers to his original state and rescues Gintoki from falling to his death after falling of a ledge in the terminal. He then proceeded to eat him (gintama sticks to its roots very well) and after a while two old men with similar silver hair came out of sadaharu's ""you know what okay"". This scene in particular made me die inside so much, my parents must've had worrying thoughts hearing their 16 year old son laughing with no sign of stopping at a computer screen. I must say, I watched the trailer for this movie many times so when I finally saw those particular scenes in the movie, I was filled with emotion, waiting six months for this is the cruelest thing you can do to a human. 

Gintoki stated that he would close up the odd jobs if both kagura and shinpachi found what they wanted to do in life and to that statement, both kagura and shinpachi said that they weren't a part of the yorozuya because they were bored but rather to stick with gintoki and the other's. In particular this scene just portrays too much wholesomeness in general, they didn't stick around because they were bored, didn't stick around because they wanted the money but instead they wanted to be a part of gintoki's adventure which conveys the silver light that gintoki permeates, even the shinsengumi and too much characters to name have fallen victim to gintoki's radiating light, and so have we.

I mean it when every character no matter how minor of a role they played appeared in this movie, at roughly 40 minutes into this movie, we finally got the appearance of baka ouji, a character who's existence is just too hilarious to me and his specific OST whenever he enters a scene is one that I will never forget for many reasons haha-

One thing I noticed was the silence during the fight between utsuro and gintoki instead of using battle OST's/songs to heighten our experience. I thought about it quite a lot and it was simple as to why they done that, Utsuro is an immortal being who's name translates to ""emptiness"" which is reasonable in the sense that he has lived for many centuries constantly suffering due to the greed of the tendoshou to learn about his immortality, all he wanted was to end his ""solitary"" life (as said by hitsugi having experienced the pain of being eternal which is a mere fraction of what utsuro had to face). Having lived a solitary life meant he was all alone being eternal while normal beings died like every other day to him which is evident in the way that there was silence during gintoki's fight against utsuro that only lasted roughly 10 minutes at most to us but to him, this silence was there everyday. It really raises the question of whether it is worth being immortal in real life to be honest, I wouldn't like being eternal, would you having known Utsuro's pain and suffering throughout his lifetime? 

Another thing that I didn't understand completely was how takasugi shinsuke stabbed utsuro in appearance but in reality takasugi stabbed himself and that the body Utsuro saw lying on the ground was himself? I really didn't understand that specific scene but that didn't ruin my experience at all, straight after we were graced with the fated fight between utsuro and gintoki. In this fight every second frame we were brought back to the past where gintoki went head on against the likes of takasugi and shoyo in his childhood, it really just goes to show how much gintoki has evolved as a human. In my opinion, who gintoki killed was not utsuro but rather takasugi (but indeed killed utsuro after all, that's the thing that doesn't make sense to me at all) as portrayed by the reflection which mirrored takasugi's chilling expression that was smiling, did he do this as he knew that gintoki could not end his own teacher? I truly don't know, maybe I'm reading into this way too much but here's an image of takasugi's expression on the sword that was flinged into the sky:
!img300()!
We are then presented with one of the most darkest scenes gintama has created up to now and will ever do so, a dying takasugi being held in gintoki's arms, what ended my heart was how he said ""the score was 246-247 to gintoki"" and that it was their final duel, all these kids from shoyo's school wanted was to live a normal life, they only wanted to stay with their teacher, it was an innocent thought that just didn't last forever. Gintoki's clearly had a tearful face as his lifelong rival and childhood friend was about to pass away on his arms but takasugi requested that he wanted to see Gintoki's smile as the last thing he ever saw with left eye, takasugi then died in his arms. I will never forget the man that was takasugi shinsuke, man it was too emotional, way too emotional. The only other scene that I can remember that had such an impact on me was the final moments of the shogun assasination arc where sho-chan passed away (also) on her sister's lap.

We are then presented with the final scenes where tama is finally revived from her long sleep. She is given the memories that occurred when she was asleep so she would be informed as to what occurred when she was away,  in these frames we still see the same yorozuya (and mostly same cast of characters) celebrating in otose's snack bar even if edo was transformed into a futuristic city, those moments are something that I will treasure for the rest of my life for sure. During the last scene, gintoki, shinpachi and kagura decide to run towards their ""urgent job"" just like running away from their rent every month from otose ;)) ending with the words ""we're the odd jobs"", that was the final straw for my heart which was already ravaged in pain knowing that this is the final ever movie (i mean until gintama 2 becomes a thing of course) haha-

the soundtrack from the beginning of this series to the end of this movie was simply phenomenal, the use of wadachi which i had listened to uncontrollably prior to this movie was a true pleasure to watch. The OST's in particular like madao's OST were phenomenal, I mean imagine telling your ""sound director"" to create a sad OST and then they create madao's OST, the man who created that song is man among men I tell you. The change in character animation style was amazing aswell, it was deemed necessary as it just comes with a movie in general, no problems with any of the above at all. 

img1000()
IMG1000()

with the end of this movie, you think we may have ended our journey with the yorozuya but you are wrong, this is only the beginning, we will continue yorozuya's legacy for as long as we live. Nothing will ever be better than this for the rest of my life, I will forever come back to this show with great memories for as long as I live. The way how they can implement comedy elements within this supposedly serious movie that ties all the loose ends is a wonder to me, gintama is the only series that can do this and executes it phenomenally, laughed every moment of the way even shed tears along the way, people say this series is just a bunch of parodies and comedy but they're wrong, they neglect to see the true side of gintama that flourishes exceptionally and is the reason why we all as a family love gintama. I feel really empty as it truly is finished but rewatching every summer from now on (already did this summer) will heal me slowly.

the key word here is ""we"" and not ""I"" because no matter who you are the yorozuya will be there for you. this anime has changed my life forever and I can never thank sorachi the creator of gintama enough, to create something that every person is enamoured by along with the idea that the watcher/reader becomes a part of the journey along with the yorozuya is just unfair. I truly truly truly can only wish sorachi hideaki the best from here on out, he deserves the world for creating this. Everywhere I go all the comments when people finish this movie are filled with heartwarming comments that try their utmost best to portray their love for gintama, what you've created sorachi is something that binds us all together for the rest of our lives. I will miss watching this movie for the first time, rewatching it isn't the same but it'll have to suffice haha

(PS: Even after this and rewatching gintama once, I still don't know if gintoki has silver or light blue hair lol)

20806,"Cross Ange is an anime about titties and explosions, and mechas too. It’s gory, it’s funny, it’s entertaining and it usually doesn’t pull its punches (we’ll get more into that later). Now, I get why this show won’t be for everyone, as with its weird tone, the mix of silly fan-service and gory/crude drama will be a turnoff for many. That said, I honestly thought it made the series twice as entertaining and funny, and the tonal whiplash can make for some seriously impactful scenes.

The plot of Cross Ange is nothing you’ve never seen before, the classic story about a privileged person who loses everything until they hit rock bottom, and how they deal with it.
In this case, Ange, the princess of the kingdom, is outed as a Norma (a person without magic) on the day of her coming of age ceremony or something because of some conspiracy plot coming from her own brother. Ange is detained after her mother is killed and is brought to a concentration camp, where she is stripped of every last piece of her human dignity.



Now I’ll get on with the positives and negatives about the show:

Positives:
-Great character development and progression, and not only for Ange.
-Great fun, mechas, explosions, titties, unga bunga and all that.
-Interesting enough setting.
-Great villain until a certain point.
-Music's great
-Some types of character interactions that I’ll later get more into

Negatives:
-Some weird logic jumps and a couple situations requiring a little bit more suspension of disbelief than normal.
-It has one of the worst decisions of anime direction I’ve seen in my life.
-Ending is alright, but villain is nerfed.

Now, as I’ll explain some of these pros and cons, I’ll get into some minor and later some major spoilers.



Character development yeah, Ange is great; she starts off as the most sheltered and spoiled brat on possibly the whole planet. She never had to do anything by herself so she didn’t even know she couldn’t use magic, and her maids did literally everything they could to cover it up.
Now she gets sent to this concentration camp for Normas (people without magic) where you get abused, raped and all that for sport, and either you fight some literal dragons or you die.
Ange, being the spoiled little shit that she is, doesn’t want to do anything and actually still believes that all this is just a misunderstanding and that her family will soon come rescue her, denial and all that.
The thing is, every selfish, sheltered action Ange takes, will later become a slap in the face for her, getting other girls and even her own commander killed (who had actually raped her before whoops); she will be obviously hated and ostracised.

This lends itself to a constant but sufficiently slow character progression to be credible, where Ange ends up becoming the chaddest of them all.
Some other characters get their own share of character development and progression, and it’s decently well done, but obviously Ange is the main focus of the series, and in my opinion it’s just great.

Major spoilers for villain, but he’s kinda great. At least up until episode 22.
He’s menacing, he’s clever, he has everything under control. He’s one of those villains that will be waiting for you drinking tea everywhere you go. He’s op, has control over space and time, is immortal basically and can control human sensations with a mere touch. Don’t forget he can also control all magic users telepathically. He’s in no rush to accomplish his plan and revels on manipulating people and taking them to his side. I was actually invested and wondering how they were going to defeat him, he seemed too powerful to even defeat. But oh well, he kinda got nerfed for the finale and that’s it.

casually sipping tea while torturing the protagonist

Before I get into “the great stink” I have to point out something that actually surprised me involving some character interactions. With anime, and actually also western media it usually happens that when there is a confrontation, everyone is very polite and listens to every word the other has to say, as if it was a Dhar Mann video. For example let’s say some character betrays another, and usually you’d expect something like “wah, you betrayed me!” “yes, you see: cue the 5 minute flashback or whatever explanation they come up with”. Not in Cross Ange though, people get interrupted or shot without a word when their intent is made clear; and that was honestly refreshing to see.

Now drum-roll, for the actual reason i made this review, to vent about the shittiest decision, the biggest stinker of them all, and this involves some major spoilers.

How great was episode 21, how intense it was, how fun and unexpected and all that, great sacrifices from some important characters to save the ones they love etc; just to be shat on by the last 5 minutes of episode 22 in one of the most glaring “fuck you” moments I’ve seen in my life.

You see, Momoka and Tusk weren’t really dead, and didn’t sacrifice themselves to save Ange. Even though Momoka was shot in the heart, then ran over by a car, then fell down a cliff, then the car fell on her, then exploded, she had a literal pan, like a cooking pan on her breast so she was fine :) . And the biggest offender Tusk, he literally blew himself up, terrorist style, with an explosive belt and everything. But no, it’s actually revealed in the episode preview for chapter 23 that, in the exact moment the explosion went off, he ninja changed into some anti explosive armour and then used a body double technique to get out of there, and this is canon, I’m not even making it up i swear.

""nobody likes persistent men!""
So yeah, while this anime isn’t usually afraid to go all the way, and doesn’t really pull its punches, this happened, which i gotta say, took me out of the experience for the rest of the ending.
img620()
""hey babe did you miss me, that plot armour sure came in handy""

Overall a great experience, has the best and worst of anime, really fun to watch with friends or family, loved it and hate episode 22 with all my soul: 8/10
Feel free to disagree with me of course, but know that if you do, you’re wrong and have no taste."
21425,"This review was originally written in Russian, so I apologize in advance for anything sounding unnatural in English. The review also  contains spoilers for some plotpoints.

The original [Black Butler](https://anilist.co/anime/4898/Black-Butler/) anime from the 2000s was quite a mess of an adaptation, being more filler than manga cannon, with a 2nd season entirely composed of """"anime canon"""" content. However, starting with Book of Circus each of the newer adaptations were better and better. One constant issue amongst all of them however stems from their formats ([BoC](https://anilist.co/anime/20606/Black-Butler-Book-of-Circus/) only having 10 eps, [BoM](https://anilist.co/anime/20670/Black-Butler-Book-of-Murder/) being only an OVA, BoA being a movie). They have to cut quite a lot of the original source material, shorten the dialogues that take place, not to mention they remove a lot of small details that gives us a better understanding of Ciel’s personality in the manga which in turn makes him a flatter character in the anime. Book of the Atlantic is no different.

To begin with, they cut quite a lot of conversations that take place early on in the film, which makes newly introduced characters like Lizzie’s family seem a bit one dimensional. (Ronald Knox is technically not a new character, but this is the first time he has such a large role in any arc and yet they cut quite a bit of him, which made some scenes of his feel a bit disjointed.) They also for some reason include the 2 Charles in this arc when they are nowhere to be found in the manga, not to mention their appearance is kind of pointless in the film anyways? Time we spend seeing those two we could’ve spent watching the canon content they removed, but alright.

Some content they removed, I believe for no good reason:
Small bits of info about who the Grim Reapers are reaping in the film. First when the very first zombie we see kills her own mother, we learn about who the mom was while in the anime she’s not named at all. Later, Ronald and Grell have a conversation where the former starts naming some of the people on their list. In the anime he just says they have a lot of souls to reap so they should get to it. The thing is, while obviously it’s not like any viewer is going to remember the names and birthdays of every character that’s on screen for a split second, whether a victim is presented as just a number or as an individual with a name has a huge effect on most people, so cutting it feels like a waste.



This is just a small detail, but they also made some horrendous choices visually. Terrible, out-of-place 3D models aside, they turned one of the coolest parts of the manga arc (which are several pages of zombies attacking humans on the ship, no dialogue, just pages showcasing true terror sweeping through the ship) into a few second montage with a PowerPoint-esque transition slapped on top of it. Just way less cool. 

img200() img200() 
img200() img200()

img 400()
Also looking at this screenshot I realized they literally just reused the same like 9 scenes multiple times...

Also, and this the last complaint about the visual choices in the film, but why on God's Earth did they choose to put sleeping masks on the zombies instead of the lace thing they had on their eyes originally?   Seeing it for the 1st time made me actually laugh out loud. 

The good bits
Although I’ve been doing nothing but dragging this film for the past few paragraphs, I still overall had a pleasant experience watching it. Firstly, the voice acting as always was great, which isn’t surprising since that’s the one area Black Butler never lacks in. o7 
Additionally, the background music was also always fitting and definitely set the right tone for each scene. 

A very small detail, but they included a scene of Ciel cringing at himself for having to do the Phoenix pose again, which doesn't happen in the manga but was a very cute and accurate detail to add. :)

(It can be seen at 0:24 in the background)


Why I'm being so nitpicky
The thing that haunts every adaptation made of Black Butler so far is that they could've been so good, with the right budget and actually enough time. Of course I don't think a 1:1 adaptation of anything is possible, but there's so much of content from the manga cut with each adaptation that the end result always feels very skin and bones. Not to mention neihter the old artstyle of the original show, nor the ugly 3D models of the newer ones are easy on the eyes, so while the ""just read the manga"" cope is something said about any anime under the sun, Black Butler is one of the rare cases where it 100% applies. The manga's artstyle is beautiful, you'll still get the exact same story and more, and the cast doesn't feel like carbon cutouts without personalities.

To cut the team behind this film some slack, they had to squeeze 2 whole manga volumes and some more into just one film, so I understand why they chose to cut some stuff. 

Overall a fun experience with some quirks you'll just have to overlook. 

The complete flame in our chests shall not be extinguished by anyone. We are The Phoenix."
7193,"Aoi Bungaku Series is an anthology of six adaptions of classic Japanese literary works that share similarities in their sinister overtones as well as the general era in which the original works were written. The series attempts to convey a stylistic array of provocative commentary on the human condition whilst maintaining a heavy emphasis on pathos, and, to an extent, succeeds. The final result is a mix-mash of both individual stories and overall quality, dark and disturbing, yet definitely not without its flaws. 

Given the structure of the series, it's best if I give my individual thoughts for each of the six arcs, as there are major discrepancies in terms of production quality and overall effect. 


The first and longest of the six arcs,  No Longer Human is the flagship story of the series and focuses on the demise of teenager Yozo Oba as he enters a cycle of depression, substance abuse, sex and insanity. The arc excels at establishing a tenuous relationship between the main character and the audience, where his emotions  and angst are communicated with disturbing vividness, prompting a sort of apprehensive sympathy. Similarly, it does a brilliant job at presenting the world as an ubiquitously twisted and troubled one, where the general feelings of disgust in our main character are easily understood and to an extent, even justified whilst setting the atmosphere for the rest of the series. 



My biggest qualm with this segment lies in the development of Yozo's character. We never really gain an in-depth insight into the reasoning behind his demise. Sure we grasp the basics, but we never fully understand the intricacies behind his psyche at the different stages of his life. Whilst the feelings of sorrow, guilt, humiliation and fear are easily comprehended, the cause of these feelings isn't, and thus all we're left to follow is a disturbed man lacking in any substance. The pacing of the story is also questionable, where awkward flashbacks and time skips leads to the arc becoming slow and repetitive. Visuals are characterized by a dull color palate which works well in establishing the mood, same can be said with the soundtrack (a trend maintained throughout the series).  No Longer Human succeeds in drawing our attention, but it doesn't perform so well in conveying anything besides the general themes and emotions. 



Probably one of the most perplexing of the stories, this arc focuses on a countryside bandit who falls in love with a city woman he captures and marries. On the visual level, there is an immediate shift from the sombreness of  No Longer Human to the bright and vivid style of  In the Forest, with even a few quirky jokes here and there. Make no mistake, however, as the sinister and violent undertones are just as prominent here as they are in the first arc. Personally, the juxtaposition between visuals and atmosphere wasn't as much unsettling as it was distracting, but you may think differently. 



It was rather interesting to observe the progress of our two main characters, ultimately culminating to a somewhat challenging conclusion that really makes you think about what this arc was trying to communicate. If anything, there is a heavy emphasis on self-awareness and self-understanding, where the consequences of not being able to grasp the truths of one's own character and nor being able to penetrate the outer-fronts of others may be incredibly dire.



One of the more fleshed out stories, this arc follows two friends, a physically imposing monk and a more refined man as they compete for the affections of the same woman. What this really excels in is structure, where two episode are dedicated to the story, one from each man's perspective. As such, an immensely deep insight is gained into the two different characters, where stereotypes collapse and motivations and actions are explained, leading to interesting commentary on the jealousy, prejudice and mutual misunderstanding common to both men. It ultimately is rather tragic, and a sort of poetic beauty is established. This is easily one of the better arcs.



My personal favorite of the series,  Run, Melos! once again has a unique structural presentation where it follows a playwright writing a version of the classical Greek tragedy ""Run, Melos"". This leads nicely into a mise-en-abyme scenario, where we have a play within the events that are actually occurring, which is utilized to great effect. Our young playwright struggles, however, as he does not agree with the themes of the play due to a past experience where he was seemingly betrayed by his best friend. The end result in a beautifully orchestrated story which addresses the question 'is it more painful to wait or to keep someone else waiting?' Our characters are incredibly dynamic, as both childhood friends are constantly transitioning between embodying either Melos or Selinuntius respectively, which in turn raises some interesting questions regarding the fickleness of trust and conveys various emotions of guilt and despair. It gets a bit melodramatic at times, although considering its roots as a Greek tragedy, it's forgivable. The production quality was notably of a higher standard, and this arc is easily the most uplifting.



 The Spider's Thread follows a violent outlaw and his journey into hell whilst  Hell Screen addresses a painter who feels obligated to paint the atrocities of the world around him; both take place in the same setting. An intense and vivid visual style is utilized, which leads to some truly spectacular and confronting scenes. There two arcs are undoubtedly the most simplistic, each only a single episode long- and it shows. The main characters in both stories are horrendously underdeveloped and are molded to fit a single, archetype/caricature in order to convey the principal themes. Speaking of which, the principal themes aren't particular complex either, and the commentary presented is more or less a simple statement of a particular aspect of human nature (with a heavy focus on self-egotism) as opposed to an actual exploration of said aspect.  The end result are two stories that, although successful in effectively emphasizing these various aspects of the human condition, (there's some interesting stuff on artistic integrity thrown into the mix as well), are lacking in any real depth of character or analysis. 



Whilst the stories of  Aoi Bungaku do an excellent job at conveying emotion and atmosphere, some do a far better job than others at presenting genuinely thought-provoking material. This inequality can be attributed to a number of things, whether it be actual construction or how dynamic the characters are. Ultimately, it is this discrepancy in depth that prevents the series from being truly amazing. Horror fans in particular are sure to get a kick out of this."

Mayumi Doujima's fate changes when she meets five unique boys in search of a star she saw only once ten years ago. Her beautiful story of finding herself and other mysteries unravels with the Pretty Boy Detective Club!

There will be some spoilers in this review.




The anime begins with introducing Mayumi Doujima, who seeks out the help of the Pretty Boy Detective Club to find a star she saw when she was younger. After the club deals with her case, she joins the Pretty Boy Detective Club, and take on lots of other mysterious cases. The story wasn't anything new or special, but I found it enjoyable. The finale was good, and I liked how we got to see them grown up in the future.



Overall, the characters were great and unique in their own ways, and each has a purpose to serve as a member of the club and the story. I will only be going over the main characters in the club.

img300(

Mayumi Doujima - She is the main heroine of the series; she was born with unique eyes so she can see objects and people far away and can see things that may be hidden to others. But her eyes can also be a curse, she wanted to become an astronaut, but because of the chance she may go blind in her adulthood, her dreams of being an astronaut were shattered. She then joins the Pretty Boy Detective Club.

img300()

Manabu Soutouin - He is the leader of the Pretty Boy Detective Club. Although he doesn't read the room sometimes and is not the brightest or smartest, he has a strong eye for beauty, and is always cheerful in times that are serious.

img300()

Hyouta Ashikaga - He is the ace of the track and field theme. He always wears shorts (even in winter) to show off his beautiful legs. Even though he acts cute, he can make dangerous comments and acts carelessly.

img300(

Michiru Fukuroi - He is known as a dangerous person and so people don't get involved with him at school. He is actually a great cook, uses a lot of satirical metaphors, and even has a family-orientated side of him.

img300()

Nagahiro Sakiguchi - He has a beautiful voice, great at speeches, and can copy other people's vocal cords.

img300()

Sousaku Yubiwa-  He is a child prodigy and has artistic and financial talents, but is a man of few words, thus not speaking very often and is very quiet.




img300()

The art was simply amazing, it's part of why this anime is good, especially since beauty and aestheticism are a big part of this anime. The art makes up for the slow parts of the show with long dialogue. The amount of detail that went into the characters and their surroundings and world should not go unnoticed. The animation was also amazing, the different angles of the camera were very unique and sets it apart from the rest.

The soundtrack and OST are good, and the opening and ending themes were great. This series also had two ending themes compared to the usual one per season and sung by the five boys' seiyuus. The opening theme is very catchy and personally I think it is the best opening of this season.




The voice actors were very well picked, they fit the characters very well, and make them and their personalities come to life. Some notable voice actors are Ayumu Murase, (Manabu Soutouin) who plays Shoyo Hinata from Haikyuu!!, and Toshiki Masuda, (Michiru Fukuroi) who plays Eijiro Kirishima from My Hero Academia.




Even though the characters were great, there are some qualities that they have which just feels like they took from Ouran characters. A notable example is Sousaku, which reminds me a lot of Mori, since they both have similar hair and the same trait of being the quiet character. I also think that the stories and characters would be slightly better if each of the boys had more screen time for their backstories. I also disliked Kodaki Kawaike, (Nagahiro's fiancée) and preferred if they had annulled their engagement, since their parents had forced them into this engagement with no choice, and she was too young.



Pretty Boy Detective Club is like Ouran High School Host Club, Toilet Bound Hanako-kun, and Bungo Stray Dogs combined into one. The characters remind me of the characters in Ouran. If you enjoy aesthetically pleasing art in anime, mystery or a tad of romance, then I would recommend these anime:

Pretty Boy Detective Club is an enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing anime. I loved the message at the end: to cherish the present and look back on all the good memories you made. Nothing lasts forever and everything changes eventually, but some change is good. I believe it's the new Ouran High School Host Club. I really enjoyed this, and I can’t wait for others to discover this new, underrated anime.

This was my first review, thank you for reading."
12031,"Kingdom is one of my favorite mangas, having stumbled across it by chance after sinking my teeth into Vagabond some years ago. Finally digging into my ever-growing anime list, I randomly picked Kingdom's anime adaptation as my next viewing experience (thank you cool feature of AniList).

To be honest, for 2012, it looks really well: the animation, the artstyle, it's pretty good... when it's not using CGI. I'm not really sure who greenlit this, but the CGI here is horrendous and quite possibly the only tell this is a 2012 anime all things considered. While it gets better as the season goes on, there seems no be no rhyme or reason surrounding its usage. One moment it's a normal dialogue, next frame it's suddenly CGI. It does look decent enough for the wide shots and panoramic views of the battlefields, but whenever it goes for close-ups, it looks horrendous. This goes double for characters. Early episodes with CGI Shin show him with very jittery and ugly facial features, especially mouth movements, while the few one-on-one battles feel very clunky. By the end, Houken vs Ouki (one of the biggest highlights and pivotal moments in the story, even now), there's some reliance in CGI for some of its scenes, but it's used much more sparingly. Conversely, I noticed every scene Shoubunkun is in has him animated in CGI, which makes him feel weirdly 3D in the world - and to be honest, this disconnect between the regular 2D scenes having 3D-looking models is what makes the CGI look so bad.

Another bone I have to pick with it is the lack of any real violence and gore. If you've read the manga, you know most battles, if not all of them, have an overwhelming amount of bisecting, beheading and power-cleaving through soldiers. It's often how the manga tells you this character is strong, by how gruesome and effortless they can bisect a man. In here, blood is only shown on non-fatal cuts or stabs. Moubu and Houken's cleaves, for instance, just send their targets away with unfathomable strength, rather than the accustomed (and expected) experience of seeing soldiers getting physically cleaved in two. This makes some moments, like Moubu and Tou's spinning swings feel more over-the-top and silly than they ought to be. You can still get a sense of strength, but the lack of that visual, expected impact in a war anime really is disappointing.

When it comes to the material adapted, it skips the entirety of the Assasination Plot arc, which served to fuel the bigger battle of Sei's and Ryofui's faction past the starting throne usurper arc. Everything else is faithfully adapted, with the highlight naturally being Ouki himself and the battle of Bayou. The death of one of my favorite characters still has the same impact as it did back then when I didn't expect it, and to see it without CGI is honestly surprising, since the no-rules rule of its usage made me think they had restraint when it came to this scene, which is, once again, one of the pivotal moments in the manga. 

Overall, it's solid, past the clunky and distracting usage of CGI on the first episodes. But once it gets going, it knows better when and when not to use it."

STORY

The way they handled the story wasn't rly up to par with the manga, the show wasn't bad but it was definitely compressed, which is sad as the story is very amazing & each character gets it's fair share of screen time which in the anime was mostly skipped past, just to get to the fights or it was made into a quick flashback scene (do have to say i liked how they made those scenes)
But ofc it was still able to hype you up for the fights to come & still give some share of screen time to some of the characters (not as much as i wanted it to but oh well)
In the end i was still able to like it to some degree maybe because i already know the characters & their story.
CHARACTERS
The Characters in the anime didn't rly have much development, they get but a little bit of development as most just gets cut or is used in a quick flashback sequence of sorts, alot of the interactions between characters inbetween fights or right before them is also cut, which again sad as their is some amazing characterization in the manga, that makes you like a lot of the different characters even if you 1st hated them.
the anime rly just went with fights & just a little bit of development for some characters.
And it doesn't rly help when you know it has a big roster of characters but they aren't rly developed.
img()
FIGHTS
The fights were quite nice, the 1st few fights were quite nicely done, it made some impact & impresion on you, but not all fights were as good there were some that weren't executed as good or just didn't leave as big an impact as the others (or like the manga).
They were all quite smooth & fluid, aswell none of the characters were of model during fights or regular scenes.
The anime did struggle with making the fights as impactful & epic as the manga. (sad as the fights in the manga leave a big impact & lasting impression).
Some of the fights just didn't rly add that extra story & impact that the manga was known to do.

I do have to commend the studio for using real fighters to perform the different moves & the studio recreating them almost perfectly in the anime, the moves rly did look great.
img()
img()
ANIMATION
The animation was pretty decent, alot of people will prolly be put of by it being CGI but tbh it wasn't half bad & it had significantly improved since the 1st teaser trailer we got which honestly looked very bad, the final product made everything look much better & was pretty fluid when it came to the movements, ofc it had it's fair share of flaws, but that is ofc to be expected, CGI is still far from perfect but it has been gradually improving in shows & this show is def trying to make it look great.
Aswell it also made use of 2d imagery so not everything is CGI, there were a ton of scenes outside of fights(which are all full CG) that were 2d.
Which they nicely implemented & made look rly good and blend together quite nicely.
img()
MUSIC
The ost wasn't rly anything too special, most tracks aren't rly too memorable, atleast to me.
The OP was quite good, the ED wasn't rly my thing but it did quite nicely fit the show.
OVERALL OPPINION
In the end the show wasn't all bad but it wasn't able to rly convey the same emotion i had when i read the manga, but nontheless it had it's moments that were quite good & enjoyable.
so now we wait for part 2 & hopefully it's better & improved

(also this is my 1st full on review so i'm sorry if it isn't the best)"
7592,"Before reading the review I'd like to inform you that I've got a gripe with school kid based anime, especially the shonen small kid takes over the world type. No/minimum spoilers will be involved here; I'll start with the bad and end on a good tone.

The protagonist of this anime is a 13 year old boy who has the blood of the supreme leader of all demons, and such, by default he is to become their next leader. Now this is all fine and dandy, but the part I did not like was how they portray this child as an adult using his alter ego as an excuse.
Imagine a council of the most influential big bad yokai in that region listening to a 13 year old boy and following him as their one and only leader. perhaps because this said boy is stronger than any one of them as portrayed a while later in the show, while these ""powerful"" leaders are just all at his mercy and totally reliable on his for protection.
At some point of them mentions that he's had more power than the supreme leader, but the events of the plot show otherwise, and in the most insulting of manners.

Aside from my why are all anime about school kids pet-peeve, the main battles in this show just felt lack luster, the build-up takes longer than needed with the only constant being that the climax is underwhelming, sometimes so much that it's just sad. In addition to that, throughout the show, many fights have been put off for barely any reason, the bad guys keep running away, but the protagonist and his allies just sit there and look, at more than one point in the anime there's also that Power Ranger ""I'll just sit here and watch as my opponent powers up while I do nothing"" moments, which just makes me scream WHY!?

In addition to that, have ever played a game with max stealth skills where you crouch in front of an enemy and suddenly you're invisible? Well, some moments of this show gave similar vibes, where half a dozen standing guard still can't see the enemy approaching or running away.

And don't get me started on those ""Oh, I forgot I was actually strong"" Cliche moments where characters have and the next moment you know, the fight is over in one hit.

The GOOD:
It's surprisingly entertaining. If you're looking for something lighthearted and chill to watch, then this is for you. The innocence in this one is just nice, if you've watched 'Natsume yuujinchou' then you'll know what kind of vibes this one offers. The hilarity and peace in the children's and the yokai's everyday life is just heartwarming. I loved every moment of it. Character development is slow, but it's there, and it's nice to see them progress into realising that life is not all black or white.

I liked how many characters had a personality of their own, this part was well done in my opinion, as the plot continues, you see more sides of every character's personality. Not the most detailed or fleshed out, but just enough, it's there and it's likeable.

The Art is just beautiful, The variety of the Yokai in the mansion just leaves me astounded every time, and each of them are interesting in their own way, each of them given a time in the spotlight showing the different aspects of life in the mansion. The interactions they've got which each other, the sense of home that they've created, it all gives a sense of belonging that was well portrayed.

Overall I think this is an enjoyable show, kept me wanting to know what'll happen next, and didn't feel like  a slug to go through, despite it being somewhat childish and wishy washy with many things that barely make any sense. If you want something lighthearted with comedy, romance, and some action to watch, then this is the show. If you're looking for something well written and deep, then look elsewhere, you lose nothing by skipping on this one."
21874,"Some shows usually get a second season to expand on the shows universe while others like Trinity Seven get the movie treatment and with two to date, this is a show that might not be dying just yet. Also, there may be spoilers as usual.

Story
This story takes place after the events of the first season and there is a little introduction which takes up about four minutes of run time and with this being a fifty-five-minute movie, it's not really something that you should do. Anyway, the opening scene is actually a dream sequence with Arata being protected by Lilith which we would know later that it was also the final fight scene in the movie. The first actual scene we get is Arata talking about that dream to Lieselotte who is still in Selina body. From there it feels like another episode of T7 just with bigger stakes on the line with world destruction once again on the line this time, not by Arata.

The problem that I do have with this is the fact that 55 minutes (sorry 50 minutes if you cut the intro) is too short for a movie and just feels like an extended episode of the show instead of what it should be and that is the fact that it properly should have been at least twenty or so minutes longer. [6]

Animation
The animation for the movie has been kept up to standards that the TV series showed us with the dark colours being followed up throughout this movie bar a couple of scenes here and there where the colour scheme is a bit better but still on that sort of darkish tone that you are a custom to this series. [7]

Sounds
ZAQ is back in terms of singing the ED this time with the song ""Last Resort"". In my personal opinion, I actually do prefer this song compared to the original OP for the series. This is, of course, isn't something that I would imminently put on the anime playlist that I have but would be happy to listen to it if it was on the overall playlist. On the character side, the characters sound like how I would think they sound in my head. Ok, that might of sound weird because I think it was in my head while writing this. [7]

Characters
So most of the regular characters make an appearance and do the role that they usually do during the entire series. That is except for a couple of characters that suddenly switch motives for this movie. Now for me, this is something that they shouldn't really do as it sort of deflates their motives for these characters. Yeah, you shouldn't go and attack another demon instead to the main focus being the MC. But before that, we have to beat this demon lord who may I ask is essentially doing the same motive of destroying the world that these characters are in. So hooray for that and no real development throughout the entire movie.

The other new character to make an appearance in this movie is Lilim who only appears after Arata ""accidentally"" touch Lilith grimoire. But compared to the demon lord, at least we have some development (even if it was for this movie only) with the characters all being lovely to the new girl that is not of legal age. I didn't mind this addition to the cast as it felt like it was an addition that I could be able to get behind [6]

Final thoughts
This is a movie that if you haven't seen the series, you might not enjoy the movie but for people who have, then it's a good ride. I do feel like it was a bit short and maybe an extra ten minutes would give it justice"
17909,"The Eccentric Family: 
How to Live, Love, and Other Tanuki Recipes


This is a spoiler-free review for both seasons of 
The Eccentric Family


img()


Living is something that is always happening, it is not something you do. Life and self-actualization are not as convenient as most stories would have us believe, and The Eccentric Family understands this better than most. There is no coming-of-age singularity. Our identities are malleable and fluid, and they are largely shaped by the world around us and the community we inhabit. The simple beauty of living far outweighs the meaning of life.  



The foundation for the worlds that [Tomihiko Morimi](https://anilist.co/staff/108775/Tomihiko-Morimi) creates are always absurd and unruly, with a striking portrayal of people. The separation between the truthful people that inhabit his stories, and the mystical gambits that serve as their premise has never been so disparate as in The Eccentric Family. In spite of that, the poetry and wealth of meaning in the dialogue are a cut above what we come to expect from drama/slice-of-life anime. The wordplay using double entendres and syllepsis is splendid, even if they only capture a fraction of the original language. The challenges that come with adapting Morimi’s novels are often outweighed by the splendor of watching his imaginative worlds come to life, and this anime is perhaps the best illustration of that dichotomy across his adapted works. Trying to parse the logic of its world will leave you floundering, but that’s part of what makes The Eccentric Family so unique. It sweeps you into a magical world of possibility and gently guides you back to reality with the reflective nature of its dialogue and characters.

There are a few interesting creatives working on the project besides its renowned writer. [Yuusuke Takeda’s](https://anilist.co/staff/103102/Yuusuke-Takeda) art direction is as immaculate as always, but a bit more reserved compared to what we usually see from him. [Kumeta](https://anilist.co/staff/97662/Kouji-Kumeta) has grown as a character designer in part through his tandem work with Shaft on Sayonara Zestubou-Sensei, where the designs for the characters between anime and manga were in flux and constantly influencing each other, and the result is a realization of those efforts which would solidify his style that we see today. The music was done by [Yoshiaki Fujisawa](https://anilist.co/staff/116505/Yoshiaki-Fujisawa), who is a big-name lately, having worked on Revue Starlight, Mushoku Tensei, Land of the Lustrous, and many more impressive compositions. This was one of his first endeavors, along with his debut on Love Live. For as simple as the music is, it does a good job of keeping a consistent meter and tone with each shift no matter the mood of the scene.

Although much of the production elements are consistent across seasons, certain areas lose a smidgeon of their luster in the second half, but not enough to bother most viewers. The backgrounds and atmosphere maintain a wonderful cohesion. From the vibrant and bustling city of Kyoto, the serenity of the forest, industrial hellscapes and everything in between, it is one of the strongest areas of the visual presentation. The animated set pieces, such as flying houses and moving mountains, are full of life and lend a unique charm to the world, particularly in the first season. The character animation is subtle and expressive, elevating Kumeta’s simple designs. In all, you can see a lot of passion and care put into this project, which is typical of a lot of P.A. Works anime. This was a peak era for them, and The Eccentric Family is one of the best of the bunch.

Following the exceedingly relatable Yasaburou, we flit through moments in the lives of the characters, learning about the way they think and what drives them. Fantastical and ridiculous things happen, but so do menial and mundane things, such is life. The story teaches us about family and the meaning of a life well-led, and each character represents a different way to reach that understanding. It is also about the balance between modernity and tradition and the tribulations of maintaining our culture through that struggle. In the same breath that it espouses respect for the traditions that make up the culture it exhibits so eloquently, it also rejects those notions. Heritage is something we must respect and learn from, not be confined by. The structure of the narrative of each season is based around interweaving episodic tails tales about tengu, humans, and tanuki that coalesce into a dramatic finale. The lead-up to its suspenseful finishes loosely builds around itself as the series progresses. The form the story takes is fluid, fitting for a tale of tanuki, and although it never bothers to make sense, it is always truthful.

The magical imbuement in this world is a carefree exhibition that demands a suspension of disbelief, or an acceptance of the fantastical as something ordinary. The mysteries surrounding the death of Yasaburou’s father and the ominous Benten are drip-fed through the daily life of the Eccentric Shimogamo family. The foundational conflict that threads the narrative is something I could never quite wrap my head around, but as the series teaches us; stopping to ask why things are the way they are, makes them more difficult to enjoy. Humans eat tanuki and that’s that. The grim reality that the Friday Fellows (who name themselves after the seven lucky gods) and their infamous dinner represent is difficult to understand with a western lens. The hierarchy of society in the anime is modeled after Japanese and Kyoto folk-lore that most of us gaijin just aren’t all that familiar with, and there are plenty of intricate [cultural, historical, mythological, local, linguistic, and literary references](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7k2fny/uchoutenkazokutheeccentricfamilyaprimeron/) that simply fly over our head. That is to say, I still very much enjoyed the series despite a gnawing sensation that I wasn’t able to appreciate it as much as was possible. You can certainly educate yourself about these cultural idiosyncrasies, but it seems to go against the grain of the series’ intent to do so. Isn’t it much more enjoyable to just let it wash over you? As they say, you can’t have your tanuki and eat it too.

The Eccentric Family also explores the difficulty of following your heart while staying true to your self-image, sense of propriety, and social position. The struggle with personal identity and how we place ourselves within society is one befitting of the shape-shifting tanuki, but also extends to the proud and everlasting tengu, who exhibit a stoic and unchanging grace that drapes above the lives of the more earthly dwellers. A lack of propriety allows a certain freedom to bring people together. Yasaburou’s talent for tossing aside his ego is valuable in these cases, but being so carefree with your pride can come at the cost of your self-image within others. On the other hand, characters like the proudly alluring Benten or the stuffy Nidaime struggle to find meaning in anything other than themselves. This gives them power over others, but also the weakness and loneliness of hubris. The characters are a celebration of contradictions, and watching them navigate romantic entanglements, familial obligations, and pursuits of happiness feels exceedingly real to life. Learning how to live and love, and finding the different avenues of that is a challenge unique to each individual. The time spent with others imprints on us in a variety of inexplicable ways. Those closest to us are the ones we entrust with our inscrutable weaknesses, and the ones who provide us the greatest source of strength. This gives them the power to pierce us deeply, but with the understanding that these connections provide an invaluable source of belonging.

Considering the succinct and poignant characterization of the cast in the first seasons, the best way to expand on the perspectives of its themes is by introducing new characters. With them comes a plot-driven escalation that is at odds with a slice-of-life delivery, and so the second season relies more on the drama of its storytelling. There is a certain escalation required for this, even for a story as laid back as The Eccentric Family. The deeper we tread into the world of tanuki and tengu the more enticing it becomes, but the more difficult it is to understand, changing the impact of its mood. The whimsical nature of the anime wanes ever so slightly the higher the tensions of its plot rise. Like the novels it’s derived from, each story beat builds upon the last. Much of the second season retreads and reimagines many of the narrative beats of the first, but as the context changes, so does their result. The intensification of the narrative in the second half may appeal to some audiences, and the dips in presentation with the set pieces, character models, and background CG are not noticeable enough to impact the viewing experience much. The repetition of scene structure in the second season was a boon as much as it was a crutch. The predictability can be rewarding though. By watching the cyclical patterns created by tradition unfold, and seeing it tempered by the accumulation of experiences and the shifts in values that occur over time, we get to see the progress of the characters alongside their community, and because of it.

Like many of the anime stemming from Morimi-sensei's novels, an introspective calm is created through melding respect for life with a rambunctious appreciation for the wealth given to us by experiences. What it lacks in accessibility, it makes up for in relatability and fun... and “a fun thing is a good thing.” 

As with life, you’ll get from The Eccentric Family about as much as you put into it, and that's a recipe for anime that I can get behind.

>[Translation] When I told my editor, ""It's going to be difficult to compress it into 12 episodes. Should I just rewrite it to fit the right length?,"" he just ignored me, as if saying, ""You're just talking nonesense..."".  It's better to leave it to the professionals...... surely......!

- From: [Kuji Furumiya's (deleted) tweet](https://x.com/furumiyakuji/status/1808423017883795501) (Author of Unnamed Memory) | [mirror link](%3Fwidth%3D597%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dcd217d99365aef316aa1a2fdbdba6b640d1ac76b)



Classic Studio ENGI, when every reader’s dream of getting an anime adaptation for their favorite LN is finally realized and they see your studio being the one in charge of it, that dream just turns into a complete nightmare.

I don’t like writing negative reviews, and I rarely write reviews anyways, but something about this adaptation just rubbed me off the wrong way so I’ll try to articulate my thoughts here. To keep myself sane I’ll at least start off by listing the things that I did actually like about the adaptation because as much as I disliked it, I do still think there are some positives.

Firstly is the music. The opening and ending themes’ vibe and lyrics really fit the series. The BGM is nothing particularly outstanding but again, it just fits the series very well. I can see myself listening to the OST while reading the LN/Manga. I can’t say much in-depth about things like composition and melody so I’m basing this purely on my opinion and personal taste, simply put - I like it, it’s very good. 

Music: 85/100. 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpEdweWbHiU)
personal favorite track (opening)

Voice acting and cast choices were on point. Even the minor/side characters’ voices really fit how I envisioned their voices while reading the LN. In particular the standout performances for me are from Tanezaki Atsumi as Tinasha, and Kusunoki Tomori as Miralys. Atsumi has had a knack for voicing powerful mages that are hundreds of years old recently, and this time is no exception, she delivered a very engaging performance, especially with emotional scenes that I can appreciate despite all the problems I have with the script. Tomori voicing Miralys was a surprise for me, and even though her character in the show was effectively reduced to just being a one-off side villain (as with the other major villains in the story), I believe that she delivered an excellent performance despite the extremely limited amount of time that her character was on screen. 

Voice Acting: 85/100.

Animation was decent, particularly the early fight scenes, however it was definitely noticeable that they cut corners for the non-action focused parts for later episodes (horse riding scenes in particular, them riding on the horse with the way they just jaggedly spun around killed me inside). ENGI book move frontloading all the budget into the first few fight scenes to bait you into thinking you were watching a good show.


Animation: 60/100

Now, as someone who can say that Unnamed Memory is one of their favorite LN series, despite all of the things that I can respect about this adaptation, I cannot in good faith recommend this show to anyone. There is one simple reason for this - the pacing of the show is absolutely horrendous. Whose bright idea was it to adapt three volumes, more than a thousand pages, into a single cour 12 episode anime? It would have been better to just completely adapt the first volume or two instead, or at the very least follow the manga’s pacing, but with that they did it was pretty much impossible to follow the story if you’re only looking at the anime. Yes, the important plot points are adapted, and that’s the core of the story, but it's just completely skipping entire chapters of buildup in order to meet the 12 episode deadline.

The main problem with having this pacing is that a lot of the charm of the series is lost. For example, in between major plot points, there were side stories and mysteries that showed characters in lower stakes situations which allowed the characters’ individual personalities to shine and show actual development. These stories often foreshadowed major elements of the later plot and expanded a lot on worldbuilding. However - these were completely cut in the anime, which lead to the development of the two main protagonists’ romance (which is pretty much the focal point of the entire series) just feel completely forced and out of the blue without the proper context, and it also makes them a lot less likable. Example; an episode ago our two leads seemed like they were at the same distance as before, with Tinasha routinely denying Oscar’s advances, then suddenly a kiss happens and they act like this is completely normal? Obviously something happened, but we are not shown this at all. Those who are uninterested in reading the source material or wiki snippets are completely unable to see the full picture.

There is only the payoff to Oscar and Tinasha’s relationship, and none of the proper stepping stones to actually make it satisfying to see develop. It felt like they ripped the pages of the book which contained the main plot points, rewrote some parts of it, and presented it like a full story. It’s an absolute disservice of the source material. If they are planning to make the second cour keep up with this pacing that they’re doing, it will be an even worse mess.

Story: 30/100

If you’re completely new to this series, I would honestly recommend skipping this anime and go read the LN instead. If you still want to watch this after reading the LN, just treat it as a visualization of the important scenes (like LN illustrations), it will save you a lot of sanity.

I believe that adaptations should be made to elevate the source material and give a great viewing experience to both newcomers and those who were already familiar with the work equally, and painful as it is, Unnamed Memory completely fails on both of these regards."
1530,"The KeyAni adaptations, and harem visual novel adaptations in general, are beset by a tendency to relegate some, if not every, female character to a setup for an emotional punchline (figuratively and literally, as the narrative climaxes tend to involve the central character getting maimed, physically and/or emotionally). Once sympathy is maximally bled from the girl, she is disposed of either by narrative convenience or hasty preoccupancy with the next girl. This sadistic pattern emerges naturally from the harem visual novel, but what works in a video game doesn't translate quite well onto the TV screen. Television lacks the agency and immediacy found in games, so time devoted to developing a female character and her relationship to the MC becomes wasted once she is tossed for the next, never to have an inkling of relevance outside of ""best girl"" polls again. 

What are some ways to remedy this narrative disease endemic to harem VN adaptations? Toei's solution was the virtue of economic storytelling. For the movie adaptations of Air and Clannad, Makoto Nakamura stripped the source materials of their character and route multiplicities, resulting in typical monogamous romance tales. Consequently, they have fairly coherent narratives, yet they feel rushed and lack the wholeness of a fully realized story. How can an adaptation avoid the aforementioned flaws of a harem VN without abandoning the harem?

There's a cafe scene in Kanon's fourteenth episode in which one of the characters asks the MC, Yuuichi, if he recognizes the song playing over the speakers. The piece, Pachelbel's Canon, is not only the show's namesake but its narrative foundation. Like a canon, in which a melody, the leader or dux, is introduced and played again later in some form(s) of contrapuntal imitation, the main approach employed in Kanon's structure is the reiteration of narrative on multiple diegetic levels. The most pronounced manifestation of the canon is written into the broad history of Yuuichi's time spent in the snow-covered city. Over the course of the show, the current timeline is slowly revealed to be a repetition of past events from Yuuichi's last visit, setting the musical duration at seven years. Kanon chooses to present the past in an impressively seamless manner. Instead of inserting flashbacks at narratively convenient moments via battle shounen-style, Yuuichi rediscovers his history through dreams, which doubly serve as pacing buffers between the cycles of his daily routine. By bookending each day with a dream of the past, the events from seven years prior are incorporated into the current, and the discrete timelines begin to harmonize until the past collapses into the present.

The first couple episodes set Kanon's rhythm; each girl is introduced into the daily routine, coming in gradually as reiterations of a similar sob story from Yuuichi's forgotten past. The schedule is thus: wake up and eat breakfast with Nayuki and Ayu; walk to school with Nayuki; eat lunch with Sayuri and Mai; skip a bit of class to meet up with Shiori outside the school; eat taiyaki after school with Ayu; foil Makoto's nighttime pranks. Yuuichi learns something new about one of the girls with each iteration: one day he realizes Shiori may have a sister in his grade; the next day, he finds out Mai's birthday is upcoming and buys an impromptu birthday gift for her. It's never really predictable which of the arcs will be explored next; the show keeps you guessing by weaving important details about different characters together. This way, each arc is developed alongside another, and the show constructs a braided narrative rather than a segmented pastiche of the MC's romantic life. Motifs shared between the character arcs include hospitalized family members, novelties gifted by the MC (especially hair bands), forlorn promises, gastronomic affinities influenced by the MC, and wishes/dreams in media res. The arcs resemble each other, and though this type of bad writing is pathological in these adaptations, it actually works, whether intended or by happenstance, in favour of the show, establishing a main theme like a canon's dux. As in a canon, where the intricacies of the leader unfurl through repetition and interplay between its followers, these characters are developed steadily at intervals in the slice of life narrative.

The slice of life segments are employed with expertise here, ingratiating the viewers with each girl at a steady, repetitive pace. Repetition is key, even in the comedy found in the short manzai routines or the character specific gags (for example, Akiko's special jam became more amusing with each introduction to a new character's palette). As the days repeat, the daily narrative begins to denature and break down as the voices play out to their natural conclusion. The different arcs are explored and conclude, and respective characters drop out (Makoto disappears; Mai and Sayuri are hospitalized; Shiori is hospitalized) but not completely since they are permutations of the leading melody, and their presence can still be discerned in the remainder of the show (e.g. the snow bunny reminds Yuuichi of Mai creating a snow bunny zoo for her mother instead of Nayuki's confession, the spectral Makoto watches over Yuuichi during the climax of Nayuki/Ayu's arc.) Nothing feels extra or wasted, and each arc comes to a satisfying conclusion.

Kanon is a glimpse at what the ideal harem VN adaptation should be. Repetition espouses the harem, allowing each arc to resonate on its own yet tethering it to a thematic principle. That being said, the faithfulness to the magical realism of the source material undermines the tone at times. Makoto's arc can be given a pass, as her overwhelming desire-turned-to-miraculous incarnation has mythological and folkloric roots. A relationship with a fox-turned-girl may be morally dubious, but the concept isn't entirely strange. Rather than the miracle itself, the real hiccup is the show's explanation, opting to introduce an extraneous character who has had a similar experience and can thus elucidate and dispel the mystical. The show also delves completely into Makoto's arc for three episodes, ruining the pacing by returning to the typical isolated arc structure of a harem in which the rest of the cast is largely ignored.

Mai's arc is the guiltiest of flouting aesthetic distance; dark, shounen-esque sword battles with invisible demons run completely perpendicular to the light slice of life school routine. The supernatural mechanics are given a half-assed explanation: Mai's healing powers somehow manifested themselves into fake beings with real, tangible consequences? The reasons are unidentified (not that everything needs to be; mystic and vague circumstances are often a given when dealing with supernatural phenomenon and are part of the appeal), but when a how is more or less provided, it's only natural to question the why. Her arc comes to a climax when she impales herself with her sword, after which she walks away completely unscathed. The scene is full of such bombast and unwarranted melodrama that the show, for the first and only time, truly flaunts its Key genetics. Thankfully, the subsequent arc, Shiori's, proves to be the most mature and profound, staying entirely grounded in realism and containing only one crying scene (of which is not even enacted by the arc's heroine). Interestingly, the final arc explores two characters, Ayu and Nayuki, simultaneously. As a sort of coda, the last episode restores Yuuichi's harem by revisiting the daily schedule, thus completing the Kanon.

As an addendum, I'd also like to praise the OP. The sweeping medium shot zoom in/outs are absolutely breathtaking; it looks as if a camera was actually used."

〈 A chest of treasures... 〉

It goes without saying that the first season of Ousama Ranking has an extremely captivating style and energetic personality that pulls the viewers right in. In a way, it confidently wears its enthusiasm and uniqueness on its sleeves, which is a genuinely commendable trait. As a result, I and many others were very eager to see what it had in store for us.

However, despite the awesomeness of these fantastic elements, they were unable to save the anime from its biggest and most glaring flawᅳthe primitive and lacklustre writing that is not only unfocused and all-over-the-place but also has no idea how to push the story forward. In simpler terms, the writing is to blame for how the show turned out, and I will never get over the fact that it made the entire experience so lukewarm, aimless and tasteless.

With that in mind, my expectations for The Treasure Chest of Courage were minimal. In spite of that, I had at least hoped that, unlike its ""parent"" series, it would try to experiment with the formula and explore fresh, fun ideas. I longed for compelling stories that would utilise the anime's shining personality to its fullest potential while delivering unforgettable moments and imagery. As it turned out, this burning desire to witness creativity was swiftly extinguished since this collage of side stories is harsh, brutal proof that the visual charm and surface-level allure are all the show has to offer.


If we ignore [Ouken's ](https://anilist.co/character/260808/Ouken) somewhat fascinating backstory for a moment, it will become painfully clear how predictable and unimaginative the other tales the show features are—their structure rigidly follows well-established tropes, which, in turn, deprives them of any sort of surprising twists or exciting developments. On account of that, every single thing the series presents to the viewer comes off as wishy-washy and substanceless. There is no flow or synergy between them, as they are randomly pieced together without any consideration for chronological order or coherency. The characters' hardships come and go without real importance or impact, and the problems they face are always quickly overcome and cast aside. Consequently, there is no excitement to be found here, which makes it difficult to sink your teeth into anything the show depicts.

While incorporating noble morals and values into the plot is indeed a neat thing, it is infuriating when the show can only portray plots that lead to everything-is-perfect, happy-go-lucky conclusions without any complexities or nuances that make stories truly effective and efficient. It is through the exploration of ""the grey""—the tango of light and darkness, respect and depravity, bliss and sorrow—that narratives succeed in being special, memorable and touching. However, The Treasure Chest of Courage remains narrow-minded throughout its run, and it only allows the sunniest, happiest and most one-note problems, questions and solutions to take centre stage. In doing so, the anime denies itself the chance to delve into the more complex and engaging parts of its very interesting, quirky world and characters, and abandons the gravitas it could and, most definitely, should have.

In a way, The Treasure Chest of Courage is an example of how critical taking risks and experimenting with the plot's foundation is in shaping the effectiveness of a story. No matter how stylish, majestic, or beautiful a series may be at first glance, without solid writing, it will inevitably cower beneath its ambitions and fail to impress its audience. Both the first season and this spin-off ultimately fell victim to their inherent flaws and determined that walking the path of least resistance is enough to win us over. That, obviously, did not happen; they could have been regal but turned out to be peasant-like, which is a truly saddening sight.

〈 ...yet the riches are fake. 〉"
130549,"RE-MAIN is about a water polo champion who at the start of the series is greeted with a car accident. Not only does he suffer a coma he wakes up with amnesia, now having to rebuild his love from water polo again.


 Misleading Advertisement    

This by far is one of the most intriguing intros to a sports series I've ever seen, so I was extremely excited. Turns out the series ended up being 75% about the character development of the characters, and 25% about the actual sport. You'll have to wait to till the very end of the series to actually see them preform a full game. The rest of them is primarily the cast alone at practice and learning to deal with the own emotional adversities. 

The main poster of the anime, as well as the trailer that Funimation had rolled out definitely gave out the vibe that the series was either about water polo/a mix of how the drama effected the water polo, so it felt very false advertised so I spent a large portion of the anime upset that they weren't really going to showcase the sport. 

There are two kinds of sports anime; sports anime that focus only on the sport (like Haikyuu) and sport series that divide the sports with the drama in half (like Kuroko no Basketball). This show barley passes for a sports anime. For such a short series, I think it they needed to sacrifice some of the drama in the earlier eps for a (full) practice game to have even the balance. 
 
 Character Development  
This was the main focal point of this series. Our main hero, Minato, personality is constantly changing through the episodes. His adventure from discovering what his past started off very interesting seeing I have personally not tackled series that have dealt with amnesia before. However, by the end of the series they took a very cliche route (despite them quite literally in the series saying they wouldn't) and it became disappointing. 

Aside from Minato, it was refreshing to have a team that for the most part were newbies and were struggling with their own demons but excluding Minato, the team captain was the only other team member I thought had a compelling storyline that remained fresh throughout the series. Shuugo, one of his teammates, also had notable transformation but his character was not charismatic enough for to truly enjoy his growth to the fullest. 

 OST & Animation  
The animation was standard but on the higher end of the spectrum. Their choice of when to use CGI was fair as CGI goes, no complaints there.For the few times they did play the sport, the animation pulled through. The OST was forgettable. Not to be misunderstood with bad, I just wouldn't be able to recite anything from the series or identify it if someone played it for me without context. I don't think they choose to use OST a lot, but I think it really could've helped some of the moments for the extra kicker.

 Overall  
The series was O.K. I would never go out of my way to rewatch it, but if a new season came out I would probably watch it with a small hope they try to obtain an even balance ratio of game to drama ratio. It would also be interesting to see how they would pursue Minato's character development, seeing the amnesia route can only last for so long. I do truly believe this series should've been advertised more as a drama. As a graphic designer, this mistake probably costed them a lower rating due to accidentally attracting an audience who had initially came for more action. I think if one goes into the series with knowledge that it's more of a drama, they'll have a better liking to it than I."
20583,"Never have I been so thoroughly disappointed by a work of fiction. A complete waste of what seemed like a very interesting premise. I can't fathom the incompetence of every individual in the series; Nana has no control or oversight over her loose cannon subordinates, Naoto proves himself completely unable to perform even the simplest security-related tasks, and Noa, despite being a professional idol, fails to behave with a single ounce of charisma or likability. Pretty much any of the plot conflicts could have been solved with just a little more communication between members and departments. While this is certainly true of many plots, I'm holding it against the show because it is constantly implied that the JRF is a highly efficient, well-oiled machine, yet it's clear that every single member is not only under-trained, but also a poor fit for their role.

Perhaps I am being overly harsh; I started watching it because I read the description and got excited to see the dynamic of a spunky, persistent team as they unraveled a continuously expanding, high-stakes conspiracy threatening the well-being of their organization, and by extension, their country. I was looking forward to seeing the protagonist grow from a naïve high-schooler with a rose-tinted view of the rail industry and an adoration of trains struggle to redefine his impossibly idealistic expectations of the job to meet the harsh, yet reasonable, reality.

What I got was 288 minutes of the platonic ideal of bad anime. Every member of the main cast is a one-dimensional plank that remains completely static throughout the entire run, and the supporting characters are forgettable and capricious. I don't think there was ever a point where I felt like I truly understood a single character's motivations. Every character seemed to behave in a completely inscrutable way, and the word vomit that they try to explain the plot with would probably be worse than just not explaining anything at all. The bit about freezing electrons to stop them from flowing is a particularly poorly written plot point that just totally broke my suspension of disbelief. I think the thing that made it particularly bad is that there could have been any number of more believable ways that liquid nitrogen could have been used to disarm or delay a bomb explosion.

I'm also mad that Shou was sidelined. He's easily the most unique and potentially useful member of the team, yet almost never interacts meaningfully with the plot, and hardly ever gets a speaking line. He probably could have been replaced with a dog and the plot still would have worked (and he still would have been the most interesting character).

The only solace was the one (occasionally two) train tidbits in each episode. However, even though the trains should have been the stars of the show, I would be willing to bet money that the amount of animator-hours spent drawing butts and boobs was at least 3x higher than the amount spent drawing trains. I would have given this show at least a 6 if it consisted of just a montage of the train facts. Heck, if they took out the bad writing in the plot-heavy and fanservice parts, and increased the train focus, I could see it being a 7 or 8.

Also, I counted, and out of the ten named characters who show up in more than one episode, seven of them serve as love interests for the main character. Like sure, harem is a genre with a non-negligible fanbase, but this seems like overkill. Is it even possible to enjoy the implied romantic relationships when literally every female character with a name (except one) falls in love with the main character?

I would like to say my disappointment is immeasurable, but it's pretty easy to measure; I'd say I wanted this show to be about a 6 or 7, and it ended up being a 2. Frankly, there's no one to blame but myself since I only read the description and not the genre tags, and as a result, ended up expecting PSYCHO-PASS in a world of nationalized trains instead of the oops-all-tsunderes harem anime I should've expected."
1559,"Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple is a fun and inspiring anime that centers around martial arts and personal growth. The story follows the journey of Kenichi, a weak and timid boy who joins a dojo and trains under six different masters, each with their own unique style. Throughout his journey, Kenichi faces numerous challenges and adversaries, while also forging friendships and undergoing significant personal development.

Humor and comedy play a significant role in the show, particularly through Nijima, the cunning leader of Kenichi's club. While the story itself may not be overly complex or original, it remains engaging and motivational, delving into themes such as fighting for a cause, conquering fear, and discovering one's true path.

The dub voice acting is well executed, adding to the overall enjoyment of the series. However, it is worth noting that the show's length can be a bit excessive, and at times, it falls into repetitive patterns as Kenichi progressively battles stronger opponents one by one. This can become monotonous over time, although it effectively showcases his growth and unwavering determination.

Undoubtedly, the standout moments of the show occur when Kenichi's masters take center stage and exhibit their exceptional skills. Each master possesses their own captivating qualities and distinctive traits. Personally, my favorite is Shio Sakaki, the karate master, who is not only funny but also tough and loyal. However, all the other masters are equally impressive, showcasing their own unique personalities and quirks.

One aspect that could have been improved upon is the portrayal of the passage of time between fights. The show often gives the impression that Kenichi is continuously engaged in new battles day after day or week after week, which somewhat strains believability regarding his rapid improvement. A more realistic approach with additional downtime and training scenes would have enhanced the overall credibility of the narrative.

Additionally, it's important to note that while the ending of the season provides a satisfactory conclusion to that particular arc, it doesn't bring closure to the entirety of the show. Unfortunately, since there won't be any further episodes, Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple remains an incomplete story. While this may leave some viewers wanting more and longing for a definitive resolution, it doesn't diminish the enjoyment and value found in the episodes available.

In conclusion, Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple is a lighthearted and uplifting anime that effectively combines martial arts with valuable life lessons. While it may not be groundbreaking or flawless, it remains an entertaining and worthwhile watch, offering a blend of humor, inspiration, and personal growth."

This is a very difficult series to really approach. I tried watching the first episode of this a few times, but ended up forgetting about it each time. It's absolutely a slow burn sort of ride, but one that is absolutely worth sitting through. The dialogue and writing in this story are all done in such a way that feels uneasy. Not quite stiff, but not totally natural; all coming together to form what I would consider an extremely specific atmosphere for the series. An atmosphere that is only heightened by how beautiful the animation, art style, and artistic cuts shown within it art. As I continued through the episodes, that slow or otherwise dull experience continued to build. The sense of uneasiness and teasing of something deeper gave way to an experience that is generally unlike any other that I've seen before. Two parallel romance stories, each with their own unique woes and storytelling.

img()

A girl who can not remember past 13 hours, and a girl painfully afraid of being stranded alone again. A boy with no aspirations or hope for himself, and a boy with grandiose aspirations but no motivation to see them out. An extended mystery and other relationships which develop as a result of these stories. There are many moving parts like this in the series, though none of which are quite perfectly connected. Each character fully immersed into their own lives, their own way of thinking, and their own motivations. An unexpected deep dive into themes of loneliness, depression, anxiety, unrequited love, insecurities, a sense of self, and many other deeper subjects.

Until the final episode, I was left uncertain of how things could be resolved and of what path this intricate story would take. The end result was an immensely fulfilling romance, and one that sets itself apart from any other in the genre. I feel as if this was unlike the vast majority of anime that I have seen, and am confident in saying that this series can be considered a masterpiece in my eyes. Based on a sequence of renowned visual novels, I also hadn't previously thought of the potential of visual novels as a medium for telling stories with this degree of depth.

This series has helped to define the medium of visual novels, and spark much more interest in me for reading more. As fan of manga and light novels, the source material for various anime takes many forms. Stories are told in many forms, and I feel as if the medium which an author uses to tell a story can be used to great effect for setting a very particular atmosphere and truly telling a story the way that they want it to be told.

Visual novels can be a lot more than I had given them credit for. Furthermore, anime continues to surprise me with how many gems are out there. A series so discreet and so hidden away that it's no longer licensed to watch through any legal streaming platforms. One that I own physically and had neglected to watch for so one. Yet one that I'm sure I'll remember as one of the most influential romance anime to me; not just for its romance, but for the experience it provided which was entirely its own.

I'll leave off with the opening, which I feel is in and of itself very unique due to its own storytelling and artistic choices. There is a lot of value in this opening for someone that has watched and/or read this story, and symbolism is carried through this series from start to finish.

21815,"Overview:

This may be in OVA form, but it is a continuation of the first season and actually a second season to the anime hence its naming they did. It covers 2 arcs in its 8 episodes one involving a beast from old times and the second being an artifact from old times to put it as simple as possible. There was definitely the `No Sempai, This is our fight!` but it is nice to know it’s not hammering down at you several times an ep which some hated from the first season. It never bothered me but when people pointed out to me how much she truly said it I did get a laugh out of it. Back to the main 2 arcs, the first one spans 3 episodes and takes place on the main island with a threat that is shown to, if left alone, would bring about destruction to everything and would not stop until everything is destroyed. Our Boi, Akatsuki Kojou is not about to sit by and watch it happen though. He gets himself in gear and deals with said threat in the end.

As for the second part we see more new faces, one of which is a nice surprise and when you see him will immediately know. This arc has a lot of organizations involved and can be a bit hard to follow everything that is happening due to the pacing being a bit fast. You are expected to keep track of quite a bit and a couple times I did rewatch some parts to better understand the situation and all the current events with who and what is involved. We are introduced to what appears is going to be a major plot point in the coming seasons and was hinted/shown a bit in the first season but a tad more expanded on here. The entire second arc was more of a setup it felt like for what is to come and brings out the who and what will be involved. Of course Kojou has expanded his harem a bit within these couple of arcs. The ones added are different enough from the others and have their own personality that keep them from being completely bland characters and I don’t mind seeing how they interact with the rest of the cast in due time. Should be some fun and interesting times ahead of us.

Visuals/Music:

The visuals, due to this being an OVA series look great all around. Everything is well polished and crisp. At times there are even smaller details such as one of the characters jumping up and when he landed the hair actually didn’t stay stagnate and went the way it would be expected. Nice little touches like that can be found throughout which is always nice to see. Since they are continuing the OVA style of season release we can only expect this trend to continue onward and no complaints there.

With the music you can tell thee wasn’t a lot of budget pushed forth into it. Not that it is bad by any means, but the variety seems to be lacking in OST choices per scene. The OST’s do match what is going on and are not out of place but would be nice to see a bit more variety in choices. It is an average soundtrack though and compared to the visual quality, the soundtracks are not up to par with it. The sound effects, nothing terrible either, they did their job and luckily have not followed that godawfully trend of mic rupture sounds when explosions or high impact attacks happen.

Final Thoughts:

Overall it’s a enjoyable watch and if a person has not seen the first season I highly recommend it but in comparison to this season it doesn’t hold up as good. I would say that is mainly due to the lack of episodes due to the route of OVA’s that they are taking. There just wasn’t much that happened throughout this season that would be standout and make a person go `Damn, that’s good`. We do however get to see a loli in her natural state hehe, Natsuki still best girl. The entire cast look good and even if a person was to watch it just because of the style of characters, it would not be regrettable by any means. Forewarned though, this is not a show for everybody and does contain some nudity with a fair amount of Ecchi throughout it.

```Overall Rating: 3/5```"

Girls Band Cry is surely the surprise that few people could have seen coming, due to the lack of interest from the community at the anime's launch, and also to the 3D aspect which has been much criticized in anime circles to date.
img()
img()
The anime quickly divided those who found the 3D ""disgusting"" ""despicable"" ""burns the eyes"", and those who found it lively and extremely enjoyable to watch x)

I actually made a post in the Episode 1 thread about this, and was very happy to receive so many likes in support of the good use of 3D in Girls Band Cry!

Messages below :

>People's relationship with CGI is always negative, whatever the quality. To say that the CGI is average would be to say that the anime is rather average in its animation, and that would be a lie. The CGI in Girls Band Cry isn't ""average"", it's objectively good. The dinamism is there, the scenery works well with 3D, the characters don't lack facial expression. In general, we tend to accept bad 2D rather than good CGI. 
-
Bad CGI is often recognizable with a lack of expression and jerky animation. I don't think ""Girls Band Cry"" can be considered average CGI.
-
img()

It's perfectly normal to take a dim view of 3D when it has more often than not marked catastrophic works such as the famous ""Berserk (2016)"". But since then, we've had good licenses like ""Houseki no Kuni"", which is today the pillar of ""Full CGI"" and the one that gave 3D its letters of nobility in anime. (I haven't seen the series). There's also ""Trigun Stampede"", to name but two. Even the CGI in ""Chainsaw Man"" was criticized when it came out, even though it was really very good.

Nor is 3D well promoted by some studios, who use it to make disgusting anime, which disgusts newcomers who discover that these animes are mostly aimed at maximum economy.

img()
Girls Band Cry is a ""band"" anime, like ""K-on!"" and ""Bocchi The Rock"", not an ""idol"" anime, as some people seem to confuse it.
Only ""Diamond Dust"" acts like idols, which was the main reason for Momoka's departure, so I highly doubt Momoka will want to follow the style that has been imposed on Diamond Dust! What's more, throughout the anime, the group makes it clear that they don't want to change their style to become more popular.

The main strength of the series already lies in the characters, especially Nina, the first character to be shown on screen and the very essence of the anime.
We're treated to a very lonely character, misunderstood by those around her, despised at school, and also very impulsive. Nina will then meet Monoka, who will enable her to convey her powerful feelings through song, and little by little Nina will take more and more initiative and confidence in herself, even going so far as to make decisions cruelly impacting her future.
!I really didn't expect this revelation about the reason for the argument between Nina and Hina, it made me love Nina even more x)!

For her part, Momoka remains a rather withdrawn character throughout the series, keeping her feelings to herself and finding it hard to reveal herself, even in the face of Nina's insistent temperament. It will take some time and a certain scene for Momoka to dare to move forward, but time is a good thing, so why solve a problem in a hurry when you can take your time.

Subaru will then come into play to bring a slightly more zany, light-hearted aspect to the group and the discussion between the girls.
Subaru hesitates between satisfying her family and living out her own ambitions, as many of us do during our school years.

Tomo's a pretty straightforward girl, and I recognize a lot of myself in the character, because I tend to be like that too. Generally speaking, we can offend people who don't know us. At the same time, I think Tomo's way of talking is a bit over the top, but she's still a very likeable girl with a very cute side. As for Rupa, all we know is that she's lost her parent, but the anime doesn't really go into it, so there's very little information. But Rupa is a bit like the group's mother, she has a very caring attitude towards the group and especially Tomo x)

The main role of ""Diamond Dust"" will be to give Nina and ultimately the group a sense of purpose, as well as Momoka's development.
Unfortunately, as in many series of this kind, whether it's an ""idol"" or a ""group"", the rivals don't get enough in-depth development.

Why is this anime so good? 

The characters are alive! They argue constantly, disagree, throw glasses of orange juice in each other's faces.
The characters don't say ""no, nothing"", they talk like we talk to our loved ones, they're not cute, characterized characters.
And the 3D gives such power to their exchanges, with such striking facial expressions!
We quickly become attached to these characters, who are more like us than like stereotypical Japanese characters.

The same goes for the music videos, which are incredible!
It's much better than ""Love Live Supertars"", which offers an already sublime 2D/3D mix, and much better than ""Oshi No Ko"" in Full 2D, which is nevertheless an extremely popular series.
The camera isn't made to stay in place, it spins, it flies, the characters move in such an energetic way through such powerful lyrics.
You really feel like you're at a live concert, farting your brains out!

I don't think anyone would have expected an anime with such striking force, be it in a story that was so classic but so real through every character in the anime!
The 3D sublimated the anime, with its color schemes, camera movements, and the powerful feel of the screen!

In short, Girls Band Cry is for me the anime of the season. I know that it won't be able to convince everyone, notably because of the presence of ""Full CGI"", but I'm terribly happy to have been able to discover a work with such a good atmosphere, and so full of emotion!

21382,"This visual novel was my childhood and you guys had one job and you managed to fuck it up more than Tokyo Ghoul after season 1. I never had so much hype for an announcement just to get my kneecaps beaten when we jump into the series in one of the most random parts in the visual novel, WHAT WERE Y'ALL SMOKING? I didn't understand why they thought it would be a great idea to start towards the end of Kagari's route. I don't know what the director was going for or who called where to start when it would've started off better staying true to the visual novel. Anyway just a huge disappointment with an anime that had so much potential and it having a unique story with such a unique and odd character like Kagari, as well as the route that between Kotori and Kotarou could've been so great to present in the series. I understand giving all the routes especially when I enjoyed Chihayas route as well as Lucias route  but it kills the drive of a story when you have such a good true route, and also if one specific route was just used to drive the story it could've cause people to become fans and check out the visual novel overall instead of giving a sour taste with most people dropping it after the first episode when they don't understand what's going on, so much could've been done to help create a fandom such as Clannad. I understand they made a second season but with how they butchered this season alone I'm not even going to waste my time to view it, it truly saddens me when I had such an excitement and vision of where this could've gone but well what can you do I highly recommend if you came into this series just watching the anime to check out the visual novel where you can see how amazing the story and routes truly are unlike how this anime perceived it. Key is such a unique visual novel company it's sad that this ended up being one of those bad ones but to check how their visual novels can truly be executed correctly in anime fashion I really recommend checking out Clannad as well as Kanon (2006) made by a masterful studio like Kyoto Animation. Overall, thank you to anyone who actually took their time to read my review turn rant about how one of my favorite visual novels got thrown away as an anime, I hope there are many of you who enjoyed the visual novel who can agree with me on how they really threw away a good opportunity on making something big.

121176,"Our beloved bookworm is back for yet another season, and it’s a little different what I had remembered from the excellent Season 2. The story went a bit away from the slice of life elements in creating new inventions and reading books, and we actually see a bit of stakes in this season, with dangers of Myne being kidnapped, and even some action sequences.

The reason why I loved this series was the slice of life elements which even felt a bit educational at times, and while those themes still exist in this season, it felt more action and politically oriented, which isn’t what I had known this series to be, but I understand the change of pace.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 17.5/25

It’s some of the same elements from the first two seasons, but the stakes seem a bit higher this time around. Myne has to be careful as many people from the nobility are targeting her, and it could even affect her family. In all these events, there are new characters, including Myne’s new younger brother Kamil, Dirk, an abandoned child with the Devouring, and Sylvester, a notable noble with a rather interesting personality. Each have their own quirks and contributions to the story.

In the most high stakes situations, the thing I found issue with was the execution of them. Things get solved rather easily at times, and the villains aren’t doing a whole lot of stuff in the fight scenes either, heck, sometimes the protagonists are just talking to each other while the fight is happening, and the villains are just off screen, standing there. It’s supposed to be tense, but the overall feel of the story or even the tense moments don’t present themselves in the most suspenseful way. With all the build up, it didn’t feel like an effective climax was executed. 

ART: 7.9/10

The animation is fine, but the action sequences aren’t all that flashy, which was unfortunate, but I can’t fault it, since action isn’t the main focus of the series. Still colourful and vibrant, fitting of the world.

MUSIC: 6.5/10

Opening and ending are mediocre songs this time around, and the soundtrack sometimes takes away from the immersion in tense sequences. Not always fitting of the atmosphere.

CHARACTERS: 14.8/20

The overall characterization wasn’t as great as the last two series in my opinion because there are just a lot of side characters that don’t play much of a role at all. I would have loved to see more Benno and Lutz screen time, since they had a solid role in the story before. Felt like a two person show between Myne and Ferdinand, and while those two are still as incredible as can be, there are just too many underdeveloped characters.

ENJOYMENT: 12/15

Some parts were boring, but there were still many intriguing moments.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 15/20

The themes have a more complex feel to them this season, and I appreciate the plot progression and further world building. The action sequences were handled a bit awkwardly, but overall, still the Bookworm series that I enjoy.

OVERALL: 73.7/100

Notably a bit more bland than previous seasons in terms of emotional impact, but it’s still a well done show overall in its slice of life elements, it’s just a bit unfocused in its tense situations, and if the technical aspects were handled just a bit better, I’m sure the overall atmosphere of the show can shine much brighter!"
20800,"When I first ran into this show, I didn’t think much of it and just jumped in because both Keiichi Okabe and Emi Evans were doing the soundtrack, so all I was hoping for was some good ass music even if everything else was unenjoyable, as I am not the biggest fan of the Mahou Shoujo genre. What I got was a proper deconstruction of the Mahou Shoujo genre, far surpassing Madoka, and ironically being more reminiscent of Bokurano than Madoka itself.

I’m not going to be splitting it the usual way, instead, I’m going to do it by quarters. They each represent 3 episodes each, as the show is 12 episodes. Dividing it this way makes sense, as the elements of this show are too tied together and differ quite a bit depending on which quarter. Respectively, Shirayuri (1-3), Freesia (4-6), Shiragiku (7-9), Edelweiss (10-12), and Higanbana (Conclusion). There will not be explicit spoilers throughout this review, but if you want a completely blind experience, stop at Freesia, then read Higanbana. This naming scheme is weird, I know, but it makes sense. To the review:



The first episode introduces itself as a typical Mahou Shoujo, with light SoL scenes about the Hero Club with interactions between the main characters, and while entertaining, not enough to grip you. This is fixed, however, when almost immediately after, the world freezes, the world-building blocks set in, and you’re treated to the actual visual aesthetic of the show.

webm(https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673995047192100914/708795926273327195/Vlc-Record-2020-05-09-18H14m04s-YuukiYuunaWaYuushaDeAru-01--1.webm)

For this first quarter, the show goes at a constant pace of interactions in the club, building character (for both them and the show), and then fighting in the Jukai (Sea of Trees). This is almost incomparable to its “predecessor,” Madoka, as there the twist is shown in this first quarter, here the “twist,” if you can even call it that, is revealed much later, after the show has grounded itself and so have the characters, so its impact is much less shock-value meant to put off the viewer into believing it as a deconstruction, but rather a logical consequence for the characters’ abilities which is rarely seen in a Mahou Shoujo. Don’t get me wrong, I love Madoka and for a good while it was one of my favorites, but its execution at the beginning is rather flawed upon rewatch. The setup just isn’t here as it would be in both Bokurano and YuYuYu.

Ironically, even though I want to praise YuYuYu for being the Bokurano of Mahou Shoujo, the beginning section of Bokurano is much more reminiscent of Madoka, but Bokurano is still far different from both as its twist is “confirmed” in its middle section while at the beginning all you are given is tons of speculation.

While this section can be considered boring by some, and likely where a lot of people decided to drop this show in its initial airing, I found a lot of enjoyment in it. The character interactions got a giggle out of me every once in a while and looking hard enough, there was a lot to be found in terms of unanswered questions (which I won’t be mentioning because of spoilers). The soundtrack holds up extremely well already, having some true bangers just in the first episode like:

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSAIDK71lro)


In the second quarter, the viewer is finally introduced into the plot, and a new power-up ability is also introduced to the characters known as “Mankai” or “Blooming.” There’s not too much to go into yet.

This section is probably one of my favorites. While the first episode of this quarter can be a bit reminiscent of the earlier episodes and be a bore-fest to some, it's also where it starts to drop some time bombs that are going to take some episodes to blow up. Initially, these details will absolutely make you confused or intrigued, but the characters and the world around them will constantly tell themselves, and in effect the viewer, that “everything is fine” and “there’s nothing to worry about.” This is further contributed by the pull-back to SoL even after the sequence of events. Of course, this is a move that is completely on-purpose by the show, once again demonstrating that it IS a Mahou Shoujo and nothing more. I love this sort of illusion and it shows just how well-crafted and thought out the show was. From a surface-level perspective, there truly is nothing for you to worry about.

As for comparing this to Madoka or Bokurano, Madoka was basically running with its plot here so there’s nothing much to say. As for Bokurano, this is where it really starts to get similar. Yuuki Yuuna takes longer than Bokurano does, but it finally kicks in and that sense of comradery is almost the exact same. The people in the crew each have different roles for the morale and or general thought process, and it's seen big here.

One of the highlights of these episodes is the visual aesthetic taking on a darker tone but still keeping the characters “light.” The soundtrack, however, gets somber. While we are treated to some absolute bangers while in the Jukai, like:

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZgsfPPGKDE)

While the outside, real-life tracks are depressing, not as upbeat, for example:

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snqH2Lwvog4)

As a side note, the OP lyrics start to take meaning.



The SoL is back again, but not for long. We are quickly thrown back into reality and the consequences have finally become clear. 

Being the rising climax, this is where I praise it the most. The mysteries are revealed and it's such a satisfying experience, and it got me truly in love with the world they were living in. The themes truly shine here, where the “main” franchise theme is hinted/teased at, while their past, present, and future realities are finally settling in for the main characters. It’s very hard for me to talk about anything in this part without spoilers, but what I will say is that it will be surprising no matter how much you paid attention, but this is not shock-value, as it makes SENSE with everything you’ve seen so far. The difference being, the show purposely goes out of its way to make you think it's NOT going to go this way. During this, we are treated to this gem:

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt4x--0Dq6A)

While their situation can’t be derived as realistic by any means, through the lens of deconstructing the genre, their situation is definitely of a Mahou Shoujo, but a twisted version of it. No longer does it fall into the same tropes, it subverts them while also still being a Mahou Shoujo at heart, as clearly seen at the end of this quarter. This is where I think Madoka failed, as Madoka did not subvert common tropes but instead used them as plot devices for propelling its themes, and through its middle portion could not be seen as a Mahou Shoujo in any sense of the word except its name.

Bokurano has the most similarities here, as after the reveals, the reaction of the characters and their next actions are very much in-line with each other. The situation they find themselves is also just about the same, if not the exact same. It sticks with the fact that it is still a MECHA show, with a focus on the characters, while ALSO subverting the tropes of said genre. Bokurano also deals with “inevitability,” which is seen heavily in this section of YuYuYu, but in a different light which obviously is because the genres they are trying to subvert are different.


A most important character arc, and the show’s ending. 

The climax of the show is, to put it simply, epic as fuck. Not only is there more info revealed, more world-building, and most importantly the introduction of lore to the series, the characters, and the plot also ramp up accordingly. And, on top of that, the final fight is emotional and full of sakuga. I’m not going to show any of it here, because I would much rather you experience it fully blind yourselves. What I will post, however, is by far the best version of the ending, which is extremely fitting:

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZkIqw8AzAc)

The finale, while using what came before it stunningly and finishing things off nicely, ends a tiny bit sour at least for me. It was predictable, which in of itself is not a bad trait, but in the way they did it here, there are a few things which, while explained in later entries, feel a bit asspull-y from a stand-alone perspective. I do like how the anime still is brimming with subtlety and it's obvious that just from the last episode alone there will be another entry and more to come, but I cannot get over how they portrayed the consequences of the characters. It seems almost against the deconstructive nature of the show and instead falls back on the Mahou Shoujo trope wagon a bit too much.

One thing I can say is that I felt the same way about the Madoka ending. From a stand-alone perspective, ignoring Rebellion and the in-between manga, the show ends on an unsatisfying note and ignores what they were trying to do from the beginning. It ends as a Mahou Shoujo when it should end as a broken Mahou Shoujo. Of course, this issue is fixed with both of them having sequels, and while I don’t think Rebellion is the best movie of all-time, I greatly enjoyed what they went for and that it made sense overall. I have yet to watch the second season of YuYuYu as I am reading side-materials, so we’ll have to wait and see for that review.


Overall, I can safely say that YuYuYu is much deeper than what meets the eye. Regardless of what I mentioned here, there are many other factors you could also look into that will give you new perspectives on the show. For example, Japanese flower language, or [Hanakotoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanakotoba). Make sure that you start researching AFTER you watch it, as if you do before/while watching, you may very well spoil yourself.

There’s something for everyone here, and while the community tends to overstate Madoka, I think YuYuYu is much more noob-friendly. Even in its construction (and deconstruction) of a Mahou Shoujo, it’s simple but complex, and all it takes is your interest to find something that will hook you to just this anime or even the franchise, either that be the characters and their interactions, the worldbuilding, the plot, the soundtrack, and its integration, or even the tiny details that might pique your interest. Give it a shot.


As for starting it, I HIGHLY recommend you read/watch WaSuYu alongside YuYuYu as it gives some perspective you wouldn’t normally get watching it after YuYuYu. It was originally intended to be this way, after all, however, the order I will be presenting is my own as while the LN published during airing, the anime came out years later, though the contents are the same (if not better).

Says ""Nanba Mutta"" who promised to go to Mars to his little brother ""Nanba Hibito"" who dreamed to go to the Moon. But Mutta couldn't keep up his promise. While Hibito was taking one last step to reach the moon & was going to create history as the ""Japan's First Astronaut on Moon"", Mutta was fired from his profession, crying in his room and he had to blame no one but himself for abandoning his promise.
Being a big brother/older sibling is a tough thing. While many like to make fun of their younger siblings by that ""I'm OlDeR ThaN YoU"" card, older siblings have to be role models or inspirations for their younger siblings, and that's the hard thing. It's even harder when you have a younger sibling more talented, more welcomed and more appreciated than you. Jealousy, self deprecation but most of all, disappointment, that you couldn't be the big brother they can look up to.
Mutta pretty much gave up on becoming an astronaut but he gets a chance, when his mother sent his resume to JAXA and he got the green card to attend the new astronaut selection exam, following in the path his brother layyed out.

The torchbearers of humanity who mark our existence in the outer space, Astronauts. ""Being an Astronaut is considered as one of the hardest professions out there"" will say anyone and that single sentence alone might've destroyed many dreams but no one really tells ""why"" its so hard. Space Brothers takes you on a journey as for why it's so hard to become and most importantly, continue to be an astronaut. There's a lot of realism in the setting that its hard not to be impressed. Exams, training sequences, locations, hell! [They even contacted a real life astronaut to voice over a character](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-10-08/astronaut-successfully-dubs-space-brothers-anime-from-space#::text=Astronaut%20Akihiko%20Hoshide%20successfully%20finished,have%20been%20recorded%20in%20space), what's even impressive is his character doesn't appear in the manga. So much passion and love went into making and it shows, whether it be in its production, or in its themes and characters.

I was struggling a little bit to how or with whom should I begin with among this amazing cast. Well written? In depth? Fun? Inspiring? A lot of words are just flooding my head but I'll say this, they'll definitely feel real. There isn't really an antagonist in this story because everyone is there for their own reasons, relatable reasons if I may add. To simply put in the words of Nanba; I am my own enemy. None of these characters come off as a supporting cast just so our protagonist can reach the moon, instead they come off human because they're like us, struggling with their own worries and trying their hardest. Even if you only see a small segment of their story, you'll get attached to them even when things go north or south.

Just listen to the first few seconds of [opening 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ94UdUQXCQ) and tell me if you can see the Earth because you'll definitely Feel So Moon..
The openings and endings are great and this is probably one of the few shows where I found a [Favourite OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5zzN2yZpWg) and Favourite ED (It's from episode 55) from the same show. The beautiful OSTs oozes a profound feeling every time it plays in the background but it gets watered down after using them for the nth time.

I initially couldn't watch a 99 episode show because of course, it's 99 episodes. So, I decided to watch an episode per day, which ended with 90 days. It was a lot of fun. You can check it  [here](https://anilist.co/activity/429490909).
Special thanks to @AstroAndy for introducing this Anime to me.

Space Brothers means a lot to me and I'm glad I watched It. Let's end with one of my favourite moments.

I AM REBORN

For about twelve minutes of its first episode, it seems like Revue Starlight will be a perhaps interesting, but fairly run-of-the-mill high school dramedy about the classes in a boarding theatre school. A somewhat novel premise to be sure, but not anything groundbreaking. Then, at the episode’s halfway mark, protagonist Karen presses the “down” button on an elevator she’s never seen before, and nothing is the same ever again. What follows is an incredibly exciting (and more than a bit surreal) sequence involving a massive secret stage underneath the academy, where a pair of Karen’s classmates duke it out as part of an “audition” process with what appear to be very real weapons, while singing, in a scene that will likely remind newcomers of Symphogear as much as anything else. Karen, alone in the “audience” for this performance, is lectured by a giraffe who pops out of nowhere and begins talking about the necessary sacrifices one makes to achieve stardom, and seemingly taunts our protagonist, who then climbs onto the giraffe’s neck, and launches herself into the fray below into what can only be described as an industrialized version of a magical girl transformation sequence, as her costume is built prop by prop, piece by piece, button by button. Then, we get this, in what became in mere hours the opening episode’s defining shot.

img880()

It’s breathtaking. You do not get that kind of knock-you-on-your-ass punch very often, not from anime and not from anything. It’s a pretty bold display of directoral prowess, and what is perhaps most amazing is that it’s director Tomohiro Furukawa’s first series at the helm. What is less surprising is that Furukawa has an impressive non-directorial resume, spanning everything from the whacked-out Mawaru Penguindrum to standard shonen fare like Bleach and Yu-Gi-Oh! ZeXal. Even as its impacted is ever so slightly lessened by its repetition in later episodes (is it really a magical girl transformation sequence if it’s not later used to save time?), it remains a striking image.

You could be forgiving for assuming that something like this simply must have sprung fully-formed from nowhere as a work of auteurship, that kind of narrative is still common, but the truth is that Revue Starlight the anime is only one facet of a surprisingly large franchise with roots in, in something likely quite foreign to western anime audiences, the country’s thriving live-action musical theatre scene. It’s sort of impossible then, to talk about Revue Starlight the anime without at least mentioning Revue Starlight the stage show, which it is an adaption of. To understand Revue, and developments over the rest of the series, you have to understand that first. It’s an intimidating proposition, Japanese theatre (specifically the Takarazuka Revue, whose academy the setting of Starlight is based on, and an alumnus of which is responsible for the Starlight stage play) has its own entirely separate fan culture and the scene itself dates back over a century, it’s a cultural wellspring that Utena director Kunihiko Ikuhara has drawn from, and given the aforementioned pedigree of this series’ director--Tomohiro Furukawa--it shouldn’t come as a surprise that it’s a heavy influence here too. Revue Starlight the anime revolves in part, itself, around the annual school production of an in-series play called simply Starlight. There’s a lot of theatre in here, for many viewers it is going to be their first window into this world.

Take this as an admission then that you’re not going to get the full story here--you simply can’t. It's perhaps unusual to ""break"" a review in this manner, but, to get the full breadth of the Takarazuka-inspired thematics behind Revue Starlight, I strongly recommend Swedish youtuber Andrea Ritsu's [youtube videos on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZee8szQG8). Do be aware, some of the episodes delve into rather heavy subject matter.

The Women Merely Players

So that’s the cultural background, but what about the actual plot? Revue takes what is always a pretty big risk for single-cour shows, and is slow to reveal its hand. The first six episodes are primarily focused on single characters and explore the dynamics between them, every member of the primary cast gets a focus episode (though some split their episode with another, the show is not shy about pairing characters up) and for the most part the central question of just what, exactly, is going on with the underground stage is danced around or just flat-out ignored, in favor of getting us to care about the cast. These characters include, in brief:

img220()

-Aijo Karen; the aforementioned protagonist. Plucky, childhood friends with Hikari who she made a promise to become a stage star with. Karen falls loosely within the storied “idiot hero” archetype, though she’s not nearly as dumb as you’d at first think. Utterly obsessed with the in-universe Starlight play.

img220()

-Kagura Hikari; Karen’s childhood friend. Transfer student, very mysterious, and for the first half of the series the character elaborated upon the least. 

img220()

-Tsuyuzaki Mahiru; Karen’s roommate. A rural girl with a warm personality and an absolutely massive crush on Karen. 

img220()

-Daiba “Banana” Nana; A motherly sort of girl who oversees the production of the Starlight play. She has an interesting secret, too.

img220()

-the class president, a studious sort who envies her more naturally-gifted classmates.

img220()

-Hanayagi Kaoruko; A haughty rich girl who has trouble doing much for herself. Dating Futaba.

img220()

-Isurugi Futaba; A rather butch motorcyclist who Kaoruko relies on heavily. Dating Kaoruko, also.

img220()

-Saijou Claudine; Half-Japanese Half-French ojou type, perpetually frustrated at always playing second fiddle to Maya.

img220()

-Tendo Maya; The ace of the 99th class. The Top Star-to-be by all reasonable metrics. 

img220()

-Finally, there is The Giraffe; the mysterious arbiter of the underground revues, about whom rather little is known. 


The first half of the show explores these characters in detail, as mentioned. Then, at the series’ halfway point, Episode 7 is very different, and it is here that the show begins to take a different turn.

Unreachable & Dazzling

It does begin as a character episode as well, focusing on Daiba “Banana” Nana, a member of the cast who, in what turns out to very much not be an accident, has largely played a supporting role up to this point. Banana is, for the cast’s first year at the academy, the stage director. As such, her primary job isn’t to act herself but to set the play up. She is the character easily most distanced from the fight for the top star at the beginning of the series, which makes her turn here all the more surprising.

After the first part of the episode--which finds the class performing their version of Starlight much to her delight, and graduating from their first year at the academy--Banana ends up at the underground stage, where she is confronted by the Giraffe and talked into auditioning.

img880()
It’s also worth noting that this is easily the most heartless and sinister the underground revue looks up until this point.


She wins--easily, in fact--even trouncing Maya, who until now has been framed as untouchably above everyone else in the auditions. As the top star of the auditions, we learn that she is (effectively, though the series doesn’t put it in these words) entitled to a wish, and it is the wish she makes that effectively turns the series on its head. It’s the kind of shock moment that lent infamy to Madoka’s head chomp. Banana’s only wish is for her class to perform the play at the end of last year again. Her wish is granted, and she is sent back in time. 

It’s almost too classic, but the execution is too good to not give it the credit it deserves. Banana has spent the entire series being built up as a rather passive, supporting character, to learn that that was deliberate on her part is a wrench to the gut. Moreover, we find out that the loop we’ve been watching is not the first, and the final moments of the episode allude to the idea of Hikari as some kind of disrupting agent, a girl Banana doesn’t actually recognize from how many dozens of times she’s locked herself in this circuit. It’s really hard to pull off this kind of complete 180 reframing of a character, to take Banana from being one of the show’s most likable characters to the closest thing among the class to an actual villain (no matter that this doesn’t last, that’s honestly just not the point) isn’t just gutsy, it’s risky, the kind of twist that poorly pulled-off could completely tank the show. Here, that it works so well is a testament to the strength of Revue’s writing.

img880()

But above all that, it ties the show’s thematics together nicely. The central struggle--for all of the girls at the academy--is to be the top star, but Revue seems to push us toward this idea being inherently flawed. The Giraffe speaks of an ultimate, blindingly brilliant stage that defies all expectation, and transcends into sublimeness. This is a struggle that ultimately pours out of Revue itself and indeed the entire medium altogether. 

All of that, though, is just part of Revue’s general critique of the Takarazuka system and competition in art in general. Something we’ve not mentioned thus far is that Revue treats stage glow--”radiance” or “glimmer” as its variously rendered in subtitles, star power as it’s probably more commonly known--as a literal, supernatural force. 

So a central question is raised then, if the Top Star system isn’t valid, what is? This struggle defines both Nana’s character arc, and, later, Hikari’s. The ninth episode gives us something of an answer, for Banana’s character arc is resolved there. If there’s no point in freezing a perfect “peak” in time forever, then, Revue postulates, maybe there is one in the simple act of change. This isn’t a new idea in anime--”the power of friendship” is kind of a cliche, in fact--but the specific execution here and the heavy ties to the theme of the rest of the series make it stand out nonetheless. 

Revue Starlight

The rest of the series follows suit on that same note. The 8th episode gives us Hikari’s backstory. We learn that in her old school in London, there was another underground revue, which she lost, causing her to lose her “glimmer” (again, the series treating star power as a literal force), and contains some amazing visuals (including a fight with Banana), but it’s really the 10th and 11th that start to drive the series home. The 10th episode has a masterfully done two-on-two duel between the pairs of Karen and Hikari and Maya and Claudine, and ends with an apparent betrayal, as Karen and Hikari are forced to briefly “fight” each other, and Hikari cuts off Karen’s button in a single strike.

Things aren’t as they seem of course. The 11th episode sees Hikari finally breaking the system by refusing the Giraffe’s offer of a stage of destiny. Unfortunately, what this seems to do is imprison her in the underground revue, as we learn at the episode’s end. As a side note, after the credits, we’re treated to the surreal image of Hikari, naked and trembling in a pink desert, with the Tokyo Tower toppled behind her.

img880()

The final episode is hard to even talk about with objectively-minded, critical language. It is a poem, it is a play, it is a song, it a story. Cursed Hikari constructs candy stars of pink sand, stacking them to the sky, they are toppled by the two blood-red prop stars that hang from the Underground Revue’s ceiling. She repeats, chanting lines from Starlight itself, over and over, to see a character so strong rendered so weak by this Sisyphean task is heart-rending. Then, again, like she did in the first episode, Karen leaps in to save her. First failing, then again, and then….

The Tokyo Tower itself rendered in miniature crashes through the stage, an endless cycle broken, the tragedy of Starlight straightened out, fixed, snapped by the sheer will and love of the redheaded stage girl. The Greek Chorus Giraffe screams in awe, maybe you scream in awe. I told you it was hard to talk about.

If Revue Starlight is not, maybe, the best anime of 2018, it is the one with the best finale. The ending drives a stake through the heart of cheap melodrama. No stage girl, no girl, no girl who loves another girl, dies at the end of Revue Starlight. The Giraffe is shocked, as minutes before this he actually breaks the fourth wall (perhaps we can call this a stage whisper?) to point out that we, like him, are the audience, and all this reverie and tragedy is for our benefit. Leaving the show on that note would’ve been a very easy thing to do. Lesser series have done it and been praised for doing so. Here, Karen destroys the very possibility, demolishing the stage Hikari is trapped on with the Tokyo Tower, and lying to bed the idea that a story built around something like this has to end in tragedy.

The very, very end promises a new beginning, directly from the characters’ mouths.

Sure enough, to bring us back to reality, there are many plans for Revue Starlight. It was conceived as a multimedia franchise after all, a mobile phone game is on the way, multiple manga are currently running, more iterations of the live action show are in the works.

Here is the secret, though. 

Even if none of that was so. Revue Starlight forces you by the simple sheer brilliance it shines with, that this is the new story now forever. The game has changed, there is before Starlight, and there is after Starlight. Tragedy for the sake of tragedy is dead. 

Is that actually true? Time will tell, but for a few moments at the end of the series, as the curtain literally drew closed on the 12-episode odyssey, I believed it. Those moments, in of themselves, are a testament to the fact that anime as a medium still has endless potential to awe, dazzle, and thrill. 

Does the show have flaws? Certainly, nothing is perfect--there are some dips in animation quality in non-action scenes, some reused cuts, it’s been poured over many times by the time this review will go up that the French in the series is pretty terrible, and so on, but these are not major issues. Certainly, series that are not nearly this ambitious have been given a pass for much less. Let the stage bring you some joy, it’s good for you. 

At the end of the day. We, just like the Giraffe, are the audience. The girls of Revue Starlight perform for us, and we should all be so lucky to have a front-row seat."
158559,">""No otaku worth their salt would ever shame someone for the things they love"" 

This quote, which i'm probably mangling together from a handful of different translations due to poor memory, is one of my favorite quotes of all time by now. It's source, as you should know, comes from episode one of the show that you'll see me ramble about, and the topic of this review; 2.5 Dimentional Seduction.

The story, as you'd figure from that quote, is one about otaku. it's about people who are passionate about things they love and engage with those things with their entire heart and soul, unapologetically so. However, by virtue of being a story about otaku, it also addresses the main problem that anyone willing to assign that label to themselves has to bear: being judged for the things you like.
This is more notable in the manga, which features some of the more otaku-centric arcs within the whole story, but you can also see it within this adaptation in the characters of Kisaki-sensei, Nagomi, and particularly Nonoa. 

To many of us in the english-speaking side of things, the term 'otaku' mostly just refers to those who watch anime and read manga. If you are a bit more informed about the otaku culture of japan however, you probably know that the term extends far outside the realms of anime and manga. The term, while often being self-assigned by otaku themselves, can be taken to be a pejorative term, mostly equivalent to calling someone ""obsessed"". Being an Otaku, of any kind, is to devote yourself to something to a point most people would deem unreasonable. You will only ever be obsessed with something to this degree if you love it, and 2.5 Dimensional Seduction is a story about expressing this love, and enjoying it as much as humanly possible.

There is a weakness to this enjoyment, however. One which you probably know just as much as I do. When you love something that much, and when you try to share that love with the world, you will get mocked by those that don't understand it. 
That mockery, that shame, has driven many of us to hide the things we love. After all, It's only natural that you'd rather shut up than be laughed at. And so you shut up. You stop bringing up your hobbies for fear of ridicule. you stop expressing your love because it makes you vulnerable.

Thus, ""No otaku worth their salt would ever shame someone for the things they love"" becomes my mantra, because the last thing i want is to deprive someone of a chance to express their love. It does not matter what things you like, whether they are good or bad, whether I myself like them, or whether you watch it for the intriguing story or the sexy anime women. What matters to me is the sparkles in people's eyes when they talk about the things they enjoy most, and that's all that should matter to them too. Thus, in my eyes, 2.5 Dimensional Seduction presents an ideal of the otaku pride. If you love this thing, then you won't ever care about what other people say about it. Yes, people will look at you weird, they will mock you and you probably won't have as many people to talk about it as you'd hope, but you should never feel ashamed for the things you love.
This is why 2.5D Seduction is a manga that I hold in such high regard, and one which I dare say I love.

But I don't just love it's themes of being an Otaku, which I hope i've proven here. I also love it's portrayal of cosplaying and how it affected the way I look at the people that partake in it, gaining a new perspective on a hobby I never thought much about. I love it's romance plotline about learning to trust people again, and how i saw myself reflected on those themes. I love how so many of it's characters speak to me personally about the experiences I've had when being an otaku and being a teenager. 
But before I loved any of those things, before the manga turned into the cosplay-as-a-sport romcom narrative that it did, and before I realized just how much I related to these characters, I had also loved to read what once was a generic ecchi manga about a girl wearing a sexy costume. And those ecchi elements, while not as heavily present as they once were, are still there even 150+ chapters later. 2.5 Dimensional Seduction's manga is, among a myriad of other things, an ecchi manga.

It is in this, despite it's great work at portraying every other part of the story, that this anime adaptation fails to fully encapsulate all of what I loved about it's source material. No matter how you want to look at it, the show is ashamed of the fact that it's source material is ecchi. You can see it in the changes to the outfits, you can see it in the scenes that are cut, the ones that change angles to avoid showing much skin, and the ones where the camera looks away. To take those elements, which are a part of the original material, and remove them to this degree, feels like nothing short of an insult to those of us who liked them. It's telling me that those elements were not good, that I shouldn't have liked them in the first place. It's telling me that the show is better without them, as if they have no worth.

And the worst part of all this? I am here, complaining to you, instead of talking about the many things I love about the show. Its unfortunate, because the show is great adaptation. I loved watching every episode week after week, getting to see the early arcs of the manga getting animated. I loved hearing the voice actors perform their roles, especially Mikarin's seiyuu. I loved seeing the opening and ending themes, my favorite being the first ED theme. I particularly loved seeing the in-universe anime of Ashford Wars, which was barely ever seen in the manga, getting animated scenes which were clearly crafted with love for the medium (the 4:3 ratio!!). I loved reading the author's own commentary as he spoke about the experience of first writing the manga every week on twitter. In general, I just really really loved seeing the adaptation of a manga which i had deeply enjoyed before.
But in all of this, I could never truly get rid of the awful feeling that came with seeing the scenes altered to tone down the original material. I couldn't get rid of the idea that the show would have been more popular and enjoyed by more people if it had dared to keep the pantyshots. And I very much couldn't get rid of all the people talking about how the ecchi was removed, which really ruined my enjoyment of the show when it came to discussing it online, and pretty much forcing me to enjoy it on my own rather than have people to share my passion with.

Ultimately, if I were to give it a score without taking this whole thing into account, I'd probably give it a 7. It's not a particularly stellar adaptation, but it does have it's moments of beauty, and it's a really fun thing to watch for anyone who likes the source material. I'd argue the manga is more visually stimulating and the pacing works better in that format, but that's probably up to you. 

But I can't review this without taking the changes into account. 
Because it's adapting a story that tells you to not be ashamed of who you are, while being ashamed of what it is. And that's probably the greatest sin it could have made as far as I care."
139310,"This is a spoiler-free two-part review for a two-part movie. You are reading the review for:  ""Blue""

Intro

To Me, The One Who Loved You ([Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153) Background), also known as ""Kimi Ai,"" and To Every You I’ve Loved Before (Blue background), also known as ""Boku Ai,"" are a pair of films that can be watched in any order. For convenience, I will refer to them as ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153)"" and ""Blue"" respectively throughout this review. The following review will be kept spoiler-free, but if you're seeking quick recommendations, it is suggested to start with ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153)"" and then proceed to ""Blue"" in the same viewing session.

The Good

Although I expressed my dissatisfaction with ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153)"" in its review, ""Blue"" stands out as a surprising improvement. The voice acting in ""Blue"" is notably more emotive, with a refreshing presence of inflection that adds depth to the characters. The contrast is stark, and even if they had chosen random people off the street for the voice acting, it would have been a vast improvement over ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153).""

As ""Blue"" was created by a different studio, the art style also differs, and in my subjective opinion, it is more enjoyable. Both films utilize the distinct art styles of their respective studios intentionally, which may initially appear odd but becomes clearer as the story progresses.

While both films contribute to the overall context, starting with ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153)"" is recommended as it lays the foundation for a more satisfying conclusion in ""Blue."" The logical progression of the storyline is easier to grasp, as events in ""Blue"" are often consequences of actions from ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153).""

Unlike ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153),"" which struggled as a standalone film, ""Blue"" fares better in that regard. The plot in ""Blue"" is more coherent, and the dynamic between the lead characters is genuinely interesting. Through improved voice acting and a well-crafted script, viewers can witness a natural and compelling development of their relationship.

The Bad

Admittedly, the plot itself lacks excitement or engagement. While the characters in ""Blue"" are somewhat interesting, their relationship doesn't reach its full potential. This limitation was expected due to the ambitious nature of the project, aiming to provide two standalone movies that combine into a larger narrative. Both films share weaknesses, including an overuse of scientific jargon that adds little value. Instead of pretending to have complexity, valuable screen time could have been utilized to provide clear explanations of concepts. Both films also struggle with a strong central theme.

Conclusion

Individually, the dual movies offer a mixed viewing experience. While ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153)"" falls short in terms of voice acting, soundtrack, and standalone appeal, it serves as an exposition dump for the more enjoyable ""Blue."" The improved voice acting, distinct art style, and a more coherent plot make ""Blue"" a passable standalone film - a high 6/10 on its own. Starting with ""[Red](https://anilist.co/review/21153)"" and progressing to ""Blue"" enhances the overall understanding and satisfaction of the storyline. Despite its flaws, the combined viewing experience showcases the clever overlap of the two plots, which adds intrigue for those seeking a puzzle-like narrative. While these movies may not satisfy viewers seeking a simple and entertaining plot, those with the time and inclination for thought-provoking experiences are in for a unique and mind-blowing journey."
4565,"Don't get me wrong here.

The second Gurren Lagann movie recaps episodes 17 to 27 of the original series and includes some new stuff as well. As I said in my review of the first movie, I wasn't a big fan of that. It felt rushed and I disliked the divergence from the original series.

However, in this movie, the divergence was handled much better with an epic and mouth dropping final 10 minutes which was 100x better than the original ending. This movie succeeded in trying to do its own thing. Like the first movie, it also succeeded at throwing new information like f.ex Nia writing a letter to the deceased Kamina, Simon figuring out that she will die and Nia being much more of a badass!

Nia in this film got her own mech and she becomes way cooler and much less of a damsel in distress which she was a bit in the OG series. But just a bit, she was still a fantastic character in that as well.

But that wasn't the case with the other characters. Simon, Yoko, Kittan and Rossiu had the exact same things happen to them as it happened in the series, which I felt they could've given us more information about these characters. I would've really liked to know more about Simon and Kamina's deceased parents, which they had given us no information about. I would also really like to have known more about that first scene in the OG series, which I speculate is Kamina's father and Boota in the first war before the anti-spirals took over. However, I think a prequel would be great because it would explain Kamina's father, Lordgenome and the anti-spirals. Which we only got 10 minutes in the first film. Furthermore, another issue that I had in this movie is that like the first one, It feels way too compressed. Gainax could've made these two movies a bit lengthier.

To conclude, this movie was great all around but could've elaborated on some more things e.g anti-spirals, most of the main cast, Lordgenome, Kamina & Simons parents, etc. But, I highly recommend you watch this, mostly for the new stuff that's added and for the final battle, which was all around glorious. Still, though, it's not as fantastic as the real thing and you have to watch the series before these movies! It was still a tearjerker, especially that wedding :("
11665,"For so long I can’t even begin to truly understand why this show doesn’t touch me that much at all. It has all the right elements from the get-go with a relationship-related theme absolutely relevant for someone like me and the consistency to carry that theme out in a multitude of storytelling approaches utilizing its format as an episodic story to its maximum advantage. Plenty of facets regarding connection are laid out in every episode. But still, despite it being my cup of tea, why do I not find it beyond the realm of “alright” and “just good”?

If I were to describe what I feel, it would be that Natsume Yuujinchou is quite “faint”. Whether it’s the visuals, the characters, and the story itself, they appear much like apparitions that if somehow evolve into a solid figure with promising features burn out all their luster quickly, ephemeral and languid. And no, this isn’t me being overly analytical over a simple show to relax and heal. Even during my vegetative states I did not find any nourishment sticking strongly to fuel my love for the series. Four seasons in and it’s only scratched the surface.

One thing that has bothered me a lot is Reiko’s confusing character writing. She’s painted with reverence and general positivity by a few youkai while hated (deservingly) by most others. We still don’t know yet her complete story, or at least even the reason why she made the ironically titled “Book of Friends” to soothe her loneliness as a societal oddity like Natsume. I say there’s irony in its entitlement due to how she basically cages in the freedom of the youkai mostly minding their own businesses after a duel and subjugation and calls it a “Book of Friends”. Its title only finds appropriate grounds for Natsume, which finds meaningful relationships by the bonding of struggle and the virtue to let go.

I just find Reiko to be such an enigma, but not even with enchanting mystique that mysterious, unknown characters usually radiate with. Her actions still look unjustifiable, even deplorable, when it’s already the 4th season. I think it’s been way past the time to reveal how she’s truly influenced the bedrock of the story and finally clarify where she stands, as someone integral to the movement of the story. The slacking pace is not bad per se, quite the contrary for an iyashikei piece—it’s a jewel of the crown giving shine, and therefore a strength that allures the viewer. But as Reiko, who is involved in pretty much every youkai’s life Natsume has encountered, is still tangled with contradiction and unfavorable mystery, there is a huge portion of adoration sapped from my person.

Additionally, the glue holding everything compact is still as weak as Natsume’s connection to society before the present age. As of now, the series feels rather disjointed in that the whole is comprised of faded individual parts. In other words, most episodes are not too memorable nor do the numbers hold as much proportional augmentation for the theme. No episode has yet evoked within me sweet serenity, heart-gratifying and soul-soothing moments that linger.

As a concrete example to outline the disappointment of these remarks, here’s my fleshed-out thoughts I commented under my Anilist watch activity on episode 3 and 4 of this season, brimming with positive comments.

Episode 3

!Episode 3 has been the most packed standalone Natsume Yuujinchou episode in my memory, with a maximally polished narrative that of course holds closeness and relevance to its grand theme of overcoming loneliness through meaningful connections achieved through kindness and understanding.

What's chronicled throughout is Natsume and Fluffball's link. Natsume found him preyed on by crows. He attempted to remedy his wounds only to be inflicted with the youkai's poison as a defense mechanism. Fluffball eventually calmed down, and became a docile little limbless Kuriboh who has established an emotional connection with Natsume, a human.

As with most other episodes of the series, this episode underlines the differences between the the human and the supernatural to paint a vivid picture for a more successful conveyance of message. To enumerate, as Natsume applies an ointment for Fluffball, he states his doubts on the effects as he's unsure if human medicine can do the trick. Despite that, he salves the wound and secures it with band aids. This single statement brings texture and depth when towards the end Natsume monologues about how his desires to be kind to everyone as a way to repay the love he has received. The lack of proper communication that lies deep within human-youkai interactions fosters misunderstanding of intents, which makes acts of kindness and trust mistranslated from one party to another.

And so, kindness does not always work; we've learned that across the four seasons with Natsume. Even the youkai Natsume helped at the beginning of the episode turned its back on him, cursed him without registering his stand. But still, Natsume continues to persevere with a pure heart.

Another noteworthy point is Nyanko-sensei telling Natsume how a lot of youkai aren't good for humans, and that opening up one's heart to them can only lead to ruin. This is a remark to Fluffball's poison which weakened Natsume and gave his hand scars. What he received for helping was this.

Our protagonist's tender heart of course wouldn't yield despite the harsh truth that more often than not, his care won't be reciprocated--even given back in a contrary form. But in the long run, there is merit to having faith in the kindness that hides deep within all of us, which we'll eventually realize later into the episode.

Fluffball is actually part of the Karu, a legendary race of youkai that migrates like birds, according to Hinoe. In the same conversation, the two usual youkai that flock around Natsume laugh at its appearance, perhaps implying the inferiority of such a little youkai. But what makes them special is that it bands together to form a dragon-like creature that helped Natsume from Amana's clutches at the end of the episode. Together, they are powerful. Hinoe says that that's how the weak survive, and doesn't that mirror humanity as a whole?

There is beauty in this episode filled with warmth, like how Fluffball left medicinal berries to counteract the poison, how the camera focuses on Natsume's wounded hand as he uses it specifically to reach for Fluffball and urge him to come closer to him, how Natsume recognized Fluffball among the hundreds to thousands of other Karu most probably through its band aids--the bonds found in pain and healing--and/or through a spiritual connection, the guilt that Fluffball has when it only wanted to help Natsume but instead, in a panic of other youkai's entrance, inflicted another wound on Natsume's face. There is so much realism that this supernatural show brings.

""The Little Ones"" presents the miracles only unity through kindness can spring forth and the importance of empathy and active understanding.!

Episode 4

!Episode 4 further focuses on distance, where separation is the essence of youkai-human relationships. ""They could not be together"" is most logical and reasonable, but time and time again Natsume breaks barriers, and even some other youkai have close relationships with humans as well (albeit they most likely end tragically).

What I like about Natsume Yuujinchou is that in the conflict that is very much staple between humans and youkai, what with its already-established division into separate universes, is that it also reflects human connection. Here, Yobiko, a youkai, was shocked in first knowing that humans who loved each other could still not build bridges connecting one another, that entities being of the same plane can be separated. This gap between humans struck deep for Natsume, as a friend of solitude all his life. His viewpoint as a human who can perceive and interact with otherworldly spirits makes his position most unique within the story.

Fastforward to this story piece, we learned that the letter contained a message of gratitude for Yobiko. ""Thank you, for telling me the truth,"" it concisely says. The youkai thought Youko resented him all this time since he told her the facts of Takahiko's sudden disappearance, and so we end in this heartwarming note which gives further hope in the unity between humans and youkai.

In the same way, truth can bring humans closer together. This episode presents how empathy and understanding is not a stranger to any creature, and so will help Natsume's character to perhaps accept that the special people in his life can also accept him for all he his. It's been reasoned out that Natsume hides his youkai interactions to avoid his friends and especially his family be less worried about him, but I'm praying that he learns to share his burdens and in exchange receive more love and security, and thanks for telling the truth.!

Evidently I don’t hate this series, just sad at how it hasn’t touched even near the inner circle of the dart board, or if it did, it swerved itself away from the area, or if by some fantastical magic shaken off it for every quake a new dart brings. Compare the while-experiencing and the having-experienced and the gap between it yawns wide. Admittedly reviewing every season makes it a bigger deal than it should be, so there’s that to be considered. If the show does grow on me eventually, I’ll look back at the early seasons with a look of endearment tinged with wistfulness as I view from the place where Natsume has reached the places that he’s been.

That expressed, there is still beauty in the 4th season of Natsume Yuujinchou as a standalone season. Each and every episode we find Natsume growing and making use of the lessons he’s received from the previous seasons. Most especially, he’s solidifying the circle confirming his existence in the human world and has faced the memory of his parents he has long since buried. To add, we had an emotional flashback of Natsume’s childhood when he was still hovering between households to-and-to. That package containing resolutions of his past unfolded a covenant that vows a better following seasons of Natsume Yuujinchou."
10379,"The third season of Natsume Yuujinchou continues to capture the essence of emotions as it did with the first two seasons. If you have read my reviews for the first two seasons, you probably would know by now that the synopsis for Natsume Yuujinchou is generally the same. In order for me to hit the minimum character limit, I will still need to write the synopsis, so you can go ahead and skip the next paragraph.

Natsume Yuujinchou follows the story of a teenage boy who has the ability to see and communicate with spirits freely without the help of spiritual tools. The emphasis on spiritual tools because Natsume Takashi has a friend, Tanuma, who could also see spirits but it's very diluted, and another friend, Taki Tooru, who needs to use a tool to see and speak to a spirit should they agree to step onto it. While Natsume lives out his daily life as a normal teenager, he also generally help the youkai he encountered with their problems, returning the names his late grandmother, Natsume Reiko, took from them, and also tying up loose ends she left behind.

Just like the other two seasons, season three does have its focus point: reminiscing the past. It is in this season that we get a glimpse of Natsume's past right before he started living with the Fujiwaras. There will also be an episode where we learn more about sorcery, which is different from exorcism. And speaking of exorcism, this will also be the season where Natsume interacts more with the Matoba clan despite Natori's efforts to try and keep him away from them.

(Picture Source: METANORN thru' Google Image Search)

While it does look like there are tons of things happening in season three based on what I wrote earlier, this season is technically the start of Natsume getting more entangled with the exorcists whether he likes it or not. Moreover, there will hardly be any episodes where it shows Natsume returning a youkai's name to the point where you will miss watching him do it. 

img640()
(GIF Source: Gif Abyss - Alpha Coders thru' Google Image Search)

Also, Natsume's relationship with his closest friend would begin to have a shaky start due to one of them wanting to help but the other felt that it is too dangerous since his spiritual powers is too diluted. Yep, you will get to see some rocky relationships between Natsume and Tanuma in this season. But good news is that it doesn't affect their friendship much.

107912,"I just finished watching this show on Netflix, so here's me rambling. :p

STORY:
Scissor Seven is a funny, quirky show with excellent animation. I feel like this might have been adapted from a webtoon or something because the pacing is break-your-neck fast. I still know next to nothing about any of the characters, but I would not mind seeing more of them either. (I see there are some OVAs, so hopefully, they flesh out the story). By the time we find out some interesting character backstory, it’s the last episode ¯\(ツ)/¯ 

Also, the last-minute world-building felt abrupt. Just bam! Here’s the guy who has come to take you out, and it is because of xyz! Still, that was a good fight scene tho, so I am not complaining.

If you’re here for a bunch of blood and guts, this ain’t for you. For a show about assassins, there is not a bunch of killing, which is certainly no problem for me, but I can see where someone else would be disappointed. Instead, the charm of this show is the gags and the animation. It’s wonderfully dumb. Despite this show’s slapstick nature, you can find some heartwarming moments that might tug on your heartstrings too. 

ART/ANIMATION:
There’s so much personality shown through Wu Liuqi/Seven’s stupid expressions or how he scurries away or fights back. All of his body movements are smooth and fluid with barely any wacky in-between shots. I also think Wu Liqui/Seven’s skill with the scissors is executed nicely!

CHARACTERS:
Wu Liqui/Seven cannot remember too much about his past, but it does not stop him from being a goofball. He's my favorite character here. !I like the contrast between his true personality as a no-nonsense, gallant assassin vs the goofiness we are used to seeing from him. When those bangs come down, he means serious business!

Ji Dabao was fun. I like when money-hungry or tough-as-nails bossman type characters have a genuine soft spot for their workers/protege/whatever (let's go Western for a second: like earlier Spongebob season's Mr. Krabs or Mickey with Rocky). !I was so happy when he gave Seven that sword! 

The rest of the cast of characters was okay as well. Even though each supporting cast character was featured as the kill-of-the-week or person hiring Seven for his services, I was surprised to see the majority of them return. So, they were not one-off characters as I originally thought.

MISC:
Oh yeah, as far as the voice-acting, I was very indifferent among English, the original Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese though I chose Japanese in the end. The ending song sounds like a lullaby to me. I like it.

OVERALL: RATING 7/10 | 70% | Smiley Face :)

I enjoyed watching it, and I think 7 out of 10 is fitting. Like, I mentioned earlier there are four OVAs for this series out, so I am going to watch them. I'm eager to see where this story goes. !I want to know why that girl betrayed him.!"
127366,"So 100-man second season has officialy finish, i really appreciate this second season and in this review, that contain spoiler about this season so be careful to not read this review if you haven't watch this season. (Forgive me about my English, it's a little rusty)

So first step: what is 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru season 2?:

Aloof and logical middle school third-year Yuusuke Yotsuya is transported to a game-like alternate world. He becomes a third player and takes on a dangerous quest with his classmates Iu Shindo and Kusue Hakozaki, who were transported there earlier. The cold Yuusuke eschews emotionalism and examines all elements with detachment, sometimes even toying with the lives of his companions. Can he protect his party from attacking monsters, difficult incidents, and powerful scheming enemies and win the game?


I really appreciated the plot twist about every mission of our Heroes, thath every mission has a Time Skip about 15 years and i appreciate the [Kahabell](https://anilist.co/character/183929/Kahabel) return and THE BEST SCENE in this Season, the waited Kiss About [Yuusuke](https://anilist.co/character/162167/Yuusuke-Yotsuya) and [Kahabell](https://anilist.co/character/183929/Kahabel), and the other 3 arc, the Jiffon Arc and the Last Arc: The  Zagroth Arc.

The CD of Yuusuke it's really nice expecially the gore part that i really appreciated, i will continue the manga because i'm intrested for the plot.
About [Iu Shindou](https://anilist.co/character/162169/Iu-Shindou) nothing important, just a little bit of extra romance between Yuusuke, but for the rest, nothing else.
About the Two new heroes: [Keita Torii](https://anilist.co/character/200235/Keita-Torii) the classic dumbass hero, but for the other hero [Glenda Carter](https://anilist.co/character/200224/Glenda-Carter) performed by the voice of [Saori Hayami](https://anilist.co/staff/95869/Saori-Hayami) she is intresting and most important, she like woman....yes.
For the other Heroes nothing to say.


My Expectations for I'm Standing on a Million Lives Season 2 has worth it, waiting for this season, too see the Adventure of our Heros has worth it, and beside of the first season, they give us important information about the final boss: The dragon and information about the parallel world and the real world.
So if you want to try this anime give it a shot."

Story :  Ritsu's middle school friend invites the band to perform live on New Year's Eve. The girls get acquainted with other bands, and become a little nervous as the performance approaches. When the time comes.



8/10
Art: K-ON! Live House! respects the same artistic sense as the basic series which is still a very beautiful animation for 2021! 

Sound: The concert was Skip and we could not have been entitled to the are of the other groups so at the music levels not much to say because there was nothing crazy.



7/10
Characters : No character development, I think it's a shame to have brought back several groups including Ritsu's childhood friend that we also see in the movie without ever dwelling on them. 
Azusa shocked me a bit at the beginning because she was not part of the vote to play on stage, which for me goes against her character who wants to play at all costs.
Otherwise the humor is still working, nothing to say about that!



7/10
Final notice : To speak seriously K-ON! Live House! is a completely useless Oav that doesn't add anything and is an extremely rush aov.
K-ON! Live House! Could have been extremely interesting but I find this Oav is a failure!
It is still very nice for the fans of the anime ^^

You can go and see it because they are only 23 minutes long but compared to the Oav K-ON! Season 2: Plan! which I will review later, it doesn't bring anything to the story of K-ON!

I hope you enjoyed this review!
Don't hesitate to tell me on my profile and to follow me so that I don't miss the other reviews on the next anime as well as the Oav and movie to finish the K-on series!"
100855,"Are you tired of reading wall after wall of pretentious text?
Do you just want to know if you should watch the darn show?
Me too.

Don’t even bother reading this review. Just look at that banner of Saber and decide if you need this in your life or not.

You should definitely watch either Fate:Stay Night, Unlimited Blade Works, or Heaven’s Feel before this or else you won’t know any of the characters. 

Episodes are max 14 minutes long, which is just enough to not bore you while giving you enough fluffy goodness. There’s a lot of scenes that don’t involve cooking, which isn’t a bad thing because having only cooking would make the episodes feel drawn out and repetitive. Every episode has a scenario that leads into the cooking scene and I was impressed by how varied they managed to make them.


They include enough detail in the recipes to the point where if you've cooked before, you could probably make most of them. I didn’t bother with the super complex ones, but I was able to make the dish from episode 8 with minor modifications. It was pretty good actually.

There’s tons of heartwarming, comfy moments between every conceivable combination of characters including some less common ones such as Taiga and Illya. Scenes with Caster and Soichirou made me realize that they’re actually super cute together when they’re not trying to kill people. 

I’m surprised how faithfully they stick to the characters. Lancer is a bro, Sakura and Rin just want a healthy sibling relationship, Saber is really wholesome underneath her exterior, etc. It feels strange to write this, but they actually expand on things like Shirou and Taiga’s relationship. This show actually fleshes out some of the characters. There is character development in the Fate Stay Night cooking spinoff.

The animation is pretty bad by Ufotable standards, meaning it isn't bad. They go for a flat, simple, hand drawn style but it only adds to the comfiness of the whole show. The quality of the character designs aren't sacrificed and more importantly neither is the quality of the food. I didn’t want to include spoilers so I decided to put a screenshot of some ingredients instead of one of the final dishes. Both the cooking and non-cooking scenes look great.

To all OP skippers: The OP is only one minute long, so don’t spam that fast forward button too many times.

To all OP skippers: don’t you fucking dare. Apron Boy is an absolute bop. I normally skip OPs but I never skipped it once even though I watched the show in one sitting.

The ED is very laid back and always manages to leave me with a smile on my face. Watching the ED is also mandatory.

The soundtrack has a mix of calming and upbeat/happy songs. It's not amazing but it does what it needs to do and complements what's happening on screen.

They paid attention to things like the scraping of a wooden spoon on a pan, but they didn’t include other things like the “glug glug” sound of pouring a bottle of oil. Sometimes the sound of shaking a salt or pepper shaker isn’t there either. Sound design isn't something I normally notice, but there were some inconsistencies.

Friendship, family, all that good stuff. Don’t expect to do too much thinking.

You should definitely have seen Stay Night, Unlimited Blade Works, or Heaven’s Feel before this. If you’ve just watched something depressing, throw this on as therapy. Basically an iyashikei but Fate.

[Carnival Phantasm](https://anilist.co/anime/10012/Carnival-Phantasm/) is a Type Moon spinoff that includes mostly Fate Stay Night stuff. I found it hilarious even though I haven’t read Tsukihime or whatever else they put in that show. It’s a balls to the wall, wacky comedy rather than laid back, but if you’re looking for something fun and Fate related, Carnival Phantasm is a great choice.

If you’re looking for shows with the same chill vibe as Today’s Menu, check out some [iyashikei](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Iyashikei&sort=POPULARITYDESC&minimumTagRank=50) or [cgdct](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Cute%20Girls%20Doing%20Cute%20Things&sort=POPULARITYDESC&minimumTagRank=50) and pick one with a premise that appeals to you.  

Heaven’s Feel sapped my will to live and this brought it back. If you want happy chemicals in your brain, give this a shot. Are you ready? Itadakimasu."
19291,"Generations 1-6 of the Pokemon anime all follow a pretty similar structure, to varying levels of success. The original anime can be rough around the edges sometimes, whether due to budget or writing or something else. Generation 3 saw a stark improvement in just about every area. The same can be said about Generation 4 for the most part. Generation 5, however, is where things fell apart. The characters were annoying, the writing and characterization of Satoshi/Ash made no sense, a slight change in art style that just looks weird, etc etc. It is considered one of, if not the worst season of the Pokemon anime by a long shot depending on who you're asking. 

Generation 6 gave the team at OLM a chance to make up for Generation 5's misgivings, however. And boy, did they redeem themselves. XY takes everything the Pokemon anime had done up to that point and utterly refines it. It is not perfect, but this is old Pokemon at its absolute best.

1. The Story

Or maybe lack thereof. I say XY is the best of what the old Pokemon formula has to offer, and while that may be true, story is something the Pokemon anime has never really shined in. It follows the same formula as the first 5 generations. Satoshi goes around a given region with a few friends and collects 8 gym badges, forming bonds with his friends, rivals, and Pokemon along the way, all the while stopping Team Rocket from stealing his Pokemon every 5 seconds.That's about all there is to it, honestly. In Episodes 92 and 93 it shows real promise in terms of things yet to come. But that's 93 episodes in. Before that, there is nothing inherently engaging about the story. 

2. The Characters
This is where things get interesting. Satoshi is the same kid he's always been, except not quite. In this series the team at OLM decided to make him a bit more mature. This is shonen Satoshi, for all intents and purposes. He's still a dumbass every now and then, but he acts more mature and more action-heroey in this series than he ever has. And honestly I love this take on Satoshi. It's refreshing to have the main character grow up in some sense. He's still 10 years old but he feels like he's a teenager. It is honestly a bit upsetting that they never decided to age Satoshi up even a little bit to make this feel more believable. 

Next we have Serena, Satoshi's apparent childhood friend from a summer camp he attended when he was a kid. Err, when he was even younger than he is now. She embarks on her journey when she sees Satoshi on TV. It's pretty obvious from the get-go that Serena has a crush on Satoshi. And at first that makes for a pretty interesting dynamic, and one that we've never really seen done in the Pokemon anime before. However, it gets to a certain point, where you're 40 episodes into a TV show and you start to wonder, ""What is the point of this character?"" Serena has no real purpose for the first 40 episodes or so. She purely tags along with Satoshi and friends because she has a crush on him. Which yes, makes sense I suppose, and is cute at first, but in the back of my mind watching this show I couldn't stop thinking about why she was really there. We finally find out about 40 episodes in, when she discovers her love for Pokemon performing. And there is when Serena truly becomes an interesting character. We see her shine, we see her struggle, we see her overcome fears and grow with her friends and Pokemon. Watching Pokemon Performances in XY is not the boring slog I thought Contests were in Generations 3 and 4. Pokemon Performances are genuinely interesting and oftentimes have fantastic animation. By the end, Serena becomes probably the most fleshed-out and dynamic character the Pokemon anime has seen....ever. 

Next we have Citron and Eureka, the final two main characters. Citron is a gym leader and Eureka is his kid sister. Citron is by far the more interesting and well-developed of the two, though I enjoy them both. Throughout the show we see Citron come to terms with who he is, and how his friends inspire him to do better and become stronger, which is a theme that's pretty frequently used in XY, but I think Citron pulls it off the best, which results in the amazing gym battle between Satoshi and Citron, which is maybe one of the best battles in the entire Pokemon anime. Eureka doesn't really get her time to shine until the next season, XYZ, so I'll get to her more in that review, but she's a pretty straightforward character. She looks up to Serena, she's always looking after her big brother, and she looks after a Dedenne Citron caught for her early on in the series. She's a nice addition to the cast and balances things out well.

Next up, Team Rocket. Not much to say here honestly. They're the same as they've always been. Though I do enjoy their dynamics with their partner Pokemon Maiika and Bakkecha (later Pumpjin). They're still enjoyable to watch, though I do think they pop up a bit too often in XY for my taste.Team Rocket won't get their true time to shine until Sun & Moon anyways.

Finally, the side characters. I'm gonna be brief about these. Tierno, Trova, and Sana are a pretty good trio and serve as good foils for the main cast (minus Eureka). Professor Platane is one of the best professors we've had in the anime thus far, having a far more active role than any past professors, even Okido. Shota is one of Satoshi's best rivals. I love their dynamic. Shota is a boy from Hoenn who obsessively takes notes and studies to further his battling skills. At first he was the character I loved to see lose. He was too inexperienced to ever logically root for. But as the series went on you saw him grow more and more, becoming a fully developed character. He grows purely to surpass Satoshi. Their rivalry becomes even stronger in XYZ.

3. The Art Style
Not much to say here. They fixed whatever made Generation 5 look so unappealing to me. The character designs look great and none of the characters look out of place. However, because of the refinement of the art style, and how crisp everything looks, characters cannot be as expressive as they could. This would later be remedied in Sun & Moon with a new art style allowing for more expression and fluid animation in scenes outside of battles.

4. The Animation
Yes, there is a difference between art style and animation, Sun & Moon haters. Learn it. This is Pokemon at its absolute coolest in terms of animation. That is in no small part thanks to the addition of the 3D camera. Gone are the days (at least for now :( ) of static backgrounds when a Pokemon is performing a move or a character is running. Now we have a fully 3D dynamic camera and 3D backgrounds in scenes like battles. The 3D camera allows for movement and animation we've never seen in Pokemon before, and it's stunning. The battle in Episode 93 is drop-dead gorgeous. I love the battles in this series, and it only gets better from here. Aside from that, overall the animation in this show is great. It really shines in battles. And because of the art style change like I mentioned earlier, some character expressions aren't as good as they could be. And that applies to the animation as well. Sometimes movements can look a little stiff, and it's pretty noticeable. It's not deal-breaking, but I thought I should point it out.

5. The Music
Shinji Miyazaki KILLS it, man. His score is just great, and fits the Kalos region perfectly. Literally zero complaints here. I love this man. Aside from Miyazaki's brilliant score, the Opening themes in this show are AB. SO. LUTE. BANGERS. Do yourself a favor and watch XY in japanese. If you're familiar with the dub, I implore you to make the switch. The dub, ever since XY, has been consistently replacing a lot of Miyazaki's score with generic orchestral music done by Ed Goldfarb, who is unfortunately still working on the Pokemon anime to this day. The only reason this is done is because the Pokemon Company does not want to pay for the music to be used in other broadcast versions of the show. Meaning they hire someone cheaper to compose a new, insanely generic score for the dub. They do keep some songs, like battle themes, but not much else. At first you might think ""Oh I don't care about the music, I'll just watch the dub"". Please don't think like this. This is my second time watching XY. I watched the dub as it aired because I did not know any better. Starting with Sun & Moon I switched to sub because I had learned that the music was better in the sub towards the end of XYZ's airing. And it's true. The dub replaces many great songs by Miyazaki with the most milquetoast boring ass songs I've ever heard. Sometimes in the sub they use the opening songs as inserts to bring up the hype, and by god is it beautiful. In the dub they use some boring ass flute and triangle songs, and it absolutely kills the mood in some of the coolest action scenes I've ever seen in Pokemon. You have to trust me on this. WATCH. THE. SUB.

7. The Formula
I briefly touched on this earlier but I want to go more in-depth with it. The Pokemon anime usually follows the formula of: 

Gym Battle
20 episodes of filler where next to nothing important happens
Gym Battle
20 episodes of filler where next to nothing important happens
etc etc.

Thankfully, XY strips this component down a lot. XY feels a lot shorter than previous Pokemon seasons because of how they've refined the formula. Yes, there are a few episodes where nothing really happens to further the plot, but for the most part I found almost every episode enjoyable in some capacity. Whether someone catches a new Pokemon, or a Pokemon evolves, or something else. The environment the characters are in changes practically every episode so it never feels like the old days of Johto where Satoshi, Kasumi, and Takeshi wander around a forest that doesn't exist in the video games for 20 episodes before they reach the 8th gym. Being a Pokemon fan my whole life allows me to have a deeper appreciation of this show, and while I was watching XY, it really felt like they were in the same Kalos region I explored in the games. No gym badge is just handed to Satoshi like in the original series, so no episode feels like a waste. It would absolutely suck if Satoshi spent 10 episodes travelling with Corni and Lucario, then showed up at her gym later and she just handed him the badge because the sprinklers went off during the battle. If that had happened, then what were all those episodes with Corni for? Just to add another character to the cast for a bit? Thankfully, XY does not fall into any of those traps and does not waste the viewer's time like Pokemon used to.

8. Final Thoughts
I love XY. It has genuinely interesting characters and dynamics, it has a killer soundtrack and score (Watch the sub), it has fantastic battles and great animation, there's really nothing to hate about this series. If you're a Pokemon fan and you want to get into the anime, THIS is where to start. Ignore Generations 1-5 because XY is where things get legitimately good. And it only gets better from here."

I normally try to start these reviews with some kind of cutesy lead in. Maybe a play on the sports anime genre and how it needs more drama focused series. Or a riff on volleyball anime now that the recent season of [Haikyu](https://anilist.co/anime/113538/HAIKYU-TO-THE-TOP-Part-2/) is over and the manga complete. Something about how the fans are looking for their next fix of Cute Boys Play Sports. Sadly 2.43 Seiin Koukou Danshi Volley-Bu, henceforth referred to as Volley-Bu, simply isn't worth it. Looking for a decently animated sports series for your action fix? Denied. Perhaps a well crafted coming of age drama that tackles social pressures and suicide with grace? Denied with prejudice. The sad fact of the matter is that Volley-Bu, produced by [David Productions](https://anilist.co/studio/287/David-Production) and directed by [Yasuhiro Kimura](https://anilist.co/staff/119866/Yasuhiro-Kimura) of [JoJo's Part 5](https://anilist.co/anime/102883/JoJos-Bizarre-Adventure-Golden-Wind/) fame, is terrible. And I'm here to explain why. So without further ado, lets jump in.

Starting off lets talk about the Art and Animation, led by Art Directors -Yoshiki Matsumura- and -Kentarou Akiyama-. This is a mixed bag and leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes we get moments of expressive faces and reactions. Others the volleyball bounces around with all the impact of wet paper bag. More often than either though are the fades. Oh god the fades. Every single time someone hits a ball, jumps or does anything with any amount of meaningful movement on the court it gets blurred and dimmed to the point of being unrecognizable. It takes the few good volleyball scenes Volley-Bu has and throws them in bin. It's a crying shame what has happened in post-production. As you can see from the screenshots, Volley-Bu doesn't look terrible. Maybe a little bland, lacking an identity, but not terrible. Once it starts moving though it loses what appeal it had.

And as for the backgrounds? Well those are actually nice, Volley-Bu does a great job depicting the mountainous landscape of Hokkaido. Whether it be the fields of white snow in the winter or the rolling countryside in spring and summer, the backgrounds are easily the best part of Volley-Bu. Even this however isn't very consistent. A large amount of the shows runtime takes place in doors or in gyms. Robbing the show of its northern landscape. And these are not very well made gyms either! So much so, and with such similarities between them that without the outside establishing shots you would have no idea which gym we were even in. Volley-Bu takes its greatest strength and fails to capitalize on it in any meaningful way. And the worst part? This is probably the nicest I'm going to be about Volley-Bu in this review, so strap in.

This brings me to the narrative and oh boy do I hate this narrative. Spoilers for Volley-Bu below because I'm about to rip into it. If you don't want to be spoiled then here is a quick one sentence explanation: Insultingly bad suicide plot gives way for boring Nationals plot. Good? Great. Click here if you're ready for some spoilers.

!Now in the effort to be fair: Volley-Bu didn't start terribly. The series knew it couldn't compete with the powerhouse that is Haikyu in action so it would focus more on the drama. A smart plan, a good way to differentiate itself and become more than ""that Haikyu clone"". In fact I thought it was a rather engaging hook, a more serious take on Kageyama with more dramatic societal and personal consequences. This idea of demanding perfection from your team, of hounding them until one of them breaks. It was a compelling look at the other side of these bullying plots we see so often in anime. The way Haijima handled and reacted to the whole thing was great to, he was really effected by it. But then Volley-Bu took this compelling hook, this thing that set it apart... and shit all over it, throwing it to the side.

What was once about Haijima figuring out his feelings towards Volleyball and how to forgive himself instead made him a victim. This idea that a kid who was to much of a coward to practice or quit the team would fake his suicide, and that everyone would go along with it, was ridiculous and insulting. It retroactively ruins what growth Hajima had, effectively saying he did nothing wrong and that he was the victim in the situation. Simultaneously introducing a load of plot holes such as how he never found out or how no one told him, etc. Faking suicide isn't something that goes unreported, surely he would have heard from somewhere or some one. But for it to take years and him revisiting the school only to learn from a passing comment? Terrible. And the worst part is yet to come.

The way Volley-Bu treats the subject of suicide is, to put it simply, insulting and concerning. It plays the whole thing off as a joke, a mean prank on Haijima. It makes the bully, the character who started the whole thing and who should have learned to grow, into the victim and downplays the seriousness of the subject. I'm not asking for some kind of harsh and in your face depiction of these subjects ala Wonder Egg Priority that aired this season. However a modicum of tact and respect doesn't feel like to much to ask from a show ostensibly rooted in character drama.

Sadly though after this reveal the character drama largely disappears from Volley-Bu. Where once it sought to differentiate itself from Haikyu it instead winds up competing directly with titan. The whole show becomes a ""Lets go to nationals"" plot shoved into a single season with a single relevant competing team. Fukuho Tech, the reigning champions of the region, are introduced soon after the suicide plot is kicked to the curb. And honest to god? These guys are more compelling than our leads! Their drama regarding injuries and ""Ill get you to center court"" is ham-fisted but at least Volley-Bu sticks with it to the end. Sadly however because these are the rivals they are destined to lose. And not even for a good reason, they lose because they aren't the MC's.!

Long story short, Volley-Bu's narrative is a proper mess. There was a brilliant idea here. It had a compelling plot and character story. But it threw it all away to focus on nationals and in doing so abandoned what little identity it had.

This brings us to the characters whom I have already railed against a bit. Most of my major issues here have to do with how Volley-Bu completely and utterly botches the drama portion of it's story. With how involved the characters are in that, it reflects on them to. But that isn't to say there wasn't a lot of other issues to be had. Take the Seiin team for example: As a whole unit you have maybe... 4 and a half characters across 8 ""people"". I say it like that because outside of Yuni, Haijima, and the Aoki/Oda duo none of them really matter. Maybe Okuma for a scene or two but that's the big issue here isn't it? This is an 8 man team where only the MCs have defined personalities and everyone else gets 1-off scenes whenever they interact with them.

The only exceptions in Seiin really are Oda and Aoki, the captain and vice captain of the team. These two have personalities, they have scene's, they just aren't good ones. Mostly. Oda's character is probably the best and is centered primarily around his height, the short captain of team. He involves himself a bit with Yuni helping him get over his cowardice and basically pulling everyone else along with him. The old ""If I can do it as short as I am, you can to"" approach. Aoki meanwhile is whatever the plot needs him to be. Early on he conflicts with Haijima because of his attitude and treatment of players worse than him. He is fiercely protective of his team. But as the story goes on and the drama gives way to Nationals he largely gives way and disappears. Only ever existing when the plot needs his brand of conflict.

This leaves us with the MC's Haijima and Yuni. I already railed against Haijima in the narrative section so lets talk about Yuni: The most rushed character in the cast. Once again, almost like a pattern, Volley-Bu started with something interesting here and squandered it. His feelings of inferiority, his cowardice in the face of conflict and his fear of being blocked and letting people down are all good beats! His stuff in the first 3 episodes and how he slowly comes to resent Haijima was legitimately investing! But All of this gets resolved by around episode 6. His entire character arc is complete in every way that matters beyond ""Going to nationals"". It's as if Volley-Bu either gave up or only involved the drama long enough to convince people it was different from Haikyu. Instead what it got was half-baked arcs that taste of disappointment.

Finally we have Fukuho who are, in my opinion, better than the Seiin team in every conceivable way. In a single episode this team has more camaraderie and personality than our leads. Not as individuals of course, most of them don't even have names. But as a team they have a clear identity, they joke, they shoot the shit, they have a goal and a history, etc. Where Seiin feels like a ragtag band of misfits brought together, which they are, Fukuho is a group that have been together for awhile. We can see this in their interactions and their motivations. It's all rather one-note, but ill take solid and average over mediocrity. Sadly Volley-Bu once again squanders this by bringing them down to Seiin's level through ridiculous circumstances and plot armor. It takes what was built up as a compelling goal and, without resolving it meaningfully, throws them away.

Across the board the best way to describe Volley-Bu's characters are ""Wasted potential"". Every single one of them could have been more, could have mattered, if only they had more time in which to do so.

Lastly we have the OST and this is going to be particularly hard to write. Not because I'm the farthest thing from a musician or because I lack an arts education, though both of those are true. Rather because Volley-Bu's OST is just... forgetful. It has everything from generic rock to soft strings and even the occasional weird piece for when things get heavy on screen. But not a single track caught my imagination, managed to suck me into the scene that way great OST's can. Along similar lines though, I was never sucked out of the show by the music the way terrible OSTs do. It's as if the music was there, and I was aware it was there, but I didn't mind it. Think elevator music but for anime. Whatever track was playing fit the scene well enough. That's just all it did. And maybe that's ok.

Now we come to the personal section of the review. This has absolutely no bearing on the score, this is just me taking to you about my personal experience. If all you care about is score then feel free to skip. Otherwise if you want to try and connect, to really understand where this review is coming from, then please read on. Let me share a bit of myself with you.

To me, Volley-Bu feels artificial. It like something made for the market to appeal to a broad audience first and foremost. As if someone saw the success of Haikyu and wanted to the same but knew they had to differentiate it somehow. And the way they chose to do so was ""Make it a character drama"". That wouldn't be so bad if that was all it was. I enjoy plenty of media that exist for that and that alone. From the Marvel movies to last years Akudama Drive to weird stuff like Thunderbolt Fantasy. None of these are pretentious ""works of art"" but they are all still good entertainment. And the reason I think they work where Volley-Bu fails is this: They know what they are. They might touch on something deeper at a surface level, but ultimately they stay true to their core start to finish. Volley-Bu doesn't.

It starts with this serious and upfront story of suicide, pain and consequences. Yet it ends in a stereotypical match about going to Nationals. There's no ideological conflict there, winning doesn't prove anything or represent the characters overcoming something. They already overcame everything halfway through the season! Rather it feels included to get the sports shounen audience. It hooks those looking for something deeper and tries to appease them in the first half before trying to do the same with the action crowd in the second. In doing this Volley-Bu loses it's identity and succeeds at neither. The terrible thing here is that it was completely avoidable as well. The rival team Fukuho, nationals, the actual competition aspect, none of these are important for the initial story. Instead it should have focused on Haijima, Yuni and their growth as individuals rather than as athletes.

There are so many things that Volley-Bu could have done to save itself from this fate. It could have cut Fukuho and focused entirely on our Seiin team. It could have lingered longer in middle school and really shown us the fallout of what happened. Most of all though, Volley-Bu could have committed itself to the suicide. But in not doing any of these, in trying to please everyone, it ended up pleasing no one. Or at least it didn't please me and I'm the one writing this review... so yeah.

img()


All in all when I think of Volley-Bu only one word comes to mind: Disappointment. I have compared Volley-Bu to the standout hit that is Haikyu a lot in this review. Something many of you probably find off-putting as Volley-Bu is clearly not Haikyu and is clearly trying to do something different. But here's the rub: In it's quest to do in one cour what Haikyu did in five Volley-Bu abandoned everything that made it stand out. The compelling and down to earth character drama was left behind for ""Let's get to nationals"". The quiet moments in the mountains, the snow, walking home from school, were all cut for more volleyball matches in the second half. Volley-Bu tried to appeal to both crowds, to peel off some of Haikyu's fans while still appearing different and in doing so fulfilled neither.

I don't rip into Volley-Bu because its fun, I don't enjoy insulting this show. I was hyped, I was invested in it after episode one. But then it let me down. And I don't want you to deal with the same. So be forewarned: You will not get what you want from this show. Whether it be action or drama, it will fail you. As it has failed me."
122348,"Sad to see this beautiful anime ended today - hoping for season 2. Will give this a rewatch in the future. 

You ever go into a show and have no idea what a shamisen is and decided to watch it on a whim? Well I am glad I did, because I did not expect to fall in love with this anime. From all that it gave us from start to finish, I felt like I was caught in the middle of a storm waiting because I was so captivated by this show because of all the sound it produced. Truly a beautiful anime that deserves more recognition. Sorry if this review is a little all over the place, since I'm just typing as I go with whatever comes to my mind. 

To review, I'm gonna mainly start by focusing on the beautiful OP Blizzard and will work from there on. 

Blizzard returns for the final episode!!! I love that OP and I think it is the perfect opening for this anime, nothing against the second opening. Those are both great in their own respect to demonstrate where Setsu stands. 

Now just to review my final thought on this show with mainly his final performance. Why Blizzard was the perfect song choice to demonstrate the beauty to this anime. 

We see throughout the entire series, he was chasing after his grandpa. Chasing after the sound that is lose, it is like chasing someone through a blizzard, you can only go so far before you lose sight of their footsteps in the blizzard. We see how Setsu is lost and eventually he does get free from it which we have the second OP. Which features all his friends, because now he has found a new path before him. But with the final couple episode, reality comes crashing down again when we are met again with his mother and father. He is again caught up in the storm (which blizzard was the perfect choice for the final episode). 
What a way to close off this anime and truly one of my favorite this season. With his final piece being broken into two part, the sound he was chasing and his own sound. Instead of trying to keep following a path, we must create our own path even through the storm. We can only hope for season 2 where Setsu must find his own footing and path and walk it. As his friends seem distant now and lost. Sometimes we are just caught in the midst of everything and we forget about those who are with us. 

If we were to talk about the visual and art style, it is beautiful. Along with the sound created, this was a delight to the ear. How they portray the sound with nature, how beautiful the sound of the shamisen captivated me so much. It was not a show I was expecting to love but this turned out to be one of my favorite of spring 2021. Is it a masterpiece? Well that is up to you to decide, but base on my own personal enjoyment, I would give it a perfect score. Since I absolutely loved everything about it. From the art, to the sound and the characters. I was happy with the plot as well, especially since with the final result being what it was. 
So now I wait here patiently hoping one day I will hear season 2 being announced and jump for joy. Until then, I will just enjoy what was presented and I love both the OP and ED. It is truly a great work of art and deserve more praise. A hidden gem of this season for sure."
9941,"It’s the distant future for us… Okay, it’s just an alternate version of the mid seventies, but who’s counting… and a bizarre mutation has started to occur among our population. Human beings with superhuman powers are popping up everywhere, and we’ve taken to calling them Nexts… Presumably because ‘mutants’ was taken. We initially rejected these outcasts, until they decided to don costumes and assume the role of superheroes, defending the very people who judged them on live, national TV!

Unfortunately for the widowered single father Kotetsu Kaburagi, the human genome isn’t the only thing that’s been evolving. In the decades since Hero TV was established, he finds that he’s become irrelevant, with younger and more capable fighters joining to overshadow him. His rank is low amongst his co-workers, nobody ever buys his merchandise, and to make matters worse, a new superhero named Barnaby Brooks has thrown his hat into the ring, sporting the exact same power that Kotetsu has… And to keep himself from getting fired, he has to take up a new mantle as this rookie’s partner!

At first glance, Tiger and Bunny seems to have one of the most tired premises in recent anime history… That is to say, a large cast of both heroes and villains who’ve mysteriously developed their own unique powers. Just off the top of my head, I can name several titles with that exact same premise… Darker than Black, the Index Franchise, Canaan, S-CRY-ED, Speed Grapher, and Getbackers, to name a few. And that view point isn’t completely unfair, since the array of powers it features is probably the least imaginative in the bunch.

But where Tiger and Bunny differs from these other shows is in it’s core concept, which is essentially an amusing combination of X-Men and Nascar. The heroes are sponsored and basically controlled by wealthy real-life corporations, who tell them how to act and dress while decorating their costume with different logos. They advertise these logos by competing on Hero TV, earning points based on just how successful their defense of the city was that season. I can honestly say I’ve never seen an idea even close to that one in my entire life.

The animation was produced by a company named Sunrise, a prolific animation studio with a lot of very impressive previous work under their belt. They’re known by fans as Sunrise Smooth, a reference to the fluidity of most of their efforts. Unfortunately, the same can’t really be said for Tiger and Bunny. It uses both 3D and 2D style animation, but it doesn’t blend them… The 3D is used in action scenes, or just whenever the heroes are in costume, and the 2D is used practically everywhere else.

The 3D animation is actually very impressive, and yes, very smooth. It turns just about every action scene into a pulse pounding, exciting thrill ride that it should be. Unfortunately, the 3D is still in effect when our heroes are wearing their costumes outside of action, as well… Whether they’re giving an interview, lounging around the company gym, or just interacting with one another, and at times, this can sometimes look really… Really… Awkward. It’s mostly due to the fact that with so much money going into the 3D animation, the regular animation obviously took a huge budget cut. With this side of the coin, we get some of the cheapest looking animation I’ve ever encountered, from hideous walk cycles to the heavy abuse of key frames. Seeing that in the background, the three dimensional characters look out of place to an almost creepy degree.

The artwork, however, almost completely makes up for it. This show is set in a fictional American city, and as such, the art and character designs have a very surprising western aesthetic to them. Aside from a few wide-eyed children, the characters almost always look more like American comic book characters than anime characters. I’m serious, too… Virtually every single frame of this show looks like it could have been taken directly from a Marvel or DC comic book, which is a touch that makes the sometimes stiff animation a lot more palatable. The backgrounds, too, are highly detailed, and the bustling metropolis known as Stern Bild looks like a dead ringer for a futuristic New York City. The architecture of this setting is beautiful and imaginative, even if some of the structures look entirely implausible in design.

The characters inhabiting this city, much like they would be in real life, are racially diverse, forming a shockingly progressive melting pot with nary a stereotype in sight. Normally, if I were watching an anime that featured White, Black, Hispanic, Russian, Japanese and especially Chinese characters, I would be on the edge of my seat waiting for something offensive to happen. But aside from a few exaggerated physical traits… Nope! Every character’s given a proportionate amount of respect, with their ethnic backgrounds never even slightly becoming an issue in the story.

Well, that is, except for the gay character. Granted, he’s cool and likeable, and I appreciate that they made him the only hero rich enough to own his own sponsor company, but the homophobia in his design is still pretty blatant. He talks in a throaty, effeminate falsetto and flirts with pretty much every other male character in the show… Especially Kotetsu, who already has the barely clad Blue Rose inexplicably pining for him. If you were to create a sliding scale that ranked all of the LGBT characters in anime history in terms of how offensive they were, he’d be somewhere close to the crossdresser from the Battle Royal manga. It’s a disappointing step backward for a series that’s otherwise been able to take two giant steps forward against the abundant racial homogeny of the anime medium.

Ironically, though, if this show were ever adapted into live action, there’s no doubt in my mind that every single character would be Japanese.

As for the other characters? Well, the main focus of the series is on the ups and downs of Kotetsu and Barnaby’s partnership, so several of the main characters got the short end of the screen time stick. Characters like Dragon Kid and Origami Cyclone are barely featured outside of having an episode each to themselves, and Rock Bison doesn’t even really get that much. Fire Emblem, Blue Rose and Sky High get a bit more than that, but they all still play supporting roles to our two mains and their families.

Thankfully, it wasn’t for nothing… The titular characters are fleshed out, interesting, and very well developed. Kotetsu, or Wild Tiger as he’s publicly known, is very thoroughly portrayed as the aging veteran trying his damnedest to keep up with new ideas and techniques while still holding on to his more traditional values by the skin of his teeth. As altruistic as he may be, he’s a very flawed character, who refuses to let anybody ever worry about him… This stubborn attitude causes strain in both his professional and personal life, as he has a lot of trouble connecting not only with his partner but also with his ten year old daughter. Despite his insistence that saving people is more important than earning points or selling merchandise, he still clearly cares about his placement in the rankings. This could make a lot of leading men unlikeable, but in Tiger’s case, it just serves to make him more sympathetic.

His partner, Barnaby Brooks Junior… Or Bunny, as Kotetsu irritatingly came up with… Is in many ways the exact opposite. He’s the newest super hero on the circuit, and he rejects a lot of the older notions to the point that he doesn’t even bother keeping his identity a secret. He fights with his head rather than his heart, preferring logical strategy to Kotetsu’s bold, gallant approach. He’s very direct with people, to the point where he jumps to conclusions at all the worst times. His tragic past is your typical ‘Batman’s parents’ story, but the way it’s portrayed… And the way it shaped his views on justice… is so genuine that you can’t help rooting for him.

They clash a lot in the beginning, working together solely out of the interest of their employment, but as time goes on they do become closer, and they stop having to pretend to be friends. This development is shown very naturally throughout the series, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s portrayed through the outstanding, flawless performances of Wally Wingert and Yuri Lowenthal. The entire dub is very well cast, with nearly all of the actors melting seamlessly and in some cases unrecognizably into their roles, but it’s the main duo by far that takes the cake.

Unfortunately, this is the part where I have to talk about the writing, and it’s not a part that I’m really looking forward to. The story in Tiger and Bunny is fast paced, well executed, and hits all the right notes, with exciting CG battles, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and just enough down time to let us form attachments to almost all of the main characters… Even the ones that don’t get a lot of screen time. However, that story wouldn’t have progressed at all without the help of inexplicably childish behavior, constant coincidences that directly challenge the suspension of disbelief, and foreshadowing so clumsily handled that a lot of the more serious plot twists can be seen coming from a mile away.

There are dozens of conflicts and mysteries that could easily be solved in ways that the viewer will often wind up SHOUTING at the screen, and it almost feels insulting when the answers you come up with are put into play at the last moment for dramatic effect. Yes, timing is important in a story, but even Dora the Explorer doesn’t make the audience shout out obvious answers as often as Tiger and Bunny does. Hell, some of the villains are so obviously villains that they might as well have had the last name Palpatine. Early in the first few episodes, an astute viewer may start wondering things about the nature of Hero TV, ultimately coming to a conclusion that just has to be, and of course winds up being, one of the biggest reveals of the series.

And that’s to say nothing about the lack of originality at play. While the two titular characters and the final villain have some interesting and unique abilities, there doesn’t seem to be an original idea in the bunch. Most of the heroic supporting characters have commonplace powers that manipulate ice, fire, lightning, and wind. There are also powers based on Colossus, Morph, and a lighter version of Rogue from the Xmen. As far as the villains go, you’ll find characters who’re based on Emma Frost(Or more likely the diamond woman from Speed Grapher), Sandman, The Hood, and others. Even when you put Kotetsu and Barnaby’s powers aside, the Iron Man suits they wear are just that… Iron Man suits.

While the vigilante Lunatic may have a somewhat original power, think about this; He’s a judge who experienced emotional trauma as a kid, and grew up believing all evil doers must be killed… And he uses his powers to do just that, murdering the wicked while criticizing those who let them live. He’s basically Teru Mikami, except that he has the long white hair and shady face that have become trademarks of any obvious villain. And by comparison, he’s actually one of the better villains in the series… He’s nowhere near as obvious as the main villain, whose convoluted master plan and backstory turn the entire final story arc into a rat-king sized clusterfuck of plotholes that had me more confused than excited. It’s actually kind of amazing.

Tiger and Bunny was dubbed and released stateside by Viz Media, and is reasonably priced both online and on common store shelves. Two films have also been released in the following years, but in typical anime fashion, they’re just slightly altered retellings of the series. In other words, they’re full fledged cash grabs. I haven’t seen them myself, but apparently the first one is available stateside, undubbed, and also fairly cheap.

Tiger and Bunny is an enthusiastic love letter to American comic books, and it damn well feels like it. It’s a really fun story, with an intriguing idea, great comedy, and it has a highly diverse cast of likeable characters. It’s not very original, but it’s sincere, and it’s clear that some very real heart went into it’s creation. It looks beautiful when it tries, but it doesn’t try often enough. It’s also heavily flawed below the surface, and there’s a lot of points where you have to turn off your brain to fully enjoy it… I don’t like doing that, so there were a lot of times where I just felt alienated from the fun that I should have been having. It’s heart is in the right place, but it’s just not attached to it’s head. I give Tiger and Bunny a 7/10."

It’s not great. It’s trashy. But it is still enjoyable. Here we have a shameless quintessential quintuplets knockoff. But wait, it’s not entirely the same. Amidst the heavy fanservice and reused tropes lies a decent watch. It’s more wholesome than you may think. The comedy is pretty cringey but it isn’t horrible. The series progresses by progressively revealing the backgrounds of each character, and they are well-fleshed out. The romance is pretty weak and consists of the MC’s few moments with each girl, except for blue hair because she is an idiot. The drama is the same as the comedy, but I thought it was better, sometimes it was cringe, as was everything with this show, but it also felt real sometimes and served as character development. I also want to add that the main character is good, nothing like your typical harem moron. He has a spine, doesn’t take bullshit, and isn’t abnormally horny. He is serious but also has a kind and compassionate side that makes the show work. While not as developed as the manga, as the series progresses, you can genuinely feel an intricate bond between the characters as the makeshift “family” that they speak of.

Plot [8/10]: I know what you are thinking, but hear me out. The premise of this guy getting his grandmother's cafe off the ground is pretty interesting. While each episode might have some side-plot(s), the overarching idea is that they get the cafe up and running and eventually successful and profitable. It’s also a romance but as a comedy/slice of life, the episodes were interesting and there is a general direction in which it is heading, which is far more than a LOT of romance anime these days. As for the side events, they were also interesting as well.

Characters [7/10]: The main character is definitely a refresher as I said earlier. We have too many total simps or gigachads. This guy is a mix of both, he isn’t like Kazuya from kanokari where he just lusts over the girls but he does not treat them like his slaves either. He is strict and stern for the sake of business but he is also willing to learn from the girls and is kind to them. While it does eventually fall into the tropes of all the girls becoming attracted to the MC towards the end of the season the girls aren’t bad either. I’ll go through each of them now. Akane (Short-hair): She starts off as very mysterious and stuck-up/arrogant, but later her character does a 180 after more is revealed about her in her backstory which makes for her cute, submissive side. Ouka (Red-hair): Nino Nakano ripoff, she's the classic tsundere, she hates the main character and is just kinda there with not a lot of screen time, will have to read the manga or wait for another season before she starts to develop. Ami (Blue-hair): Very annoying character but also funny, this girl isn’t a love interest at all, she's literally around as a living joke for the sake of comedy. Falls into the trope of hitting the MC in early episodes but eventually falls out of it. Riho (Orange-hair): Another tsundere type, but not as bad, who has issues with overworking and is kind of clingy to the MC because he is kind to her. Her backstory is great IMO. Shiragiku (Green-hair): Big-boob uwu voice girl. She’s the kind one of them and has a good relationship with the MC, her backstory is at the very end of the series. Her character juxtaposes nicely with the rest of them as her personality is a lot more laid-back. Very likable and the best girl for me although her character isn’t the most complex, used as shameless fanservice sometimes.

Art/Animation [9/10]: This color palette is SO good. It is just a feast for the eyes to watch the art. Seo Kouji, the mangaka has great art designs, and the color scheme they added is bright and lovely. Everything from character designs, comedy effects, and backgrounds, all have a bright and lovely color that is just nice to look at. The animation is also very fluid and lively to couple with it. The art alone is a pretty decent reason to watch the show in my eyes.

Sound/Voice Acting [7/10]: It’s nothing too special in this department. The voice actors did a good job, they were enthusiastic and passionate. Bashful in the romantic moments, energetic in the comedic ones, and angry/sad/crying in the sad ones. It’s a bunch of rookies around Seto Asami (Mai Sakurajima, Raphtalia, Nobara Kugisaki) and Sayumi Suzushiro (Kei Shirogane, Nijika Ijichi). They got the job done and more. The soundtrack is average honestly, the animation for the opening and ending is cool though. I like the music for the opening.

Give it a chance, it’s not a pure, one on one romance like tonikawa or horimiya, or a love triangle drama like Oregairu, but it’s not isekai harem trash full of lust, despite the fanservice. It is annoying how much it resembles the quintessential quintuplets but the story feels genuine, the plot is interesting, and the characters are good. On the characters, you just need to give them some time, they get better I promise. Their hostility at first makes sense, after all, they are about to get kicked out of their homes after “grandma” their caretaker, dies. The pacing is also good, as it reaches about 45 or so chapters after 12 episodes. As a manga reader, I didn’t expect such a good adaptation. Don’t let the rating fool you, this is a good series and surpasses expectations in many departments I promise."
106967,"MMmm, fondling those precious thighs, feeling the firm, taught, texture of the tights envelop you. Majesty is artfully hidden behind such an innocent, inviting premise, that it's hard not to get lost in the sights and sounds. Teachers in tights, schoolgirls in tights, friends in tights, sisters in tights, alls I need now is to burn these gifs into my brain so I may never forget them as long as I live.

You have not experienced characters as you have until you have seen this. Each girl has a distinct trait that I refuse to spoil here, and a unique way they express their thighs. Blatantly, embarrassingly, slyly, all combine to pacing perfection as you run the whole gamete of thigh appreciation in this hour-long lower-body experience. Side characters are few and far between, but the few that have dialogue are some of the most memorable, a la Shakespeare's masterful use of lesser-developed characters to bolster the story and the characters that have been developed.

The sound design is immaculate. Every time an episode ends, and the ED singer croons ""softly, softly"" I manage to lose myself in her voice the further and further. Tights rubbing against things, ripping, all sound spectacular, not to even mention the girl's voices. Sweet like fruit, because fruit is sweet and healthy, these girls are each two pillars that hold down the anime and keep us grounded. Those two pillars? Their thighs. That means six pillars in total, plus two more if you include the teacher's character. The thighs ground the viewer, but what parts of the anime, if any, Achieve Heaven?

The Feet.

We are not yet to arguably the best part of any ecchi, which these shorts deliver ten-fold - the Feet. Establishing shots show that our protagonists know how succulent and attractive their feet are wet, so they make sure to splash in every puddle on their way to school. Feet serve to give the viewer not just a purpose while watching, catching glimpses in every episode like hidden easter eggs, they serve to give us a purpose in life. To strive for a woman who lets us touch their Feet is the goal... but it will never be enough. While you're laying in bed, mission accomplished, there's still something nagging at you. You look through your phone, side-piece to your side - why was I chasing Feet my whole life? You stop on Miru Tights, and you once again are sucked in as our three protagonists wet their feet for our viewing pleasure. You get a glass of cold water and pour it over your lover's feet, waking them up with a low groan. You start marveling at their Feet again... but the moment fades just as quickly as the last. You press play and continue watching. By this point, the girl has left your apartment in exasperation. Forget about her, you don't need her anymore. Because you realize the thing you've been chasing, has been in front of you this whole time."

I've always had this pet theory that you can, very broadly, sort all pieces of media into one of three categories, based on how closely they relate to other works in their medium in terms of shared themes, character archetypes, style, narrative elements, and so on. Most media falls into the first two categories--derivative with no major changes to the norm, or derivative with some sort of twist. This is neither a positive nor a negative and really, is just how storytelling operates, so there'd be no sense in lamenting it even if it were a negative.

Then you have a third category. Things that walk so far outside the usual orbits of their medium that their place within them is questionable to begin with. It is here where Kaiba resides, on the farthest outlands of anime as a medium, sharing more real estate with experimental a-narrative work like some of the Genius Party shorts and 60s cartooning from around the world than it does with its contemporaries, and with a soundtrack that foregoes the usual anime soundtracking tropes in favor of a moodier score dominated by surreal washes of sound and lurching one- or two-instrument tracks, Kaiba is wholly unlike anything else that premiered in 2008. '08 saw the premiers of the third Yu-Gi-Oh! Series, Black Butler, the Soul Eater anime, and reboots of the Casshern and Macross franchises. Nobody was doing anything like Kaiba in 2008, and almost nobody is doing anything at all like Kaiba now. 

So what then, is Kaiba? That's a question that's surprisingly hard to answer. As alluded to, it defies easy genre classification, it mixes elements of cyberpunk, romantic drama, the Japanese genre of the ""world story"" (think Neon Genesis Evangelion), and even a twinge of black comedy. Kaiba takes place in a world where memories can be stored in tiny cones called ""chips"", and bodies are interchangeable. The consequence here is that there have come to be more chips than bodies, and the latter are themselves now a commodity. But that's not all! Memories themselves can be uploaded, downloaded, altered, erased, or fabricated wholesale. They, of course, are a commodity too. This sort of thing is really where Kaiba's cyberpunk shows through, it's positively Ghost In The Shell-ian. 

The first half of Kaiba is largely episodic and here it somewhat resembles ""traveler adventure"" anime in structure. Things like Kino's Journey or Gun x Sword or (to give a western example) Samurai Jack. Our titular protagonist--who throughout a fair chunk of the first half of the series is stuck in bodies not his own--wakes up amnesiac with nothing but a locket containing a picture of a girl in a place called ""The Underworld"", whose population are oppressed by the rich living in ""Heaven"", physically above them, and protected by a thick smog of memory-erasing gas in between. With the help of a vigilante named Popo he escapes to a luxury space cruiser, where he travels from planet to planet on as a stowaway. Kaiba and his companion Nyon-Nyon (and their pursuer, the bearlike cop Vanilla) get into a number of….well it's hard to call them adventures, simply because most are horribly tragic.

Take the example of episode 3. When our heroes arrive on a small planet (no name is ever given), we're promptly introduced to Chroniko, an impoverished girl with long blue hair and a pair of bright purplish boots that she is quite proud of. We learn that she wants to save money so she can someday leave the tiny backwater planet she calls home. Then we learn that her body is being sold--quite literally--to help out her mother and brothers. We learn that this isn't the first time some part of Chroniko has been sold for profit, we learn that memories of her favorite books and music have been sold too.

Of course to Chroniko this all comes out in the wash. She assures herself that one day, after her brothers get good jobs, her mother will buy her a new body and she'll live again. Not long after, we are given a scene where this is quite emphatically proven to not be the case. Chroniko goes to get her procedure done, and the doctor supervising it tells her flat out that her chip will not be saved, and she will never return home. She is promptly dismantled as the horror of her situation sets in.

It is one thing for a character to be killed on-screen, and for the audience to watch them die. It is quite another for their existence to be, effectively, entirely erased and scattered to the wind as Chroniko's is. A show less interested in exploring its universe's nature might leave things at that, but the latter half of the episode is devoted to exploring Chroniko's memories, and the regret her mother feels at having sold her. Eventually, our protagonist even ends up in Chroniko's body--literally left in a trash heap by the smugglers who bought it. Ironically Kaiba-Chroniko is saved by the cop Vanilla from these smugglers (who seek to reclaim their quarry). Somewhere in here I must note that the man who sought to buy Chroniko's body was a literally duck-faced pedophile. It is a thorough gutting of her character. Someone so innocent is destroyed utterly by the depravity of the privileged rich. 

These themes and ideas begin to coalesce into a wider narrative in the show's latter half. Popo returns, the girl from the locket shows up, Kaiba himself is revealed to be King Warp, who we're lead to believe is a vile tyrant, ruling from Heaven over the people in the Underworld below, and the way that Kaiba's earlier episodic elements tie into these later more connected episodes is really something special. As an example; the recurring narrative of broken mother/child relationships repeats--first with Chroniko and her adopted mother selling her body, then with Popo and his mother selling her own body to save her son's life, only to be rejected by that same son, to finally, Kaiba having once been poisoned by his own mother for apparent reasons of political intrigue (though notable this last one turns out to not quite be the case, but the repetition remains).

In the world of Kaiba, these problems--broken parental relationships, people being condemned to horrible fates in bodies not their own, the commodification of body and memory, the gap between the rich and the poor, and even the late-game menace of the Kaiba Plant (no relation except by name) threatening to devour Heaven itself--are not just related, they are the same. Each feeds into each other.

To call Kaiba groundbreaking is no overstatement. 

It fills me with hope and joy for the medium that Kaiba's stylistic children are just now beginning to propagate. From Flip-Flappers--which shares its fixation on memory and mothers--to TRIGGER's sugar high crossover-fest Space Patrol Luluco, which is another peculiar take on the ""world story"" genre, it really feels like Kaiba's time in the sun is just starting to come. Perhaps it will remain an underground source of influence forever, but really, if you love anime or animation in general, if you love the strange and weird and wonderful, Kaiba almost certainly has something for you. There is so much I have not touched on--and have no room to touch on, really--that I simply must implore you, if any of this sounds at all interesting, to give Kaiba a go for yourself."
136149,"Oh, Mari Okada, I wish I knew how I felt about you as a creator. After her theatrical debut with Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms, she's back in the director's seat with a brand new movie, Maboroshi, or if you wanna use its Japanese title, Alice and Therese's Illusion Factory. No, I don't know why the Japanese title is so strange. I read something about how the names Alice and Therese, when said in Japanese together, also pronounce the name Aristotle in their language, which makes you wonder why they didn't just call it Aristotle's Illusion Factory, especially since there are no characters named Alice and Therese in the film, but I digress. Anyway, Mari Okada is pretty prominent in the anime circle, and people tend to be divided on what she works on or creates. Some like her stuff, others hate it, and some are mixed. There are anime she's worked on that I really love, such as AnoHana, Maquia, and Anthem of the Heart, but also titles that I'm really not a fan of, such as A Whisker Away, A Lull In The Sea, and Hanasaku Iroha. If you get the chance, I highly recommend you read her autobiography, as it's really enlightening and fascinating. Now that Maboroshi is out (I'm going to refer to it by the official English title that Netflix gave it for the sake of brevity)...unfortunately, I don't feel this movie is as good as Maquia. Someone on a blog I follow described it best, that Maboroshi is the most Mari Okada movie ever made, with all of her indulgences and writing tropes concentrated into one movie. Not gonna lie, they're absolutely right, and unfortunately, this isn't one of her better movies, which is a shame because there is a lot to like about it!

14-year-old Masamune Kikuiri is your average middle school kid who likes hanging with his friends and practicing drawing in his rural Japanese town. One day, an explosion at the local steelworks factory literally shatters the sky as if by magic, cutting the town off from the rest of Japan. Time is literally frozen. Nobody ages or grows old, the seasons never change, there's no new forms of entertainment, the world has truly become static. Everyone trudges on, hoping the world will right itself, but nothing changes. One day, Masamune has an unpleasant encounter with his mysterious classmate Mutsumi Sagami, who sneaks him into the abandoned factory to show him something...or rather, someone: A feral girl she's been taking care of in secret, whom Masamune names Itsumi. Upon getting to know her and the circumstances surrounding her imprisonment, Masamune discovers that Itsumi's existence might just be the key to figuring out why the town is in the state that its in. But some people fear what could happen if things change, doing all they can to keep the kids from helping Itsumi.

Gentle reader, I ask you, did you ever read that Ursula K. Le Guin book The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas and wonder why nobody in the book bothers to just rescue the abused child from their imprisonment? Mari Okada decided to actually do just that, taking that one question and building the whole house around it, which forms the backbone of Maboroshi. The story is actually the most interesting part about this movie, really going deep into examining just what being stuck in a truly static world and never physically changing does to a person and a whole community. Imagine being an elderly person who struggles with daily tasks who can't even die, or a pregnant woman whose child will never be born. It also explores what happens when people look to those who seem like they have the answers, even if the person in question is a crazy old coot whose explanations have no real basis in logic. Gee, that totally doesn't remind me of a cult leader or anything. The implications behind the world these people live in are really terrifying and depressing if you think about them, which is obviously intentional on the movie's part. Using all this to craft a story about the fear of change and the difference between making the best out of a bad situation and simply resigning yourself to it is done really well here.

The stellar animation and deliberately 90s music also really helps bring this dilapidated, static town to life, making it into a character of its own. Yes, Maboroshi is firmly set in the nineties on purpose, and kudos to the movie for really putting a lot of care into recreating that time period down to the last detail. Oh, and I bet you're wondering why the singer they brought on to sing the ending song has such an...interesting voice. Remember how in Maquia, Mari Okada really wanted to have Bravely Default veteran Akihiko Yoshida to do the character designs for the movie because she really liked his work? For Maboroshi, [according to this article](https://fast.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-06-28/miyuki-nakajima-performs-theme-song-for-mari-okada-mappa-alice-to-therese-no-maboroshi-kojo-anime-/.199682), Okada personally asked popular singer Miyuki Nakajima to create an original song just for the movie because she really loved her songs, and the reason her voice sounds so distinct and unlike most of what you hear in anime movies is because Nakajima is 71 years old. I admit I'm not familiar with Nakajima's work besides Shin-On, but the fact that she's still singing well into her seventies is pretty amazing.

God, you have no idea how much I wish I could have liked this movie more than I do. The basic set-up is interesting, and I actually cared about Itsumi's plight. Unfortunately, the characters and how Okada uses them are the movie's biggest weakness. I thought the male lead, Masamune, was fine as a character. Not the most three-dimensional, sure, but he has his reasons for doing what he does and his insecurities and frustrations are relatable. However, other than him and Itsumi, none of the other characters are in any way interesting or compelling whatsoever, and there are several that feel really out of place in this movie. I really could have done without that pervy fat kid and his antics. This also leads into one of Okada's biggest weaknesses as a writer: For some reason she has this bad tendency to shove pointless love triangles/polygons in the stuff she works on, even when having them would feel really out of place and on characters that she really doesn't bother to develop or flesh out. There's a girl in the movie whose only reason for existing is to tell Masamune she has a crush on him, and for a really dumb reason at that, and to be fridged just to get the main conflict going, and I really couldn't give a shit about her because the movie never bothered to flesh her out beyond the fact that she has a crush on Masamune. Plus, I really didn't like Mutsumi as a character, and the fact that the movie introduces her by having her show her panties to Masamune just to give them a reason to interact is just...gross. You literally could have done anything else just to get them to talk to one another. Hell, Mutsumi spends a lot of her time being mean to Masamune and dragging him into her problems, with Masamune rightfully calling her out on her behavior a lot of the time...and then later in the movie they're suddenly in love and falling all over themselves for each other. And I'm sorry, but I could not buy their romance at all. Not only did they hardly ever spend time with one another for there to be any romantic or even friendly chemistry between them whatsoever, Mutsumi spends so much of the movie being a bitch that I really couldn't see why Masamune would even fall in love with her in the first place. Every attempt at romance in this movie seems thrown in there just for the sake of shoving in some contrived drama when they could easily be cut out to make for time to actually develop the characters. You could literally cut most of the side characters out of the movie and it'd probably be better off.

And for as much as I like the overall story for this movie, a lot of the conflict stems from people acting like arrogant pricks who can't use their heads for one second or even refusing to do really basic things that could have been resolved things right then and there. There's so many plot threads left hanging and basic questions the movie just flat-out doesn't answer because it's more concerned about having every character fall in love than actually doing something. Such as the following: !Why does nobody bother to tell Itsumi that she's actually Masamune and Mutsumi's daughter from the future? Or that she somehow Doctor Who'd herself into the past? For that matter, why did the movie feel the need to make Itsumi be romantically jealous of the middle school versions of her parents? That's just super creepy, moreso considering how infantilized she is. Outside of the whole pointless romantic drama, what happens to the people who get cracks and disappear? Do they just...magically get transported into the future, or do they flat-out die? What the hell even are those smoke wolves?! I want answers, movie!!

Man, it sucks that I couldn't enjoy this movie more, because it does have some genuinely great stuff in it, and I think its great that Mari Okada is being allowed to do more of what she wants as a creator. I certainly hope she gets to do more things after this. But I and other people find that her works tend to be better when she has someone to reign her in sometimes or if she just cuts the needless romantic drama bullshit. So yeah, I prefer Maquia over Maboroshi, as the latter is a little too preoccupied with pointless drama to care much about character development or really making full use of its potential. But that's not to say Maboroshi doesn't have anything to offer, like I mentioned above. If you like the movie, more power to you. Maboroshi isn't the best or worst thing Okada made, and I hope the next movie she makes is successful. Oh, and I recommend you watch the English dub, both because it is genuinely very good, and because they cast an actual child actress to play Itsumi, which makes her sound far more authentic and bearable to listen to compared to putting up with the literal auditory nightmare that is Misaki Kuno's squeak toy voice."
102882,"REVIEW 3D KANOJO: REAL GIRL 2ND SEASON (NOT SPOILER-FREE)

Ok primeiramente, a partir de agora eu vou escrever minhas reviews em português porque é mais fácil pra mim, também dividirei as categorias em tópicos pra poder ajudar.
img840()

-- ENREDO --
O enredo desta temporada é ABSURDAMENTE melhor que a primeira, desta vez os personagens realmente expressam os sentimentos e o anime trabalhou mais nos relacionamentos secundários. Na review da primeira temporada eu deixei claro de que eu queria mais desenvolvimento no relacionamento do Itou e da Ayado. E ainda ganhei de brinde o casamento da Arisa e Takanashi. Eu adorei os últimos episódios principalmente, onde o Tsutsui fazia questão de viver o melhor que ele podia com a Iroha até que o prazo de 6 meses se esgotasse. Durante o anime, tanto na primeira quanto na segunda season, ficava claro de que tinha algo estranho com a Igarashi, mas não deixava tão explícito. Na minha cabeça, de dois um: Ou ela tava mentindo pra fazer o Tsutsun se esforçar o máximo que ele podia para viver a vida sem arrependimentos, ou ela ia morrer... Acontece que eu errei feio. Gostei bastante do final onde todos se reencontram depois de ela esquecer tudo e o casal que tinha se separado se casam novamente. img820()
 
--ANIMAÇÃO--
Como eu já deixei escapar no último tópico, dessa vez parece que os animadores se esforçaram e fizeram eles terem sentimentos, o anime ficou muito mais bem polido, a lineart ficou boa também e uma animação bem mais fluida.

--PERSONAGENS--
ISSO SIM MELHOROU. Tenho que dizer o seguinte, os personagens mudam MUITO, mas MUITO MESMO. Eles tem um CD muito bom e eu gostei bastante das coisas em relação à eles. Temos o Tsusui: Deixa de ser um cara chatão e começa a entender os sentimentos dos outros, no final vira uma pessoa bem sucedida. Itou e Ayado: Amadurecem muito mesmo, parecem até outras pessoas, na fase adulta eles se separam, a Ayado se casa, divorcia e eles voltam. O Takanashi realmente foi o que teve o maior desenvolvimento: deixou de ser um personagem despresível na primeira season, ficou rejeitando a Arisa (alívio cômico). A irmã dele namorava o irmão do cara que ele odiava (Tsusui), por causa de algumas confusões ele entendeu o amor da irmã dele e passou a ser mais mente aberta com as coisas. Depois ele começou a sair com a Arisa, e começaram a namorar. Namoro esse que no futuro faria os dois se casarem e terem um filho. Nessa época ele começou a apreciar o Tsusui pela pessoa que ele havia se tornado.

--TRILHA SONORA--
Tinha umas musiquinhas legais, nas partes emocionantes tocava um violino quase inesquecível. Porém, não tão marcante.

--OPENING--
Novamente melhor que a primeira season, tenho que dizer que dessa vez ambas a música e a animação eram moderadas e meio chicletes.

I didn't exactly planned on making this so this is going to be pretty small review.

Everyday life. We got our struggles, we got our hopes. We got someone we love and someone we hate. We got something good and bad at every corner, but we have control over it. At least we believe so, but that's kind of the point. Having a belief, that tomorrow's going to be a better day. But like someone once said, ""Life fucks everyone"".

For Tosu Tetsuo, his family (his annoyingly oblivious daughter, to be precise) is what rises problems but it is also what grants him power, a reason to push forward. While the story tackles some other notable themes like Justice, Survival, Teamwork etc., it ultimately is about a father trying to protect what he loves, a son trying to get back what he lost, and a father trying to avenge his son. It's all about family.
The story does a great job at maintaining this suspense, and works well as a fine thriller. Though one thing that the show glosses over is the daughter. She's really left as a plot point, with her presence bringing an air of annoyance since the characters we know would be going through a lot of crap because of her flaws while she's over her room watching cat videos.
One thing I particularly like about the story is how it shows Tetsuo's weakness. For all his ""all according to keikaku"" planning, the show makes it point that he's still weak, makes mistakes and sometimes all he can do is pray. Though it might pull some asspulls every now and then. It also does a good job at highlighting the moral dilemma he faces, being crushed by the wait of his sins.

I'm pretty sure the manga benefits from this, because this Anime really highlights it's story and writing, by having a weak production. From it's almost slideshow-ish animation, poor action scenes, bland opening song and generic sound; it's production is ultimately it's downfall. I guess the only selling point in production would be voice acting.

There are plenty of other movies/shows that follow a similar plotline like,
Devotion of Suspect X (Novel) and it's [adaptations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDevotionofSuspectX) across multiple languages and countries.
And of course Drishyam, which is loosely based on Devotion X, which currently available in like 4 different languages, and an unnecessary but still entertaining sequel. The anime has been compared to this pretty often during the beginning of the show's airing, but it's pretty different from that, though the tone and overall themes are pretty much the same.
Or
! Just read the manga :)!

This is an engaging thriller/drama that's working with a low budget. It's watchable but there are better options."
21361,"You might have heard of Cygames. They made [The Idolm@ster: Cinderella Girls](https://anilist.co/anime/20693/TheIdolmsterCinderellaGirls) (Joint with Bandai Namco), [Shingeki no Bahamut](https://anilist.co/anime/20590/ShingekinoBahamutGenesis), Shadowverse and, obviously Granblue Fantasy.

If you don't know, Granblue Fantasy is a turn-based mobile RPG with a gacha system. That's probably the best way to describe it simply.

Fair warning before we start, this review will contain unmarked spoilers. So if you can't take spoilers, stop reading and go do something else. Also, as this is an adaptation, I will be making some comparisons to the game and its story.

So, [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/A1Pictures), probably best known for the [Sword Art Online](https://anilist.co/anime/11757/SwordArtOnline) anime adaptation. Notably for Cygames they did [The Idolm@ster: Cinderella Girls](https://anilist.co/anime/20693/TheIdolmsterCinderellaGirls) anime adaptation. Certainly this is quite different from an idol/cute girls doing cute things anime.

Let's talk about the art style and the quality of the animation. The art style seems rather rough. It feels like they didn't quite sharpen the characters. Overall the animation is fine, aside from some moments in Episodes 1 and 2.

Time to talk about the main thing, the story. Until Episode 8, the anime is an almost straight adaptation of the game's story. Inside an Erste Empire airship a knight called [Katalina](https://gbf.wiki/Katalina) is taking a mysterious girl called [Lyria](https://gbf.wiki/Lyria) and escaping from the Empire. After a general named [Pommern](https://gbf.wiki/Pommern) waves a glowing purple crystal near Lyria, which seems to cause her some pain, the crystal causes an explosion on the Empire's airship which flings Lyria out of it and down to the ground below. After the OP we cut to a boy named Gran (the game's male protagonist). This farmer boy and his pet/friend, a small dragon-like-thing (that constantly reminds people that call him a lizard that he is not one) [Vyrn](https://gbf.wiki/Vyrn) see something (Lyria) falling down to the island and goes off with Vyrn to investigate. As is typical in an RPG game he takes his sword with him. Gran finds Lyria lying unconscious on the ground. After some knights of the Empire attack Gran, Katalina appears to help.

It all sounds very much like a typical Final Fantasy game doesn't it? Yeah well, this is more or less the start of the game's story.

Anyway, some more things happen and so based on a letter Gran's father sent him, Gran, Lyria and Katalina set off on a journey to Estalucia, the so-called ""Island of the Astrals"". They are later joined by the airship helmsman [Rackam](https://gbf.wiki/Rackam) and the young mage [Io](https://gbf.wiki/Io).

Yeah, it still sounds like a typical Final Fantasy plot. You can't really blame the anime for this, as I said a few lines up, it's the game's story.

However, as I mentioned, Episode 8 (A Pair Apart) changes things. Episode 8 is mainly a filler/side-quest episode which features the treasure hunters [Mary](https://gbf.wiki/Mary) and [Karva](https://gbf.wiki/Karva). (Actual characters you can get in the game (!))

Episode 9 (Horizon in the Clouds) goes back to the story again but decides to deviate from the game's story. In the game's story the party goes to the Auguste Isles in pursuit of the [Black Knight](https://gbf.wiki/BlackKnight) and meet the retired skyfarer [Eugen](https://gbf.wiki/Eugen) who is an old friend of Rackam. We find the Empire has come to the isles and has been polluting the oceans which annoys the local Primal Beast Leviathan. The party put a stop to the Empire's plans and beat up Leviathan and calm it down. After that the party head to the Lumacie Archipelago, meet the even more mysterious JK woman [Rosetta](https://gbf.wiki/Rosetta), who joins the party, and beat up and calm down the Primal Beast [Yggdrasil](https://gbf.wiki/Yggdrasil).

The anime however keeps the plot point of the Empire polluting the oceans and meeting Eugen, but the party decide to split up and do some individual tasks while Gran and Lyria explore Auguste. Two more obtainable characters, [Lowain](https://gbf.wiki/Lowain) (along with his bros Elsam and Tomoi) and [Karteira](https://gbf.wiki/Karteira), have a small voiced role. At the end of the episode Lyria is kidnapped by mysterious assailants and in Episode 10 (Separation), Pommern, for lack of a better word, mind breaks Lyria by reminding her that she is a tool. Complete with flashbacks which briefly feature the summon [Lich](https://gbf.wiki/Lich). At the same time Leviathan is clearly annoyed and is trying to flood the island. The party are saved by Rosetta (who also made brief appearances in Episodes 3 and 9) and are told that if they want to heal Lyria they'll need to accompany Rosetta to Lumacie and meet Yggdrasil. The party leaves Eugen behind to help the residents of Auguste while Leviathan is still rampaging.

Episode 11 (Lyria's Wish) starts off by showing something that the game had never shown or hinted at until not long after the episode aired: Yggdrasil can shrink herself to human-size. The episode features Gran diving into Lyria's mind to convince her that she's a friend. After healing Lyria and a brief skirmish with the Empire the party leave Rosetta and Yggdrasil and head back to Auguste. Of course Episode 12 (Showdown on the High Seas) culminates with a battle with with Leviathan.

Episode 12, however, features a multitude of playable characters; Mary and Karva return and also the episode shows (in no particular order): [Yuel](https://gbf.wiki/Yuel), [Yodarha](https://gbf.wiki/Yodarha), [Narmaya](https://gbf.wiki/Narmaya), [Silva](https://gbf.wiki/Silva), [Soriz](https://gbf.wiki/Soriz), [Jessica](https://gbf.wiki/Jessica), [Feather](https://gbf.wiki/Feather), [Charlotta](https://gbf.wiki/Charlotta) and [Zeta](https://gbf.wiki/Zeta).

Episode 13 (Another Sky) decides to do something different: A fanservice beach episode. However Gran has been replaced with Djeeta (the game's female protagonist). Djeeta offers to help a beach bar in Auguste which has run out of ice. Some more characters that are playable in the game get cameos. (This time I can't be be bothered to list and link them.)

Overall, as I mentioned multiple times the plot is very much a generic Final Fantasy plot. The changes from the game's plot tries to keep it fresh for people who play the game, while still keeping a story for new people. The trouble is its too generic. The story is rather boring, honestly. I can't blame the anime for this though, this does lie as a fault with the with the game.

Gee, I've talked about the plot a lot, haven't I?

Okay, time for something different, the music. Most of the music is taken from the game directly or is a new arrangement. (the anime does particularly seem fond of using [The Rusty Bloodline That Burns the Blue Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZBYZn423U). There seems to be a few small incidental tracks that are original. That isn't to say the music is bad (I actually kinda like Granblue's music). The music is mainly composed by [Nobuo Uematsu](https://anilist.co/staff/100150/NobuoUematsu) and [Tsutomu Narita ](http://vgmdb.net/artist/6443). Personally, I feel the OP and ED are forgettable.

Next I feel I should talk about the voice actors. (Don't worry, the review is nearly done.) The cast is mostly the same as the games with a few exceptions: Eugen is voiced by [Kazuhiro Yamaji](https://anilist.co/staff/101755/) (Who happens to voice Yngwie in the game instead of [Keiji Fujiwara](https://anilist.co/staff/95063/KeijiFujiwara), Gran and Djeeta are usually voiceless ingame but are voiced here by [Yuuki Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/96154/) and [Hisako Kanemoto] (https://anilist.co/staff/103555/), respectively. Overall, the voice acting is spot-on, the actors are putting emotion into their lines, as they should be.

One thing I quickly want to note, is that Pommern is a lot more evil in the anime. The game shows later in the story and in a side-quest that he isnt a complete jerk and that he has his nice moments when he isn't dealing with the party.

Ok, final thoughts time. If you're looking for an anime to pick up, watch something else. If you're interested in Granblue Fantasy, there's plenty of vids of the gameplay and story on Youtube, watch them instead. If you're a Granblue veteran, consider only watching Episode 13 and possibly Episode 12.

By the way, the DVDs and BDs contain codes for ingame items (including exclusive items), so expect them to sell well enough for the anime to get a 2nd season.

(Sorry for the length of this review, by the way.)"

Story
The story follows Alina, a guild receptionist who wants to clock out on time. However, she’s forced to work overtime everyday because of the extra work created by guilds and dungeons. With a special ability and a secret outfit, Alina dons the name of “Executioner” to try to cut down any force that could give her overtime. However, a certain guild ends up crossing paths with Alina, which ends up leading to chaos.



Characters
Alina is determined to keep her life as a guild receptionist and her life as the “Executioner” a secret. Her entire goal is to just avoid overtime and clock out on time. Later on, Alina crosses paths with Jade, Lululee, and Lowe, who are all members of a popular guild. Lowe and Lululee are very friendly and both contribute to the team with their own aspects of magic. Jade is the main leader and attacker of the guild. He and his guild usually need the assistance of Alina to take down powerful opponents.



The Good
I like the idea of a guild receptionist being a really powerful being in disguise. It’s unique and it created a couple of humorous and entertaining scenes throughout the anime. Speaking of humor, that was probably the main highlight of the anime. Her only goal in life is to have a day without overtime. I mean, who would want overtime in the first place? The OP of the anime is majestic. The animation is so fluid and beautiful (also she mews so extra bonus points there). I know it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but I love the catchiness and “brain rot-ness” of the ED. It’s fun, engaging, and an absolute vibe.



The Bad
I’m going to be honest, despite how obvious it was, I could not get onboard with the romance that this anime had. It actually lost me at that part when it essentially became one of the main focuses of the story. I don’t believe that the romance was necessary or beneficial in helping out what was the main story and just ended up ruining the quality of the execution quite a bit. A little nitpick I have is the contrast between the OP and the actual show in terms of animation. The OP feels way more fluid and detailed than the actual episodes, and it kinda throws me off. Another nitpick I have is towards the ending. I felt that the action was very lackluster and cut too short to make space for what seems like a potential S2? I don’t know. I’m probably going to watch it if it’s announced.



The Downright Ugly
Mmmm yeah I don’t think there’s anything downright ugly about this anime.



Is It Worth The Watch?
Hmm…. I’m not really sure. Is it a nice anime? Yeah. However, is it something you really need to go out of your way to watch? I wouldn’t say so. I guess it’s not really worth the watch.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope this helped you with your decision on whether to watch this anime or not! If you already have watched it, I hope that you can agree with me with some of the points I made. ^^"
139606,"If you told me that this season I would find 2 series which are basically shows that look like they were written in 2015 and that I would have them as some of my favourites shows in 2023, then I wouldn't believe you, but here we are, and while I had no plans on writting a review about Temple because I can barely think of what to say besides that ""it was a very fun show"", on the other hand there is Eiyuu Kyoushitsu. I'm not surprised by people being very negative about it, after all, it is basically one of those magic school harem series that were the trend before isekais came around, and while watching the first episode I immediatly thought ""this looks like it was written in 2015"" and I was (not really) surprised to see it was, in fact, a light novel from 2015. But what exactly made me like Eiyuu Kyoushitsu? Well, because unike most of the light novels from those times, this one was actually fun to watch.

The protagonist Blade gets to the school and asks some people to be his friends, because his goal is to have many friends, and the reason is because he was a hero that couldn’t live like an ordinary person at all so he wants to try it now that he doesn’t have those duties, but he is terrible acting normal because he has never experienced such thing, and that’s basically what the show goes about. Since this is a light novel, the format on which it works on is that a different girl has the spotlight for the adaptation of a volumen, and the very first moment we get to the school we see a speedrun of the tsundered redhead with fire powers with Earnest, the thing with her is that while her fire powers make her strong, they come from a sword with a demon inside which she couldn’t control and her hair became red because of it, over time she starts acting less tsundere-ish once the thing with her sword is solved, as the show basically deals with the kind of stuff you would see in these magic school series adding just some minor stuff. As per usual, there are a lot of female characters since, to no one’s surprise, this is also a harem series, girls like Sophie (whom I like to call a Rei Ayanami clone) or Maria (who is the daughter of the demon King Blade defeated in the past) and even a dragon loli are in here, and while their characters aren’t complex they can be fun to watch. I was even surprised when the minor characters that I thought wouldn’t matter at all, the ones that Blade first contacted in the school, actually reappeared across the series multiple times helping Blade on whatever he was doing and had some moments for themselves, even if some of them were as simple as being interested in a girl and wanting to do whatever to get her.

I know this is going for the anime director because there's no way this kind of stuff is working into a written medium this easily, specially because many of them require visual cues, there are a lot of jokes that are references to different series and that is incorporated into the humour. There is some classic stuff like Shaft-like headtilts and Shokugeki no Soma's foodgasms, but the first time I was pleasantly surprised with these references is when I saw fricking Galeon from GaoGaiGar (a 90s show most people outside Japan don't even know) spouting water from its mouth in a mixed bathing to the point it was even recognized by that series' writer Yuuichirou Takeda in a Tweet, in another episode there is someone screaming ""STAND ALONE COMPLEX"" to name her plan of getting a soul into an android, and others that were easily recognizable like recreating the ""Congratulations!"" from Evangelion and the final scene of Ashita no Joe, this series has unironically better taste in anime than most anime fans I have seen.

Aside from references to other series the comedy itself is solid, as while some scenes definitely look more exagerated than they should be, some others hit me just right. This is the kind of series that can change from having a big fight with a huge monster to a very heartwarming moment celebrating someone's birthday where he is happy for being born, basically think about what Spy x Family does but actually good, it just has this very nice atmosphere all around. Take for example this scene where the MC and the Rei Ayanami Clone decide to go on a date and, since both most definitely don't know how to have one since they are utterly unaware of how normal humans act, they proceed to have one of the most autistic dates I have seen in an anime, and I loved that shit, and by the end of the episode, where Sophie tells Blade her backstory, it ends in a more heartwarming note.

However, this suffers from the same thing these adaptations used to suffer, obvious censorship in fanservice and bad animation. I mean, the animation in this series doesn't look good at all, it is barely animated at times and the characters aside from the main cast look like main characters from Boku no Hero Academia. And the censorship is obvious, the girls are literal barbie dolls, while I like the fact they aren't feigning they have nipples by hinding it under impossibly glued hair covering the breasts, it still looks kinda weird, and in other scenes like the mixed bathing? Would you really guess this series actually makes the girls wear bikinis instead of making them go naked? I don't know about the novel or even about the manga, but I'm sure you bathe naked.

Eiyuu Kyoushitsu is actually something I had my doubts at the beggining, I mean, how I could not with magic school harems? They have been dissapointing me a long time, but after watching it for some weeks, it became one of my favourites shows of this season, being very fun despite its obvious flaws in production.

Thank you for reading."
19775,"When hearing the term  mecha, one can’t be blamed if the image of gigantic mobile suits launching rocket-propelled fists at each other come to mind. After all, this is how many was first introduced to this bizarre  genre. While many mechas still exhibit similar traits nowadays, every once in a while comes a show like Sidonia no Kishi, which downplays the mecha so much that even replacing them with something else entirely  wouldn’t change  the story by one bit.

 img320()

The story of Sidonia no Kishi is set in the far future, where mankind has been forced to retreat into “seed ships”, basically gigantic spaceships, to preserve themselves after the planet Earth was destroyed by a mysterious race of aliens known as the ‘gauna’. Nobody knows where the gauna came from or what they want from mankind, but the story mainly focuses on the efforts of a military team (dubbed the “knights”) to prevent the gauna from reaching and thus destroying one of the seed ships, “Sidonia”. They do this through the use of mecha units dubbed the “grades”, which in execution is very akin to a fighter jet.

 img320()

The premise itself seems very generic. We have the human’s mothership, an attacking alien race, and a team of pilots tasked to protect the mothership (which is where of course our protagonist is). Of course, premises don’t mean that much to an anime – true beauty lies in its execution – in which Sidonia no Kishi did surprisingly well.
The crew did their best to make the setting as believable as possible. Even though most of the anime takes place in the ridiculous setting that is Sidonia, the anime explains everything sufficiently enough that you’ll never find yourself confused or objecting to any of the events that happen in the anime.

You’ll also find that the show doesn’t fell slow nor dragged on. There’s always a new development – whether it’s a new gauna or interpersonal relationship problems – to keep the show going forward.  There isn’t much of an overarching plot however, and due to this often times the development feels forced – like how a gauna always manages to appear at the right time.

 img320()

But by far the biggest flaw of Sidonia no Kishi’s story is its characters. They’re shallow, one-dimensional, and they never seem to do anything new. To make matters worse, our protagonist is too perfect. He never messes up, and even if he did, it was because of another character’s doing.  He doesn’t react much to other people’s insult, and he doesn’t react much to their praises either. He’s not a Gary Stu or anything, but a human being must at least have a few flaws.

Other than the story, the first thing you might’ve noticed when watching this anime is its very peculiar animation. Unlike many animes, Sidonia no Kishi is done in full 3D. I’m not talking about Pixar-esque 3D, it’s more similar to 3D JRPGs taken up a notch.

 img320()

As expected from 3DCG animation, the shadows are very well done. They are updated dynamically according to its light source, which is something very hard to do using traditional hand-drawn methods. In addition, POLYGON PICTURES opted to have the shadows to be very prominent, and this results in some very nice looking scenes.  The 3DCG also allows for very impressive looking battle scenes. Whether its a dogfight or a gauna encounter, you’ll never find the animation in Sidonia no Kishi to be lacking in the action department.

It’s not all flowers and sunshine, however. The animation in Sidonia no Kishi suffers from 2 major flaws that holds it back from truly being great.

Firstly, movement, especially  those of the human characters, seem very awkward. As many of you are probably aware, making natural-looking 3D animation is not an easy task. Many major 3D animation studios spend a crapload amount of budget just to overcome this one problem – budget, that POLYGON PICTURES certainly doesn’t have.  You might think that I’m overexaggerating the magnitude of this problem, but trust me, it’s nothing small.  There is a lot of screentime devoted to the characters in Sidonia no Kishi, and having their every little movement feel awkward really gets annoying. Yes, you might feel used to it after a few episodes, but the awkwardness won’t dissapear – it will always be there.

Secondly, it’s the framerate. The framerate of Sidonia no Kishi’s animation is very inconsistent. It might be fine for most of an episode, but it’s not rare for it to have a sudden drop. Some episodes even have most of their duration in low framerate. This is especially true during more complex scenes, such as gauna encounters, where the animation would feel so choppy that you can no longer shrug the issue off.

 img320()

In the sound department, I don’t really have much to say. Sidonia no Kishi has a lackluster OP and ED, and the background music aren’t really that memorable either. I’m not saying the background music are unpleasant, however – they do add to the mood – but you’ll likely just forget about them by the time the episode ends.
About the voice acting, again, I don’t really have much to say. They get the job done, but they’re not really any better than any other anime, be it mecha or not.

Now with all that said and done, that brings us to our final question: is the anime worth watching?

Despite all its flaws, Sidonia no Kishi does one crucial thing great and that is swaying its audience’s emotions. You’ll likely find yourself thrilled, shocked, happy, or even angry according to the anime’s set rhythm. Many animes set in a similar setting fail at this and end up being 3edgy5me – Sidonia no Kishi masterfully doesn’t – so I say give it a shot. If you’re a sci-fi fan like I am, you’ll probably like it."
127412,"Today I'm here talking about one of the many valid romances of this season. Since I have the review ready for ""My Senpai is Annoying"" and I'm not going to do it about Komi-san, I'm going to talk a little about the anime that perhaps most of all has passed into the background this season.





PLOT:
Taishou Otome presents himself as a sort of counterpart of Tonikawa (which I did not like). So why did I like this so much more? The main reasons are 3. The first is that the setting in a more ""ancient"" historical context (1920) made the work more intriguing, especially for the fantastic ability to emphasize this context very well, in terms of customs, prices and even using historical events that really happened to reverse the situation at the end. The second reason is the fact that there is a much greater dose of drama than in Tonikaku. The life of the protagonists is characterized by a series of unpleasant, sad, difficult events that also disturb their own love relationship. These difficulties are due to selfish and incorrect behavior of some secondary characters, disabilities of the protagonist and particularly unfortunate accidental events. I will deal with the third reason better in the next paragraph because it is precisely the sympathy that the 2 protagonists gave me. To close the plot paragraph, the series alternates more peaceful and cute stand-alone episodes (even if they still remain tied to the plot due to the character developments that follow) with other dramatic ones for which it has the advantage of being able to vary very well between comedy and drama.

img1000()




CHARACTERS:
As I always say with regard to the slice of life genre (but it is a discourse that also applies to all the other series, even if in this genre it's predominant), the plot is made by the characters, with beautiful characters you always have a beautiful plot. This speech continues to be valid for Taishou Otome logically and I appreciated the work thanks to the presence of 2 excellent protagonists: Tamahiko (expelled by his father due to an incurable injury to his right hand) and Yuzuki (young girl who was sold to the Tamahiko's family to pay off a debt). Due to the trauma of his exile, Tamahiko is a wary boy who no longer has faith in himself and would just like to spend the rest of his life alone. Yuzuki is sent to the house where Tamahiko was exiled to take care of him and marry him in the following years.
Before continuing with the discourse on the characters, I always want to remember the historical context in which we find ourselves. Exiling a son for a hand injury or selling a daughter to pay off a debt are unthinkable nowadays, but in this period the mentality and customs were different.
Returning to where I had stopped, due to this situation the 2 enter more and more intimacy and Yuzuki manages to bring the light back into Tamahiko's life. As the protagonists develop their bond more and more they are put to the test by some very unpleasant situations caused by some secondary characters. The subjects in question are mainly Tamako (Tamahiko's sister, initially selfish) and Ryo (a girl from the village of Tamahiko, who tries to blackmail him to obtain financial support in order to allow the brothers to live in peace). Watch the series to see how these 2 characters evolve their personalities;). In the final episodes, instead, a series of much more friendly characters are introduced from the beginning and who help to support the protagonists and their relationship.

img1000() 



ANIMATIONS AND MUSIC:
On a graphic level, the anime is very simple but not in a negative way. The animation studio (Synergy SP) in fact, although not a high-level studio, succeeds perfectly in the intent to reveal the emotions that the characters feel, the anguish in their eyes in times of difficulty and their cuteness in periods brighter.
As for the music sector, the anime has a very catchy OP and ED and on the OST it hits us even if it does not shine particularly in any of these.



CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, I recommend to all lovers of the romance genre to recover this excellent series, especially to Tonikawa lovers. As mentioned above, I also recommend it to those like me who did not particularly appreciate the aforementioned work because it has very peculiar aspects that make it much more interesting. Also remember that these 12 episodes fully adapt the manga so it is also recommended for those who want to enjoy a short and complete series.

170083,"What if GT came out today but worse? 
This is what Daima is. Characters turn into kids, they look for Dragon Balls, there is a red dragon, Goku turns Super Saiyan 4.
If you have seen GT, there is generally not much reason to watch this except you need more Dragon Ball or want Vegeta to use Super Saiyan 3. 

Generally people excuse this by saying this is canon or its good because Toriyama has written it. You need to remove that mindset and realize that it doesn't work that way. There are way too many contradictions in the show that make it impossible for Super to continue after this. Either one is canon and the other isn't or both aren't canon if you use that mindset.

What about the humor? 
It is ok. It is not really Dragon Ball funny but you do get good laughs unlike in Super. Sadly, the jokes are so mediocre that often I had to turn of my streaming device and do something else. Not a single episode was good enough to keep my attention for long

The fights were not really impressive either. There were no antagonist that gave me the feeling of ""Oh no, what they are gonna do?"". I don't know if that was because of knowing how Dragon Ball ends or the atmosphere of the show. If you look at Dragon Ball GT, you felt like there was something at stake when Goku fought Baby or Omega Shenron. If you look Z, you felt like things are real.
But in Daima, the enemy can be a billion times stronger and you still don't feel there is anything to worry about.
Thus seeing Super Saiyan 4 used against these kinds of foes feels hallow.

There is also a plot device introduced really early that should introduce fusion that was never used once. So don't get your hopes up.
There is another retcon to Boo's origin which makes it the 3rd attempt to come up with an origin story for Boo.
Due to budget issues, while they gave Vegeta Super Saiyan 3, they changed its design in a way it doesn't look like how Super Saiyan 3 should look.
New Super Saiyan 4's introduction is underwhelming taking away everything what made the original special. It has a design change too so it is not the same as in GT. Which just means they put a pallet swap on it like with Super Saiyan Blue and made certain body parts different.
Sadly, not even Daima is safe from the lasers guns that could harm Super Saiyan Blue Goku.

Generally it is better than Dragon Ball Super. I mean its hard to make a show worse than Super but it is still not good. Super was awfully bad but at least it kept you most the time watching to figure out what will go wrong next?
In Daima everything is so mediocre and doesn't stand out. If it was Dragon Quest, nobody would watch this show.
While people start calling it a 'better' GT, I question how? There are like at most 2 'good' episodes but that depends on how much you enjoy transformation sequences and maybe fights in final forms. 
Like my favorite Cell Saga episode is the Drivers license episode but most think the best part is Gohan going Super Saiyan 2 and fighting Cell. That kind of way.
However, I argue that GT had far more highlights, far more engaging fights and far better transformation sequences for the introduction of Super Saiyan 4.

If you wanna watch Daima, you have to watch it as a different take on Dragon Ball compared to Super and GT, like adventure 'more' and that adventure being more wholesome than comedic, Super Saiyan 3 Vegeta, Demon Realm lore and want to see Super Saiyan 4 again (which you can see in GT and Heroes too but better). Don't watch the show thinking its 'canon', for the 'good' fights and comedy."
21708,"I'm not really sure how to talk about this one without spoiling anything for you, but I'm going to give it my best shot. This show moves so fast that if you blink, you'll miss something story-critical and be confused for the next three episodes. Although it could have certainly used a couple more episodes so that it didn't feel like the show just did a line of cocaine before it started rolling, I don't think that the pacing really made THAT much of an impact on the content. It might be a detractor for those of you that aren't fast/peripheral subtitle readers, but for those of us that have no issue with series like Monogatari, this will be child's play. I'd even go as far as to say it's not the speed that makes this series a little ""confusing"" at points, but rather the way that the plot is presented. Flash-sideways, flashbacks, and the like are all employed to the point where keeping the different inter-weaving parts of the story straight can become a little difficult to some. That being said, I watched eighteen series this season and had no issue actively following this, so the effort required to get the full effect of the plot (which is honestly engaging and wraps up pretty well) is going to vary from watcher to watcher. If I could say anything to set you at ease about the speed/dialogue, it would be that Occultic;Nine dialogue kind of like an episode of Law and Order: characters are constantly moving while talking at an accelerated rate, even though their movement doesn't exactly add anything to the dialogue nine times out of ten, except that sometimes that movement is replaced by dutch angles instead. At the end of the day though, the plot was interesting enough to keep me on the hook every week, and the mystery and its resolution are legitimately intriguing. That's more than can be said for most anime mystery plots. 

Speaking of visuals, this one definitely had a stand-out art style and direction, employing this soft-line style that allows character designs to look incredibly consistent with their backgrounds while still keeping an insanely high level of detail in their character designs. A-1 Pictures is a master of character design when they want to stray from their ""A-1 face"" design templates, and this show proves yet again that they can be just as visually consistent and impressive as the most in-house studios when pressured to be. The character designs overall are very good, outside of our MC looking a tad generic in comparison and another HUGE issue that will be obvious to you immediately. There are multiple times when this show is animated ""on-ones"" (24 frames of animation for 24 frames-per-second video playback) to incredible effect. ""Camera work"" is another thing I would highlight with this show, as it frequently employs dutch angles and other framing techniques to keep the setting interesting and give you more opportunities to take in the lush background art. Voice acting was also pretty killer considering just how fast the dialogue can get at times, and although the music was pretty good I wouldn't be handing out out any awards to it. The visuals were the definitive draw here in the aesthetic department.

If you are pretty fast with subtitles and are looking for a good mystery, give this one a look. One of the top five this season for sure and a definitive visual treat."

English Review:

Hey everyone. My name is Blaze9 and welcome to my quick review of ソウナンですか？(“Sounan Desu ka?”), also known as “Are You Lost?”. This is gonna be a spoiler-free review.

Overview:

Sounan Desu Ka is a comedy anime, adapted from the original manga of Kentaro Okamoto and Riri Sagara, presented in twelve episodes of 13 minutes. It aired from July 2nd, 2019 to Sep 17th, 2019 and is also the first anime that I decided to watch on this season. 

Now let’s talk a bit about the story and characters:

Story: 

This is an anime about 4 girls that get involved in a plane crash and somehow survive. However, they find themselves lost in an island that looks deserted, and now, leaded by a girl named Homare (that conveniently has impressive survival knowledge), they must overcome their pride, understand their situation, work together and learn how to survive alone in this island. 

Well, if you considerer only what I told on the previous paragraph, you might think it’s a very serious anime, but it actually isn’t. Now, the first reason why I picked this to watch was because I thought the premise was interesting. I mean, getting lost in an island surely gives some great margin for writing a story. If the author wanted, this could totally turn into a very serious story. Turns out this became of the most clean, educative and funny animes of the season. I don’t have any problem with that, and I think I could even call it an Iyashikei. The second reason was because I loved the art, haha.

But, there is a little bit of ecchi on it, mind you.

Now, I will give my notes on this anime, with some extra commentary:

Opening and Ending: 9/10 - Opening is great. Song is fun, the dynamics are pleasant and well animated. The ending is simpler but is also decent.

Soundtrack: 6/10 - It’s normal. It serves its purposes.

Animation: 9/10 – Not only it gives us beautiful, colorful scenarios, but you also don’t have those times where you think you’re watching a slide presentation. The comedic story also takes advantage of the animation for some scenes and provides some great moments.

Voice Acting: 8/10 – Voice acting is very professional, as expected. 

What I would change: Sorry if I offend someone, but I think Homare is kinda boring. But it’s not because of the interpretation of anything. It’s just the nature of her character. If I could change something it would be her way of acting. Don’t get it wrong though, I liked Homare and I would never remove her of the story.

Conclusion:

Well, I loved it. I have watched a decent number of anime to this point and Sounan Desu Ka gave me a fresh air I was not expecting from it. It gave me some of the best times of the week, despite my humor, and made me look forward to the Tuesdays. If you’re reading this and did not watch it yet, do it. There is a high chance you’re gonna like it.

Thank you very much for reading.

Olá. Eu sou o Blaze9 e bem-vindos ao meu rápido review de ソウナンですか？(“Sounan Desu ka?”), também conhecido como “Are You Lost?” ou “Você Está Perdido?” em português. Este review não conterá nenhum tipo de spoiler.

Visão Geral:

Sounan Desu Ka é um anime de comédia, adaptado do mangá original de Kentaro Okamoto e Riri Sagara, apresentado em 12 episódios de 13 minutos cada. Foi ao ar de 2 de julho de 2019 a 17 de setembro de 2019, e também é o primeiro anime dessa temporada que eu decidi assistir.
 
Agora vamos falar um pouquinho sobre a história e os personagens:

História: 

Este é um anime sobre 4 garotas que se envolvem num acidente de avião, e de alguma forma sobrevivem. Porém, elas acabam perdidas numa ilha que aparenta estar deserta. E agora, lideradas por uma garota chamada Homare, as outras 3 meninas precisam superar seus orgulhos, entender sua situação, trabalhar juntas e aprender a sobreviver sozinhas nessa ilha.
 
Bom, se levarmos em conta só o que eu disse no parágrafo anterior, você pode pensar que é um anime bem sério, mas na verdade não é. O primeiro motivo pelo qual eu peguei esse anime pra assistir é porque a premissa me pareceu interessante. Se perder numa ilha dá uma margem bem interessante pra escrever uma história. Se fosse a vontade do autor, isso poderia ter virado uma história super séria. Mas acontece que esse na verdade foi um dos animes mais limpos, educativos e engraçados da temporada. Por mim tudo bem, e eu acho até que posso chamá-lo de Iyashikei. O segundo motivo foi porque eu adorei a arte, haha.

Mas só pra constar, tem ecchi.

Agora irei dar minhas notas para este anime, juntamente com alguns comentários extras:

Abertura e Encerramento: 9/10 – A abertura é ótima. A música é divertida, as dinâmicas são bem agradáveis e bem animadas. O encerramento é mais simples, mas também é bem feito.
 
Trilha sonora: 6/10 – É normal. Serve ao seu propósito.

Animação: 9/10 – Não apenas o anime nos apresenta lindos e coloridos cenários como também não têm nenhum momento daqueles que fica parecendo uma apresentação de PowerPoint. A história cômica também tira proveito da animação pra algumas cenas, criando alguns momentos bem legais.
 
Atuação de Voz: 8/10 – A atuação e interpretação são bem profissionais, exatamente como esperado. 

O que eu mudaria: Desculpe se eu ofender alguém, mas eu acho que a Homare é meio chatinha. Mas não é por causa da interpretação nem nada. É por causa da natureza da personagem. Se eu pudesse mudar algo, seria a forma dela de agir. Mas não entenda errado, eu gosto da Homare e jamais a removeria da história.
 
Conclusão:

Bom, eu adorei esse anime. Posso dizer que já assisti um número interessante de animes, e Sounan Desu Ka me fez sentir um ar fresco que eu não esperava dele. Me deu algumas risadas ótimas, levantou meu humor quando eu estava aborrecido e me fez ficar ancioso pelas terças-feiras. Se você está lendo este review e ainda não assistiu, assista. Tenho certeza que você vai gostar.

Muito obrigado por ler este meu pequeno review."
107418,"haven't written a review in a long time. However, I felt the need to do so after watching this.

a big fan of P.A works, and have been amazed by some of the things that came out of their studio. However, for Fairy Gone.. I was appalled, as the show felt like a torment to watch past episode 1. Bland characters, bad cgi that they tried to cover up with rock music that eventually became annoying to the ears as well. The show tried to be deep with flashbacks, but in the end I didn't care about anyone in this show and had to drop it like a rock.

Story: it's simply all over the place. Trying to be complicated with flashbacks, location, events only made it messier. 

Art the main characters are at least nicely animated. With rich backgrounds as well, giving you the feel of post WW1 era europe. Although not enough to save this wreck from sinking to the bottom of the dirt pile. 

Characters some of the blandest characters I've ever encountered. They try to make use of flashbacks to try and flesh out character histories, but for some reason it just does not make me care about the characters at all.

Sound decent enough., but why do they have to insert annoying rock music into almost every fight? Trying to copy Digimon? Nice try though.

Cgi shows the lack of budget with the terrible cgi faeries. You can judge just by watching them in action even on the first episodes, they are just not that good.

Enjoyment almost zero enjoyment beyond the first episode. Perhaps the enjoyment might rise if I watched a few more episodes? But it really felt like a chore to watch, and had to drop. If you like to have monster beast fighting each other, then I recommend you try watching Katsute Kami Datta instead. Katsute is not perfect, and has boring moments of it's own, but it is still more watchable compared to Fairy Gone.

Had high expectations from the show, as I thought it might be another success story for P.A Works. Was sorely disappointed after just two whole episodes. 

I do recommend you try it, to see if this anime is good enough for you. This anime had mostly negative reviews on other sites. However, there are still a handful of people who liked it. So again, it won't hurt to try one or two episodes from this thing. Or you could just watch it all the way to end of the first cour, before giving a review.. some people like to finish a show first before giving a final overall opinion. Sadly, I just couldn't stay until episode 3 of the first season of this unfortunate show."
16009,"Please note: This is my first anime review, so it might be a bit sucky.
>“...On Friday, God looked over the world in minute detail. God rested on Saturday. And God, on Sunday… abandoned the world.”

This is one of the many shows I watched because the OP or ED sounded good. I did quite enjoy watching it, and even though I am around 10 years late to this review, I’d still like to give my take on it.

Synopsis
In a world where God abandoned the world, the people cannot reproduce nor can the dead properly die. The one miracle God left the world with were ""gravekeepers' who are tasked with maintaining a balance in the world and allowing the dead a peaceful and proper death. Ai, a 12 year old gravekeeper must bear that responsibility for her village. One fateful day, Ai meets a black cloaked man with a different outlook on life and death, but soon enough, he ends up making Ai's job much more burdensome.

Plot
The first time around, I didn’t know about the plot beforehand, but I can confidently say that the plot was quite intriguing and kept me watching. The second time around, I noticed quite a few plot holes, and the pacing could’ve been better. There are many questions left unanswered and some conclusions that could’ve been better explained. The way the show looks at, and reimagines death is quite intriguing and does spark some curiosity as to what the characters will do about it. In general, the plot could use some depth, but aside from that it's very compelling. (8/10)

Art
The art perfectly matches the plot of the story and the emotions of the characters. The animation was consistently beautiful and always matched the plot. The tawny colors gave way to many distinct emotions and helped make every moment, conversation, and highlight of the story drastically more meaningful. The shot composition and the realistic panning on their own would've been able to show and elevate the characters' feelings.  (9/10)

img220() 

Music
The OST is one that perfectly captures the story and makes it shine more. The music matches the show flawlessly and the scenes are never made worse by it. The choice of instruments and genre was ideal, and I don't think the music could've been done much better. (10/10)

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9Abkapnlk&abchannel=KenjiHamada)

Characters
I absolutely adore the character design and their personalities. The character design is quite close to perfect and each character has a familiar but yet unique design. Each character only has sufficient depth, and the characters' actions always end up aligning with their emotions but to a minimal degree. Each one is burdened by the abandonment of God in their own way, and that is shown well through dialogue and animation. I do think some characters could've had more depth. (8/10)

In conclusion...
This show was very compelling and I'm happy I watched it. Though there were slight issues pertaining to the plot and character depth, overall this show was great. I truly loved the moments and highlights of the show, but also the animation and color usage.

Would I recommend it? Probably to most people, it's completely their choice. This show has it's own pros and cons which some people may care a lot about, while others not at all. I do think this anime is great for fantasy enjoyers, but not so great for people who care a ton about plot and don't want there to be plot holes every now and then."
5356,"Canaan is intriguing by staff alone. It’s not obvious why I skipped over it initially. Maybe my fascination with P.A. Works didn't exist yet. Maybe Type-Moon and Mari Okada weren't the rock stars they are now. Or maybe the whole affair seemed so passé, even in its time.

Some things age like wine, but Canaan is Pepsi Blue. If you have nostalgia for laser blue consumer products, perhaps you also have nostalgia for the George W. Bush era of blockbuster terrorism, dubious US military operations in tandem with evil paramilitary forces, black hawk choppers circling bombed out desert villages, a shadowy vice president and his cabal pulling the strings, the pervasive browns of tactical shooter video games, and more time bombs than you can shake a stick at. Canaan offers all this and more.

That said, it's watchable. Takashi Takeuchi’s familiar character designs are rendered crisply in its acrobatic bullet-opera shootouts. And Kinoko Nasu & Mari Okada’s grim sensibilities align in a story about a warrior of fate burdened by her supernatural “synesthesia” vision (or one could call like it is: The Mystic Eyes of Death Perception), and the web of guilt and envy that surrounds her.

Unfortunately, it rarely transcends the mundane of its era. Okada’s now-familiar brand of over-the-top melodrama makes for some entertainingly grotesque moments, but its drama is shortchanged by a semi-supernatural global conspiracy story that reaches for Metal Gear Solid levels of convolution. The hows or whys are hard to keep track of, and lack Hideo Kojima’s eccentric knack for camp and absurdist levity.

Though Canaan is only P.A. Works’ second TV series, proceeding Okada’s True Tears, it feels older than it is. Perhaps by its 2009 release, it already missed the zeitgeist. The inauguration of Barack Obama was the culmination of post-9/11 fatigue reflected in popular media. ""24"" was already in its final seasons. The apocalyptic, terrorism-packed Battlestar Galactica just aired its tortured finale. Metal Gear Solid 4 wrapped up its canon a year earlier.

The market was not ripe for a terrorism-flavored action anime in the desert with cartoony analogs of Bush, Cheney and Blackwater. Oh, and Pepsi Blue ended its distribution in 2004. Perhaps it’s better to experience this anime with curious nostalgia than with the contemporaneous verisimilitude it never fully grasped.

! Some additional thoughts to pad out the review length due to the new 2100 character minimum; all I wanted to do was edit a typo! I have similar feelings about Code Geass; its [2019 throwback movie](https://anilist.co/anime/97880/Code-Geass-Fukkatsu-no-Lelouch/) really smacks one in the face with dated 9/11-isms. But original Code Geass debuted in 2006 — significantly earlier than Canaan — so it didn't have the same issue as Canaan did. !"
1726,"Warning this review may contain spoilers. 

First impressions, so devil may cry a anime adaptation of a video game about this guy who fights demons sounds cool enough.

Story, 5/10

So the story of devil may cry is about dante who is a demon hunter and is also a demon-human hybrid.

So if your a devil may cry fan you have probably wanted to know the question of what does dante do when he isn't saving the world or fucking some random chicks in a dumpster somewhere.

Well if your asked yourself this question then you will me happy to know that this anime gives you idea. He fights Random demons he then eats pizza and sundaes and we are reminded that he is drowning in debt and doing all these things while being a badass.

So from what you have just read so far you can pretty much guess that there really isn't really a plot to this and for the most part you would be right.
Devil may cry story is for the most part very episodic it mostly includes stand alone missions.
that dante dose for a living and some of what dante dose when he doesn't have work going on. Which is mostly him fucking around while eating high amounts of sundaes and pizzas.
Which I am not an expert of demon or half demon biology but surely eating all that pizza and sundaes would probably slightly bad for him .
unless in this world just demons really love pizza and sundaes.

But other than that there really isn't much I can comment on
this show doesn't really use all the ingredients that it could used and even if this show for all intents and purposes is a kick ass rule of cool show about some badass dude fighting demons. It doesn't use or play on many of the elements it's brings up.

Like one example there was an episode where we find a demon falling in love with this human women and though this episode we find out that not all demons are evil monsters that destroy and kill everything in there path and demons themselves have the ability to grow not just in power and also there personality and beliefs.
And what really bothers me is that they gloss over this idea in one episode,
Which leaves me with few questions like why is this demon so different from the rest of his kind or what lead him to becoming like this.
They never explain or expand on that idea and concept.
Which I think is a wasted opportunity.

Now I will mention that this show tried to have an overarching plot with the loli side kick that Dante has with him.
That dose lead to this plot In the end but it really doesn't matter in the long run of things. What happens is that the this demon that's trying to become some sort of super demon and needs the loli side kicks blood or something she has to complete it.

But it was boring and predictable and I don't care about in the lest.

Like here is how they could have made this show ten times more interesting and not feel like a soulless video game ad in anime form.

Still keep the episodic missions expect the episode count is 24 episodes and during these episodes we lean more about the lore and world of devil may cry.
Because the demon and super natural elements are quite interesting and it would cool to explore Dante childhood as being a half demon/orphan or talk about what other super natural shit that going down that doesn't involve demons.
It would be pretty cool to see Dante fight angels or some organization trying to capture or kill him because of his demonic nature.

Surely that would be batter Than what we actually got and if it had those what ifs the story and anime could stand up on its own and not just be a video game adaptation.


Character,6/10

The main character is pretty badass. I mean if you look up badass in the dictionary you would probably find this dude picture on it.
He is pretty cocky and very relaxed , says bad ass lines and dose the most badass things you can think of.

The side characters were also pretty cool as well.
Except one character because for some reason this show has a loli side kick for dante 
Who pissed me off some times.

The bad guys who are demons of the week.
Are pretty much your throw away characters that I don't give a fuck about.

Art, 6/10

The animation is pretty decent, it's very polished and shiny it is something you should watch in he if you can.

It also has this kind of dim color scheme that goes well with the kind setting that this show has.

It also has some pretty good fight animation as well.

The demon designs were pretty cool as well.
Dante also looks pretty cool as well.

Sound, 5/10

Not a big fan of the opening or ending song.
Because it just a background noise music which doesn't sound good to me.
The ost is pretty decent and it fits the tone of the show pretty well.
And I couldn't find out who did the ost.
But ost is ok.

The sub and dub is alight.

Plus Dante English voice actor sounds like he does in the games.

Enjoyment,6/10

I liked the fight scenes.
I also like the characters as well.
I also like some of the designs for the demons they were pretty cool.


Overall,6/10

So if you are Looking for a decent rule of cool show then you will probably like this anime but it seems like to be that you would have to be fan of devil may cry in order to like it more.
If you not a fan of the game you will mostly right this off as another sub par video game adaption."
112818,"Content warning: This review is SFW, and there are no screenshots, but if you're against most sexual talk/content, I would not recommend reading this review and especially not watching this show.

After I finished episode 2 of Super HxEros (the H is silent) I decided to check on Anilist what the reviews were and the only one I saw was in Portuguese. That's when I knew ""Oh I gotta review this one."" And so here I am.

There's a Roger Ebert review that I love of [Shaolin Soccer](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shaolin-soccer-2004). In that review, he explains that his rating system is relative. I won't go in-depth with his examples to keep this on topic, but it's a philosophy important to bring up when reviewing Super HxEros. If you are here reading these words, you're not interested in knowing how I think this compares to Mob Psycho 100 or Ranking of Kings. You're here to know how I think this compares to High School DxD or Domestic Girlfriend, or at least you should be. And in that regard, I believe that Super HxEros is better than both of those shows.

And to keep things clear before I continue, I am fully aware that Super HxEros is an ecchi series with massive amounts of nudity and perversion. It's the name of the game that I signed up for. If you watch episode 1 and hate it, you're not going to like the rest of the series so I suggest dropping it. If you don't like overly sexual anime, I do not recommend Super HxEros. But even if you have no sexual attraction to the female gender, I would still recommend checking this out, just for how absurdly fun it is.

So why did I watch Super HxEros? How did I decide ""Yeah, this is worth 5 hours of my life"". Well for starters, you don't forget a name like Super HxEros. But also, the English dub stars Brittany Lauda and Matt Shipman. Both are great voice actors in their own right, but if they're starring together in an ECCHI? That is a sign that there is zero shame to be had. That's why I pulled the trigger, but having now seen the series, the main characters could be played by any actor and I still would have liked it.

Super HxEros is about a superhero team of teenagers (which because it's a harem consists of one boy and four girls) that fight against bug monsters that have invaded to suck up our ""H-energy"". The Super HxEros use their own H-energy to fight said bug monsters. In other words, five teenagers are so horny that they use their horniness to fight monsters. All five of the teens, in their own different ways, try to restrain themselves regarding their perversions. Which is good, because it leads to many batshit moments and keeps the series from being a full-on hentai.

How's the animation? All things considering, pretty good. Yeah it has that ""early 2020s"" look to it, and if you're a stickler for high quality animation then I can't imagine this winning you over, but considering how LOW the bar is for ecchi comedies with extreme amounts of fanservice (that aren't borderline porn), I'd say Super HxEros looks good to me. The same can be said for the sound. Nothing noteworthy, the music isn't special (and that's fine, it's only a problem if it's distractingly bad and it isn't), though I have to admit that both the OP and the ED go much harder than they have any right to. I won't be listening to them outside of the show, but I can recognize a good bop when I hear it.

It's hard for me to explain this without spoiling scenes (which I don't want to do) or showing screenshots (which I'm not sure I can do), but the reason that I like Super HxEros so much is because it is insane. I think the reason for that insanity is thanks in part to the knowing exactly what it is and not trying to be anything that it isn't. It doesn't try to be serious in any way, it has lore but it doesn't expect you to care. I certainly didn't. The only thing Super HxEros is concerned with is being a goofy fun time. And really, is there anything wrong with that? Dumb, lowbrow entertainment should be appreciated for what it is than be shunned for what it's not. And this goes for all media, not just anime. It's a series about embracing perversions and how shutting them down can only make matters worse. And the way the series goes about exploring that is some of the most genuinely unhinged you'll see an anime go for a while.

Anime is a wonderful section of the animation medium, able to explore themes and ideas that most worldwide animation rarely thinks to dabble on, and it does so in mass quantities. Several of these stories are some of the best that the medium has to offer, and their stories are considered classics worldwide because of that.
Super HxEros is not one of those shows. It's a tits show. You are here for the tits. You are here to see beautiful women fight bug monsters and somewhere along the way remove their clothing, bonus points if the reason the clothing is removed makes sense (logicality not required). It meets its goal by being exactly as I just described. It succeeds at this for not going about it in an uncomfortable way, a trapping that many anime of this genre fall into.

If you want a great anime that pushes the medium forward, watch Sonny Boy. If you want a stupid, corny anime that just wants to have a fun time, watch Super HxEros."
141351,"Kakegurui has always been known for two things: Mentally deranged high schoolers' gambling and outstanding opening/ending credits. The half-baked prequel series, Kakegurui Twin, only has one of those things. 

Unfortunately, the opening is a generic instrumental song with awkwardly lifeless visuals. If you enjoyed Kakegurui's first two seasons for its ridiculous characters, disturbing facial expressions, and idiotic games, Twin might scratch that itch. Instead of following Yumeko and her generic male companion (I do not remember his name), this short spin-off series focuses on Mary Saotome's origin at Hyakkou academy. Upon enrolling, a naiive Mary allies with Tsuzura, a friendly girl with no gambling skills. Both immediately become in debt, conned, and forced into the role of ""House-pet"" (AKA Kakegurui's bondage-inspired penalty for broke students). The dynamic duo leads a refreshing hybrid sitcom, ""Gambling Apocalypse x 2 Broke Girls"" as they attempt to rise in the school's ranking. It's a lazy rehash of the first season's plot. 

img1000()

There's a handful of side characters—mostly girls only distinguishable by candy-colored hair and the number of times the camera zooms in on their breasts. The few male characters, one-dimensional perverts at best, are motivated by their desire to win against and/or date the girls. The guys bet for girls, like a more NTR version of Rent-a-Girlfriend, whereas the girls bet for cash. Each gamble is laced with the series' patented horniness—if that annoys you, don't even bother watching Twin because it's more like a fanservice OVA stretched thin rather than a standalone spin-off. Twin's most noticeable difference from the anime is its aesthetics. Over-saturated lighting and high-contrast color-grading make it feel like you're tripping on psychedelics. Those effects look fabulous in the colorful posters; in the anime, it's a cheap attempt at covering lackluster art and mediocre animation. MAPPA's entire production appears rushed, and with zero impressive animation cuts, it's clear the studio was on a time constraint.

Twin sucks as a spin-off to Kakegurui because the author wrote the original manga with zero thought for a prequel. You could easily watch Twin without seeing the first two seasons. The original story, themes, and characters are irrelevant. Six episodes pass, and almost nothing new is learned about Mary (partially because that'd risk messing up the continuity). The new characters are gone and forgotten by the end. At least it makes no pretense of complex characters, unlike the main anime. The ending teased a sequel (which I'll watch like the fool I am), so perhaps they'll explain how dozens of characters disappeared. Even the mysterious student council is barely referenced—wasting the opportunity to develop the enigmatic members. However, there's not much you could do to fix the original's flaws. Almost every problem in the first two seasons—lack of logic, no stakes, shallow characterization, etc.—applies to this one, so go read AndoCommando's reviews if you want an in-depth analysis.

img1000()

Kakegurui was ironically entertaining in its own schlocky way. Twin was just phoned in Netflix fodder. The over-the-top personalities, unhinged mannerisms, and over-exaggerated voice acting of the first two seasons are nowhere to be found. It's as if someone fed Kakegurui to Netflix's algorithm and removed all the trashy charm. Thank god this was only a mere 6 episodes. I don't think I would've survived anymore."

img880(

 What to make of Otherside Picnic? Named after a famous Russian novel to which it bears little resemblance, and drawing on a twenty year tradition of Japanese “net lore” for its inspiration, one might initially peg Otherside Picnic as a fairly heady, intellectual kind of horror story. But while it’s certainly creepy enough in its most unsettling moments to earn the genre tag, it’d be a mistake to box this one in as being solely for those with an SCP Foundation addiction.

img880()

A more proper indicator of where Otherside Picnic is coming from might actually be its opening theme. A rollicking, adventurous pop-rock tune with a romantic slant from accomplished anisongsters CHiCO with Honeyworks. Otherside isn’t not a horror series, but it’s important to consider what else it is; an adventure anime, and also a show with some pretty prolific lesbian subtext. It’s not at all dour, is what I’m getting at.

Instead, Otherside is a surprisingly breezy watch. It’s the story of Sorawo, a depressed college student who, through her vast knowledge of online urban legends, wanders through a gateway to another world; the titular otherside. When we meet her, she’s lying flat on her back in a puddle, pursued by a mind-invading monster known as a kunekune, and about to accept her imminent death. What, or rather who, saves her is a gun-toting Canadian-Japanese woman named Toriko, who she quite quickly develops a very obvious crush on.

img880()

Otherside Picnic follows the two, as they grow closer, make trips to and from the Otherside, and contend with the many strange creatures that live there. Sorawo often gives a brief rundown of what these things are, which is helpful if you, like me, only have a pretty limited knowledge of Japanese creepypastas. The “net legend” angle is a big part of the setting’s appeal, so if the idea of even something as out there as the bizarre and disturbingly violent “monkey train dream” getting a nod appeals to you, the series is a must-watch.

Really, I was surprised at how much I liked Otherside Picnic in general. Horror isn’t really my genre, but Sorawo is just the right kind of relatable reserved nerd. (Although I will admit, the one thing the series is missing from the light novels is her delightfully gay inner monologues about how attractive she finds Toriko.) Her character arc over the course of the series is fairly simple, as she starts out as said reserved nerd and by the final episode, having along the way developed what are essentially magic powers, and having been through so much with Toriko is, well, decidedly no longer that.

img880()

On a less literal level, the series also hums a simple theme of the importance of finding people who you just vibe with. In the finale, this is all but stated outright, as Sorawo and Toriko both recount how the other saved them. It gives Otherside Picnic a point, adding some substance to its afternoon anime binge-friendly nature.

Much of the rest of the fun of the series comes from setting details or technical aspects. The monster design is quite strong, and combined with the often surprisingly good animation, this carries the series’ weaker episodes. There’s also quite a few running sub-plots tucked in to the show’s single cour. These range from fairly serious (a lost group of US Marines who the pair eventually rescue), to clear set-up for seasons yet to come (Sorawo’s apparent and only briefly touched-on ability to not-quite mind control people, the late-game introduction of minor character Akari), to the just plain odd (there’s an episode about cats who are ninjas) or funny (the pair accidentally buy a multi-purpose miniature harvester on a drunken spending binge at one point).

img880()

It’s hard to imagine that Otherside Picnic will exactly change anyone’s life, but like last year’s Dorohedoro, it’s strong genre fare in a genre that is under-represented in mainstream TV anime. That it is perhaps only the second-best anime of the Spring 2021 season to revolve around a heterochromiac who travels to an otherworld that also has a lot of queer subtext speaks more to the strength of the competition than it does any problems with Otherside. This is a series I could see getting sequel seasons for years, frankly, as there is a lot of unadapted material and a lot of mysteries left unexplored. Perhaps if we’re lucky, that will be the anime’s eventual fate. Either way, there’s a lot to love about a brief trip to the Otherside.

114302,"Remember when isekai used to be about power fantasy fulfillment, with larger-than-life abilities, worlds, protagonists, and antagonists? Somewhere along the line, an eponymous “they” decided that such an approach to the genre was simply not going to work anymore. It seemed logical that after spending so much time in the fantastical, a new approach would involve settling down with the mundane, where scenarios were more focused on being able to do something simplistic, or solving a mini-crisis rather than one that would shake the foundation of reality with the cool swords and the cool booms.

Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life: Making a Drugstore in Another World is an anime I went into with a lot of apprehensions. If you were to ask me why I had even sat down to watch this anime in the first place, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I had doubts about whether the very premise would be decent enough to fill out a 12-episode season, but I suppose that one of the fun things about watching anime is that you sometimes just decide to take a chance on something for the hope of being pleasantly surprised. I could only hope that it wouldn’t end with me staring into the mirror and asking what I’m doing with my life.

Kirio Reiji, a former corporation worker from his world, finds himself making a living as a potion maker and pharmacist in another world. With the ability to brew various potions, cures, and other aids for ailments, he lives and works with Noella, a wolf girl he once rescued, and Mina, a ghost who lives in the house that the pharmacy now occupies. As days go by, people from the nearby town come into the pharmacy seeking Reiji’s help in fixing whatever it is that’s troubling them. Sometimes, it requires a potion’s touch, and other times, it doesn’t.

Because the show’s premise is so paper-thin, the series wisely avoids having a longer, overarching narrative from episode to episode. Instead, each outing focuses on tinier little stories that are connected rather loosely, or have small threads of continuity that carry over to other episodes. This allows the show to re-use some of the characters seen early on throughout the rest of the show, and even though the characters themselves are not terribly interesting, they afford at least enough material to last about eleven minutes at a time. Whether it be stories solely focusing on the main trio or introducing a new character altogether, each episode doesn’t feel oversaturated or bloated with content, making Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life incredibly easy to digest.

Where the characters falter in regard to depth or interest, the comedy does partially make up for this. Because most of the scenarios that bring customers to the pharmacy are so silly, the show can play up the absurdity of the situation to decent effect. Especially since Reiji is the fish out of water in this new world, his reactions to things unfolding the way they do make him serve as an audience avatar, albeit not the most effective one. His reactions are at least somewhat believable, especially as he finds himself getting roped into the various situations that require his assistance. Most of the other characters have one or two aspects to their personality that can be used as comedic fuel. Though most are either a little amusing or at least acceptable (if not overtly funny), there are some running gags or gimmicks that suffer from overuse, with Noella constantly doing her cute “woof” as the biggest offender. I could only hear it so many times before I got sick of it.

As can be expected of someone having a maximized power in an isekai story, Reiji’s potion-making is considered legendary among the townsfolk. Part of the comedic value therein comes from the people desperately wanting potions for things that real-world medicine would never have any cure for, such as healing familial problems or making it so that people don’t need to exercise to build muscle in a healthy manner. In cases like these, Reiji’s potions serve more as a kind of workaround for the problem rather than being a cure. This usually leads to two different kinds of payoffs, with the comedic ones landing with more grace than the sentimental ones. Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life works best when it stays in its silly lane, not trying to bite off more than its premise can accommodate.

Despite the skill that Reiji supposedly has for potion-making, we don’t see him ponder over potential ingredients or the actual potion-making itself for any significant time. In that sense, the show misses a few opportunities for further comedic value – potions exploding because the mixture was wrong, the potion accidentally doing the polar opposite of what it was supposed to do, and so forth. This is, in part, due to the show’s first episode already having Reiji established as an accomplished apothecary, so a lot of trial and error is not considered. The potion-making sequences themselves consist mostly of recycled animation of Reiji doing mixing and foot-tapping at his workstation. While basic and repetitive, it doesn’t get old thanks to the happy little music that accompanies the moment. It’s cheesy, yes, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t amused by its appearances.

And “cheesy” pretty much sums up the entire series. In many ways, Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life is not aspiring to any sort of heights, opting instead for simplistic entertainment and perhaps the bare-minimum of what a story requires in regards to most things. It’s so bright and happy with its visual aesthetic, character designs, soundtrack, and overall affect that it is not trying to hide anything underneath the surface. What you see is what you get. Does that mean that the show is bad because it is so shallow? I suppose…? But you know, sometimes I want something shallow. I’ve certainly seen a lot worse from shows that aimed low and didn’t entertain me, so I have to give it props for keeping me amused on my Wednesday afternoons.

Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life: Making a Drugstore in Another World is the equivalent of anime junk food – it fills you up just enough to tide you over, but doesn’t offer much beyond its sugary-sweet taste. The series being an anthology of short, loosely-connected stories may not mean much in the way of character development, it may not look or sound the best, and it may not be memorable, but it still offered some smiles to elevate it ever so slightly. It will never enter the pantheon of great isekai, and probably not even good isekai, but given what it is, it could have been significantly worse. I enjoyed it more than I expected I would. What more can I say?"
143866,"Unlike the title, this anime tells the top-tier story of an unskilled, bottom-tier main character, Tomozaki, who overcomes several challenges in his high school life. This, as the story's major background, is quite appealing to mankind, who like the school-themed genre. Of course, some events must occur to establish the setting. Tomozaki met Hinami and progressed through his ""life game,"" leading to a close relationship with his peers. In this occasion, Tomozaki was assigned the ""life game"" of dealing with social situations in class. As a result, he has developed and identified his role and capabilities within the group. 
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOn00whPquM)

The way social interactions were elaborated as a game was the cherry on top of making the show entertaining. It somehow prompted me to reminisce about the fun time watching Oregairu, which has some similarities. So, if you are a fan of the Volunteer Service Club, you might have a fun time watching Tomozaki-kun. It’s just like how Hikigaya in Oregairu who has a twisted view on life and hence isolates himself from others was developing by helping students in trouble and starting to make bonds in terms of friendship and romance ever since he was allocated to the Service Club. As for Tomozaki, the encounter with NoName or Hinami changed his dull life into a challenging game. The training for redefining his life in a classroom with Hinami is where it all started.

In s2, we are able to witness once more how developed Tomozaki has become and how he has influenced the people around him. Somehow, he's made it to a place where he must figure out the value of a relationship and his feelings for the two ladies he wants to be closer to. Certainly, Tomozaki is a total stranger in front of romance. We know that with the progression of the anime so far, it’s either Kikuchi or Nanami. Picking a girl out of two that both have a good feeling for you is something common in rom-coms, and it’s surely unbearable to see the loser after a decision has been made, especially considering that the loser is the one you favour or side with. Although it was heartbreaking for Mimimi, but Kikuchi finally be together with Tomozaki was just lovely. 

img(

As an anime-only audience, all these dramas of picking a girl out of two have been initiated and led by Hinami, while Tomozaki always obeyed the assignment given to him. Therefore, it will be interesting to know more about Hinami in the future or to see conflict between the mentor and mentee, which we saw at the end of season 1 as the story developed. Although there is an underlying scenario that the MC would end up together with Hinami, so far, the Hinami we have seen is merely a persistent yet sometimes cruel perfectionist, as if she is shielding herself. Nonetheless, what’s the truth behind her facade? As of now, the last episode seemed like a happy ending, which left me pondering about the later story and whether Hinami is the predestined girl for Tomozaki. If that’s the case, what about Kikuchi!? 

img()

Anyway, it's pointless to speculate on what will happen next; all I can hope for is a sequel announcement as soon as feasible. To be honest, the bullying incident at the start of the show was casual in the sense that it was more of a side quest for Tomozaki to assist Tama-chan, but the rest of the episodes were the major challenge. Overall, the ending may appear rushed and unsatisfactory, but not every anime adaptation or production team can meet the demand for a consistent series composition. In short, Jaku Chara Tomozaki kun might have been the best adaptation, with Project No. 9 providing consistent quality, and the overall watching experience has been rather satisfying, particularly the scenes in which Tomozaki appears seated in between Hinami's thigh gap, which are absolutely fantastic !"
21291,"""I spy you. You're under arrest for espionage."" An actual real line of dialogue from this show about spies.




This show is an adaptation of a series of novels by [Koji Yanagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KojiYanagi). It's a show about a spy agency in the 1930's. There's no ""main plot"", although there's occasionally a couple of episodes that are actually linked together. More or less it's episodic, an episode about a spy on a train here, an episode about a spy on a boat there. Choosing to go for a more episodic feel is fine depending on how you do it.

If it was just a bunch of interesting or entertaining spy missions, it would have been fine. But that's not really what it is. It really just feels like... ""Okay, let's do a show about spies. There will be spies and they will be doing spy things."" Invisible ink? That's a spy thing. Anti-amnesia training? That's a spy thing. Truth serum? Yeah man, throw it in. We gotta scrape the entirety of the bottom of the barrel. Actually, you know what? Let's be a little different, let's raise the stakes.

TRUTH SERUM WASN'T ENOUGH, THERE'S ALSO AN ANTI-TRUTH SERUM AS A COUNTER. BOOYEAH, THOSE AMERICAN SPIES JUST GOT OUT SPIED. Wait, no. This is all wrong. We need interesting characters and interesting writing, not more generic spy thi--

""Also, this is a real human being.""

Not pictured: two other spies, and the old spy who is of course the spymaster as he is the best spy because he is old.

Throughout most of the anime, these guys are only rarely ever shown together. Also, we get their names like once in the first episode and like right after it's made clear that their names are spy names and therefore fake. Basically, none of their names matter, because there's no possible way you're going to actually remember or be able to tell any of these spies apart.

There's... there's nothing there. They're all just spies and that's basically it. There were only two characters that I actually even still remember. 

First was the guy from the first two episodes who I initially believed was going to be the main character (he would become a spy and that would be the show) that in fact wasn't an actual spy but instead a military guy who had a tendency of saying how much he wanted to kill himself because that was more honorable than being a spy. But after the second episode, it goes mostly completely episodic and the guy I believed was going to be a main character shows up I think... once or twice after that.

img440()

Japanese man almost goaded into commiting seppeku by American spy (anime 2016 spy pranks).

Second of course, is the old spymaster character, Yuuki. He's only memorable because he shows up in most of the episodes because he's... well, the spymaster. Also, there's a whole episode dedicated to showing what you're supposed to believe is Yuuki's past, only for them to immediately go ""Well no, that was this other guy. Maybe some details of all of that also fits Yuuki's actual past though."" Wow, thanks. At least you tried to have ONE character.

I couldn't honestly look at that picture up there and say. ""Well, the guy who's in the brown suit was the spy who was the one who was in the train episode. The guy in the black suit was the one in the boat episode, and so forth."" I honestly have no idea which one was which.




The only point where this show even manages to be anywhere near okay was towards the end when it was about Yuuki's past and the rivalry between ""D Agency"" (Yuuki's spy agency) and the spy agency that actually kills people. Oh yeah, by the way, ""D Agency"" never kills people. Pacifist spies sure are interesting and neat. Don't get me wrong, they didn't have to be like assassins... but have you ever heard of a little term called loose ends?

Yet, everyone is utterly incapable of identifying or besting a single one of these pacifist spies.

There is an episode where one of the spies goes to infiltrate a rebel group of literally like three people and one of those people is a German mole. The nonsensery of that aside, the episode literally starts with a firing squad about to open fire on an old woman tied to the tree SOLELY because she was being annoying. The spy character for that episode saves the old woman, has his head bonked which gives him amnesia, but he still remembers how to be a spy because of specialized spy training in case of amnesia, then has his head bonked again and that cures him of amnesia. You can't make this up.

 

""Stack up enough head injuries and I'm sure it'll work out in the end. Or you'll die.""

There was another episode where a house is bombed, and the guy who ordered it in the first place has someone investigate it. His own crime that he himself committed. ""You better not kill me, fellow. You know the thing where I make a bluff about some letter that I can't prove actually exists? If you kill me, that'll get sent to the authorities with due haste! Also, I hope this chap with this gun to my back doesn't end up shooting you instead for you are the bad guy of this situation! Oh ho! He did exactly what I predicted! Called it, you foolish buffoon!""

Also, there's a dead child in the mix with the explosion because dead children = tragedy. Also, the dead child dressed like a girl and was a waitress/sex worker (???), and the guy who killed the bad guy did so because he loved him/her. That's... what even was that episode about again???

img440()

There's nothing much to say about the boat episode (the guy would have survived if he had just ignored the crossword puzzle) or the train episode (spy dude kept a pigeon in his shirt for an entire seven hour train ride). The episode with the truth serum as well as the anti-truth serum was probably the closest to doing spies. Spy guy is captured by American spies and being interrogated and has to escape from this building all spylike. Oh yeah, this show's about spies!

!Also, this is just a general thing but don't end your show on a line from the first episode. [Please.](http://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace) ""Oh hey, that was from the first episode. They didn't have anything else better to end on?""!




Did you know that this show was about spies? Completely uninteresting spies lacking any sort of personality or depth doing spy things, but spies nonetheless! Invisible ink! Truth serum! These are spy things! 

Most episodes are either generic or boring, others are downright baffling (the amnesia episode, the a building got bombed episode), but the episodes that are more about Yuuki (the old one) are almost pretty okay in comparison.  

But to be honest, did there really need to be 8-10 different spy characters anyways? There could have just been a couple and maybe they could have actually given them personalities but instead, every episode has to be a new (yet completely interchangeable with the others) spy. To be fair though, this is an adaptation of a novel series and blah blah blah.

A score of 3 out of 10. Not the worst thing I've watched, but wouldn't recommend actually watching it. It's more towards the boring end of the spectrum. Although, I had a laugh in keeping track of all of the spy clichés as I watched it.

BONUS: I give the [Joker Game specials](http://anilist.co/anime/21790/JOKERGAMEKuronekoYorunoBouken) about a cat that foils a bunch of guys' attempt to bring down the ""D Agency""  a 4 out of 10. Because even though it was very brief, it had all of the different spy guys actually together and interacting with each other. It actually almost fooled me into thinking ""Oh yeah, these guys are actual characters."" Also, I'm fine with the thought that without this stray cat, this spy agency would have literally been taken down, being my final thought on this series."
135778,"Warning, there might be some light spoilers.

Homura Kawamoto striked again! This time, his love for suits and cards gets a fresh new twist: a deck of 52 cards that give special powers to gifted people. And no, this time there are no psycho girls that enjoy gambling, it's less weird.
First, let's talk about the world building: i really enjoyed the London vibes that the city gives, from old cars to tailored suits, which were clearly inspired by The Kingsmen franchise. This first season takes its time to develop as much as it can, some episodes are slower, with lot of narration and explanations about the cards, the powers and their history, sometimes there's little to no battle and some action scenes are even skipped, which is kinda weird in a spy/ action anime. 

Now let's talk about the characters. I believe there are too many of them, like i was hoping they were being shown for just episode, like Chelsea or the bitchy policewoman, which i hope gets some sort of development in the future, otherwise she could be literally just a comedy relief, which doesn't belong to such a story. As far as the Pinochle team, all of them works beside the green guy, but we can wait for his redemption arc since a lot of time is spent for all the others. Chris, Finn, Leo and Wendy are well written: they are all complex characters, and their weaknesses are something that make them relatable and enjoyable. Finn, even though is considered the weakest because of his card is always trying his best, and he's also the one that will most likely have a huge power spike in the next episodes. Chris is the romantic killer, hiding his worries behind a smile, Leo is the leader but seem to not agree with the boss, and Wendy is the OP character that has yet to find a balance. 
As far as the bad guys, we only had a few chances to see them, this first part focuses on the gathering of the cards, but at least the final episodes have some decent battles, also showing some high-level cards (which also seem to be pretty unbalanced, like the woman that had a J could just pull things to her?? What kind of power is that? The gravity goth lady could literraly move everything everywhere). 

img220()

High Card has some potential, it reminded me of Bongou Stray Dogs: the first season was a bit slow, with lots of characters, and the protagonist is sometimes a side character. This time i didn't particularly enjoy the change of tones, that went darker for a few episodes, but at least the comedy is kept for some situations and not spat everywhere. You could say it's in between. I hope good things are coming, this was pretty much my favourite new Anime this winter, it's worth a shot. Best thing? The ending. It's the definition of ""vibe"", with all the characters singing together while driving."
21038,"Taking old anime and rebooting them for current anime viewers has not been done before. Many reasons are that the visual quality of the old anime shows, for the most part, has not aged well, especially trying to view a stream of one that is of low quality and bad subtitles. One prominent example is Space Battleship Yamato 2199 in 2013, regarded by many as a suitable remake of the classic space opera from 1974. Here we have Ushio to Tora, a reboot of a 1992 10-episode OVA based on a six year-long manga in 1990. I was not aware of their existence, but this reboot has piqued my interest in the series.

Right when I watched the first episode, one thing that came to mind was the unique art direction of the characters. It was not something that I often saw in the past few years. Not that it looks completely different from your current art style, it is a mishmash of elements from new types of Japanese animation and old ones as old as the 90s. The faces look rough around the edges to emulate the older aesthetics of character designs and the fluidity of a good enough animation budget that was not present in most cases in that era. It is a welcoming addition to the year 2015, where the art direction in most of the shows that year was nothing unique.



How the show is presented in terms of story is a little hit or miss in many cases. At first, it becomes your classic fight a monster in each episode of anime until it gets into a big climactic arc near the middle and 2nd half. The first arcs are fine to let us get to know our two protagonists, Ushio and Tora. We see how their relationship starts and see it gradually grow and give some good individual stories, the one involving Omamori-sama being the highlight of the bunch. I enjoyed the first big arc involving the girls helping out Ushio from his torments because it gave the supporting cast some humanity to them than just the one character that Ushio saves in that particular episode.

However, the plot lost me afterward with the addition of the time travel plot involving a princess of the ancient times in how they present it in a rushed manner. Had they made it longer to develop them further for me to garner sympathy for the princess character and feel the anguish of one character without spoiling anything, I think it could have been great. It just starts to get stale after a while. The last couple of episodes especially feels out of place in how short-lived and underwhelming it felt with bland villains with cliched intentions. It isn’t something that I would call terrible by any measure, but I feel like, had they slowed the pace a little in the 2nd half, it could have worked better in the long run.



As much as the plot does not live up near the end, Ushio no Tora makes up for this with a great cast of characters. I found Ushio and Tora likable in their charm and chemistry as two opposite personalities working together at odds with their intentions; Ushio’s to save the people he loves from evil and Tora to one day eat him when he doesn’t notice. There are points where it might seem a bit silly, but Ushio no Tora is, by and large, a silly show in some cases. Mostly due to the character of Tora, who often has hilarious animation quirks that morphs him from this terrifying-looking monster to a chibi-looking caricature with big cartoony eyes. Many might find this a bit conflicting, but for the most part, the show does balance out the comedy and serious moments well enough that it doesn’t feel distracting. Again, seeing both of these lovely characters bicker at each other is always a comedic splendor and makes them the best duo of the year.

The supporting cast has its fair share of great characters, and at worst, they are average. As I’ve mentioned before, the female characters have some characterization as far as supporting casts go and do things to further Ushio's character progression than be catalysts for one plot arc and nothing else. The villains, however, are nothing special and forgettable as a result. Either their intentions are predictable or don’t come across as intimidating. Not counting the monsters that Ushio and Tora fight, just the villains harm the protagonists. Especially those in the last arc where they felt like they were ripped straight off of another anime involving bad scientists. Nothing straight-up awful, but nothing that will be looked at with admiration.



A good sleeper hit is what I would describe Ushio no Tora. Though it does not gravitate any higher than your typical shounen anime involving supernatural elements, it didn’t need to. It fits all of the aspects that make shounen anime a good treat to see while you leave it in the background every once in a while after watching it. It aims to please the eyes and ears, and that is how most shounen anime succeed in being good but not great. Life isn’t perfect, as they say.

Grade: B"
44,"Arguably the most well-known element of Japanese culture and history is the samurai. Wielding a katana while maintaining allegiance to the honor code of bushido, they are known for their honor skill and skill at fighting. As such, many manga and anime have references to these swordsmen, whether it be for comedic purposes or to serve as a piece of historical fiction. With how many of these samurai stories are out there, what makes one stand out from the rest? What are the elements to make a successful samurai story? Trust and Betrayal answer those questions with ease, making for an enjoyable OVA series that aims to tell a story of romance and violence in under 2 hours.

The year is 1864 and rebellion has bubbled against the military government of the Tokugawa shogunate. In the midst of this action is the protagonist Shinta, renamed as Kenshin Himura, who is an excellent assassin who’s wish is to protect the innocent. Despite his brutality against his targets, Kenshin is a soft-spoken man whose cold exterior hides a rather caring individual. The OVA oversees his development by having him interact with characters that serve as guiding forces. Seijuurou Hiko and Kogoro Katsura are leaders to Kenshin, recognizing his strength as a swordsman through training or missions but worry about his ferocity. Tomoe Yukishiro serves to balance out this very nature, as her role is eloquently described as being the “sheath to his sword”. Other characters introduced in the series serve as a way of providing more strength to Tomoe and Kenshin. These minor characters are successful as their behaviors and reasons are believable, tying in directly with the central plot without interfering with the story’s focus. All of this encapsulates a drama that flourishes, a story that tells of the prices paid for good ideals.

The story itself, despite the ominous title, is rather standard. Tales such as this have been told in older manga such as Lone Wolf and Cub. Though the “trust and betrayal” is the key element in the tale, it is not as explicit as one may believe. This is because the series is more inclined to show rather than tell. Dialogue blocks are still present, but they play a subservient role to the atmosphere the show develops. It is this silence that often speaks more than the characters themselves. Yet despite this atmosphere, the show never feels swallowed by lethargy. The pacing of the show is perfectly matched to all the key scenes, making the action build the viewer’s adrenaline and allowing the sensual portions to burn slowly yet gracefully. The OVA plays out like a string arrangement, adjusting tempo to draw out the emotions of the piece.

Speaking of music, the score for the OVA is superb. Though it is sparse, they are all wonderful instrumentals that serve the animation well. Perhaps the moodiest of these is “Quiet Life” by Taku Iwasaki, a beautiful string piece that only adds to the wistful feeling of the series. The seiyuus (save for one I’ll mention later) all adhere to the emotional qualities of the show very well. Sound director Shouji Hata should be very proud of his work on this OVA. The studio behind it is Studio DEEN, one that has a bit of infamy behind their production quality. Despite this, the OVA’s animation is well done. I adore the look of cel animation and it’s done very well here. The desaturated colors and painted backgrounds are wonderful and add to the serious tone of the show. Though the animation is well done, the overall visual appeal stems from the various editing tricks that DEEN have done. Rotoscoped imagery and filtered images are present at times in the show. This allows DEEN to avoid having to animate these scenes while avoiding a stylistic clash. Sometimes DEEN’s editing tricks don’t always work, like when a strobe effect is used to emulate quick action, but for the most part they are successful.

There are a few minor problems I have with the show. As focused on pacing and presentation as the show is, I can’t help but feel some cuts were a bit erratic in the first half of the show. Scenes could often be interrupted by other moments that were occurring or by flashbacks without much lead in. It is to be expected, as the series wishes to promote a more subtle narrative while keeping good pacing. Still, it can lead to some confusion early on when organizing characters and events within time. The second problem I have is another contradictory issue – the voice acting of Kenshin. Kenshin’s design and character (at least, in this OVA) is designed to be soft-spoken and rather cold. As a result, the seiyuu Mayo Suzukaze plays this role to a tee. However, these limits to Kenshin’s range hinders the character during more critical moments, taking myself away from proper immersion into how the character feels. Again, this is more minor, as for the most part the acting is fine. The visual qualities of the character more than make up for this, so Kenshin’s current state of mind is expressed even if the voice doesn’t seem to match.

Overall, I give this show a 7/10. I must admit that I was more indifferent starting out, but over time the series’ qualities began to enthrall me. If you’re a fan of samurai stories or historical shows in general, I recommend this title. I also recommend this show if you are looking for something a bit more atmospheric. This is a series that had a lot of love put into it, wanting to show the artistic integrity of the Rurouni Kenshin to its fullest. I can definitively say DEEN succeeded with their mission.

-Erza Scarlet

The animation in this film was (chef's kiss). I can tell that the animators did great in executing the film. Of course, kudos to our creator who managed to think about the story and the plot. In the beginning I thought I pressed the wrong movie but actually it was like a prequel or a sneak peek kind of thing to their mission. Little Wendy was so cute when she thought she barged into something important that Lucy and Natsu were talking about. Personally, I THOUGHT my ship was going to sail. Turns out it was a false alarm.. (┬┬﹏┬┬)

  !That scene at the bar made me a little nervous?. I was anxious when Lucy was doing her part in their mission. ..good thing they were able to steal that thing without being caught that they duplicated it.! I was really happy to see how Lucy improved and saw the star dress that Capricorn has!! She looked badass especially with those shades on when she was saving those women who were captured. Oh Wendy and Charles too!!! That Dragon Force thoooo and the transformation of Charles. The team work of Gray and Juvia was awesome to watch, as always. And oh my god, Erza!! That's the first time I saw her armor and it was immaculate✨ I did expect to see some action from Gajeel and Levy but I guess they were just like a cameo of some sorts. As expected, there were fight scenes that occurred in the movie. They were like the big 3/ knights/ fighters or something of the island. 

 Overall, it was a great film!! I enjoyed while watching. In fact, I wanted to watch more of it. I want to see what happens next for Team Natsu and how will they be able to grow and become stronger than ever. ! At the end, I was worried because I thought Natsu died.. :'( good thing he didn't tho!! !I really did not expect that to happen.. with the dragon.. and when Natsu transformed a little like a dragon. I was amazed as heck! Anyways, don't want to give away too many spoilers hehe! But I'm a little confused in the timeline, is it aligned with the series? Soooooo did it happen before the final season, when the guild came back from being disbanded??? !Because Zeref  and Acnologia were present in the film by the end that's why its hard to imagine that it happened after their war with the Alvarez Empire because of the events that occurred during the final season. !

6802,"Since it seems impossible to address So Ra No Wo To without mentioning this, let me begin by talking about the elephant in the room: no, this anime is not just K-On! but in the military. Yes, it has central cast of five cute girls; yes, it has virtually the same artstyle; and, yes, it has music and slice of life elements. But beyond this superficial level, the shows are entirely different. I love K-On! to death, but if you come into this show expecting cute, low-stakes misadventures and happy tales of adolescence, you will be in for a surprise.

Okay, glad we got that one cleared up.

Enough about what So Ra No Wo To isn't. Let's talk about what it is. As the plot synopsis suggests, this anime follows Kanata Sorami, an rather naïve 15-year-old bugler who joins a group of four military officers (read: cute girls) at an outskirts outpost in a war torn country. Throughout the series we see these five living out their lives as best they can in this comfortless world, and we slowly begin to understand the nature of the conflict that has occurred, and in some ways, continues to occur around them.

From the way I have described it, this anime probably sounds like a very bleak and serious affair, but this is a bit deceptive. Sure, it may take place in a barren, hopeless setting, but if there is one feeling that underlies all of So Ra No Wo To, it is not hopelessness but optimism. Kanata, our main character, is filled with an unrelenting (and perhaps even immature) optimism, and spends much of the  series spreading this optimism to the other four girls. In this sense, despite its dark premise, So Ra No Wo To is not an especially heavy show. There are certainly somber moments, but thanks to the spark that Kanata brings to it, there is a substantial serving of comedy and general lightheartedness to offset the potential solemnity. 

In terms of actual episode-to-episode content, So Ra No Wo To is a slice of life anime through and through. Principally, it alternates between more serious, character drama-focused episodes and lighter, comedy-focused episodes. Uncharitable viewers might be inclined to refer to some of the lighter episodes of this series as ""moe shit,"" and while I object to the idea that any moe is shit, I would advise you to be wary if you tend to dislike moe slice of life anime. None of it ever reaches the cutesy heights of, say, K-On!, but it is certainly quite, um... fluffy... at times. If you're like me though, and you enjoy a good show about doing cute girls doing cute things, then you will enjoy these lighter episodes as much as you enjoy the more serious ones. Certainly, So Ra No Wo To is as much an anime about sadness as it is about hope, so I don't think it would be complete without its lighter episodes (or its darker ones, for that matter).

While we're on the topic of its moe elements, let's discuss this show's aesthetic. As mentioned earlier, its artstyle bears a striking resemblance to that of K-On!. The animation never quite reaches the peaks of that show, but it does do an excellent job of rendering both the cute moments and the more dramatic events that make up this anime without either side feeling awkward or out of place. In terms of sound design, So Ra No Wo To also does quite well; both voice acting and background music are on-point. More interestingly, the opening and ending songs reflect the serious vs. lighthearted dichotomy of the show itself, with the opening being a weighty, traditional sounding piece while the ending is of a more upbeat, cutesy sort (as you might expect of a cute girls doing cute things anime). 

Now, this has been a very positive review thus far, but unfortunately I do have some minor criticisms to make of So Ra No Wo To as well. As much as I like Kanata's bundle-of-joy personality, she, along with many of the show's other major characters, suffers from being rather archetypal. All the characters do develop over the course of the series but not, I think, far enough to sufficiently differentiate them from the well-established anime cliches that they are clearly based on. This is not a particularly damning issue during the cute girls doing cute things segments, but when the show turns to drama, it is certainly limited from achieving its full aspirations. The weakness of its characters does not ruin the show by any means, but it does prevent it from becoming something truly great.

As it stands, So Ra No Wo To is a good and much underrated slice of life anime whose issues are few and far between in comparison to its many successes. Combining cute girls doing cute things with war drama is a bizarre and ambitious choice if there ever was one, but this anime does a remarkably good job of making it work. 

Anyone looking for a slice of life show with a little more thematic depth than the norm would do well to check this one out!"
187,"Riding off of the second season of Initial D, I was disappointed. By the stiff animation, the pacing, and by how impersonal it felt. I had zero expectations for this movie, and it surpassed even my highest standards for cinema to date. 

img()

Third Stage opens with a compilation of shots focusing on the Toyota AE86 we have come to know and love, and in the background, a funky song by M.O.V.E., the Japanese eurobeat group which composed the openings of all the seasons so far. And there are no soundtracks like Initial D. My predisposed bias towards it hits like a resounding gong, but the tracks here really drive home, and will have your armpits dripping sweat at every race’s conclusion. ‘Fly Me To The Moon & Back’ being the crowning track of Third Stage with the foreboding yet victorious grit the track pounds out, even just through a short snippet of screen time. After our introductory tune comes to its natural conclusion, you can feel your adrenaline rush subside for a moment as it cuts to our protagonist’s school in Akina. But, something’s different. Everything is different. 

img()

Initial D now moves like the greatest of animated films. The slow panning shots are now few and far between, not the here-and-there bits of character acting we had in the First Stage. Third Stage doesn’t stop, and the production doesn’t hold back from letting you notice this. The hand-painted backgrounds paired with the cutting character designs of Shigeno bars you in a cell, forcing you into the environment of this small valley town, whether you like it or not. Most of, if not all of these shots, look more beautiful than the manga, which is a key factor in making this not only a successful adaptation, but a masterful one. Your eyes move back and forth, from the blood-pumping CGI action sequences to the quiet outlook of the sunset. And the CGI isn’t intrusive in the slightest, either. It manages to be the only creation to hit that sweet spot, where the digital marries the handcrafted. They blend enough to become one entity, allowing you to realise the two worlds of racing and the real are completely separate, yet intertwined. 

img()

Some of these shots just take your breath away, and I’m utterly surprised this is Mitsusawa’s only credited work. And it’s hard to call this a one-hit wonder when the world feels this lived in. Comparatively to the rest of the series, as well, Third Stage’s atmosphere just feels...colder. This may have just been the autumn wind blowing in through my open window, but I really felt the pressure around Takumi, the weight of the racing world placed squarely on his shoulders. You can practically taste the dense morning clouds of Akagi as Takumi groggily makes the first tofu run. It burns the tension in tread marks, and stops, freezes your heart when it wants to. It allows you to breath in the sunlight, and cough on the octane-dense air of the gas station. 

img()

Through this extra bit of movement, all of the character’s personalities come alive. From Iketani’s eyebrow raises to Itsuki’s overly energetic pouts, there are extra pieces that didn’t need to be there, but raise the quality of this film so high, none can compete. Not even mentioning the voice work! The English voices are crisp and suit each of the characters scarily well. Joel McDonald’s voice noticeably deepened just enough so you can feel the growing age of the Takumi Fujiwara, while the older voices remain consistent, Chuck Huber being an always remarkable example of this. The dialogue runs into each other, but in a realistic way, like how conversations between three friends would go. Someone’s bound to be interrupted. 

img()

Oh, the characters themselves? In terms of actual movie standards, this is the greatest two-in-one combo you’ll ever pay for. It’s our protagonist’s story, Takumi’s, obviously, but it also gets tangled with Natsuki’s. Both are grappling with not only their feelings for each other, but the fear of what to do next upon school’s conclusion, and how each approaches that lingering heartbreak. They run parallel to each other, so, when these lines never cross, no matter how foreshadowed, it still pierces like a weighted arrow. The side characters, especially in the Takahashi brothers, show progression since the First Stage, previously as enemies, but now appearing as allies. Yet they still somehow ride the line of animosity all rivals seem to clench, which makes their sparing appearances ever-so-memorable. In antagonists, The Emperors felt so distant and detached in Second Stage, but placed themselves into the spotlight for Third Stage to exude some honestly intimidating pressure I didn’t feel in Second Stage at all. You feel the crushing weight of Takumi’s previous loss more than in the actual previous season, and the rematch feels that much more important, despite not relying on the past too much, even as a little bit of a crutch. The new opponent for this stage, Kai Kogashiwa, brings some past history which ups the personal ante I, again, never felt in the Second Stage. It adds that force that made First Stage so good, Kai and Takumi foiling each other so tight they felt like removed brothers.

Third Stage sets its world in stone, and you’re along for the rollercoaster of a lifetime.

98389,"If there's one thing you need to know about Killing Bites, it's that it's Gratuitous with a capital G. Mindless gore and unbridled fanservice wait their turn to bombard your senses, and sometimes both of them end up skipping the queue and inundating your screen with whatever it takes to get your head and heart popping. This show takes all the excitement from professional wrestling or other forms of superficial entertainment and turns it up a notch, using the cut-throat, winner-takes-all, dog-eat-dog premise as a foundation (read ""excuse"") upon which to ensure as much blood splatters on the floor as possible.

Those looking for something even remotely thoughtful or sophisticated need not apply - Killing Bites is stress relief in its purest, most unabashed form. There's a lot to cringe at, for sure, but sometimes in order to find happiness, you have to dig deep into the dirt. If you're looking for a show that knows no shame, this might just be the one for you.

(Ratings for each aspect of the anime are given in brackets.)

Premise (3/5): Four massive family-run conglomerates (also known as ""zaibatsus"") have devised a plan to decide which of their companies should retain control of Japan's economy: develop and train warriors, then pit them against each other in a gladiatorial ring to see who wins. As technology develops, so too do the warriors (now called ""Brutes"") as they are genetically modified into anthropomorphic avatars of various animals, possessing tremendous strength and peerless ability - especially when they transform into their more animalistic selves.

The premise of this series, which sounds like a conspiracy theory from the get-go, turns the fight for economic control into something of a gorefest. It's the sort of behavior you'd expect from the shady crony capitalists running the world, and the absolute moral bankruptcy of the zaibatsus and their chairmen lays the groundwork for the bloodshed to come. It's a simple setting, but one that allows for a great deal of narrative freedom... not that this show ever really exercises that liberty.

The main character, a hapless university student who is abruptly and unfortunately thrust into the underworld's brightest spotlight, is dragged from trouble to trouble by forces that are far beyond his control. Though he occasionally summons the will to fend for himself whenever he is able, he can do nothing against the great physical might of the Brutes or the great political and economic influence of the zaibatsus. It's refreshing to see a main character that's not strong or powerful in any way, and his helplessness only adds to the overall novelty of the story.


The beginning of an adventure beyond any nightmare.

Characters (3/5): The protagonist Nomoto is a 20-something college kid who gets into something way, way over his head. It's tempting to call him an idiot and despise him whenever he gets cold feet and delegates his decision-making to other people, but putting myself into his shoes, I can sort of sympathize. I'd like to think that I'd do a lot better, but that's really just the privilege of the observer speaking - the truth is that if you've never been anyone special, and a great mantle of responsibility is suddenly thrust upon your shoulders, it might just end up crushing you under its weight. It was satisfying to watch him take the initiative somewhat in the end, which elevated him a little above the rest of the cast in developmental terms.

The Brutes are mostly static archetypes of the animals that they embody, particularly in the heat of battle - for example, the Cobra is a slithering, sinister, salacious horndog, whilst the Tiger is a steely, hot-headed, stubborn former delinquent. Many of their pasts are explored in various flashbacks, which I do appreciate, as it's interesting to see how the relationships between certain characters have blossomed from potentially stormier pasts, particularly if they were still human when they first encountered each other. As expected, the female main character, Hitomi, gets the lengthiest elaboration on her personal backstory, and it was strangely heartwarming to see how she went from essentially an untouchable feral animal to the stuck-up, haughty, but nonetheless human form she now took on.

As mentioned previously, most of the people working for the zaibatsus are bereft of anything approaching compassion or empathy. Yoko Mitsukado, the granddaughter of the Mitsukado zaibatsu's chairman, is made out to be a particularly arrogant and officious eyesore, which probably explains the satisfying (?) fate that she ultimately meets at the hands of her former Brute charge. As for the chairmen themselves, they engage in their own game of deceit and counter-deceit during the ""Destroyal"", and in the end those that win out simply continue the endless cycle of power- and money-grabbing, hence extending their caricatures as the greedy, soulless bastards that we want them to be.

The cast as a whole is standard fare, but the characters play their parts pretty well in the grand drama that unfolds. Any additional tidbits about their pasts are pleasant surprises, though some could've definitely used a little more meat.


A likeable list of superhumans.

Audiovisuals (5/5): Killing Bites is all about the spectacle, and the spectacle is undeniably top-tier. The battle sequences cut no corners whatsoever - save for the occasional clunky-looking CGI here and there - with every slash, every wound, every bite captured in graphic and sensuous detail. The fights are well-choreographed and dynamic, reflecting the disparate strengths and habits of each animal - as well as their various weaknesses, which are frequently exploited to the fullest extent possible. The fanservice is relatively restrained compared to the gore, but that's not to say that it's minimal at all, which will please those who've come to see busty babes doing what they do best, especially as the camera keeps zooming into their... ""important"" parts. There can be no complaints whatsoever about the animation, seeing as most of the show's budget seems to have gone there.

The character designs also deserve a mention, as it's difficult to turn everyone into animal avatars without using the same ""configuration"" with every single character (e.g. animal upper body, human lower body). Some characters only switch parts of their bodies; others have essentially full-on transformations. There's a good variety going around, though it's a little obvious what the animators are going for when the females mostly maintain their human torsos and backsides.

The soundtrack for the series is blessed by the hand of Yasuharu Takanashi, who's composed the music for many famous anime series, and the mostly rock-oriented repertoire is perfect for the endless stream of battles and skirmishes. The OP is by fripSide, so it's guaranteed to be a hell of a good listen, and the ED is also similarly exhilarating. The no-holds-barred sound effects, from the shotgun punches to the bone-crunching tackles, are appropriately and impactfully applied throughout. The result is a feast for the eyes and the ears par excellence.


Gore galore.

Execution (4/5): With a show about bestial humans (or humanoid beasts) beating the shit out of each other, the last thing you want to do is overcomplicate the plot or throw in unnecessary wrenches to slow the action down. The explanatory flashbacks can feel a little out of place at times, especially if they happen right before someone's jugular is about to get slit open, but most of them are concise enough that you get a good sense of what's going on before the wholesale bloodshed returns.

Each Brute's ability is introduced with a dramatic pause followed by the name of the skill thundering onto the screen (somewhat reminiscent of Keijo, if you've seen that anime), which immediately tells you that nothing about this show should be taken seriously. Moreover, the animals' unique attributes are expounded in extravagant fashion by the narrator, who sounds more and more like a wrestling commentator with every new interjection. The ridiculousness of what you're watching is only compounded by the wacky episode names and the surreal post-credits extras, but if you don't already know what you're in for by the end of the first episode, then you probably wouldn't enjoy the rest of the series anyway.

Killing Bites is the sort of fun that borders on the hopelessly inane. It's something of a prerequisite that you switch your brain off completely before you dive in, though a few of the twists and turns that go on behind the scenes are actually quite intriguing in their own right, particularly with the double-crossing and triple-crossing occurring at the zaibatsus' highest echelons. But that middling level of complexity is just about right for a show where you only have to remember one thing: that those with the sharpest fangs win. If you get hurt, hurt them back. If you get killed... walk it off.

""That's Killing Bites,"" as Hitomi often likes to say.


A sight for sore eyes, which is all it has to be."
97716,"No idea why I decided to write a review about some anime I watched a long time ago when I have a paper due in a bit but I'm bored out of my mind and this show has no reviews yet!

Getsuyoubi no Tawawa (Tawawa on Monday) but I'm just calling it Tawawa is a product of the weekly illustrations that this guy Kiseki Himura posts on Twitter (@Strangestone) every single week and somehow it became popular enough to be compiled into a doujinshi, turned into a manga, and then also adapted into anime. Good for him.

img220()

Okay here's the very short very easy premise of Tawawa: girls go about their daily lives. But here's the catch. They have big boob. Huge even. It's ridiculously simple but this was Himura's goal since February of 2015 when he posted his first Getsuyoubi no Tawawa illustration on Twitter: for people to see a nice simple illustration of anime girl being anime girl every Monday before a stressful week at work. It's the premise of the first relationship of the series between Ai-chan and your average depressed Japanese salaryman. They get to meet each other every Monday on the train, where they talk to each other and occasionally gets to receive a ""lucky charm"" from Ai that would help him get through the week. Lucky charm being a button that popped of her shirt, of course. 

img220(&ehk=HouUoGnIFNKE3Ola5Gxh4gSGZFXI%2fIsdnxc7YQ6QUVg%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)

There is not a whole lot that stands out about this anime. The art and animation is simple enough for a simple show. The soundtrack is lighthearted and relaxing, the voice acting fit the characters well, the ED brings nice closure to the short 5-minute episode with a cute track sung by the voice actor of Ai herself. You never leave with more or less than what you expected from the show. It's a quick relaxing watch for a hazy Monday morning before leaving for school/work and nothing more than that.

img220()

For me, Getsuyobi no Tawawa was a special experience, since I got to watch the season 2 as the episodes came out every Monday morning in my senior year of high school, where I wasn't in the greatest of places. While I'm not about to say the show changed my life or anything, 5-minute fluffy short that it was, I can say for certainty that for the season that it aired, it brighten up my Monday mornings significantly and got me up for a long week of bullshit school, and even now I keep up with the legend Himura's twitter for my weekly dose of all of the oppai in my face serotonin.

87494,"This review does not contain spoilers.
I remember I fell in love with this anime a year ago when I first started getting into BL (boys' love) anime and manga. I made my way through the list of ""Shounen Ai"" anime (as they're called on MAL) starting from the highest rated ones. While I enjoyed all of them, this was the only anime that I thought was worthy of a ""10."" (MAL rating scale) Although it has a few flaws, I think this is a romance anime that people besides fujoshi/fudanshi can enjoy. 

The first thing I love about this anime is the art style. All of the characters are very well drawn and incredibly attractive, but it is a notably different style from other popular BL anime, such as Sekaiichi Hatsukoi or other Nakamura-based works. They're drawn in a very ""modern"" way, so the epidemic that is ""chinhands"" is avoided. Every character's design is unique and well done. Here are some good (and cute) examples:
img500()
Setagawa.
img500()
Hasekura and Kensuke. Note - regular sized hands.
img500()
Kousuke and Setagawa.

The side characters are similarly well done, each having their own unique/identifying feature. Aside from the characters, the backgrounds in this anime are pretty good as well! You can see a bit of that in the sky in the above photo of Setagawa and Kousuke, but it's clear to me a lot of effort went into setting the mood for this anime. The main couple (Setagawa and Kousuke) visit a mountain a few times in the anime, and the view they draw from there is pretty damn good! Although stuff like that is a bit cliche for a romance anime, I still love it.

Alright, so the guys are hot, but that doesn't make an anime good (see - Touken Ranbou anime adaptation). What really makes this anime good to me is the plot and pacing. This is not like Dakaichi, where we have the guys making out and servicing the fans in the first episode. The story starts out with an explanation from the protagonist about how he met two of the main characters, the Ooshiba brothers, Kousuke and Kensuke. From this, we get a glimpse into his troubled home life as well as his inability to find any place where he can ""fit in."" This leads to him hanging around thugs a lot and being their lap-dog. Then, he meets Kensuke (and his brother Kousuke, later), and his life starts to change. This character exposition is something I appreciate in any character-driven drama. If I don't know anything about them, how can I empathize with them in the future when they encounter trouble? 

Kousuke and Setagawa's romantic relationship is what makes up the heart of this anime. Their relationship is a ""forbidden"" one -- student and teacher.  Along with that, there is quite an age gap. My only complaint with this anime is the age gap -- I'm not a huge fan of age gap stories, especially when one is 17 and the other is 28 (yes - those are Setagawa and Kousuke's respective ages). That being said, I think this series handles it remarkably well. Their age gap is the overarching conflict in the anime. The series does not beat around the bush that their relationship is taboo: illegal, even. This gives a lot of stress to both Setagawa and Kousuke, especially Setagawa, who does not want to bear the mental burden of getting him in trouble if they are outed. The age gap problem is present right from the start of their relationship, but it is slowly introduced in increasingly intrusive ways throughout the latter half of the anime. This pacing is nice, because it reminds the viewers that although it seems nice, their relationship can be very fragile. The beginning of their relationship is also very well done: not too rushed, but not too much lead-up either. In my opinion, this is the best way to start a relationship in a romance anime. Anime like Love Stage!!, where their relationship waits until the very end to even start, seem somewhat unsatisfying. Although it is sweet, it's nice to have a balance between confession and actually seeing them in a relationship. I think it is much better to watch the couple go through troubles together and emerge with a stronger bond than before. 

It's worth mentioning the couple in the middle picture - Kensuke and Hasekura. This is easily one of my favorite relationships in all of BL anime, mainly because their relationship is well known to their friends - and they accept it! The start of their relationship was a little rocky, to be honest, but it got into some really good details about Hasekura and Kensuke's relationship in the past. What can I say? I'm a sucker for the ""childhood friend"" trope in romance anime/manga. Hasekura plays a meaningful part in giving Setagawa advice in his own relationship, and sometimes, providing him with unpleasant truths. 

In my opinion, Hitorijime My Hero deserves more credit as a romance anime. Don't let the ""age gap"" tag on this anime dissuade you from watching it. It is a satisfying, entertaining, and sometimes comical ride that anyone can enjoy. Thanks for reading!"

Review
Everyone has certain memories of high school that stick out. These can be heartwarming moments of success or shameful seconds of embarrassment. The importance of these memories may vary for each person, but getting older and dealing with individuals who are all growing up while trying to find an identity is the basic fact of high school. This environment also makes for interesting, although overused, setting in shows and books. However, there are some shows that use this over abundance of teenagdom to deceive the audience. Please tell me! Galko-chan is one such show.

Set in an ordinary Tokyo high school, Please tell me! Galko-chan is anime short series that focuses on a high school class. The primary stories involve three girls, from different social circles who happen to be unlikely friends. This may sound like an average slice of life show, but the genius of each episode lies in the disconnect between what the audience sees and what the audience hears. Visually Galko-chan is within the conformity of a girl with a large chest, a wealthy girl who happens to be an airhead and an otaku who is slightly mean but actually uncomfortable with her social life.

What comes out of these girls, and their classmates, is the true heart of show. The students are making comments and pondering the myths associated with breast size, size of nipples, the correlation between male hair loss and sex drive, how the weight of large breats effects the back or shoulders, and even fear of using a tampon instead of a sanitary pad. The obvious assumption here, is that this is just a show concerned with pandering to a male audience at the expense of the inconsistency of human biology. However, this is far from the truth. Please tell me! Is able to nimbly use these strange questions, and turn them into jokes while calmly providing answers.
image

It is a true testament to Please Tell Me!  that the show does not waste any of its limited airtime, yet the ten or so characters that appear in the classroom are fully formed. The girls in the class think that the boys are stupid, while the boys in the class are secretly curious about what the girls think of them. There are social cliques in the school, that naturally pair off small number of students, but there is no external animosity towards other students. The realistic nature of the schools jokes and atmosphere, lends itself to solidifying the idea that anyone watching the show can identify with one of the characters.

This is a lot of praise for a short form anime, but Please Tell Me! deserves it. The minor complaints that the show has, originate from the flaw of the format. The animation can feel repetitive, especially with facial reactions with a background. There are story elements carry over the course of the episodes and some that disappear after an episode or two. The older sister of Galko seems slightly unessecesry, as the jokes she is involved in fall flat. The characters spend so much time together on screen, that when they are alone the show feels empty. Again, these are issues that arise from the cramming of material into a six or seven minute episode, making it hard to justify any negativity as more than a quick nuisance. Since the pace is so quick, the flaws disappear and reappear before you feel irritated.

This show is a surprise, and a heartfelt one at that. The jokes, self seriousness of the characters, and the sincerity that is encompassed in such short episodes is outstanding. Watching the entire season should take just over an hour, and it is worth every second. Just be prepared to relive some memories of your time in school."
743,"My little odyssey at the time of touring the filmography of the Studio Ghibli officially began 5 days ago, with Hotaru no Haka being the starting point. If I'm being honest, I've rarely felt as excited about a movie as I have felt with these. Each new movie made me feel like the ""me"" of over a decade ago,  that little boy going to the cinema for the first time to watch Finding Nemo. But it's logical, isn't it? The reputation of the Japanese studio speaks for itself and its productions have a special charm, a different flavor from, say, Pixar works, but the same magic. Anyway, enough with the introduction.
I have to say that this is my sixth attempt at writing a review about a Ghibli production, but for various reasons, with my previous attempts I could not deliver a comment effective enough to be happy with and therefore, publish it. This time, however, seeing that I have the advantage that nobody has made a review of this movie, (something that makes things easier for me), I will not have second thoughts. So, I hope I am capable to transmit something interesting through this text. 
Let's focus, the premise of Uma Ga Kikoeru is relatively simple: A familiar face in a train station makes Taku, our protagonist, relive the memories of his time in high school. At that time, Rikako, a teenage girl who'd recently arrived from Tokyo, took the whole class of Taku by surprise and was able to catch both his and his friend Yutaka attention.
Who would have guessed it? The parents of such fantastic (in a magical way) works as Tonari no Totoro decided to do a small and wistful drama about a love triangle. Based on this premise, the events of the film are developed more like a Slice of Life than a full-fledged drama. And it is true that, perhaps in other hands, this movie could have been a disaster. But, luckily, it is not. It may lack the scope or charm that other productions of the studio can boast of having and its narrative philosophy is closer to that of Omohide poro poro (which can restrict it to a niche), but that does not make it a bad movie under any circumstance, just an unfortunate one, let's say. A good one surrounded by an enviroment of excellence. Even so, it's worthwhile to see what Ghibli can do with a premise so simple, contained and grounded such as this.
Umi Ga Kikoeru is a fairly modest film, even minimalist and subtle in certain occasions. And that translates to the treatment of its conflicts and its whole narrative arc. It ends up delivering a very elegant story within a genre populated by cheap drama and unnecessary conflicts. And it is there in that simplicity where it shines with more strength, through silence and the small connections between its characters. And it's true that this can depict the film as a more monotonous and uneventful one, but it doesn't need major events, twists and contrivances. Its slower pace nourishes the film with a tinge of nostalgia and melancholy that resonates, even more than an overreaction for the sake of being dramatic. Honestly, it's a relief and it feels fresh.
It all comes down to this, Umi Ga Kikoeru is a good movie. It's a small human story about the emotions in adolescence, about friendship, love and longing. It is true that some of its aspects don't feel so good nowadays, such as their representation of women (especially coming from Ghibli, having the works of Miyazaki so many strong female characters) or a small violent exchange between Taku and Rikako that left me with a bitter taste. Even the personality of the latter that for me feels like that of a teenager at times charming, at others vulnerable and at others unpleasant, can be seen as obnoxious by many.
The title of this film is quite an accurate analogy for the state of its main cast. This is a warm, minimalist film, yes, but a captivating one. It may not reach the greatness of Omohide poro poro, but it is more than a worthy companion. It's nostalgic and there are very close and relatable moments in it, moments that show how good can Studio Ghibli be when it comes to narrating a simpler and more contained drama.
Thanks for reading and allow me to apologize for my English. It's not my mother tongue."
9863,"A work that I wanted to see to kill time and ended up regaining my love for audiovisual media and what they have to offer.
    Synopsis:
Sket Dance tells the adventures of Kaimei Academy's ""Sket-Dan"", a club that is dedicated to solving any problems raised by the student council for the overall improvement of students' lives.

Based on the plot of the series, we can expect that the series will not be a great adventure with a very elaborate plot (until later), but rather an episodic work, in which each chapter will have a different protagonist, and therefore, a story apart from that of our main characters

The series takes place in an ordinary world (mostly), an educational Institute, using parody and gag (Humor transmitted through images and not words) as main resources. On a great variety of occasions we will find scenes, and even complete chapters of parodies of other well-known and popular cult series, but it is not limited only to the field of animation, Sket dance also parodies different recognized Actors, both in Japan and in the rest of the world, including celebrities. like, for example, Michael Jackson.
There are times when the series even makes fun of itself, breaking the fourth wall on many occasions, a resource that the author, Shinohara Kenta, uses in a magnificent and very recurring way in most of his episodes, from the characters talking about their voice actors, to discussing the terms of conditions when publishing explicit or inappropriate content in the industry.
Characters:

What I love the most and what made me fall in love with this work is the individuality that each character possesses, and they are not few. Each and every one of them is unique in its own way, and it's impossible not to fall in love with the cast of the series.
I will talk more about the 3 main characters of the play.
img220()Fujisaki Yuusuke (Bossun): It could be said that of the three, he is the ""Hero"" of this story, but that is not entirely correct, since the stereotype of the protagonist that is usually used is quite the opposite, he is a character character immature, lazy and childish, in most of his time, he can be seen playing with toys as if he were a child, he usually wanders in the club room or playing jokes with his acquaintances, he gets easily depressed and self-conscious when he is insulted or Left aside. Regardless of these flaws, Bossun is a very analytical person when it comes to dealing with problems. What I like about this specific character is how much one can empathize with him, because he is an ordinary person without many talents, extremely humble and enthusiastic, despite the fact that not everything goes as he would like, he remains firm and keep going. He follows his ideology of helping everyone who has the courage to seek his help, going to any extreme if the situation warrants it.

Hime Onizuka (Himeko): An ex-delinquent who used to fight with anyone who came across her, she is the one who does the ""dirty work"" when the situation calls for violence, and she is the one who usually finishes off the series' jokes. Although she appears to be tomboyish and violent, she has a taste for cute and cuddly things. He shows unwavering loyalty to the leader of the group and therefore follows him everywhere. What I like most about her is her constant attempt to be a better person, to forget that delinquent past that haunts her throughout the play.

Usui Kazuyoshi (Switch): He is the mind and the secretary of the group, due to the events that took place in his life, switch chooses not to speak with his mouth, he does so through a voice synthesizer through his computer. He is an otaku who apparently enjoys making fun of others, not much can be said from his expressions, since he doesn't have one. Later in the work, his story is delved into. What I love most about Switch is the fact that the conclusion of the play is about his self-improvement, and everything that he stands for, he's probably the most developed character in the play.

Of the rest of the secondary characters, I could spend all day writing about them and what they represent, but there is no time for it. As I said before, each character is unique, from a Samurai in the middle of the 21st century to a manga artist who constantly breaks the fourth wall.

The message of the work and all that it means ""Help the rest""

This story taught me that no one can live by themselves, each and every one of us at some point in our history will need the support of someone else, and this work speaks of how important it is to be willing to offer our help to those who need it. , teaches us to look around us and reflect on the lives of others and understand that we are all different and have various problems, teaches us not to be afraid to ask for help, and above all to value the present, leave the past behind and keep going.
“What does helping others mean to you?” Bossun answers this question as follows: “Being someone who understands others. Not to change people so that they can overcome their problems, but to make people recognize where they stand and appreciate themselves as they are now, by giving them a push in the back.""

My conclusion

Sket dance is definitely my favorite show, it has taught me a lot about how to be a better person and how to cope with my problems with the best of smiles, it is a series with which you will laugh out loud, but you will also learn, and you're going to cry, it's a long journey, but it's totally worth your time and patience. I fell in love with this anime/manga, and I'm sure it will happen to more than one. So, should you watch Sket dance? Give it a try, and I swear you won't regret it.

21746,"Ah, the tragedy as old as time. A popular piece of media comes out and proves to be a hit, both critically, and financially. Some odd years later, a sequel is made that exists solely because the first one was popular, rather than because there was something to add. It gets panned, financial success or no. 

FLCL Progressive is yet another example of this tale. It’s what would happen if they tried to make FLCL in the current day -as of writing, of course- without any of the charm or passion that went into the original. Love it or hate it, FLCL is a distinct piece of work, one filled with little references and neat, temporary art-style shake-ups to add flavor to an already eccentric and visually stunning take on the coming of age story. Progressive is milquetoast at the best of times and downright broken at the worst of times. There’s no flavor outside of moments that already take cues from its predecessor, and perhaps a few bits in the latter half. It doesn’t have anything worth covering, let alone worth bringing to the table.

It would be one thing if, in spite of this, this sequel worked as a functioning tale with the audiovisual mastery that exemplifies the best of the current age. It would simply be an unnecessary addition, but a harmless one at best. However, we instead get a mess that decides to pander. Think about it. Why else does the main character wear headphones that have cat ears? Why else do we have a loli and a beach episode? Why else do they just randomly include smartphones without having anything be done with them? Why else does this show’s equivalent to Haruko wear a sexy maid outfit? Simply because it’s hip with the current otaku crowd.

The real origins of Haruko and her Progressive counterpart, Jinyu, are not only stupid, but also somewhat contradictory to FLCL 1 and raise some questions the original was never equipped to answer. The things they try to add about the universe of the franchise are absurd and even inconsistent, even by the conventions of the franchise as well. It’s already aggravating that it’s all in service to a show that has nothing new or interesting to comment on in any meaningful way, and that the finale is this dumb mess that abruptly wraps itself up. The characters make it even worse. Hidomi is a nothing character. There is nothing consistent to her other than having a secret want to reset the world for particularly incongruous and asinine reasons. The show even claims she is going for a tsundere angle, as god awful as that observation is, and it’s as inaccurate as a blind man shooting in the dark. Even Haruko largely just an adult brat rather than the quirky, ambitious, and amoral vixen from the original. Her counterpart, Jinyu, is bland like Hidomi, but at least she is the least obnoxious character of the entire cast. The male students in the show are also nothing characters with no chemistry, even though the main guy of that trio, Lide, acts infinitely more like an active protagonist than Hidomi ever does. The loli character also isn’t any better; she’s as unremarkable and annoying as the rest. No one has any chemistry to speak of, adding insult to injury.

Outside of the ending credits and the 5th episode, the show’s visuals are rather dull and even a tad unappealing to look at. Production I.G honestly did a poor job outside of the hit and miss new character designs, as the animation was incredibly stilted and choppy --even in the more kinetic action scenes-- and the color pallet was not to my taste at all Some scenes look downright terrible, even if that's counterbalanced by a few scenes looking pretty evocative. Even in the art style shift in the 5th episode that actually made Haruko look more similar to how she was in FLCL than in the episodes preceding it, it’s arguable if the more purposely rough visuals worked. The music is as much to my uninterest as ever, with several songs by The Pillows, both new and old, and largely forgettable background music outside of that, which is barely any more memorable than the original. The only song of any note here is ""Thank You, my Twilight"", which is one of my favorites in the franchise, believe it or not. That's not enough to save anything though. At least the dub was nice given the awful material, I suppose.

In essence, FLCL 2 is your typical underwhelming sequel. I’ve seen worse in this regard, even in terms of sequels to Gainax shows, but damning with faint praise doesn’t excuse how pointless, shallow, and lifeless this installment really is. Sadly, its existence also slightly nullifies some of the uniqueness of the original, so doing nothing substantial to help make up for that is arguably one of the biggest crimes this sequel could have committed under these circumstances. At least it doesn’t use that show as a crutch, but again, it does that anime and several of its fans no favors, either. FLCL 3, please be a proper alternative to this mess?"
18,"8/10

A great, authentic instalment that focuses chiefly on racing and its developmental stages. Takumi, with the help of Ryosuke of Project D, learns extensively about theory, mechanics, and even the psychological aspect of serious street racing. In nearly every race, Takumi discovers something new from his opponent's technique and adapts it, improves it, or simply invents something entirely new so as to come out on top. And he does, unfailingly; even through the oddest of circumstances. His disadvantages aren't as great as before. His car now has the upgraded engine and even a team of mechanics, tuning it to the specific course and his liking in every race. Still, his car has no ABS and lacks the stability and quickness of modern electronics. He soon discovers that when his Dad decides to give him the Hachi-roku and buy himself an Impreza WRX. Bunta then proceeds to beat his Akina downhill in it, of course, without informing him of his purchase. After he realizes who the driver was and gets to drive the AWD Subaru himself, he also actualizes the fact that his technique makes his runs with the better car faster. Thus, his beloved AE86 is hindering his development and effectively driving him to an impasse.

Most of my qualms about this title are story-related and a few minor ones I've always had with how the show allows some opponents to behave. The story here is minimal and disappointing. We are shown that Mogi, now in Tokyo, has sent Takumi a letter, but he doesn't seem to care to even respond, albeit he is thinking about her all the time. The reasoning is pretty solid, however, as he can't focus on much else when he's the ace driver of Project D, a temporary superteam. The other aspect is Keisuke of the Red Suns. He is developed a bit and some plot is written on him. It is shown that he used to be a rebel who'd lead street gangs in high school and his brother saved him from that lifestyle by showing him his Touge. A girl also comes to fall in love with him and even help him win on some occasions, but he decides to reject her for his competitive bromance with Takumi. The studio is, also, the worst so far with everyone looking much too blurry and about five years younger.

Further, we have the races themselves. Almost every single one of them is intense and involves some new, interesting, and well-analyzed technique. One of the standouts was the one where Takumi raced an actual pro-racer. He discovered the disappearing line overtake. A technique where the attacking driver uses his opponent's blind spots to come up in his line and force him to give up the line. Said pro uses this trick, which Takumi immediately retaliates with his own twist (turning off the headlights for extra sneakiness), so the pro decides to ram him lightly to force his way back in the lead. Takumi doesn't retaliate, since he doesn't like putting other lives at risk, but overtakes him cleanly anyway. The tactics of the pro racer were so unbecoming, in my opinion. Perhaps, light ramming is accepted in protected circuits, where drivers know what's coming, but with Takumi who had no idea those existed, he could've easily flown off the mountain and to his certain death.

Speaking of certain death, there is another interesting race where the opponent seems kind and respectful yet attempts murder, many a time. The final races and most intense are when the duo of Takumi and Keisuke race against the Gods of Touge. God Foot—so named for his divine pedal control—and God Arm—so called for his godlike handling, which employs only one hand for better angles. The first one is likely the most underhanded yet. Keisuke faces God Foot, who uses some pretty murderous tactics to get ahead. Initially, Keisuke is faster and manages to overtake. They're doing an uphill and downhill battle and, at some point, they have to J-turn around a cone to turn around. God Foot gets to his side right before that point, J-turns with him and uses the fact that this will cause a head-on collision with certainly fatal speeds to force Keisuke to back off and give him the lead. Thereafter, when Keisuke overtakes him again, God Foot bumps him. At least, he apologizes for that infraction.

The last race is Takumi v. God Arm. This opponent comes with a few quirks. He only uses his right hand for steering, making for better angles, and he has the unbelievable ability to attain the same exact speed while cornering by using random lines differing each time. That shouldn't be possible as each line limits how much speed you can carry, but he apparently can do it because he's not using all his speed and he performs delicate torque control at variable points throughout all the random lines. This strategy is very powerful as it helps maintain better tire grip and is sure to throw Takumi's pace off. The race comes down to a war of attrition, where each driver is tired and God Arm has to go for his record-lines, which aren't the ideal ones for speed, but the ideal ones for grip—as his racing style is more so grip than drift. He uses this to get a gap, Takumi overshoots his gutter technique and fries the suspension, but God Arm is too late. His middle age finally shows as he stops and throws up right before the goal. Undoubtedly, the most hollow victory our protagonist has tasted to date.

The last part of this title I've yet to mention is the conclusion of Itsuki's plotline which was started in Second Stage. He finds the girl he likes in one of Takumi's races and manages to chat her up. Later, the girl learns that her ex has gone to her house and is searching for her. She panics and tells him that she doesn't want to go to her home tonight. Awkwardly and terribly, Itsuki immediately asks her if they could get a room and somehow she responds positively. Then, she admits that she had been dating some guy before, and hasn't fully gotten over him yet. Then, he asks her how many times they got a room and tacitly how many times they had sex. Beautiful, bro, beautifully smooth. Even after all that, he has the girl. But, an unexpected turn of events occurs. Her ex finds them and stops by, shouting to her that she loves her and only toyed with her because he didn't have the confidence to treat her seriously, because of their age gap. Itsuki, hearing that and knowing she's not fully over him, denies her proposal to leave. He, in lieu, closes his eyes, opens up his arms and tells her to run to the chest of the one she truly loves. Of course, the creator does him even dirtier than before and when he opens up his eyes, she had run to the ex. Poor Itsuki.

Overall, I think this is one of the better titles in the franchise, and everyone who loved First Stage is sure to love this one, as well."

While currently scrolling through Crunchyroll to see what anime I can add to my list for the winter season, I scroll across “The Foolish Angel Dances with the Devil”. Hmmm an angel meets a demon in a school setting... Count me in! This anime has been one of my favorites of the season so let’s jump into why.
Synopsis

Akutsu, our MC is a demon on a recruitment mission who is sent to a human high school to find allies to help assist hell in the fight against the angels. During this search he meets Lily, our other MC, and when attempting to recruit her he finds a surprise... Lily’s an angel.


Story

Alright so being 100 percent honest this is a genre that is not hard to fail at. The genre of a rom com anime simply needs 3 things to succeed. That is romance even at the simplest form, comedy which is the hardest thing out of the 3 to achieve, and a lovable female MC. The foolish angel dances with the devil check all 3 boxes. There’s not much to provide within the story outside of the fact that we see the relationship of the two progresses to the point where they are rarely outside of the screen together. We all know demons and angels are archrivals but even then, the romance of the anime almost makes you forget what they are at the school to achieve. Lily is there to hunt demons which she does and turn them into little puppies to be well taken care of by someone who loves puppies and who doesn’t love puppies. Meanwhile Akutsu barely did anything for his mission. Not one person did he recruit let alone attempted to recruit. The story’s Juliet and Romeo kind of vibe isn’t bad but after watching this is literally just a show of how an angel and demon fell for each other.
Characters
Starting off with Lily, the cute MC female that’s an angel. She does charm the audience with her angelic features and in ways but honestly, she’s a bit more demonic than the actual demon when you watch the anime. To begin with she turns Akutsu to her slave and basically makes him come with when she is demon hunting. Within this story she reveals that even though she seems perfect in the human world she was someone who has been looked on as an outsider within heaven.

Akutsu shows the least progression out of the characters. However, there’s not much progression to be made. Yes, he’s a demon but also a great guy. There are multiple instances where he helped Lily even though she’s made him her slave and he knows that she’s an angel. The part where Akutsu shines the best is when he meets Lily’s brother SPOILER ALERT lol.

Outside of the two MC’s, we have a few supporting characters on the screen for about 5 minutes. We have Hirota, Tanigawa, and Tanahashi. Tanahashi is really the side character who stands out the most due to her ability to get Lily riled up regarding Akutsu. We also see Lillia as well, which is Lily’s weapon but in human form if that makes sense. She’s portrayed as Lily’s older sister.

Animation
There isn’t much to be said regarding the animation, it’s fine. Most of the characters are in the same outfits so there’s not much to really critique. This does kind of add boring affect to the anime, I’ve enjoyed seeing characters style within anime now days. I will give praise to the fight scenes. Yes, fight scenes in a romcom aren’t that rare now days. The fight scenes were a total surprise to me within this anime.

Conclusion

To conclude this anime tugged heart strings, I enjoyed the comedy, and the chemistry between our two main characters. However, it doesn’t stand out within the romcom genre. There’s nothing I can point out that this anime does better than any other romcom anime. This is the downfall and realization that came to me when I finished the anime and thought of the review. Yes, it’s a nice romcom just to watch but nothing to recommend honestly. I recommend this anime as a - “Not bad it’s a good watch”.

Anime with a score of 70-80 receives a ""Not bad it's a good watch""."

Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary is quite a curious title. With it being a mystery anime, even just its title leads me to question things. “Shoshimin”, is translated as the [petite bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petitebourgeoisie), which refers to someone in the lower middle class. So indeed, that might be what constitutes an “ordinary person” in a financial sense. Who or what is trying to be ordinary though? The characters? The whole plot itself?

A likely reason why you (and myself) might be interested in this series is that it was written by the same author, Honobu Yonezawa, who wrote another mystery series in Hyouka. I can definitely see the similarities in these two series, with both tackling mysteries that are grounded in the sense of ordinary, mundane life. Shoshimin takes it one step further though, and in my opinion, brings it to an even more “ordinary” sense, with little mysteries in daily life that seem even trivial to most people. For most of this season, the show revolved around simple daily tasks, like buying sweets, solving a mystery of who ate the missing sweet, things that we might take for granted through our lives, but through all these experiences, they coalesce into a larger mystery, which is one of the things I appreciated most about this series.

webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/902ff2e1b9d4abbd45c2ab91ec047d47.mp4)


A big mystery, is why Jougorou’s agreement with Yuki, which was to be “ordinary” together, exists. Why do these two want to be ordinary, and stay out of people’s lives? What were their pasts like? Bit by bit, by watching the two main characters and their lives, and how such twisted individuals have such trouble with being ordinary, one being drawn to being a detective, and the other having sharp insight and the ability to act quickly, we get to know just a tiny bit about the characters. Though, we have to ask, what does “being ordinary” actually mean? Does it mean that you go with the flow like everyone else, or act like everyone else does? Jougorou’s definition of being ordinary seems to revolve around not butting in to other people’s problems, or in other words, keeping the status quo, but by trying so hard to keep that status quo, it seems more deviant than ordinary, in trying to quell every one of life’s swells.

img500()


The biggest issue that people might find with this show is that there’s no real hook. It’s more of a “feeling-out process” then something with an immediate pay-off. Through its overall gorgeous visuals, it can hook you into the most “boring” and mundane of mysteries, or entrap you in its depiction of delicious sweets that have you frothing at the mouth. If you’re not into that, then this show is not for you, but the show certainly invites you to try it out, with its initial slow pacing. It’s easy to feel that it’s average or boring, but I think that is what the show is going for, because in showcasing what it means to be ordinary, the show must feel like that as well. In that sense, I think the show did that extremely well.

As a second season is on the horizon, I say, we let them keep cooking. If the food looked that good, whoever was in the kitchen knew what they were doing, that’s for sure. Overall, the show did its job well in allowing the viewer to find intrigue and beauty in the mundane. It slows down to the pace of an iyashikei sometimes, yet swells up with tension ever so slightly to keep you interested. It’s not an approach to a show I have seen much at all, and that’s all the more reason why I ended up enjoying it as much as I did. The only thing that I’m questioning is the direction that the story is going in, and what the main point of the show is, but since there is still more to adapt, there’s time to rectify that issue.

With so many questions left unanswered, one can only say, “I’m curious!”

11751,"This review contains spoilers. Any spoilers beyond the first episode are marked with spoiler tags. It's also my first anime review, plz dun hurt me ;-;


Symphogear is a fun, music-heavy anime that blends a lot of generic action elements together in a new way. Though it has some darker moments, it is overall a light, fun anime that can be enjoyed by anyone who can read subs (obviously it would be difficult to sub an anime where the characters sing for a massive portion of the anime). I would only recommend avoiding this if you don't care for Japanese singing. 


I found the first episode to be a strange mixture of happy scenes and disturbing, dark scenes. Particularly the initial transformation sequence of the main character at the end of the episode invokes a knee-jerk gag reaction due to the body  horror involved. (Luckily, this is the only time that brutal sequence is shown.) I wondered if the series was trying too hard to be tragic.
!img() img() img() img() 
does this look like a normal transformation sequence to you?!

I had heard the music was good but even so it exceeded my expectations. Animation and art seemed pretty decent quality too. The first episode managed to hook me in, despite the aforementioned shortcomings. I wondered if it may not be so trashy after all.

Sympogear is set in a more-or-less modern Japan. The primary differences are the existence of powerful 'relics' which can be awakened through song, and the existence of eldritch abominations called 'Noise'. The noise are impervious to conventional weaponry and turn humans to ash on contact, so battle songstresses wielding relics manifested as weapons and armor do battle with them. Anime being what it is, only grade-school girls are 'compatible' with relics.

In order of introduction, more or less. Names written in Last First format.

img120(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20170825083945) Kohinata Miku -- Hibiki's roommate and close friend. Tends to serve the token normal girl and emotional support roles. Has several small yuri moments with Hibiki, if you're into that sort of thing.
 
img120(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20170624125645) Tachibana Hibiki -- The main protagonist. Although she's not exactly a reluctant hero, Hibiki's primary motivation is to protect her normal life. Although she has no qualms about mowing down Noise, she becomes distressed if her opponent is human, attempting to reason with them and only fighting if forced to. Although powerful, she is not a 'Mary Sue' character as she has her weak points -- just don't expect them to get in the way too much unless diverted by villain plot armor. !Unlike the other relic wielders, she cannot summon a weapon and thus learns martial arts to be able to fight!

img120(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20170821161336) Kazanari Tsubasa -- The first relic user, who wields a sword-themed relic. Cold exterior, due to seeing herself as a human weapon rather than a human being. Also seems especially hostile towards Hibiki !due to Kanade effectively sacrificing herself to protect Hibiki. Later makes it up to Hibiki and becomes a close partner!.

img120(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20160119144049) Kazanari Genjuro -- Commander of the Noise-fighting organization, and a fatherly figure to the relic users that work for it. A training maniac that appears to have an obsession with Bruce Lee movies, he's so ridiculously strong he could easily have been the protagonist, ace, or primary antagonist of a shounen anime. 

img120(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20170624130437) Yukine Chris -- The first human antagonist introduced. An underling that works for 'Finé', she appears to have the ability to summon and control the Noise. Tsundere personality. !She later flips sides after Finé disposes of her.!

img120(/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20161011094732) Finé -- The primary antagonist. Her plan is initially unclear, but seems to both require relics and can be impeded by them. Can summon and control the Noise. !It is later revealed that her soul has taken over the body of the primary researcher that aids the protagonists, and that her plan is to destroy the moon in order to lift the curse of confusion that has been cast on mankind.!

Although I can't call the cast original by any means, they're certainly fun. In other words, though the originality is low, the execution was very good. I believe most audiences can empathize with them well enough to care about them, even the villains to an extent. Character development is at an acceptable level for a show of this length, but nothing to rave about Character Score: 82/100

This is the main area the show suffers in. However, it is not terrible, simply rather generic. The blandness is somewhat offset by the characters dealing with events in a reactionary manner for most of the show: the protagonists don't know !or, perhaps, pretend not to know! who their enemy is, and thus have to react to threats as they appear. However, this is somewhat diminished once the primary antagonist shows her face -- aside from a few small hiccups, !like Hibiki going into an animalistic berserk mode,! the plot becomes more or less predictable. However, excluding the ending, there is virtually no deus ex machina, and they don't use too many cheap plot devices. Plot Score: 52/100


A good point for the show. Animation is fairly smooth, without any noticeable inconsistencies. The concert in the first episode and the battles throughout the series stand out in particular. It's not on the level of, say, Unlimited Blade Works or Onepunch-man, but it's definitely up there. Animation Score: 85/100

As expected from an anime called more or less 'Swan Songs of the Valkyries', Symphogear's music is simply phenomenal. Particular tracks worth noting are 'ORBITAL BEAT', 'Gyakkō no Flügel', and 'Gekisō Gungnir'. Music Subscore: 100/100

Music isn't the only component of sound though. Sound effects are about average. Nothing to complain about, but nothing that stands out from the crowd. Voice Acting is a little harder to judge. On one hand, the seiyuus are excellent. They have to be in a show where the characters sing as they fight. On the other hand, the writers made the always questionable decision to use English for foreign characters... and proceeded to fail miserably. So badly, I suggest having your finger over the mute button for some episodes. Thankfully this only happens in a couple episodes, and the later installments in the franchise drop Engrish in favour of magically making everyone speak Japanese, much to everyone's relief. Voice Acting and SFX subscore: 85/100
Sound Score: 90/100"

English review:

Introduction:

So, this will be my first review, which means it’s also my first real opportunity to mess up. With that said, and considering I plan to do more of these in the future, i accept feedback about possible improvements. All my reviews will be done in 2 languages: English and Portuguese.

I chose this anime for my first review because it gives just so much margin for critic, both in favor of it and against it. There are some things I like on it and some I don’t, which I will expose later.

I took my time writing this, so it’s kind of a big review, but If you don’t want to read it all and just want a quick summary of the anime, I would say you should watch it if:

-you don’t have problems with violence and blood.
-would like to see a different take on mahou shoujos.
-you’re not a kid.

Really, it’s not meant to be watched by kids. AT ALL.

I would like you to read the full thing though, as it took a lot of work into it. This review is more destined to people who didn’t watch the show yet, so I will try to give the least amount of spoilers possible. However, if you already watched it, then you know it’s very hard to talk about this anime without giving spoilers. Because of that, I will openly talk about the story until the end of episode 3, which is when the important stuff begins to happen. If I need to talk about something beyond this point I'll make a spoiler alert. 

Now, let’s begin this before the laziness attack me again.

Overview:

Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (Mahou Shoujo Raising Project, in English) is an animated series adapted from the original light novel created by Asari Endou and Maruino. The series went on air between october 2, 2016 to december 18, 2016, in weekly episodes of 24 minutes. If you watch the trailer, you’re going to think it’s another cute mahou shoujo anime with cute girls, or at least that’s what I thought about it. However, this series has attracted some attention, first due to giving a different look at the Mahou Shoujo genre, and also for being violent, very violent.

I know what you’re thinking. “But Blaze9, you said you weren’t going to give spoilers”. Well, I don't consider that a spoiler, because the show doesn’t do ANY effort to hide it. In fact, the very first scene of the first episode is very dark and bloody. Crazy stuff all the way around.

The very first scene of the first episode.

Before I return to this subject, let’s talk a bit about the story.

Story:

You see, there is a city and in this city there is a popular RPG game that is called “Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku”. Between the many players of this game, there is our protagonist, Koyuki Himekawa. She is a (elementary school?) student, and is a pretty good girl. She’s beautiful, very gentle, has a cute voice, really loves magical girls, and is also ridiculously innocent. No, for real, she’s TOO innocent.

There is a rumor going around that says that some people between the many players of MSIK have the opportunity to become real magical girls. Doesn’t seem very right, but then our protagonist were playing the game as usual and then guess what? She receives an offer to become a real magical girl, and she takes it. And then the magical girl Snow White is born, and her main power is to hear the cries of help of people in need.

The incredibly cute Snow White.

Well, at this point, if you have at least a bit of awareness, you’re gonna think there is something strange going on here. And if you’re a paranoid dude like me, you’re gonna see something bad coming a mile away like a parade. But our protagonist, being ridiculously innocent, has no clue at all. 

After becoming a magical girl, Snow White gets to meet most of the other magical girls of the town, and everyone seems reasonable enough. Her main chores, according to Incub- I mean, “Fav-Pon”, are helping people and collecting “magical candies”. Everything seems to be fine and well for our protagonist, who loves her new job and managed to fulfill her dream that she once thought absolutely impossible.

And then, hell starts breaking loose when Fav says he’s gonna “cut” half of the magical girls of the town, and the way to do so would be to remove the girl that collects less magical candies throughout the week. The girls soon find out however, that losing their magical powers is equivalent to losing YOUR LIFE. 

Stuff doesn’t get any better when Fav later announces that girls can now transfer magical candies to one another. Which also means they can steal from one another. You can already see where this is going, right? The thing is, everyone noticed that Snow White is a dedicated and innocent magical girl and in fact, she’s the only one between them all that fills the stereotype of “ideal” magical girl. Because of this, people start to think that she’s the easiest target of them all. 

That does it for the story. After that, some interesting things happen and some of them are imprevisible, so I recommend watching the full thing if you wanna see where this will go. I will now do some commentary about the anime and some of these will contain spoilers.

Opening and Ending: 10/10 - my favorite parts of the anime. The songs are great to hear and the dynamics of the intro are fine, considering the amount of characters we have. As for the ending, I love it for being simple. I could watch it the whole day.

Artstyle: 9/10 - it’s strangely… cute? Actually, the art is the main reason why I decided to watch this, and i still love the art. I didn’t read the original light novel so I can't compare the works though.

Acting: 8/10 - good, nothing bad to say about the acting. Some of the characters are difficult to perform.

Animation: 7/10 - It’s OK. It has some bad moments, sometimes it seems a slide presentation, sometimes the characters doesn’t have expressions and sometimes they have the wrong expression, but overall it’s nice and won’t bother you unless you are crazy over this matter.

-SPOILERS-
!Soundtrack: 5/10 - weakest part of the anime in my opinion. Excluding the opening and ending, which are great, the soundtrack sometimes sound out of context, like putting a “funny” music during a death scene. Of course, there may be an artistic context to this, like trying to demonstrate how much of a psychopath a certain character is, but it doesn’t sound very correct to me. !

-SPOILERS-
!What I would change: 

if I had the power to change anything in this anime right now, first of all, without a single doubt, i would get rid of that damn intro scene. That thing just spoils 60% of the show and makes us watch the episodes expecting always the worse. The second thing I would do is to make it longer. If it had 24 episodes, the story wouldn’t be so cramped, it would flow better, and there would have more time to explore the backgrounds of the characters (some of them are really interesting) and the show would shine much more.!

Conclusion:

Just for the record, i see that some people tend to say this anime is a “bloody copy of Madoka”. While I do agree that this anime sadly lives in Madoka’s shadow, i don’t think it deserves to be called this way. It’s true that the idea of deconstructing the mahou shoujo stereotype (in an animated series at least) came some years before with Madoka, but Ikusei Keikaku walks on his own feet, and I actually think that if the story wasn’t so cramped due to so many characters to work on with so little space, it would definitely achieve a bigger spot on our forums.

This concludes this review. I hope it helped you have a better idea of this show and I hope you had a good time reading it.




Review em Português. 

Introdução:

Bom, esse será meu primeiro review aqui no anilist, o que significa que é minha primeira oportunidade de fazer besteira. Pretendo fazer mais desses no futuro então se alguém quiser me dar algum feedback eu aceito. Todos os meus reviews serão feitos em Inglês e em Português.

Achei justo começar minha saga de reviews com um anime como este, simplesmente porque ele deixa muita margem pra comentários, tanto a favor como contra ele. Tem algumas coisas que eu gosto nele e outras que não, que irei expor depois.

Demorei um tempo escrevendo isso então o review ficou meio grande, mas caso não queira ler tudo e queira apenas um resumo do anime, então eu acho que você deve assistir se:

-você não tem problemas com animes sangrentos ou violentos, ou ambos juntos.
-gostaria de ver uma visão diferente no gênero de mahou shoujos.
-você não é criança.

Sério, não é uma boa ideia passar isso pra crianças. ESTOU FALANDO SÉRIO.

Apesar disso eu gostaria que você lesse tudo já que deu bastante trabalho pra fazer. Esse review é mais destinado para pessoas que ainda não assistiram a série, então vou tentar dar o mínimo de spoilers possível. Porém, se você já assistiu, então sabe que é muito difícil falar sobre esse anime sem dar spoiler nenhum. Por conta disso, irei falar abertamente sobre o anime até o final do episódio 3, que é quando as coisas mais importantes começam a acontecer. Se eu precisar falar sobre algo além desse ponto vou fazer um alerta de spoiler. 

Agora vamos começar logo, antes que me dê outra crise de preguiça.

Visão Geral:

Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (“Projeto de Ascensão de Garotas Mágicas”, em Português) é uma série animada adaptada da light novel de Asari Endou e Maruino. A série foi ao ar de 2 de outubro de 2016 a 18 de dezembro de 2016 em episódios semanais de 24 minutos. Se você ver o trailer, deve achar que se trata de mais um anime mahou shoujo com garotas fofinhas, ou pelo menos foi isso que eu achei quando vi o trailer. Porém, essa série atraiu uma certa atenção, primeiramente por apresentar uma visão diferente de mahou shoujo, e também por ser violenta, bem violenta.

Já sei o que você tá pensando. “Mas Blaze9, você disse que não ia dar spoilers”. Bom, eu não considero um spoiler, já que o anime não faz NENHUM esforço pra esconder isso. Na verdade, a primeira cena do primeiro episódio já é bem sombria e sangrenta. Bem louco mesmo.

A primeira cena do primeiro episódio.

Antes de eu voltar a falar sobre isso, vamos falar um pouco sobre a história.

História:

Existe uma cidade, e nessa cidade tem um jogo bem popular chamado “Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku”. Entre as várias pessoas que jogam esse jogo, existe nossa protagonista, Koyuki Himekawa. Ela é uma estudante (ensino fundamental?), e é uma menina muito boa. Ela é gentil, bonita, tem uma voz bem agradável, adora garotas mágicas, e é ridiculamente inocente. Tipo, inocente DEMAIS.

Também tem um boato rolando por aí que diz que algumas pessoas entre os vários jogadores de MSIK tem a oportunidade de se tornar garotas mágicas de verdade. Não parece verdade, mas aí nossa protagonista estava jogando o jogo como normalmente, e depois adivinha só? Ela recebe uma oferta para se tornar uma garota mágica de verdade, e ela aceita. E assim a garota mágica Snow White (Branca de Neve) nasce, e o seu poder é ouvir os apelos de pessoas em necessidade.

A linda Snow White.

Bem, a esse ponto, se você tem pelo menos um pouco de atenção, vai pensar que tem algo estranho acontecendo. E se você for um cara paranóico que nem eu, já sabe que vai dar merda. Mas nossa protagonista é tão inocente que não tem a menor ideia. 

Depois de se tornar uma garota mágica, Snow White conhece as outras mahou shoujos da cidade, E todas parecem ser razoáveis à primeira vista. As suas tarefas, de acordo com o  Incub- Digo, “Fav-Pon”, são ajudar as pessoas e coletar “magical candies” (doces mágicos). Tudo parece estar dando muito certo pra nossa protagonista, que adora o seu novo trabalho e ainda realizou o seu sonho que ela antes achava completamente impossível.

E aí, as coisas começam a ficar esquisitas quando o Fav diz que vai “cortar” metade das garotas mágicas da cidade, e a forma de fazer isso será remover a garota mágica que coletar menos magical candies ao longo da semana. As garotas rapidamente descobrem, contudo, que perder seus poderes mágicos equivale a perder SUA VIDA.

As coisas ficam ainda piores quando Fav anuncia que agora as garotas podem trocar magical candies entre elas, o que também significa que elas podem roubar os doces das outras. Já dá pra ver pra onde isso está indo, né? O problema é que todo mundo notou que a Snow White é uma garota mágica dedicada e inocente e na verdade, ela é a única entre elas todas que preenche o estereótipo de garota mágica “ideal”. Por conta disso, as pessoas começam a pensar que ela é o alvo mais fácil de todas. 

Vou parar por aqui com a história. Depois disso acontecem várias coisas interessantes, e algumas imprevisíveis também, por isso recomendo assistir o anime todo pra ver onde isso vai dar. Agora irei fazer alguns comentários sobre o anime e alguns desses irão conter spoilers.

Abertura e Encerramento: 10/10 - minhas partes preferidas do anime. As músicas são agradáveis de se ouvir e as dinâmicas da intro são boas, considerando o tanto de personagens que tem. Sobre o encerramento, eu adoro justamente por ser simples. Poderia assisti-lo o dia todo.

img(

Arte: 9/10 - É estranhamente… fofa? Na verdade, a arte é o motivo pelo qual eu decidi assistir esse anime, e eu ainda adoro a arte. Eu não li a light novel original então não posso comparar os trabalhos nesse sentido.


‘-’

Atuação: 8/10 - boa, não tenho nada de ruim pra falar sobre a atuação. Algumas das personagens são difíceis de interpretar.

Animação: 7/10 - É boa. Tem alguns momentos ruins, às vezes parece uma apresentação de slides, às vezes as personagens não mostram expressões e às vezes mostram as expressões erradas, mas geralmente é bom e não vai te incomodar a não ser que você seja muito exigente com isso.

-SPOILERS-
!Trilha Sonora: 5/10 - parte mais fraca do anime na minha opinião. Tirando a introdução e o encerramento, que são muito bons, a trilha sonora às vezes fica fora de contexto, tipo colocar uma música “engraçada” durante uma cena de morte. Claro, pode haver um contexto artístico a isso, tipo tentar mostrar o quanto uma certa personagem é uma psicopata, mas não soa muito correto na minha visão.!

-SPOILERS-
!O que eu mudaria: 

Se eu pudesse mudar algo no anime agora, primeiramente, antes de tudo, removeria aquela cena de introdução. Aquilo ali “spoleia” 60% do anime e faz a gente assistir a série esperando sempre o pior. Ela basicamente destrói todo o elemento surpresa que o anime poderia proporcionar. A segunda coisa que eu faria é torná-lo mais comprido. Se tivesse 24 episódios, a história não ficaria tão apertada, o anime correria bem melhor, e teria mais tempo pra explorar os backgrounds dos personagens (alguns são muito interessantes) e a série brilharia muito mais.! 

Conclusão:
Só pra registrar, eu vejo que algumas pessoas tendem a dizer que esse anime é uma “cópia sangrenta do Madoka”. Apesar de eu concordar que este anime infelizmente vive na sombra do Madoka, eu não acho que mereça ser chamado assim. É verdade que a ideia desconstruir o estereótipo de mahou shoujo (em séries animadas pelo menos) veio alguns anos antes com o Madoka, mas Ikusei Keikaku caminha com as próprias pernas, e eu realmente acho que se a história não fosse tão prensada devido a tantos personagens pra trabalhar com tão pouco espaço, ele ganharia um espaço de mais respeito nos nossos fóruns. 

Isso conclui nosso review. Eu espero que tenha ajudado a ter uma ideia melhor sobre este anime, e que você tenha se divertido com a leitura."
115183,"I rather whimsically marked Mars Red as one of the anime that I was going to watch this Spring Season sometime last Winter and I'm rather glad that I did. It was a unique watch, had its slow moments, but also moments where it absolutely floored me visually and intellectually. I think the fusion of theater and old cinema with anime is something really interesting that makes watching Mars Red feel strange, but also incredibly exciting. I think its no secret that I'm a huge fan of visually interesting shows with philosophical themes and wacky or bizarre methods of presentation, all it takes to know this is simply taking a glance at my favorites list. Mars Red is another anime of that type, putting a unique spin on anime and creating something that won't have mainstream appeal because its not an absolute masterpiece akin to others that are equally as strange and unique, but are, in my humble opinion, some of the greatest anime of all time, Monogatari or Tatami Galaxy.

As I've mentioned already, Mars Red is beautifully presented. It's aesthetic style is simplistic, yet extraordinarily effective at conveying tone creating the mood of the scene. I could go on and on about every facet of the visuals is used to perfection, but I won't waste time on going into that much detail. One aspect I really do want to bring up though, is their use of aspect ratio to really highlight the stage play and old cinema themes. It's entirely objective, but I thought it was a really cool touch.

As far as the music and soundtrack is concerned, I don't have too much to say. I didn't really find the soundtrack memorable in many ways and the opening was fairly meh as far as openings go. However, the ending, ""On My Own"" by Hyde, is an absolute banger in storytelling, presentation, and musically. I literally never skipped it and that should be enough to certify it as a banger.

Favorite Character: Deffrot
img()
Deffrot was easily the highlight of the show as far as characterization went. His story was tragic, his connection to Misaki and Maeda, equally so, and his love for playing characters on stage to stimulate the feeling of life gave me a feeling nothing short of melancholy. He doesn't have the most relevance or screentime, but his story was among the most moving, up there with Maeda and Misaki's. In fact, Mars Red has no shortage of characters with tragic backstories, even some of the one-off characters have stories that could spin off into their own arcs, but leaving their fates, in some cases, up the imagination is powerful storytelling.

And now, what did I like about Mars Red? Aside from repeating myself about the visuals and presentation, I love the parallelism of Misaki's stage play ""Salomé"", with Maeda and Kurusu specifically. In fact, symbolism like that is one of Mars Red's strongest aspects, along with the little micro stories that play out. Suwa and Ayame's cute little plot and Takeuichi and the vampire kids most to choose my two favorites. Deffrot revealed as the storyteller of the entire anime at the end is a great detail too, explaining the theater-like presentation (which is even cooler because the show is based off a stage play). It's ""the show, don't tell"" aspect of Mars Red's storytelling that makes it such a engaging watch.

However, there's a reason that I haven't given it full marks and now is where I'll briefly bring up those issues that keep Mars Red from stepping up into the ""great show"" tier. Firstly, the inherent slowness of the plot really takes away from the overall product. Specifically, there's a set of episodes in the middle that crawl at a snail's pace. If anyone thought Mars Red was too slow in the beginning, those few episodes in the middle would seem like absolutely nothing happens. It wouldn't be far from the truth either. The pace of the plot as a whole could've been sped up a bit to keep people interested instead of bouncing from small pointless plot point to another, even if this did sacrifice a couple of the small mirco stories that I mentioned earlier. The animation is really sub average as well, which makes Mars Red a weird case of the directing being better than the animation, which feels fairly rare in anime these days. I also think that, sometimes, Mars Red took the ideology of ""show, don't tell"" to an extreme, meaning that certain moments feel really confusing, but this could also be a product of watching it weekly, with seven days and watching other shows in between eroding my focus on Mars Red's plot.

To put it simply, Mars Red is going to be more miss than hit for most viewers most likely. It's not a very widely appealing show, due to many things working in tow: its slow nature, fairly obscure theater references, abnormal presentation style, and storytelling that requires attention. For a guy who likes new takes on things, weird presentation, symbolism, and philosophical themes; Mars Red stands out, despite it's flaws. It's a tough show to recommend, really. I'd say that if what I've described appeals to you at all, give it 3 episodes or so and see if it interests you or bores you to death."
145815,"Phew. Thank god it’s over. It was like a super generic Isekai utilizing all of the typical troupes you would expect to find in a stereotypical Isekai, only it wasn’t. Main character Al-Wayne wasn’t sent blasting into another world by Trunk-kun; he was already born in the fantasy world as an authentic inhabitant of the world. Without the transportation bit into another world, it strips the series of a isekal genre despite being very Isekai-like in nature. 

The characters

Al-Wayne: As the title implies, Al is just a farmer and only wants to be a farmer despite picking up absurd amounts of power just from doing farmer-related activities. This is despite the title insisting he’s only grown a little stronger improving his farmer-related skills. He’s actually grown considerably more powerful; to the point he can throw a carrot at a dragon with the purpose of distracting it for some adventurers to fight off and end up blowing it up. The show already falls into the pitfall of making AI unstoppable from episode 1, depleting most of the tension for the rest of the series. 
Al is also completely aggravating as a character, adamantly insisting he only wants to be a farmer even after saving the princess from being kidnapped and has a far more lucrative offer of being her bodyguard presented to him. He even lets himself be nearly violated by orge-like creatures dubbed orcs despite the fact he has the power to eviscerate them quite handily.

Meigis Ys Fal – She ends up being a damsel in distress Al had to save. The least interesting of the harem members.

Helen Lean – The second entry of Al’s harem cementing the series to the trash leap pile of cliché (non)Isekai. She was a little interesting at first, starting off as the receptionist at the adventurer’s guild and giving Al her deceased brother’s old cloak (which somehow fits Al perfectly despite the fact her brother died as a kid and Al is an adult-teenager, but whatever). This enables Al to see the spirit of her deceased brother who dumps plot exposition on him, revealing he and his entire village was slaughtered by a dragon and that his sister is the sole remaining survivor that the evil dragon may want to kill just because he’s evil like that. 
This would be a decent setup for an otherwise intense and thrilling arc if Al wasn’t so egregiously overpowered. It completely vaporizes all the tension like hot-air. How the writers attempt to fix this is by nerfing Al’s power and pulling out absurd plot-twists with no forewarning. After Al unceremoniously defeats the evil dragon, it’s then revealed he had taken over Helen’s body at some point and used her to stab Al. As the audience had no breadcrumbs to piece this together, the reveal came across as jarring and forced. 
The evil dragon is ultimately defeated by the random spontaneous appearance of a godly character. Really, the only good thing to come out of this arc is that Helen got to keep a portion of the evil dragon’s powers for herself, though she does next to nothing with them so it feels ultimately pointless. 

Ruri - The final harem girl is introduced saving Al from yet another orc he really shouldn’t be having any trouble with. She would probably be the best one if she hadn’t joined Al’s tedious harem. She’s the descendant of the hero but doubts herself and doesn't believe she truly has what it takes to be a heroine. Needless to say, Al helps her overcome this and together, they defeat a powerful demon. The rest of her time was spent either helping Al or bantering with the other girls over who gets him. 

Al’s Mom – Undoubtably the second worse character in the series. Unbearably clingy to the point of nauseating creepiness. Her introduction was her basically spearing her son all across the district of her hometown before comically circling back to her house and slamming him in the wall, bear-hugging the life out of him. It’s as cringey as it sounds. She was obnoxious, even going as far as to beat up Al’s father on several occasions for daring to come between her and Al and becomes annoyingly jealous of the other girls for being with him.   

Al’s Dad – Just a loser wimp letting his wife walk all over him. 

Volpe Dorma - The worst character in the series bar none, even worse than Al's creepy mom being a pedophile. He's supposed to be the demon attendant of a little demon princess, which further decimates the already horrific writing of the series. What father in their right frame of mind, let alone a king, would task a blatant predator like Volpe Dorma with his daughter's safety when he clearly has creepy, indecent feelings toward her, from sniffing her clothes and watching her sleep and even bathe? UGH. This is so frustrating. I can't wrap my head around Japan's frankly weird obsession with the quote ""lolicon character,"" unquote. It's weird and gross.

Near the end of the series, the writers introduced Al’s supposedly deceased little sister (whom his family adopted) in a flashback for no further point other than to set up the “surprise reveal” that she had somehow been resurrected by Lord Evil God. (Sheesh. What unique names these are). Once again, the series poorly weaponizes shock-value without leaving any trail of breadcrumbs for the audience to follow along. During the flashback, Al’s parents were conveniently away while a plight occurred destroying their village and depleting their food supply. 

Given what we saw of Al’s clingy mother, I find it near impossible to believe that she would journey away from the village for any length of time and leave her precious son all by himself. She refuses to let go of him whenever he returns home for frequent visits. This inconsistency only happened to facilitate the plot. Al was stricken with illness when he read a stone tablet in a cave and in an effort to heal him, his little sister gave him all the food the village chef was sharing out and ended up starving to death.
Obviously, this couldn’t have happened with his parents around since they would’ve just upped and taken them away. The storytelling is really poor. 

The flashback does try and rationalize Al’s absurd power as Lord Evil’s doing, but we don’t have any idea why Lord Evil God would bestow him this power or why he wouldn’t remove it when Al began slaying demons and evil dragons. We see the loss of Al’s power in the last episode so it begs the question of why he never lost his power sooner. 
Ultimately, this is just a poorly written and cliché mess following all the usual troupes of an Isekai anime while not being an Isekai series without putting a clever or comical spin on them like the hilarious Uncle from Another World. It even ends rather abruptly, too. Another godly character spontaneously appears and stops time so Al can save the aforementioned demon girl from his resurrected sister. His sister just ups and leaves because the reasons, I guess, and after a brief bit where Al discovers he's lost most of his incredible power, it just ends. We don't even really learn how and why his sister was resurrected.

The series must be under the impression it's gonna get a season 2 to flesh this out but with how badly season 1 turned out, it clearly doesn't deserve it. I, for, one wouldn't watch it if it did get a season 2. Season 1 barely held my interest as it was. 

Score - Coupled with an uninspiring ost and you have yourself a recipe for bland and mediocre. It’s not dynamic during the action sequences nor is comforting or soothing during the slice of life moments. I can’t even say it’s upbeat and positive when Al begins adventuring. Even the tones of the comedic moments feels like the studio did the bare minimum. 
Animation – It’s adequate. Nothing really noticeable about it. It’s lives up to the standards of today’s artstyle.   
The only character I can say I enjoyed is the demon postman Ricks and only because he reminds of the postman from the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

Final score: 0/10"

""As long as you live, tomorrow will come.""

Gunbuster is both the last relic of another era and the progenitor of an entire lineage of anime that draw from it to this day (Neon Genesis Evangelion, its own sequel Diebuster, and Gurren Lagann being just the most famous of these). It's not an anime with much company in that regard. Usually, singular works of media like this either begin a new period for their medium or bring one to a close. Gunbuster manages to do both, and in a way, actually watching the thing makes that all the more surprising, this is after all the trial-by-fire of an at the time unknown Studio Gainax (and, bless them, their forgotten collaborators at Studio Fantasia), as well as the show whose gratuitous partial nudity infamously inspired the term ""gainaxing"". 

But make no mistake; Gunbuster is an etched-in-the-tablets classic,  perhaps even more influential--if less loudly so--than its angstier nephew Neon Genesis Evangelion, and with the cynical eyes of the 21st century it can be a little hard to see why (I suspect that this may be a part of why its sequel Diebuster was made in the first place). Gunbuster begins as a mecha-themed parody of Aim For The Ace!, moves through a pastiche of The Forever War, and ends with a black and white, esoteric, theme-lead ending to rival A Space Odyssey. Not much out there covers this much tonal and narrative ground in such a short time. Yet, in what is both the OVA's greatest strength and its biggest, most glaring flaw, Gunbuster does not do much deep-delving as far as character goes. Gunbuster is a story told in broad strokes, in shadows, and in part by implication. Noriko is a rock-solid protagonist, but at the same time her actual personality is broadly-defined enough that it has inspired Shinji, Nono, and Simon The Digger, characters different enough in outlook and traits that aside from all largely coming from the same company's works, you'd be hard-pressed to find much in common between any of them. Character development (for Noriko and everyone else) is brisk, broad, and straightforward. Noriko starts out as kind of a wimp but by the end of the story is brave enough to sacrifice ever seeing anyone on Earth ever again for the sake of the human race. Her partner Kazumi starts out as cold and distant but by the end of the series is close enough to Noriko that she makes that sacrifice with her, this sort of thing.

Gunbuster is very consistent on one point though, and that is its theme, which is so blunt that it might be better described as a moral; you can't save the world without sacrifice. Over Gunbuster's three hour runtime, our heroines save the human race multiple times, and at each turn they are asked to give more, which they do. Relationships are shed like a winter coat--Noriko's best friend ages into an old woman in her absence, her first crush is a casualty, on Kazumi's side her affection with their mentor the Coach grows into a romance that she too is forced to leave behind. Both of them lose a close friend at the series' end as the (ridiculously named) character of Jung Freud makes her exit, and then finally the both of them leave all they've ever known behind, flung 12,000 years into the future by time dilation, with only each other for company. 

Hideaki Anno was not yet the mastermind behind Neon Genesis Evangelion when he directed Gunbuster, and while his touches are obvious with a closer examination, on first watch especially Gunbuster has a sort of grandiose anonymity to it. Less like something that was made and more like something that coalesced out of the memories of otaku who watched and loved reams of super robot and sentai shows throughout the 70s and 80s, but we have to be careful to not remove the artists from their art, because looked at with a more thoughtful eye the seeds of what would make Evangelion what it was were planted here in the show's darker moments, especially the second half, as the unusual-for-the-genre hard sci-fi elements set in and become a vehicle for genuine tragedy. That love is still there, but filtered through a very adult worldweariness.

But it's not just that, really. Because Gunbuster does end, in its own way, on a happy note. A bittersweet ending that is less bitter than it might first appear. Our heroes arrive back to earth, twelve thousand years after their departure, and for a moment, they are greeted with a dark ball of rock, an earth that appears lifeless. Then, just as they begin to mourn humanity, lights flip on, slowly at first and then more quickly, forming a pattern--the distorted words ""WELCOME HOMЭ""--revealing that their sacrifices haven't been for nothing.


That ray of light to puncture what would've been a truly bleak ending is what makes Gunbuster work. There were darker dusks and brighter dawns on the horizon for Studio Gainax and the hordes of successors and imitators their work would spawn, but much of it ultimately traces back here; Noriko and Kazumi, in what remains of the combined Gunbuster, being hailed as heroes by their beloved planet and knowing it was all, in a sense, worth it."
482,"Yugioh GX is a strange and confounding show. It has one of, if not the best casts in the Yugioh franchise, but it heavily underitilizes or derails most of them. It has perhaps the most likable, fleshed out, and developed protagonist in the franchise but at the cost of a lot of characters the show doesn’t know what to do with. It has some of the most conceptually interesting and narratively sound arcs in all of Yugioh, but one of them is rushed while the other has an ending that almost killed its season outright. GX has a lot of potential that finds itself capitalized on brilliantly at times, but the show is just an inconsistent mess. 

That being said, this is easily the best Yugioh anime, at least in context of the original timeline. Unlike Duel Monsters, GX doesn’t treat you like a moron while padding itself out to oblivion with characters whose existences become increasingly confounding as the show’s nonexistent sense of logic somehow takes a nosedive for the sake of establishing threats for the main protagonist to beat over. Unlike 5D’s, it wasn’t the subject of a complete shift in focus following real-life scandals, causing the entire show to devolve into a jumbled mess of bastardized characters, intentional as well as accidental retcons, and nonsensical plot-points. In spite of all of this, GX has generally been seen as inferior to both. In fact, prior to Zexal’s miserable first season and all other Yugioh series that followed, GX was seen as the black sheep of the franchise. Even after Zexal II supposedly redeemed its series and the later entries found their reputations dwindling sometime after coming out, GX has always lived in the shadow of Duel Monsters and 5D’s. Why? Outside of the initially dismal reaction to the fun cheese dub which has gained a lot of fondness in the 2010s, it’s still puzzling as to why GX is looked at as the middling step-child in the original trilogy. While getting a definitive answer may be impossible, asserting the notion that GX is perhaps the best series in a lackluster franchise by virtue of being semi-decent is something at least someone might find worth doing as we examine some of the highs and lows of this strange, erratic entry.

The first thing to dive into is the cast, which is both GX’s greatest strength and biggest weakness. Main character Judai, as well as other characters such as Manjoume and Chronos are incredibly likable and well-developed characters. That’s actually kind of the problem, though. They are pretty much the only characters that get used well on a remotely consistent basis outside of some of the ones introduced in season 3. In terms of the major characters introduced in the first half of the series, most of them find themselves largely relegated to the sidelines, or get absolutely derailed after the first season. 

A great example of the former is Asuka, who largely loses relevance in the series after her season 1 plot of trying to find her brother. She’s certainly a formidable duelist, and she even has a few instrumental wins in the first season, but by the second half of the show, she barely gets to duel anymore and only has a couple of single-episode arcs and showings. It’s telling that her only bearing on the main plots of seasons 3 and 4 amount to her essentially being assimilated around the halfway mark of those two respective seasons after dueling once...each. As for an example of the latter without touching on the broken mess of spoilers that is Kaiser, we have Daichi Misawa. Good lord in Heaven, what happened to one of the strongest characters and friendliest rivals of season 1? After being one of the few decent duelists in the first half of season one, they decided to play more into his “science” gimmick while making him a joke for the rest of the first and second seasons, culminating in his only significant on-screen duels amounting to losses and questionable forfeits as he randomly becomes insecure about being seen as weak. By season 3, he isn’t even dueling anymore, though the once friendly rival to Judai at least has his own interesting plot revolving one of the antagonists from season 1 who beat him.

There are several other characters that suffer from these bad writing decisions. Judai’s sidekick of sorts, Shou, goes from a wimpy loser struggling to prove himself in the first season to a whiny coward who picks on freshmen just because season 2 decided to be the worst. The season 2 mainstays, Edo and Tyranno, have miserable introductory seasons, as the former has an annoying revenge plot, and the latter’s on again off again bickering with Shou over who gets to be Judai’s sidepiece is perhaps the most insufferable character dynamic in the franchise. However, a lot of these characters either barely matter in the latter half anyway, or become genuinely endearing once they find their own new personality traits, character dynamics, and big moments such as Tyranno nuking an entire wave of zombie students with a meteor attack just so his friends can reach season 3’s main antagonist.

That’s the thing about GX. Whenever it knows how to develop a character well, it can produce some of the best characters in the franchise. Judai’s development is the best of any character in the series, as his fears over losing his friends to some of the more supernatural and dangerous aspects of dueling are weaponized in later seasons to great effect. He’s already a likable character at the start, with how his jovial, laid-back attitude eventually contrasts with his greatest fears. However, seeing how far the series goes to both break and reshape him while a bit flawed in some cases, is absolutely harrowing. They’re the main draw of seasons 3 and 4, as the darker tone of the series takes hold and legitimately sympathetic or at least interesting antagonists bring out the worst of Judai before he and his friends can overcome it. The show actually conveyed the messages of not giving into your greatest fears in life quite well, as those who do either give up on life, or become a more desperate, depressed, and inconsiderate version of themselves whose actions and failures haunt them at every turn.

On a less cerebral note, there’s still Manjoume and Chronos. Out of the major side characters established since the beginning, they’re the only two who don’t get derailed or underutilized. Manjoume’s eventual development from the most abrasive elitist to a somehow more AND less egotistical powerhouse clown is honestly astonishing. While they perhaps could have done a bit more with him in later seasons, the dichotomy between his egotistical and borderline tsundere clown side growing simultaneously while sandpapering his more abrasive edges is a treat. He steals the show almost every time he’s on screen throughout his entire journey. As for Chronos, him learning to be less of an elitist professor who hates all of the students on the lower rung is equally compelling. Watching him slowly go from constantly trying to expel Judai to putting his line and career on the line for his students multiple times, makes for some of the most impactful scenes of each season. His final duel with Judai makes for the best, most compelling duel in the entire series as Chronos’ arc comes to a heartwarming close. There are other entertaining characters with their own arcs and gimmicks, such as Austin O’Brien’s militant and crafty nature leading to a compelling mini-arc and some of the third season’s funniest moments, and Jim Cook’s devotion to friendship being so powerful that he legitimately has a mystical item related to it and an alligator as his partner. However, we’ll be here all day if we go over every aspect of GX’s strangely inconsistent character writing.

A cast of characters makes up the bulk of a series’ heart and soul, but the story that drives them along is similarly important...and often weak in this case The first half of the first arc is largely devoted to hilariously absurd, albeit inconsistent episodic plots, as well as a few minor character arcs. This is where a lot of the show’s charm is found, as the characters interact with the strange setting of their duel academy with hijinks ensuing. Chazz’s gloriously bizarre conquest in preparation for the mid-season finale is the best part of the first 26 episodes. The second half of that season is a rather weak “stop several bad guys from doing bad things for immortality and world domination” plot. The only interesting aspect of the arc is how Judai starts fearing the weight of the consequences that comes from losing whenever things get serious, and therefore has to learn to overcome that. There are contrivances and several odd filler episodes interpurced with the somewhat more serious arc, which makes the narrative of S1 even weaker. At least, the show goes through a beautiful transition period in the last few episodes of the season to send off some of its side characters.

The second season/arc is even more drawn-out, as the first half largely has sequences of Judai bumbling through a forest, two of his classmates bickering back and forth on who gets to be his side-piece, and several filler duel episodes of inconsistent quality. The idea of someone slowly brainwashing the students is somewhat neat, as is the idea that Edo is looking for his father’s killer. It’s just that the former is dragged out for too long, and the latter isn’t really fleshed out or interesting here. The absurd nature of how Chazz launches a counter campaign later on and how Judai and his friends combat a deadly satellite are the only things of interest this time around beyond how some of the eclectic characters from the first season’s more bonkers slice-of-life half wreck shop here as Chronos, who tried to end Judai’s education in S1, gets multiple opportunities to stick his neck out for his students and occupation.

The later seasons take on far darker storylines meant to utterly break Judai so that S4 can restore him into a more mature version of his old self. The execution of these ideas is a bit inconsistent, relying on breaking the rules of the game to defeat certain antagonists or just flat-out using lore to absolve the third season’s main antagonist of all of their atrocities because apparently it’s Judai’s fault anyway. However, some of the previously derailed or lackluster characters get significantly better portrayals with character-defining scenes, and the new cast members get their own fun arcs. Additionally, things such as Judai’s temporary downfall after throwing his friends’ lives in danger just to rescue a new person close to him, and some of the apparent character deaths are standout moments of the series. Season 4 would then expand upon these ideas with the darkness consuming all into collective consciousness plotline and how his depression and guilt over both what he put his friends through in S3 and everything that has ever transpired over the 3 years they’ve been at the duel academy. It does take a while to get there, as the show has to retroactively ruin one of the best deaths in the franchise. Despite that and how some rather important characters that would make perfect sense to feature more frequently are largely absent, this is still the best season for what it does with Judai and how thematically resonant and emotionally impactful it is. The middle episodes have some of the most resonant duels and storylines in the series with Manjoume and Chronos’s final moments of relevance.This is sadly where all relevance for most characters not named Judai come to an end, but at least some of them go out on a high note before getting sucked into the final plot of the show. The way it’s presented with the evil light from S2 being defeated and now S4 evil, uncaring darkness taking over so it can also be defeated is hokey, but there’s a lot that gets said here.

The latter half of Season 4 becomes one of the best “human instrumentality” storylines for how it showcases what it’s like for the characters trapped in misery and the collective consciousness as they’re pressured into giving in, letting their lives go once and for all as they escape into the temporal abyss to end their cycle of failure and misery. It’s allegorical suicide, and only the most damaged person is left to fight it off as he weighs off his guilt and depression thanks to his friends’s attempts to reinvigorate his passion, as well as the responsibility he knows he has to those he cares about. This is the perfect capstone to Judai’s arc, and why in spite of the somewhat iffy and inconsistent execution that makes it hard to appreciate in the moment, the plotline is perhaps the richest of the series. It’s what allows the finale to truly feel earned and impactful.

The final aspects to mention are the show’s audiovisuals. Much like Duel Monsters, the music in GX is great, albeit often overplayed in the first two seasons. Yutaka Minobe became the composer for the franchise from GX to Zexal. While this OST doesn’t have the grandiosity or sheer emotional weight of a lot of the Duel Monsters tracks done by Utena composer Shinkichi Mitsume, there are still plenty of energetic, chill, and beautiful tracks to choose from. Majoume’s theme is a somewhat mysterious yet somewhat lax piece, Fierce Attack goes harder than perhaps any track from the show, and Duelist is a personal favorite for how perfectly it encompasses the bittersweet nature of season 4. Other great tracks include Wicked Grudge, Sad Duel/Supreme King theme, Judai’s theme, and Beyond the Sorrow. Judai and Supreme King’s themes in particular are perhaps the most iconic pieces in the entire show as the former is a satisfying yet laid-back piece that’s sure to incite a mix of hype and a willingness to groove, while the latter is as fierce and downtrodden as Jaden grew to be in the third quarter of S3. The later seasons did get a ton of newer, often darker tracks more befitting of the grimmer tone, which is part of why the OST did not feel as repetitive in the show’s latter half. It’s a good thing, too, as several of these tracks are outstanding.

The lineup of OPs and EDs is perhaps the most consistent in the franchise, with the only real dud being the first OP. Personal favorites include “Teardrop” by BOWL, “Precious Time, Glory Days” by Psychic Lover, and “Endless Dream” by Hiroshi Kitadani (OP 3, OP 4, ED 4). “Teardrop” is a beautifully somber song that speaks about opening up and letting out one’s sorrows from the perspective of someone they saved and therefore are devoted to, and seem to be directed at Jaden as he goes through primarily negative development in that season. “Precious Time, Glory Days” is a lot more hopeful and energetic, aware of the sorrows that took place but still being a fun and optimistic song in spite of everything just as Jaden grew to be by the end of S4. “Endless Dream” is a beautiful and somewhat bittersweet piece that opens up with a serene sequence as Jaden sleeps on a field of grass in broad daylight. It truly conveys the bittersweet nature of the final season as everyone moves on and gives it one last go with smiles on their faces.

Lastly, the visuals are...about as mediocre as you’d expect from a Yugioh series. The franchise was never one to be sought after for sakuga or anything compared to most long-running shounen anime. This could mean that the series would focus more on detailed artwork and generally decent presentation. However, that’s not exactly the case, either. Studio Gallop returned to work on this show, and there are a few minor improvements as well as unique issues. Starting with the positives, there do seem to be more moments compared to Duel Monsters where important summons or attacks result in explosive sakuga cuts. The artwork is more consistently on-model than Duel Monsters, though oddities do still pop up here and there. While the characters are more consistently on model, there are still moments where they look particularly awkward from lower angles. The character and monster designs are often more pleasant as well, at least until the later seasons decided edgy BDSM-esque designs were the new “hip thing” for a lot of antagonist decks and boss monsters. The characters also get to have more visual interactions with the game, as field spells crumble around and affect them, and monsters get a bit more dynamic with their engagements. The early seasons in particular often look worse when characters aren’t dueling, as there are moments where character models very blatantly and awkwardly bounce around, snap, or hover from one part of the screen to the next as a substitute for animating any actual flight or walking. Any CG is thankfully limited to the occasional ugly game effect and a couple of episodes that use ugly water effects, compared to DM’s occasional grotesque CGI background. This would change forever once 5D’s rolled in, so it’s good to appreciate what’s here in Duel Monsters and GX before the franchise became CGI hell. Still, it’s hard not to say that the series fares a little better than Duel Monsters, which notoriously went through some rough patches in certain filler arcs. Both are largely still slideshows, though.

It’s sad that the best of the original YGO trilogy is a depressingly inconsistent mess. There is a lot to like about GX, such as its cast of characters, the bizarre yet lax nature of the early episodes, and the stories the later seasons told. It has perhaps the most well-written and defined protagonist in the franchise, and tells a rather important message via one of the only decent post-Eva “collective consciousness/human instrumentality” plots. However, the show largely sidelines or derails most of its otherwise stellar cast, and a lot of ideas are fumbled in the most critical moments, like the insultingly awful conclusion to season 3. For everything fascinating or great about the show, something stupid counterbalances.

Yugioh GX isn't not the easiest thing to recommend, but if you want a decent nostalgia trip, feel free to watch some of season 1 in dub form and switch to sub at your leisure until it becomes the only way to properly appreciate S3 or even watch S4. Your mileage will certainly vary with the first two seasons, but if you make it to the end, you might get a lot more out of it, emotionally and thematically, than you’d expect."
131516,"Do it Yourself!! is so unassuming that one would be inclined to come away with the initial impression that it’s not anything more than just cute girls doing cute things: the woodshop edition. And you wouldn’t necessarily be wrong; on the surface, it plays the formula in much the same way as it has been employed in countless other anime before it. Niche hobby, relaxed atmosphere, low stakes, the whole nine yards(tick). Why should anyone walk into a show like this and expect something different, or different enough that it would become one of the more-pleasing anime of the season?

Even if someone was willing to take a chance on it, goodness knows that the show also had its own uphill battle to climb. Fall 2022 was, to put it in one term, top-heavy. Between the highly-anticipated juggernaut Chainsaw Man and desired sequels Bleach: The Thousand-Year War, Mob Psycho 100 III, and Spy x Family Part 2, a show like Do It Yourself!! stood no chance of etching itself onto the landscape at-large. Even when Bocchi the Rock! managed to do it, that was an unexpected dark horse. A happy one to be sure, but an exception nevertheless. Do it Yourself!! thus seemed condemned to be lost in their wake, suppressed by the sheer extent of their mark.

But that reality, in truth, is why the show managed to succeed so well. Whereas other shows announced their presence with boisterous explosiveness or an unexpected comedic jolt to the senses, Do it Yourself!! started more gradually. When we’re introduced to the anime’s world, its aesthetic is markedly cutesier and more juvenile. That is not an insult in this case; rather, it’s a perfect visual sign that the show will kick back its feet and let simplicity take the reins. The aesthetic of the show, when it’s not adopting its musically jazzy time in montage or its delightfully-catchy OP, feels fresh out of a children’s coloring book – the color palette employed is simple, but it propelled by its splashes of beautiful lighting and animations. It is not the type of animation that will be immortalized forever, but the level of care gives its simplicity more verve and spunk.

Serufu is likewise a charmingly-simple protagonist, klutzy and always seemingly with her head in the clouds rather than her feet on the ground. There’s a disarming appeal in how she always takes misfortune on the chin (sometimes literally given how often she’s covered in Band-Aids), allowing herself to be impressed by others around her or have her friend Purin’s insults bounce off her like rubber, much to Purin’s consternation. She coasts on by, often right into a telephone poll. She meets Rei, the senpai of the show, who introduces her to the world of DIY crafts after helping fix Serufu’s bike, and one clever little pokingly-fun pun later, the show sets itself into proper motion. Coming to stop by the club include the shy-but-capable Takumi, the self-confident and obscenely-rich Juliet Queen Elizabeth VIII (which, yes, that is her name, and it is glorious), and the energetic and ninja-like Shii, all while Serufu’s old friend Purin watches the oddball group from afar.

“Oddball” not only defines the group as a whole, but it similarly characterizes the humor. Do it Yourself!! does not rely nearly so heavily on setups and punchlines; if anything, the way I described the pun earlier as “pokingly-fun” is the most-appropriate descriptor. Given the sometimes-weird nature of the characters, both individually and as a group, any time is prime time for a little barb, a little cutoff, or a little moment for someone to be temporarily fascinated with someone else. Scenes therefore have a little spark that allows comedy to come from any direction and from essentially anyone. They have their moment arise naturally out of the dialogue and dynamic, then gradually fade away into the background. So when Shii scampers up a tree like Spider-Man or Rei and Takumi obsess over a mutual love of manga, the scene carries on seamlessly when the moment is done like no pause had occurred. 

webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/8f728d3eabe5efd048de9c4363fea546.mp4)

But when it decides to pause, it works well! DIY is not just a little framework to make the show fit into some kind of mold. Do it Yourself!! wisely takes the time to let us know how exactly the various goods and crafts are made, which is more than can be said for other shows around niche hobbies in its genre. I’ll confess upfront that I have never been blessed with good hands for DIY. I am not a woodworker, handyman, or anything closely resembling that nature; putting together a chair this past summer was more hassle than I’d like to admit. Not all of the crafts are immediately feasible—I wouldn’t know where to get my hands on a decent UV light for hardening gels—yet I didn’t care. The show treats its audience like it treats Serufu, a newcomer to this type of craft that might need help knowing what to do and when to do it. The show, in essence, takes it upon itself to be the teacher. I cannot say that I remember how to make everything the show demonstrated, but I enjoyed seeing the process at work and play out into finished objects.

The care in showing the crafts be made step by step is not the only way the show shows its cohesiveness. It’s made clear throughout the narrative that the club members are not just a hodgepodge of girls hanging out together and doing whatever is in the anime’s name. Rather, they are and actually function like a team, actively seeking to help one another when something either goes wrong or needs to be worked on. Especially as the increasingly-apparent competence of the other DIY Club members makes its presence known, Serufu is notably left behind. Jobko, Rei, and Shii are all good with their hands, but even early on, newcomer Takumi works to create the colorful mosaic to hang outside the school’s clubhouse. Serufu bumbles about trying to do something as plain as work an electronic screwdriver correctly. This does beg the question of why let the narrative focus so much on Serufu.

The show, fantastically, has an answer. Serufu is a walking accident waiting to happen—put the hammer down, Serufu!—but her contributions to the club are not limited to simply making things. I remarked before that one trait to describe her was “disarming,” which each character at various points in the story comes to experience for themselves in her wake. Even when the show operates under the veneer of giving the other characters their time in the sun, Serufu is always right beside them, encouraging them with unapologetic, sincere positivity and getting them to admit or realize something about being in the club that they might not have either understood or wanted to admit, or perhaps even wanted to try. 

To put it in terms the show would use, if the other club members are the tools in the shop (the saw, the screw, the hammer, and the straight-edge), Serufu is the superglue that keeps it all together. Serufu’s usefulness to the story is only insubstantial if one limits their understanding of the DIY Club and DIY as a whole to the things that are made and how finely-polished they are. If Serufu were out of the picture, it’s fair to say that everyone’s lives would have been a lot lonelier. Because she’s so enthused, there’s a mutual admiration that is collectively shared among everyone in a way that comes across as so earnest and sweet that it makes the mundanity meaningful. Serufu’s handiness comes not in the house for Meat—it makes sense in context, I promise—nor the charms they make. Her handiness is in talking with Purin on the boat, cute nicknames, always trying to make new friends, and letting the good times roll. The DIY Club, with all its members smiling and enjoying themselves, is her masterpiece. It may have been forged from incongruous parts with the instruction manual thrown into a paper shredder (after getting jammed first because, let’s be real for a minute, it would happen if Serufu did it), but hold their form they do.

Do it Yourself!! never could have wrestled with the larger monoliths that the season had, but it didn’t need to. What the show did was adopt something plain with just enough of the right blend of sugar, spice, and everything nice. It needed no high-fantasy; it just needed a saw. It needed no bloody splashes; it just needed a lot of Band-Aids. In setting itself apart from everything surrounding it, it carved its own cozy little corner handicraft in my anime season, and whether one wants to observe from a distance to see the overall shape or get in close to see the times Serufu accidentally screwed in something incorrectly, it was wholly its own.

In that sense, the show “did it itself,” which is so beautifully poetic in its own way.

97903,"Sakura Quest is an interesting series in how it approaches small town life and passion. It's focus being on revitalizing a small town in the middle of nowhere, while keeping its townspeople happy and not taking away the things they love about Manoyama. I'll be talking about a few spoilers. 

The characters do a really great job of exploring my favorite theme of the series, passion. Each character has something they are passionate about whether it's Maki with acting or Shiori's love for her hometown of Manoyama. The exception to this is Yoshino who doesn't have a passion at the beginning of the series and is resistant to her job at the tourism board, but over time she grows to love her job and finds a new passion in town revitalization. 

Despite the passion they have for these things they fail often or entirely give up on their passions. Which is the case for Maki. She returns to her hometown after not making it as an actress and has to rediscover her passion for it, or find a new reason to be passionate about it. As she shows failure is painful. It's frustrating to do your best and not be able to make it. To feel like everyone and everything is against you. It's hard to want to keep going and easy to give up. I struggle with these feelings as well, and often feel that I'm wasting my time or that everyone else is better than I am which makes me want to quit. Maki embodies these feelings but her arc also gives me reason to push forward. If I lose sight of why I'm doing these things I should take a step back and rediscover those passions. 

Manayoma is a beautiful town to look at. It's natural feeling and lake make it really pretty. It's also a great setting for this type of story as it feels like it has a personality itself thanks to its local traditions and Chupakabura Kingdom. At a certain point the lake gets drained and an old festival is rediscovered and brought back as a part of the town. The town itself has it's own history and forgotten passions that get rediscovered throughout the series. As someone who grew up in a small town I can understand and appreciate how the characters view it as well as appreciate its natural beauty. 

Music wise it's OST is fantastic and I listen to a handful of songs a lot on my own time. Particularly the first OP, both EDs, and the song Thyme. The full OST is really great though and it fits the series exceptionally well. 

Sakura Quest is one of my favorite shows because of how it portrays passion, failure, and small town life. It really resonates with me and it's a series I'm happy to have experienced. However, I'm hesitant to recommend it because it's a very niche appeal. If anything I've mentioned seems interesting it's worth a look."
1690,"Bokurano is a show that nobody seems to have heard off. I think its one of he most underrated animes ever. The entire anime revolves around tragedy and thus its not possible to make a review that doesn't spoil everything. Hell telling you what happens in the fist episode will spoil stuff so I have to be as cryptic as possible.

The story is about a group of 15 children/teens who follow their friend down into a cave where a stranger who asks them to play his ""game??"" where they have to pilot a giant robot one by one to defeat a ""monster?"". Is it only a game? Who or what are those enemies they need to defeat? Why can the whole world view their battle? 

If there is one emotion that describes what you feel watching this anime,its despair. Its worse than what puella magi ever made me feel. Being chosen to pilot the robot ""Zearth"" is no gift,its a curse. But they have no choice but to get in as they learn what not doing so would mean when they learn what they are really fighting for. You can watch as our characters slowly get broken mentally and emotionally and how they find the resolve to step into the machine.

Considering the show is supposed to be about fighting robots, its art and fight scenes are nothing to look at. It's honestly quite poor if you compare it to the other anime that came out in the same year. But thats not why you watch bokurano. Its the story and characters,who will make you really feel like you're rooting for them till the end. The show also has one of the most unlikeable villain in any anime I've seen.

The opening of this show deserves special mention as I've never skipped it once. The music is hauntingly beautiful and it brings out the best of the show.Truly despicable.

!You probably won't get a satisfactory answer in the end as to how and why the events in the anime are orchestrated and the explanation might leave you with just as many unanswered questions regarding the ""masterminds"". Who are they? why do they look like that? Why is the metric worth of a universe determined by the victor of a robot battle? Why are the pilots chosen unwillingly? The number of universes is supposed to be infinite......and infinity divided by any finite number is still infinity.......therefore after the culling process there would still be an infinite number of universes therefore achieving nothing.Therefore all I can conclude is that it was done for entertainment and the masterminds are just assholes. ! But in my opinion it's no reason to not watch the show."
139311,"This is a spoiler-free two-part review for a two-part movie. You are reading the review for: ""Red""

Intro

To Me, The One Who Loved You (Red Background), also known as ""Kimi Ai,"" and To Every You I’ve Loved Before ([Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152) background), also known as ""Boku Ai,"" are a pair of films that can be watched in any order. For convenience, I will refer to them as ""Red"" and ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)"" respectively throughout this review. The following review will be kept spoiler-free, but if you're seeking quick recommendations, it is suggested to start with ""Red"" and then proceed to ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)"" in the same viewing session.

The Good

Let's cut to the chase - ""Red"" serves one essential purpose, which is to provide crucial exposition for ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)."" As both films possess a slight sci-fi element, ""Red"" effectively sets the stage by offering the necessary background without actually being a part of ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)."" It's akin to the popular meme that says, ""My hands look like this, so hers can look like that."" The way ""Red"" and ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)"" tie together is actually quite cool, but I'll leave the details in my review for ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152).""

If I were to give pity points, I appreciate the limited number of side characters considering the ambitious nature of the two films. By focusing on the individuals who truly matter, it becomes easier to keep track of what's significant.

The Bad

Just as the color red is often associated with something amiss, ""Red"" unfortunately falters in nearly every aspect. Let's start with the abysmal voice acting, which feels as though the director instructed the actors to speak like robots. This is particularly puzzling since the male lead character, who reportedly shares the same voice actor in both films, doesn't speak with such lifelessness in ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)."" Even during pivotal moments where emotions should run high, the characters barely raise their voices by 30%, failing to convey the necessary depth of feeling. While it could have been an intentional decision to differentiate the two films, it was ultimately a poor one. Furthermore, the female lead also speaks in the same monotonous manner.

If enduring two lifeless characters engaged in dull, heavy dialogue wasn't enough, the absence of a compelling soundtrack exacerbates the issue. I kid you not, the first 30 minutes of the film consist of NPC interactions against near-complete silence. While we often take sound design for granted, it becomes painfully apparent when you sit through ten minutes of dialogue without any accompanying music. By the time I reached the one-hour mark, it felt as though two hours had already elapsed.

At this juncture, it's difficult not to delve into a rant. The characters lacked depth, the plot failed to captivate, and meaningful themes were sorely absent. Despite being advertised as a standalone movie, ""Red"" stands as one of the worst films I've encountered recently when viewed independently. Disregard everything you've heard – ""Red"" cannot be watched on its own. It merely serves as a setup for ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152),"" but does so in a remarkably disappointing fashion.

Conclusion

Unfortunately, ""Red"" falls short in various aspects, including lackluster voice acting, a glaring absence of a compelling soundtrack, and uninteresting characters and plot. While it serves as an exposition dump for its counterpart, ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152),"" it fails to stand on its own as a satisfying standalone film. Its reliance on ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)"" undermines its individual merit, making it a disappointing watch.

However, it is highly worth recommending the combined viewing experience of both films. Despite the flaws, the clever overlapping of the two plots adds an intriguing layer to the story. The true enjoyment of ""Red"" and ""[Blue](https://anilist.co/review/21152)"" lies not in their individual entertainment value, but in piecing together the puzzle they create when watched together."

It's bizarre to think that so many of us collectively had our bustling lives come to a screeching halt within the walls of our homes. Waiting out the COVID-storm, it's all too easy to feel bored and boxed-in with your thoughts. There are certainly worse problems to have, but this is a problem nonetheless. I, like many others, have picked up hobbies to stay preoccupied and sane. What you're reading right now is a product of one of those hobbies, and I'm happy you're giving this article the time of day! There's something comforting involved in pursuing your passions, and an oft-ignored joy to be had in the small day-to-day victories. Super Cub (Cub for short) is a timely reminder of that very same happiness, and how our interests can bring color into our lives.

No family, no cash, no ambitions. She doesn't even appear to feel blue about the way things are; a few tears would at least add color to her monochrome life. The still mundanity of Hokuto City is made evident in Cub's quaint opening minutes, drawing us into a world the way Koguma sees it - devoid of color. By happenstance she meets a used Honda Super Cub, which (literally) brings vibrance to her vision and a longing like no other. Much of the show is then centered around Koguma's day-to-day experiences with her Super Cub. She's not on the open road alone though, and is soon accompanied by the strong-willed motorcycle enthusiast Reiko. Also droppin' in towards the end of the season is Shii, newly-avid cyclist and aficionado of all things Italy.

Someone could feasibly make a drinking game out of everytime a character says ""This Cub can do anything."" It's certainly not the first time a company tie-in was this obvious; Cub even goes as far as to reference [Initial D](https://anilist.co/anime/185/Initial-D/) with the urban myth surrounding Koguma's ride. But even if this is a case of selling out, there are certainly far worse ways going about it. Honda Motor Company reportedly supervised the writing behind Cub, ensuring consistent and realistic details that go beyond close-ups on the featured motorcycles. Speaking of mechanical eye-candy, this series is a visual treat. Pulling back the camera lens from the show's motorbike chassis, Cub looks as stunning from afar as it does up close, with scenic visuals of Mount Fuji and the surrounding countryside. Also neat is the show's visuals as they relate to Koguma's perspective. Cub transitions between washed-out, near-grayscale scenes to radiant, saturated colors. The whole show acting as a mood light for Koguma is a trick that thankfully never gets old. The series' OST is a mix of classical compositions and a handful of original tracks, all of which contribute to Cub soothing atmosphere. The cast of characters don't work against this calming background with over-the-top performances, but complement Cub nicely. Performances are lowkey and avoid ""moe -blob"" generalizations, all while standing out with their own enjoyable personalities. All-in-all, the world of Cub is as wholesome and relaxing as this season is gonna get. You could say that Cub is yet another case of a Cute Girls Doing Cute Things (CGDCT) anime about a niche topic, and I'd be inclined to agree. However, that take doesn't fully account for what this series aims to achieve. This chill watch isn't afraid to introduce momentary tonal shifts, as seen in an unexpected adventure throughout Episode 5 and a solemn incident in Episode 11. These engaging deviations to the formula are enjoyable in their own right and paint a clearer picture of what Cub is trying to convey: the healing power of hobbies.

This isn't the kind of show concerned with love triangles or girls running to school with toast in their mouths. Instead, this iyashikei has its sole focus on leaving viewers with a ""healing feeling"" every episode. To achieve this, Cub draws us in with its effective episodic story structure. Each instalment establishes clear needs, and patiently shows us the process undertaken to achieve those goals. Obstacles introduced are resolved by the end of each episode, and the audience winds up sharing the same satisfaction that our characters do. I know that this observation is hardly revelatory; set-up and payoff is the most basic writing concept there is. But Cub is noteworthy for how stripped-down its methodology is. With little else to distract us, we offer our undivided attention to the low-key lives of Cub's cast, and are rewarded with a cozy reprieve. The characters' love for the open road (and Italian espressos) is all there is, and those personal passions exude strongly due to the depth at which those interests are explored. A 50cc in the picturesque Yamanashi Prefecture isn't merely a mode of transportation, but a lifestyle. As high school girls, there is recreational value to be had in cruising down the highway, as the scenic views of Mount Fuji loom in the distance. Of course, there are considerations as well, which Koguma and her friends need to address in order to continually enjoy their leisurely drives. Plotlines see the girls getting comfortable with their Super Cubs, obsessing over Cub trivia, learning bike upkeep, purchasing affordable accessories, taking on odd jobs involving their motorcycles, and finding ways to stay warm while riding in winter months. I think Cub captures common bike-centric plights and scenarios with a great deal of accuracy. And biking fans seem to agree, judging from [third-party accounts from communities far more familiar with biking than I am](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/honda-super-cub-anime-captures-reality-riding/) (we likely have Honda Co. Ltd. to thank for this.) Just like how last year's [Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!](https://anilist.co/anime/109298/Eizouken-ni-wa-Te-wo-Dasu-na/) was a passionate love letter to the process behind animation, Cub wears its heart on its sleeve and makes its love for biking known. Cub's attention to detail, and the unflinching trust in said detail to carry the show, leads us audience members to enjoy an otherwise unfamiliar interest alongside our girls. Even though most viewers can't tell the difference between a Super Cub and a Vespa, the dedication put into demonstrating these girls' hobbies still strikes a chord. Koguma, Reiko and Shii may share vastly different experiences from ours, but the roots of their passions are universal. The desire to achieve a goal, and overtaking the objectives that make such a reward even more worthwhile on a personal level. It's cathartic to see those desires realized, and Cub emulates that joy with each week. And sure, tasks like changing motor oil or delivering documents are tiny and unremarkable from a distance, but it is Something. And that means all the world to The Girl With Nothing.

It's the kind of quiet, meditative watch that I almost exclusively put on before bed. The calming nature of the show might put you to sleep in the worst way. Half of Cub's character development amounts to our stoic MC eventually picking up sarcasm. There's nothing all that interesting about window shopping with Koguma at hardware stores, and it's not the sort of storytelling all audiences would appreciate. My snobby ass might claim that the sophisticated Cub isn't bound by story conventions of a heightened reality, but others would probably say that it's ""boring."" Something like [Yuru Camp](https://anilist.co/anime/98444/Yuru-Camp/) achieves relatively similar things as Cub , while adding a light-hearted comedic presence and entertaining character dynamics. In spite of these elements, Yuru is sometimes dismissed as a boring CGDCT, and Cub manages to be even more stripped-down. There's little Cub does to convince audiences that aren't already fond of SoLs or the iyashikei genre, and I can't sugarcoat the show to argue otherwise. If you happen to enjoy works such as [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/Mushishi/) and [Aria](https://anilist.co/anime/477/ARIA-The-ANIMATION/) , Cub should certainly be high up on your planning list. But if you are foreign to the meditative realm of iyashikei anime, I recommend that you try out at least the first two episodes of Cub. At worst, it's hardly an insulting loss of your time; at best, you just might stumble across some of the most immaculate vibes in anime this year.



Before wrapping up, I'd like to leave you with some sappy closing thoughts. It's been over a year since I began sharing reviews, and I've enjoyed (nearly) every second of it. Writing started out as a fun way to kill time, and I gradually grew to enjoy articulating my thoughts and experimenting with my craft. Sharing my rants has not only been a rewarding experience in its own right, but also a process that helped me open up to the anime community. I didn't exactly have IRL pals keeping me company during the ongoing hyperbolic apocalypse. Making these reviews emboldened me to put myself out there.  Being inside my home over the past year, I found social circles online that kept my life as lively and fun as it's ever been. Amidst the virus, this hobby healed me. If you haven't already, I urge you to find wholesome endeavors of your own, and share those interests with others around you. It may seem awkward, but there's no shame in trying to enrich your life with activities you enjoy. And heck, if your passion is watching anime, Cub is certainly a great place to start.

Super Cub demonstrates how personal fixations can fix us. Besides the frequent bike trivia persistent throughout the series, Cub takes its time to revel in the joy of pursuing hobbies. Set to a calming soundtrack and stunning backdrops of the Yamanashi countryside, Cub puts us in the driver's seat through relaxing immersion. Viewers without motorcycles need not be worried about doing their homework before approaching this show, as the chill vibes and enjoyment is for everyone. So strap in, sit back and enjoy what this open road has to offer. 7/10




- Just wanna quickly shout out @azumiii's [thread of all the classical compositions used in Cub](https://anilist.co/forum/thread/32125). The tracks were really calming, so if you're feeling bored of Lo-Fi radio playlists on YouTube, try giving these songs a shot!

- Koguma's bike has a kill count, it's practically Devil Z lol. Be scared:

- Didn't get to cover this in the review, but seeing Shii's cafe was pretty darn surreal by Cub standards. The show turned into a lesson in interior design for a good 5 minutes, I love it. The blend of all that European iconography, in a country known for being isolationist- 'kay, that's enough musing. I want a German sourdough sandwich.

- Was definitely not expecting to go from ""purposely taking the wrong turn on the intersection"" to ""scaling Mount FRIGGIN' Fuji on a scooter"" by the 5th episode. What a ride.

178533,"Pros:
The Ranma 1/2 remake anime not only brings the anime up to modern standards but also improves upon the original in almost every way. Starting with the most obvious difference which is the quality of the animation. The animation of the original show was great at the time and still holds up well today, but if you compare it with the new one the difference is night and day. The new animation style has loads of flair and style and feels dynamic. It transitions to a more unique art style during some fight scenes which helps them stand out more. I especially enjoyed the way the animation was used to highlight jokes. Whether it was the expressions of the characters or a pause at the right time, it made the show quite a bit funnier than the original and I found myself laughing out loud every couple of episodes. You can also feel the higher budget with the new show due to changes that weren't strictly necessary but greatly appreciated. Such as the opening and ending being updated to match !Akane's new hairstyle! and each episode having a unique recap of the premise of the show compared to the one that the original show had.

The voice acting is also stellar. At first, I had to get used to the new VAs after being used to the old ones for so long, but that only took 2-3 episodes as the new cast feels very natural in their roles. This combined with the updated script made jokes land better as well. Especially when it was something that I wasn't expecting the characters to say. On top of the regular voice acting specific jokes used filters or a widely different vocal range, to make the voice stand out more and make the joke funnier than it would otherwise be.

But the highlight of the remake for me is the new scenes they added. The new scenes expand on the relationships between the characters and it gives them more depth. These are especially used for Ranma's and Akane's relationship and are used to highlight how they do care for each other and also love each other to some degree as well. The old anime always backpedalled their development due to the large amount of filler in that show, so it's nice to see how the new anime sticks closer to the manga and strengthens their relationship instead. I'm very interested to see how later arcs will be adapted and improved upon.

Neutral:
The only part where the remake anime stumbles a bit compared to the original is the soundtrack. The soundtrack isn't quite as memorable, although to be fair the old soundtrack only had a couple of memorable tracks as well. The real problem I have with the soundtrack is that it's underutilized. Some scenes would've been more impactful if sad music was playing in the background, but instead, it was just silence. When the anime did decide to use sad music, however, it worked excellently to set the right mood for the scene. Despite the inconsistent use of the soundtrack, the opening and ending themes are just as good as ever. Especially Anta Nante which is the ending theme, is presented very thematically, which makes it easier to connect to it."

First impressions, so when I was first getting into anime this was probably one of the first v.n romance, harem shows I ever watched. So I didn't really know what to expect. and for most part it was all right for what was.




Story,6/10

So the premise of shuffle is pretty much about are bland main character who lives in a world where demons and Gods live peacefully with humanity. So while going to his school where Gods,demons,humans go together. He is given the opportunity of a life time to ether become the king of the gods or king of the demons by marrying one of of the princess who of course likes him because they meet him when they where children.

So from this you can tell it's going to be one of those happy if it's not broke don't fix it kind of harem plots where very thing is pretty idealistic and very thing is peachy as all hell.
So some of you are Probably thinking to yourself what's the point of watching this if everything is so happy go lucky. Dose that mean there is probably not going to be any drama to it and it's going to be a waste of time for someone like me that likes there rom-com's to be a bit more serious . Well if you said that to yourself then I have good news this is exactly what your are looking for if Your looking for something that takes itself seriously enough.
Now you're probably thinking how can this be if everything is happy and idealistic you must be trolling bio gundam please explain why you are saying theses thing.
Oh ok will.

So shuffle for the first half plays out like a generic v.n rom-com harem school life.
We have the Male lead who is bland as fuck who convent starts getting a few girls that of course like Him and they go on all the usual slice of life, harem bullshit.
Like going on a few dates, going to beach together with his not harem group, doing school thing with them, and last and not lease the ""not""on purpose fan service.
Sore zzzzzzz sore sore zzzzzzzzzzz sore zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sore zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
Bio Gundam you were trolling this isn't serious at all reported the mods need to know about this.
Wait wait you didn't let me finish, oh sorry there. 
So the first part is pretty much sore city because if you have seen enough of v.n anime you will pretty much find this exact same plot beet for this.

But where the story starts getting better from the point of v.n rom-com harem school life standards.

Is the second half which starts getting a lot more serious.
Because we get some much needed back story which explains why there girls like him and some drama about the harem girls.
For example one of them become very sick and almost to the point of death.
Another one being that one of the girls has a mental breakdown because of choices that the main character made.

Which helps make the main character realizes that he can't just have his cake and eat it to. That choices he makes has actual consequences and he has to fix them himself.
Which adds a sense of realism that I believe that this series shares with the more realistic comparably speaking show school days that is willing to acknowledge the fact that when you try to have your cake and eat it to there is going to be consequences. 
Of course shuffle never took as far as school days did.
But it's took itself seriously enough that you could take everything as serious.

Now the ending is petty much the most disappointing part of it because the girl he chosen is sick and is going to die if they don't do something. so the protagonist saves her and then the girls act like nothing happened like for example one of them saying the he has chosen a girlfriend but not a bride so we still have a chance.

And I like Oh shit it's going to restart all over again fuck.

Another problem that this story has is that by today's standard it's very dated and also story telling like this pretty much helped kick start the decline of anime.
So dated is my biggest problem with it.
But it is well paced for a v.n. And it is probably one the better presented v.n anime.



Characters, 6/10

The main character is pretty much your by the book v.n protagonist.
Who just happens to have life served to him on a plate literally.
His personality can be summarized in about on sentence
He is pretty much the nice guy and nothing else.
But one thing I have to give him credit on is that he makes the choice of what he is in love with. And also him realizing that he can't take these girls for granted. So he stands out a bit for just that.

The side characters are pretty much one note.

Except some of the harem girls because all of them I have an ok back story which dose add some depth to them.
Also when you see these back stories in detail you can kind of understand why they would like the main character

For an example One of the harem girls who he lives with pretty much does everything for him and at the start your probity thinking why is she like this. She probably there for waifu bait.
But when you see her back story it's makes a lot more sense why she does this. Because of a certain event that the Main character took the blame for And she treated him like trash for most of his life because of the event that he took the blame for. But after finding out the truth which the Main character was hiding for her own good she starts doing everything in her power to make the main character happy Because she feels guilty for all the bullshit she put him though. And I am like damn this is an actual good reason for doing this shit.



Art,6/10

The animation was pretty average at best. Even buy the standards of the year it came out.

The style is pretty much the generic Style number 452282222929 that has been used countless times.

The characters designs are pretty much generic v.n novel designs with fantasy flavoring to make it look different. 

The colors for this anime are pretty much bright which fits with the tone of the show.

Sound, 6/10

Op and ending was pretty nice to listen to.
It not sound take worthy but it was quite a nice listen.
So worth checking out. 

The ost for me was pretty forgettable.

So if you're into getting ost then you will probably not find anything else of interest here.


Enjoyment, 6/10

Now even though shuffle is generic as all hell.
With all the bland storytelling that has been milked to death in recent years.

But what I really enjoyed about it that for the most part took itself seriously.

And it had a conclusion to its romance.

Which most story's like this don't have.


Overall,6/10

So overall if you like v.n,harem,school life that take themselves a little seriously then shuffle is what you are looking for.

But If you have seen enough of stories like this then you will it pretty generic and dated.
And probably overall not worth your time."
100500,"Kakuriyo is about a young college student named Aoi who has the ability to see ayakashi (also known as yōkai; Japanese supernatural beings) just like her grandfather. Shortly following her grandfather’s death, an Oni demon appears before her at a local shrine and whisks her away to the realm of ayakashi. Upon arriving, he tells her that she must marry him in order to pay off her grandfather’s outrageous one-hundred-million-yen debt as per the contract the two individuals signed many years ago. Appalled by such a notion, Aoi refuses and offers instead to work in the ayakashi realm so that she can pay off the debt through hard work. A few plot steps later, she becomes a cook at the local inn owned by the Oni demon.

Psychology relates to the emotional and mental state of a person. It can centre on many different things pertaining to internal characterisations. Some examples of this include insecurities and fears. These are two internal things that many people struggle with to some degree or another, and they impact the decisions that people make externally. For example, if I’m afraid of death, there is a very good chance I will avoid hospitals and any situation that will make me face my own mortality. Another example: if I’m lonely and far away from home, I will more than likely gravitate towards things that remind of the things that I am missing, such as Indian curries (my mom makes phenomenal curry). If we think about psychology in this sense and how food can be a major cursor in our mental associations with emotions, we have the substance of what makes Kakuriyo so great.
Kakuriyo can be wholly unsuspecting, particularly with the beginning episodes, as they are quite humdrum to say the least. Nevertheless, in the first half of Kakuriyo, we learn a lot about Aoi and her upbringing. She was abandoned as a child and her grandfather raised her. Because they shared this connection via ayakashi, he also taught her to cook and helped her comprehend that most ayakashi can be peaceful beings, especially when good food is involved. Since their palettes tend to be more sensitive to a different sort of flavour style, he also taught her how to cook according to their tastes. After she gets situated in the inn, these seemingly irrelevant gastronomical lessons end up paying off in wonderful ways, both for Aoi and the inn’s business.

This was extremely contemplative to me. I learned how to cook traditional Indian food from both my mother and my grandmother. These two women have complementary cooking styles, yet they also have enough differences to those styles that set them apart. They are/were brilliant cooks (my grandmother passed many years ago). Thinking about their methods and the time I spent learning from them and listening to their explanations while watching this anime, I started to appreciate that it was more about traditions, both familial and cultural, rather than the food itself. It was also about family togetherness and learning to be compassionate and giving. For my family, going hungry is a sign of sadness and bad fortune (literally and metaphorically). Additionally, so many of our cultural practises revolve around unique meals and meal preparation methods. I saw these same themes in Kakuriyo with each new mini-arc.

The anime is pretty episodic for the most part. The overarching premise of Aoi paying back her debt does hang in the air and is referensed here and there, however, each episode or two focuses on her interactions with a specific set of characters or situations and how she goes about in resolving the issues presented therein. In this way, it creates a casual and kick-back atmosphere. This will appeal to some watchers and not to others. For me, as long as its done in a way that isn’t outrageously unbelievable or obnoxiously offensive, I can find ways to enjoy myself with it. Another thing this episodic quality allows for is that it concentrates on a specific sets of emotions associated with the people and the dishes that are shared, examining the psychological power that food has on people.

Ritsuko is a human woman who is married to a member of the ayakashi royal family. She left the human realm behind a long time ago and chose to live her life quite distantly from all that she knew. In her story, Aoi cooks up food celebrating a special event and the meal she makes for Ritsuko and her husband are very similar to the dishes that the woman ate many years ago living in the human realm. The feelings that are evoked and drawn upon here consist of nostalgia, homeliness, a sense of longing, and bittersweet joy that comes from recalling beautiful memories. How many of you can recall a meal or a dish from when you were younger that reminds you of something precious or sentimental? For me, it’s my grandmother’s small squared fried potatoes cooked with gharam masala. I’d visit her every weekend and my grandma would feed this to me for lunch with homemade roti (Indian tortilla).

 Ritsuko 01 Ritsuko 02 Another character we have is Ginji. We encounter Ginji relatively quickly in the beginning. He is a nine-tailed fox ayakashi who helped Aoi when she was much younger and is part of the main cast to an extent. One of the things that I love about Ginji is his eagerness to help other people and his passion for cooking. There are quite a few sporadically placed episodes that revolve around Ginji and each one is about compassion, empathy, and trust in various levels. One episode even follows along his history of anguish and loss, which further highlights his capacity to identify with another person’s suffering. Food for him isn’t about just having a good meal but it’s about providing comfort to the less fortunate, whether that entails dealing with grief or being unable to feed yourself due to dire circumstances. In Islam, we have a holiday dedicated entirely to giving meals to needy people and Ginji’s episodes reminded me a lot about those practises.
 Ginji Kakuriyo Eps. 01 f The last character I want to discuss is someone I’m going to refer to as Unnamed to avoid spoilers. Unnamed’s story was probably the one that I felt the most kindred of connections to. They were abandoned a long time ago and they are feared because of how unique they are and what they represent in the ayakashi realm. Because they were left and forgotten, their emotions are strong and intense, pertaining specifically to fear, sadness, and loneliness. When Aoi makes a meal for them, other familiar faces that sprout up through the series are come along and it creates this stunning portrait of a nurturing environment; of how monumental it can be to someone who’s lonely to feel accepted and loved. Friendships are taken for granted everyday in one way or another and I love that this story fixates on the importance of appreciating the little moments you have with people who can make you feel meaningful and less alone in the world. Even the food that is cooked are flavours that encompass umami, or a savouriness, that makes you want to take it in and make it last as long as possible (my favourite food flavours ever).

All in all, as a food lover, and as someone who is addicted to narratives about interpersonal interactions and relationships, and also as an individual with the greatest appreciation and admiration for classical, traditional Japanese aesthetics—including food, attire, music, and history—I highly recommend Kakuriyo -Bed & Breakfast for Spirits- to anyone that is in the market for a feel-good series that will constantly make your mouth water.

170890,"Anime Review: The New Gate

Story
Alright so , this anime is basically another VR death game story, but with a predictable outcome. The main character , Shinya, solos the final boss by himself as if he was swiss cheese, and instead of him being logged out of the game world like everyone else, he gets thrown into the future by a door, like, hundreds of years later in the game world. It’s sort of  like SAO but without the part where they actually explore the whole if you die in the game, you die n real life  shit. It’s just  there as a setup, and then they forget about it once he gets isekai’d for the ""second"" time If you count being trapped in a fantasy game as an isekai. Instead of any real struggle, the show just turns into the usual overpowered MC fantasy, where everyone freaks out over how strong he is, and he casually walks around being the best at everything. The whole ""future world"" concept could’ve been interesting, but instead, it’s mostly just an excuse for him to act like a living legend while people keep going, ""Wow, no one has been this strong in centuries!"" every five minutes. Their is no real character growth in this show since the MC s already way too overpowered along with every other character he encounteres.

Characters
Shinya is exactly the kind of main character you expect in these shows. He’s overpowered, he has no growth or real development , and pretty much just cruises  through everything while everyone around him is amazed at how cool he is.  but they don’t really do anything interesting with it. He beats the final boss alone in what was supposed to be an impossible death  game, and after that, the whole ""trapped in a death game"" part just stops mattering. The rest of the characters are basically there to admire him or be impressed by him. There’s a bunch of fantasy races, some nobles, a couple of girls who obviously like him, and that’s about it. The villains? Yeah, they exist, but good luck remembering anything about them because they’re just there to lose. There’s no real tension because, surprise, Shinya is just better than everyone at everything, and he never actually struggles.


Animation & Sound
Visually, it’s fine. Nothing special, nothing terrible. It looks like a typical fantasy anime with decent but not mind-blowing animation. The fights look okay, but they’re not exactly high-energy since Shinya basically wins before they even start. Music? Yeah, there’s music. It exists. You won’t remember it, but it’s there.

My conclusion
If you’ve seen any overpowered MC fantasy anime before, then congratulations, you’ve already seen The New Gate. It’s got your typical power fantasy  stuff—super strong protagonist, fantasy setting, people constantly being shocked by how amazing the main guy is, and fights that end before they even get interesting. The premise had potential, but instead of actually doing something with it, the show just leans on the usual power fantasy tropes. If you like watching an overpowered dude steamroll through a world that worships him, then sure, maybe this is for you. But if you were hoping for tension, struggle, or, I don’t know, a reason to care, then maybe look somewhere else."

And there is plenty to work with, too. As an oppressed synthetic population within the world, Neans are essentially shackled to the Asimov Code—itself named after science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who coined “the three laws of robotics” in the 1940s—which means they cannot harm humans both directly or by inaction or indecision. Coupled with their dependence on a substance called Nectar, Neans are robbed of any real sense of self-signification, clearly positioning them as a population both within society and metaphysically to be pitied by the audience. Within the Neans is the so-called “Immortal Nine,” proto-Neans that can exercise free will beyond the Asimov Code and take matters into their own hands, violently if needs be. Enlisted to stop them are Rouge Redstar, a Nean who isn’t particularly bright but can punch really hard, and Naomi Orthmann, the brains and tech-wizard who seems more relaxed.

For all the players involved, Metallic Rouge poorly orients how they all factor into the grand scheme (or, to use a framing device that the anime loves to employ with Puppetmaster, roles to play). If the series opted to have the two main characters as the main force walking through the narrative, it doesn’t succeed at this. A pair of characters embodying a tried-and-true “buddy cop-esque” dynamic is not poor by itself, though in terms of what makes Rouge and Naomi tick, there’s surprisingly little that feels distinct. The early interactions are occasionally tinged with remarks that border on yuri-adjacent signifiers, or turns of phrase that are meant to be endearing, particularly from Naomi. Yet, it assumes that tiny touches like these are substitutes for actual meat, rather than the potato chips or chocolate that our heroines like to indulge in. Given especially how much of the show Naomi and Rouge hardly see eye to eye, if not just being uncommunicative, dishonest, or not even within the same proximity of each other, it’s hard to care about them as a binding tether within Metallic Rouge’s story.




Because Rouge and Naomi as the protagonists cannot be positioned as antithetical to Nean freedom (because that would presume the series is advocating slavery is a better option, which…uhh…), the narrative thus puts them at odds not with Nean freedom, but rather against the Immortal Nine. And since the Immortal Nine possess personalities or cause actions so cartoonishly outlandish or evil to give the “good guys” and the audience a force to understand but not sympathize with, Metallic Rouge cannot elicit any meaningful introspection. The complexity of the Nean Freedom issue is relegated to battles with easily identifiable antagonists, defeated / killed in tokusatsu fashion in favor of gradual integration of Nean rights into human civilization to prevent “chaos.” The result is a civil war narrative in which even if both sides are simultaneously right (the investigator Ash [even says this outright]( ), just in case you missed it), the actual sense of exhilaration to see the conflict play through to the end just isn’t there because there is not a good enough reason to care. This, of course, does not discount the idea of the Asimov Code still restricting their options for self-defense or self-preservation at human hands.

webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/f7ad1bd5a57a75a920f71cc92da0e71b.mp4)


The show instead more heavily focuses on the interpersonal—and familial—drama and having so many revelations or actions come one after another for the sake of shock or worldbuilding / expositing. It makes the mistake of thinking that the intrigue of Rouge’s contemplations, the Immortal Nine’s ideology, Naomi’s quips, etc. can map onto or substitute itself for the Neans. For supposedly being about creating revolution, the people who would most benefit from it are barely anywhere to be found. It is perhaps the irony of ironies that the oppressed Nean class within Metallic Rouge is so underrepresented in their own longing for freedom, shoved to the side for those proto-Neans and other humans that are not slaves to the Asimov Code that imprisons everyone else. For all the things within the anime, it feels so hollow in the end.

I do not doubt that Bones wanted Metallic Rouge to be their next big showstopper and a massive celebration for their 25th anniversary of bringing joy in anime to millions. Part four of the 25th anniversary documentary on Crunchyroll is essentially a giant ad for it. But perhaps in their efforts to make it the “most thing” that it could become, they didn’t realize until it was too late that it had become so large that there was no way that it could be as fully developed or realized as it could have been. In what should have been their crowning hour, it turns out that the emperor had no clothes.

That is, in essence, Metallic Rouge’s great failure – in trying to “cram in everything,” it doesn’t ultimately amount to anything. Its characters are caught within a moral conundrum that leaves no particularly delicious food for thought or thrills, residing in washed-out ideological shadows. It assumes that twists (out of left-field or otherwise) or other “big moments” are enough to cover when the inner cohesion is lacking. The result is a cyberpunk anime that has no real life within itself, keeping itself fueled with doses of its own Nectar and burning through its supply so quickly. Much like that Nean in episode one who was pleading for Nectar in his final moments, the anime was desperately searching for something to grasp onto. 

Anime could always do with some more originals IPs, but an original IP does not make a good show by default. Most regrettably, Metallic Rouge demonstrates this to be the case."
97995,"Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shoujo YU-NO is an anime that adapts a classic visual novel. I read the VN before I watched the anime, but I will avoid spoilers beyond the first episode, aside from talking about the tone and such.

For a little background, the VN first came out in 1996. At the time, it was extremely innovative. Many other famous VNs could be said to have been deeply inspired by it. An English fan translation patch came out in 2011, and that's the one I played. The rights were eventually transferred to 5pb (now called Mages) which went on to publish a graphically updated remake in 2017, which just had an English localization released on Steam today (yes, they timed it with the last episode!). This anime is an adaptation of the modern remake, but reportedly both the 1996 version and the 2017 version have the exact same script and system, it's just the audiovisual elements that differ.

Now, to talk about what the story is like. I'll put it this way: if you're a major fan of Steins;Gate, this is a must-watch anime (or alternatively, must-play VN). The basic premise of YU-NO, evident from the first episode, is that the protagonist's consciousness travels through time. A lot. And that has various interesting implications. In VN terms, it's a ""multi-route mystery"" in which the protagonist makes difference choices that let him see more of the truth, until the bigger picture finally becomes clear. The plot is extremely intricate, focusing on the same places and the same cast, who adopt different roles and show different sides of themselves in each arc. It's a tight and intricate time leap-based plot.

The first episode crams in too many events, but after that they're well-paced. The animation is not especially impressive; it's just average. The music, on the other hand, is wonderful, and helps add impact to many scenes; it's borrowed from the VN. What made the anime especially enjoyable is how they fixed one of the VN's major flaws. In the VN, the protagonist doesn't remember what happened in previous time leaps. This was surely the case due to technical limitations inherent in having the protagonist react differently to all the little details. But since the anime cuts out or speeds past repeated content, and tells the story in the most efficient way possible without the protagonist wandering around trying to find clues, it can afford to tweak the protagonist's reactions and provide him with character development.

The bottom line is that watching the anime felt like a completely fresh take on the story, in which the protagonist acts rationally and pieces together the truth himself without wasting time. Furthermore, around halfway into the anime, they added an episode or two of filler content oriented around one of the heroines that also builds up the relationship between some of the central characters. I thought this was awesome, because she didn't have enough development in the original story, and the characters didn't interact with one another as much. It felt very satisfying to see this kind of character development.

Anyway, what I've talked about so far is the initial style of YU-NO's story. But after a number of such arcs, the story experiences a genre shift. I won't say exactly which episode, but it's about 2/3 of the way through the anime. The first few post-shift episodes are fairly true to the VN, and while unconventional and full of revelations, they still feel very grounded, and are even emotionally moving. But later on in the anime, especially the last half dozen or so episodes, the anime has a heavy amount of filler, and significantly changed some events. The anime staff clearly wanted to try to bring in more of the side characters and incorporate more action elements, in order to spice up the VN's more ""direct"" conclusion. However, the additions fell a bit flat, coming off as a series of cliches. And I'll be blunt: there are too many plot holes to count. (I'm not the kind of person who uses the term ""plot hole"" lightly.) I respect the anime staff's ambition, though. In any case, the overall structure of the story stays true to the VN, and the end is the same. But even in the case of the VN, people typically think the final arc was weaker than the earlier parts of the story... with the addition of these anime original developments, the contrast was even starker. Still, most viewers ought to be entertained and want to see how the story concludes.

Wondering if you should watch the anime or read the VN? They each have their strengths and weaknesses. The VN is a classic point-and-click adventure game, in which you can click on everything in the background and receive amusing little comments in response. When I played the VN, I wasted so much time clicking on stuff without making progress, and felt bored and frustrated. On the other hand, I know that many people loved having the ability to interact with the world personally to figure out how to solve the setting's mysteries. If you're in doubt, my recommendation is to watch the first arc of the anime -> play some of the VN -> decide if you want to continue the VN with its extra detail and personal involvement, or switch back to the anime. As for the big differences in later events between the anime and VN... well, from a literary perspective the VN is far superior, but the anime's changes were at least ambitious, so I don't feel like dismissing them completely.

YU-NO is far from a perfect anime adaptation, but it's properly paced and adapts a classic VN that has many worthwhile aspects. It deserves to be a lot more popular than it is."
173693,"This anime is a complete and utter disaster. I don’t even know where to start with how much of a letdown it is. First off, the title—""Loner Life""—is a straight-up lie. The main character is supposed to be this lone wolf, right? Living that isolated, independent grind, doing things on his own? Yeah, no. Instead, the dude somehow ends up in the same, overused, uninspired harem cliché that we’ve all seen a million times before. Tell me why he refuses to join the party of the one actually decent guy who helps him out, but oh, suddenly it's all good to surround himself with a bunch of conventionally attractive anime girls? Make it make sense.

This feels like a cash grab in every possible way. It’s like the creators slapped together the most generic isekai elements, threw in some waifus, and called it a day, thinking that would be enough to get people to watch. Spoiler alert: it’s not. If I wanted to watch another predictable, uninspired, self-insert harem fantasy, I’d go dig up any of the dozen other copies of this same damn formula that have come out in the last five years. What happened to originality?

And let’s talk about the misleading nature of this whole thing. The title sets up an expectation—this dude is supposed to be alone, grinding through life as a solo player, right? Maybe some real character development, some struggles, a unique take on the genre? Nope. Instead, we get ""Loner Life"" in name only, while the anime proceeds to throw every typical overdone trope at us. I could tolerate it if it was at least self-aware, but it’s like the writers genuinely think they’re doing something new when in reality, they’re just copying and pasting from every other forgettable isekai.

The worst part? The wasted potential. The idea itself—an actual loner navigating this world on his own, growing stronger, dealing with the struggles of solitude—could have been fire if done right. But instead, we get a lazy, uninspired wish-fulfillment harem fantasy where all the female characters exist solely to orbit the protagonist and leech off his power. It’s not even subtle. These girls literally mooch off of him while the anime expects us to just roll with it. And don’t even get me started on the writing. The pacing is janky, the character motivations make zero sense, and the dialogue feels like it was written by someone who thinks “character development” just means giving the MC a tragic backstory and calling it a day.

I tried to give this show a fair shot, but it genuinely pissed me off with how much potential it threw in the trash. It could’ve been something different, something great, but instead, it’s just another forgettable, half-baked isekai clone with a misleading title and no real heart. I don’t care if people enjoy it for the waifus or whatever, but don’t try to pretend it’s anything more than that. This ain’t ""Loner Life""—this is just another mass-produced fantasy power-trip with a harem slapped on top."
133898,"This movie addresses my biggest issue with Dragon Ball Super, in that Goku and Vegeta are the only characters in Dragon Ball Super. They simply got way too much screen time and we rarely got moments with other characters where they could shine, the Tournament of Power also addressed this and we got some great memorable moments outside of Goku and Vegeta but they still got the most spotlight. So this movie feels like a breath of fresh air knowing how little we see these two, but don't get me wrong though I love Goku and Vegeta but we needed a break from them. Despite not watching this with the greatest of quality I was a fairly surprised at how good the CGI animation was, admittedly when I first saw it in the teaser back when it was shown I wasn't too big on the idea but looking back on Broly's CGI scenes I thought that they could pull it off and they did very well.

Some frames look a bit funny when paused but in motion I have no problems with how the movie looks, the animations come to life during comedy along with it's great art style. With the fight scenes being CGI too you get some great camerawork during fights. I did see studio JC Staff and Orange in the credits, though I'm not sure on what exactly they did to assist here but I wouldn't be surprised if they helped out with the CGI part. If you're a Dragon Ball casual or like me whose seen almost everything the series has to offer the story here is nothing you haven't seen before, it's fairly standard and the twists are very predictable though even with it's at worst somewhat underwhelming story the overall experience is still an absolute joy to watch. The fight scenes too have some great sound effect design to go alongside it, specifically the fights against the Gamma units. You can easily hear the more metallic sound effects for when Piccolo and Gohan hit them, it gives the fighting much more weight to it all and I love it.

img800()

The music wasn't very noticeable sadly even near the end, probably my biggest issue with this movie is that it almost feels like we're creating the same problem here. I'm going to assume here that you've seen a good chunk of the trailers here, but just like the Dragon Ball Super problem Gohan and Piccolo got a lot of very deserved attention here. Maybe I'm just greedy but I was kind of hoping for a bit more with Goten and Trunks since they finally aged them up alongside Pan. They all got great moments, but I feel Goten and Trunks should've gotten a bit more then what we got. And even then this isn't even that big of an issue, if anything I'm grateful they finally gave them enough attention to aged them up. They even gave a reason as to why they didn't which was totally made to get fans to shut up about them not caring about doing that sooner. I'm simply worried that in the future when Goku and Vegeta have gotten too much spotlight we're going to switch back to Piccolo and Gohan so that fans don't get burnt out on the main two, and really never give the side characters a major role.

My favorite arc is the Majin Buu Saga for how well it treated the characters in it, everyone felt important one way or another even the ones we'd never expect to be. I long for the day when we can get an Arc written like how the Buu Saga was again. I hope I worded that properly. To clarify again just incase, I'm very happy with the treatment Gohan and Piccolo received this movie my issue just comes from a doubt for the future of this series where they just become another Goku and Vegeta situation in where they get more spotlight and ignore other characters who could very well use it. This movie was a very fun watch, I had gotten spoiled on something major and not wanting to get spoiled on anything else rushed to quickly watch the movie even if it wasn't in the best quality. It was definitely worth it, great character comedy moments brought to life by the well executed CGI one scene in particular shocking the absolute hell out of me. Intense battles left and right filled with a hint of fanservice if you notice it that also had me screaming very loudly at 3 AM, also Oreos, a lot of Oreos. A must watch for any fan of Dragon Ball, just go into the movie expecting Dragon Ball."

SPOILERS FOR SHUUMATSU NO IZETTA

I'm sure we all remember what happened with the spring 2016 anime known as Kabaneri. To recap, Kabaneri started off strongly and interestingly before divulging into a convoluted mess that made everyone remember this series as ""the biggest disappointment of the year"" rather than ""the biggest blockbuster anime of the year"". Something similar happened here. This when this series started, it had a fairly decent reception and many people interested, thinking that this could quite possibly be the dark horse of the season. Unfortunately, it lost all of its luster by the end, and now, it is up to us to bury this series and say our final goodbyes to this failed soldier. You may ask: ""how did this series flop on us all?"" Well, let's find out, shall we?

To be fair to this series, the premise is one of the most fascinating of its season. A witch gets summoned to fight for one of the many European countries (this one being Elystadt) oppressed by Germania's assault during World War II. Even the first episode managed to feel like it would turn out to be interesting, if not necessarily as grandiose as a war series tends to be. Unfortunately, some of the series's major problems come early, with one of the biggest being how the magic is explained.  There are these things called ""ley ines"" (which no one can see, ever, so how were they recorded?) which are the lines of magic energy that allow witches to use their magic. However, they aren't everywhere, so Izetta has to be careful not to wander into an area in which she cannot use magic.  This becomes a problem due to the fact that we can never truly know where they are and where they stop, meaning that the writers can, on a whim, make Izetta accidentally go off to a bad location without us knowing any better until she suddenly falls down and gets herself injured, which end us happening in episode 9, bit I'll get to that episode is the point in which the series jumped the shark, later.

While episode 9 is the point of no return, the part that first comes of major concern is episode 4, where they fake Izetta's power via theatrics to fool the world into thinking that she is a very powerful witch while beating the Germanians in another battle. However, this raises the question of ""why didn't she just use her own magic when the world from this point on, will know of her magic anyway?'. Not only that, but it leads into one of the tritest setups that I ever have to see: the whole ""this person I admire is secretly a fake"" cliche"".  It turns out that there was a spy all along, and Jonas, the guy who found out the secret about Izetta, is blackmailed by the spy that he'll kill his family. Then, he gets shot by him before the guy runs away, and then Jonas is shot and ""killed"" by Sieg. This should really affect his family given how much they talked about it. However, we never see his family once. After a few meh episodes, one ship explosion that took one torpedo when they explicitly said it required 4 to do the job, and one ball later, we finally get to episode 9.

Turns out, in episode 6, there was a girl who kissed Izetta in order to make her bleed that way said girl could drink her blood (don't ask me how this makes sense, or how they manage to pull it off realistically; this show never bothered to make it work). Turns out, she was a copy of the real White Witch: a girl described in legend to be a noble and tragic witch. I won't even get into how many of the false versions of the story there are here, as only the one showed in the middle of the finale is right, which means the series has lied to us extremely often. Let's just say this: now, she is evil. Also, they are mass-producing clones of her via magic that they shouldn't understand thanks to how this works. After struggling against her, Izetta loses power, and crashes into the land below. How? They went out of their way to state that she is still on land where the ley lines are located. Apparently, they didn't care to explain this, as there is no indication that her powers were manually shut down. Then, she starts bleeding despite nothing indicating that she was badly wounded anywhere. You could assume the crash did this to her, but all it was, was her tumbling a lot with nothing harmful going into her. She is then captured. Episode 10 even explicitly states so. So why is she still with the good guys? It turns out, that in that same episode, they retrieved her. Since that's the case, why did the Germanians bother saying that they got her. Also, why did the SS try to kill Berckmann? They had no reason to fire him, let alone execute him.

Somehow things only get worse in the final set of episodes. In episode 11, they start moving to the area with Izetta seemingly getting ready after another yuri bait moment, but in the very first 5 second of episode 12, she is already at the fight with Sophie already hovering opposite of her. After about 8 minutes, we get this. Remember when Sieg shot Jonas in the head? Turns out, he's completely fine, with the Germanians, and then he shoots Sieg out of panic. This raises a multitude of questions that damn this series even more into absolute failure. Whatever. The day is saved, Sophie is stopped, the Germanian operation has been foiled, and peace roams the land. Also, despite the last few episodes making it out to be a heroic sacrifice for Izetta to fight, she is perfectly fine, and in a wheelchair. This is just like when Ikoma copped out in the finale as Kabaneri by also living after he was supposed to die. All's well that ends well, I guess. Either way, the script is dead, and I still don't think I've covered all that makes this plot so terrible. Why did Izetta's grandmother call Sophie a traitor? They explicitly showed that when Ozetta asked if her criticism of Sophie (interfering with humans) was the reason, she said no. How did Izetta get captured prior to episode 1? Issues like this further break this sorry excuse for a narrative.

The cast isn't great either. Izetta, while adorkable, and determined, isn't a compelling protagonist despite still being the best character here with a believable backstory. She was saved by Ortfine when they were young, as the locals were about to kill her. Speaking of Ortfine, she's your typical strong-willed leader pushed to her limits. Nothing much to her. Most of the cast is also pretty forgettable and unexplored, like Bianka, Sieg, Hans, Berckmann, etc. Also, Berckmann's son, Ricelt fits this bill too, getting a mostly useless episode 7 to himself before he and the spy both die. 

It's the villains that are pathetic. Otto is just a lame tyrant interested in witches, and there's nothing else to him. I struggle to find any reason for Elliot to be here given how useless he is. Then we have Sophie. She is a generic antagonist introduced just to have an eventual final boss, in the same vein as Biba from Kabaneri (as if there weren't enough comparisons between the two shows already). After being betrayed, she wants revenge. In episode 6, she is presented as this mysterious figure. After that, she's just a vengeful maniac who cackles while doing evil things for the sake of it.

This series looks pretty good, despite the fact that the studio Aija-Do isn't well known. If this show stayed consistent, this might've put them on the map. Sure, the citizens of Elystadt have this generic light novel look to them, and many characters have those gaps in their mouths (meant to represent lips) that are way too big sometimes, but Izetta, and the styles for the Germanian characters look a lot more interesting and varied. The action looks nice too. Special mention goes to that section in the OP where Izetta is moving from bullet fire. They even went out of their way to not only get the looks of the weapons and cars right, but they even animated certain moments in the black and white box look reminiscent of that of the actual days of WWII. I wouldn't say the show looks great or amazing, but it's clear that there was some significant effort put into this show.

The music was composed by a newcomer named Michiru, who does a fine job. Many of the vocals are in German, and in certain scenes, they fit perfectly, even if none of the songs are ones I would go out of my way to listen to. Still, its experimental and it works rather well. The OP, ""cross the line"" by AKINO with bless4, is a satisfying and energetic OP with some tight build-up and several electrifying moments. As good as it is, I'm even more impressed by the ED, ""Hikari Aru Basho e"" by May'n, who, if you don't know, was the voice for the singing done by Sheryl Nome in Macross F. Here, she delivers a powerful, emotional, and slow-moving song that makes me wish this show was as gripping as its ED. Everything works rather well, except for the dub, which is comprised primarily of newcomers who do a mediocre job. That's the simuldub business for you, but hey, anything to give this show some kind of boost, right? It honest to God needs it.

I'm sure we, the people of this community, will cynically remember this in the same way we did with Kabaneri only 6 months before. Only this time, even less of us cared in the first place. In the fires of the show's train wreck path, we can only grieve at what could've been. An interesting first half that led into a stupid yet equally by the numbers second half that only served to make the first half's flaws more apparent. It mostly felt like a love letter to World War II, but that's all this show was good for. Even then, they stopped doing interesting things with that by the second half, so there's nothing I can latch onto in order to recommend this show to anyone."
1686,"Bleach Movie 1: Memories of Nobody is a movie that you can watch immediately after the Soul Society arc in the Bleach manga and right after the Bount arc in the Bleach anime, being the first exposer to Rukia Kuchiki's Zanpakuto. It is the only Bleach movie that can fit into the main continuity without much trouble.
The story is about the worlds about to be destroyed by the enemies called the DARK ONES. Some of the blandest antagonists you will see in Bleach and can be a total turn off for people that are interested in a well written antagonist with a deep backstory. However, they do have justification for what they do even if not the smallest effort was put for use to care about them.

On the contrary we have Senna and the story is focusing on who she really is as she has Shinigami powers and a named Zanpakuto. That is the only remotely interesting part of the movie and there is no surprise that non of the DARK ONES made it into video games but Senna did.

Ichigo Kurosaki in this movie takes the role as her guard protecting her from the DARK ONES and Soul Society because that is Ichigo for you. In the movies he is always the character who does and says the right thing while the other characters are just following orders or their selfish desires.
Senna is a playful self-centered girl but cares about finding the truth about herself. Not because she has amnesia, thank god. The movie takes a lot of time exploring her personality, her desires and fears. It will make you believe she needs to be protected.

As for other characters, Urahara does the usual helping out thing. The other main cast members are usually shafted with Orihime only healing once after the battle. Like most Bleach movies it focuses on the Shinigami doing the fighting. And let me tell you there are a bunch of Shinigami eating up screentime with their Zanpakuto releases and BANKAI.
Speaking of fights, they were rather mediocre. Soifon got the best treatment of all Bleach movies in this one by not making her look like an amateur. Some enemies used their energy sources they intend to destroy the worlds with in a clever way in some fight, for example the guy who fights Toshiro Hitsugaya. But that is as far as the compliment goes simply because like in all Bleach movies the Captains just slaughter the opposition with almost no effort.
Some of the enemies weapons are also uber lame and aren't used in an interesting way to make up for the lack of interesting powers.

Overall this movie is the weakest Bleach movie. Senna is the only thing that is interesting but the antagonist don't feel as dangerous as they should since the high tier shinigami are around. If you want to see where the truth about Senna lies, you may enjoy this story and the ending will be hitting you hard emotionally. If you looking for an action packed Bleach movie with interesting antagonists and killer visuals you might want to skip that. Especially if you aren't a fan of Bleach filler since this movie feels like an extended filler episode than a movie."
165855,"Hananoi-kun to Koi no Yamai aka A Condition Called Love is a Shojo-Romance manga written and drawn by [Morino Megumi](https://anilist.co/staff/120176/Morino-Megumi). It was adapted into a 12-episode anime by East Fish Studio, a fairly new studio with no notable previous works.



I have not watched many Shojo anime, but the ones that I have, I have enjoyed thoroughly. This being the Shojo-Romance of Spring season, I was curious how it would compare to Winter season's A Sign of Affection.

Sure, the production quality is not up to par from the trailers, but surely the story is good right?

The story follows Hinase Houtaro, who gets asked out on a trial date by Hananoi Saki. The latter falls in love with her at first sight when she hands him an umbrella. Initially, she rejects dating him, but later accepts his offer of a trial dating. She hopes doing this will allow her to experience genuine romantic love for the first time.

The main couple sucks! The character writing and the relationship, are written in such a contrived way that any pushy scene, sprinkled with romantic sappy music gives off the illusion that the scene in question is romantic. But the reality is that it is forced, undynamic, bland, and leaves you feeling uncomfortable.

Hananoi is creepy, pushy, clingy, and often behaves like a Yandere. His girlfriend is the only thing on his mind and is rude to everyone else. 
A character with bad traits IS NOT a bad writing decision. When someone writes a character with flaws, especially glaring ones. They are usually addressed or the character has an arc to grow out of them and mature. 

As the anime goes on his behavior improves, and his backstory elaborates more on his characterization, but the creepy behavior is never addressed properly and is ignored by the cast for the simple reason being that he is hot.



Hinase despite being 16 years old, has the mental age of a 10-year-old. She has no idea what love is supposed to mean and is scared she will never fall in love. She lacks social awareness, is incredibly naive, and is very easily exploitable. Which Hananoi indirectly takes advantage of.

In the first episode, she loses a hair clipping, Hananoi goes out of his way to search for it for hours and almost gets frostbite. If a close friend or lover did this, it would be a romantic scene of consideration. But in episode 1, Hananoi is nothing more than an acquaintance. But Hinase does not view it as creepy or even weird. She cannot even comprehend that someone having a shrine of you, the week you start dating is weird.

Because the couple is written as they are, you can have any forced scenes imaginable. With no good chemistry and bottom-of-the-barrel writing, you have scenes like when Hananoi picks up and embraces Hinase in the first few episodes. To the viewer, it is laughably forced, but to the characters, it works because Hananoi is clingy and Hinase does not know any better.

Other than the bad romance, this anime is so boring. You have scenes like the characters staring into each other's eyes that drag on, lots of yapping about feelings, and school romance cliches with no special execution.

The production is subpar. 
If some of the scenes were directed better, maybe my stance on the series would be different, but what we got is what we got. 
The art style is plain, and the animation is limiting... there were several animation errors: my favorite is when you had a scene of Hinase greeting her boyfriend while wearing gloves and then in the next scene, she is not wearing any and complains how cold her hands are.

img800()

Hanazawa Kana is an amazing voice actress, but her voicing Hinase was a miscast. Such a cheerful, full-of-personality voice is inserted on an overly plain girl. I rarely if ever complain about Japanese voice acting. The OSTs are fine, but they overuse one OST whenever there is a slightly romantic scene occurs: whenever they embrace each other or exchange turd pics, you hear it all the time. The ending song is pretty nice.

A Condition Called Love is a laughably bad romance. Along with Unnamed Memory and Metalic Rogue, it is one of the worst anime of 2024."
155890,"Kami no Glass is an interesting blend of a more episodic style character drama with a subject matter centric show focusing on the craft of bartending. Despite these two elements naturally complement each other well, especially since the series plays into the idea of bartending being a way to alleviate people’s troubles, both of them never quite blend together and support each other as seamlessly as desired. Similarly, there is a distinct tension between the initial more episodic nature of the show and the season long character story it wants to tell with its recurring cast. All this creates the feeling that Kami no Glass never quite hits its stride or creates a comfortable tempo despite all its elements in isolation being of good quality. Despite this, and to the show’s credit, the dramatic moments from both its episodic stories and longer character narratives still have a punch to them. Yet to achieve this, it feels like the show leans a bit too heavily on the framing of the scene and style of dialogue instead of there being a smooth build-up that gradually reinforces and invests the audience in what is happening. Even if Kami no Glass never quite feels like it entirely gels together, its various components are still polished enough to make for a solid and mature show.

The flow of Kami no Glass ends up feeling “stuttery”, and perhaps even a little disjointed at times, due to how the opening episode was framed. It stumbles or misses the point in a counter-intuitive way since it focuses on establishing a loose overarching plot instead of the core scenario and character dynamics that will form the framework for each episode. The actual “mechanical” plot of Miwa attempting to recruit Ryu to be the bartender at the hotel she works for barely factors into most episodes of the series, being at most a loose throughline that gives a minimal sense of direction for the season to culminate at. The problem is then that it creates the impression that Kami no Glass will centre around this plot of getting Ryuu to join them. As a result of this, the episodic stories that follow its opening are made to appear unintentionally meandering or as tangents to nowhere since most of them have little connection, either thematically or directly, to the furthering of the ostensible core plot. The recruitment of Ryu and the throughline for the season could have just as easily come after the show has established what an average customer at Edenhall would experience. Having done the reverse, it creates a confusing impression since it misorders the implicit narrative priorities that frame the overall season of the show, especially for anyone who has read the synopsis which suggests that the show would have a more episodic format. While it is more than possible to do both episodic stories and a season long arc, the one-track nature of episodes that seem to do only one or another only adds to the jagged flow of the season. It leaves the show never really finding a rhythm or flow since the purpose of each episode in contributing to the goals of the series as a whole remains unclear with how they swing from episodic to focusing on a recurring story.

Most episodes operate with only a single central goal in mind, be it focusing on their “bar guest of the week” and their woes, furthering the story of a recurring character, or occasionally an episode that seems more parts dedicated to the craft of bartending. What deviations or tangents there are from the chosen central plot are mostly snippets or singular scenes, leaving each episode with little utility in reinforcing or developing other character arcs from prior episodes. This lack of a more divided A and B plot style narrative that is more common in episodic series leaves Kami no Glass feeling distinctly one-track in its execution. This creates a storytelling pattern of character threads either being introduced and resolved within the episode or placed on the back burner with only scant reminders or callbacks to them before they are brought out all at once again. While this is effective for episodic stories that are “one and done”, and even serviceable for some recurring characters with simpler arcs that can be told in chunks, it fails to build up or show complexity in core cast members over time. There is little use of their presence in episodes that focus on other characters or events to tell us more about them through things like their responses. For instance, the complicated backgrounds of both Ryu and Miwa were introduced early in the season but were developed solely in their closing episodes. While this could arguably be expected given they are the main characters of the series, there is little done between the initial hints of their past and when the narrative decides to resolve the arcs all at once. At the very least this is narratively inefficient since it crams a majority of characterisation and unveiling of depth into designated episodes, making it feel abrupt or giving it little time to breathe. But at its worst, it feels jarring or artificial for characters to have been harbouring relatively weighty feelings for episodes on end without much indication. It fails to maximize dramatic tension or suspension of disbelief in later episodes where they are resolved. In the end, only Ryu’s story is really told over multiple episodes, being tied in with some of the latter episodic plots, and given enough time to breathe. But perhaps more importantly, it makes the cast members feel flatter than they should be because of how generic it renders much of their characterisation in episodes that do not involve their arc directly.

Due to this limited focus on the gradual build-up of character arcs, there is a tendency of overreliance on the ambience set by the animation and stylishly delivered and aggrandized dialogue to sell dramatic scenes. It even occasionally reaches a point where the lofty embellishment of bartending as healing the soul of the customer does start to feel ostentatious and hard to take seriously. Some of this romanticisation of bartending is to be expected, and even necessary to create a compelling narrative out of something that can appear relatively mundane to most viewers. And despite its flamboyant wording, the dialogue does land connivingly most of the time, a testament to the well-employed skill of the writer. The pressure these statements place on the suspension of disbelief of the audience is largely down to the lack of support from other sources like having ongoing character arcs be reinforced each episode to create greater emotional investment from the audience.

Despite these shortcomings, the series itself is still captivating enough which speaks to the strength of its individual components. It is difficult to say how accurately it shows off the craft of bartending without more specialist knowledge. Perhaps it is embellished such that an informed viewer might find the technical aspects of it unconvincing or diluted. But even then, it is still captivating and clearly conveyed enough for a lay audience to find interesting. The thematic and symbolic connections made with the cocktails are still relatively surface-level, but they are still stylish and charming enough to be interesting and set a strong tone and atmosphere for the series. More than that, the show does earn some of its more mature airs with how they at least attempt to show some of the rougher or even seedier side of bartending. While it is still hardly a deep dive or a central part of the series, it at least shows that the series can tackle interesting ideas and themes in a stylish and eloquent manner when it chooses.

Overall, Kami no Glass is a show that is all around solid but lacks that seamless, or at times even smooth flow between its different elements and episodes. Too many of its initial episodes are spent with its narrative format unclear to the audience, and even after that, they feel too focused on their immediate story at the expense of serving longer form character arcs. It is still understandable why the show would be structured as such, and more focused storytelling certainly has its merits. Unfortunately, it simply does not seem to be the ideal way to tell this type of story that ideally juggles and gradually builds up multiple character arcs in the background of each episode. Despite all the show’s elements never quite clicking into place to give it that captivating spark, there is still plenty to interest a viewer who is looking for a more mature show. While at times the show can have dramatic moments that rise to almost an 8, it is hard not to feel like they have so much wasted potential with how their structural elements could better support them. On the other hand, these same structural elements leave some scenes feeling like they are a 6 with how little set-up and time to breathe they receive. With that, a 7 out of 10 feels appropriate, albeit a weaker one and with the score oddly being on the strength of its individual elements instead of them coming together to make something greater than the sum of their parts as most shows usually do."
98506,"Konohana Kitan has the premise to be a decent slice of life, but falls pathetically short. I really wanted to stick with it longer, but this anime is just awful in so many aspects.

Konohana Kitan suffers from some of the worst pacing in anime I've ever seen. The writing feels like a high school student wrote the script for every episode in under a couple hours with a mandatory so-many-hundred word goal. From the very first episode, no effort is put towards building a halfway decent foundation for the rest of the show. The main character becomes attached to other characters absurdly fast, and just makes every interaction onward feel hollow and forced. There's also fanservice FOUR MINUTES INTO THE FIRST EPISODE, those four minutes include the opening theme. Fanservice is fine to an extent, but so soon in the FIRST episode??? Really???

The art is dreadful and lacks any soul. Oh my god, where to start? Backgrounds look like they are public domain art and do not have much detail to them, even if they are focused on heavily in a scene. The animation is literally THE worst I've witnessed in anime yet. So many corners were cut that it really makes this anime feel like it was made in a sweatshop with a strict time limit, and the employees were paid a few cents per frame without any supervisor to approve the frames beforehand. Walking animations are often nonexistent, replaced with torso shots of characters bobbing perfectly vertically up and down. Conversations between characters will sometimes be nothing but extremely zoomed in shots of character's faces, so zoomed in that you can't even see their hair or shoulders. Sometimes characters won't even have ANY animation, and will just be a JPEG sliding around. Sometimes there won't even be a character! You can only do the ""hahaha simplified scribble girl"" bit so many times every episode until it's obvious you just didn't have the budget to make an anime. Often this is done in the moments it would be most disorienting to the viewer. Eyes and heads rarely track movements, if you're lucky enough to be treated to a scene where a character would have something to track.

The sound is also pretty shit. Bland background music, overly-lengthy and uninteresting opening theme. Nothing really stood out to me besides the music being very lackluster. The audio effects themselves aside from music are just as bad. Moments where characters would obviously have audible footsteps have no footstep sounds whatsoever and it's very disorienting.

I think the creators were heavily restricted by budget and did not have any passion to create something besides ""HAHA KAWAII FOX GIRLS AND THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME :)"". This is the only anime that's legitimately angered me to watch, as I really expected it to be something halfway decent, but all I got was a waste of 40 minutes plus the time it took to write this review. It does NOTHING remotely well, and I could never see myself watching this without considering it wasted time I could've spent watching something better."
1029,"There are two people with us at any given moment… There’s the person we currently are, who’s in charge of every decision we have to make as it comes to us, and there’s the person we remember being. This can be the person we were back in school, where we wistfully wish we’d applied ourselves harder; This can be the person we were last week, when we wish things had played out differently on that date or that big important meeting; This can be the person we were when we were much smaller, as we reflect on how that child could have ever become the adult we are now. For Taeko Okajima, that person is her fifth grade self, and it has been for a while. There was just something about that age, when she stood awkwardly on the cusp of womanhood, that she can’t help but relate to as she navigates the equally confusing path into her late twenties.

As a child growing up in Tokyo, Taeko had dreamed of visiting the countryside like most of her friends, but she didn’t have any family there, and her family didn’t really have the time or resources to uproot and vacation somewhere that they had no connection to. Now, fully grown, and with one of her older sisters married to a man from an extended farming family, Taeko has taken to using her vacations from work to visit her in-laws and work in their fields, which fills her with a satisfaction that she could never get before. This time, she’s going to be picking safflowers, a beautiful, thistle-like yellow crop that is used to make red dye and rouge. It’s not her first working trip, but with the charming Toshio picking her up, and with some of her strongest nostalgic recollections finally getting unexpected resolutions, will there be more to this vacation than she bargained for?

So, there’s this small animation studio that I only really started getting around to last week. It’s kind of obscure… You may have heard of it… Studio Ghibli? Yeah, I know, but trust me, it’s a pretty big deal in some small circles. All joking aside, I’m kind of ashamed that it took me this long to talk about some of their titles, but now that their most famous title is out of the way then I figured I should move on to my favorite movie of theirs… And surprisingly, it was NOT directed by their biggest name, Hayao Miyazaki. He produced it, but the screenwriting and directing was handled by Isao Takahata, the same man who directed one of their most renowned works, Grave of the Fireflies. He also did two of their less-beloved titles, Pom Poko and My Neighbors the Yamadas, but I haven’t seen either of those apparent bombs, so I’ll hold off on judgement. He actually passed away a few months ago, which really should have been bigger news, since his final film, The Tale of Princess Kaguya, was actually quite successful.

An astute viewer may notice right off the bat that this film was animated and drawn in two completely different styles. It takes place in two different time periods, one being Taeko’s childhood in the sixties, and the other being her adulthood in the eighties. The material taking place in the eighties has a more modern, realistic feel to it, with the image being crisp all around, both people and backgrounds being exquisitely and intricately detailed, down to the smallest safflower, and to the lines on an adult’s face(which, unfortunately, makes Taeko look 47 instead of 27 in some shots). The childhood material, in contrast, is a lot more cartoony, with character designs looking slightly more anime-ish(that’s vague, I know, but you’ll see what I mean when you watch it), with the more simplified features, and slightly more blurry backgrounds, and an over-all presentation that has a kind of haze to it. When characters from this period show up in the later period(which happens), they seem eerily out of place, which was of course intentional.

Thankfully, this difference in style doesn’t come with any drop-off in budget, as Only Yesterday is insanely well animated, especially when you consider that it’s such a normal, down to earth story with no real action scenes to speak of. There’s like one flying scene(because this is Ghibli, and those are pretty much contractually guaranteed), but the rest of the movie is just people interacting and doing various activities, like driving around, working, and talking. It really doesn’t need to be animated as fluidly or as gracefully as it is, but all of the extra motion in peoples’ movements and facial expressions makes the film feel a lot more immersive, as if you were actually there with them, and even when they’re doing the most mundane things imaginable, like visiting the baths or eating various fruits at the table, you want to be there with them. There were parts where I honestly suspected the use of rotoscoping, but that’s obviously not true… The Ghibli studio is known for their lavish budgets(most of the time), and Only Yesterday obviously benefited from this.

Being that this is a film and not a series, there isn’t much I can say about the soundtrack, but that’s a matter of quantity, and not of quality. For only being two hours long, the music in this movie is still beautiful, another one of Ghibli’s more consistent marks of excellence. There were multiple composers on this project, and in addition to the obvious few Japanese composers and their wonderful piano work, there were a few from eastern Europe, as well, with the Hungarian Gheorghe Zamfir bringing in a few joyous, uplifting flute melodies, and there were also a handful of festive tracks from Hungarian artist Marta Sebestyen, who also lends her haunting vocals at times. I’m not sure whether or not I should be surprised by this, because I’ve heard western songs being adopted as motifs in anime before, You Raise Me Up for Romeo X Juliet and Country Road from Whisper of the Heart being the most obvious examples, but Only Yesterday uses a cover Bette Midler’s The Rose, which honestly doesn’t fit the movie as well as it sounds, but the way it’s used does work emotionally, so I’ll let that slide.  There’s one line in ther song…  “It’s the heart afraid of dying that never truly lives…”  That does match the climax kind of perfectly.

Before I start talking about the dub, there’s something I’d like to point out about the original sub, and that’s that much like the animation and aesthetic, the two time periods were also recorded differently. The childhood material was recorded in traditional ADR fashion, with the character’s lip flaps animated first so that the actors could dub their lines over it, but the adult material? That was done in Pre-lay, which is much more rare in Japanese productions. This is how western animation is recorded. They had the actors do their lines first, and then they animated over the performances, and if you’re wondering how this is such a huge difference, it’s because instead of people having to match animation, animation had to match people, and the result is far more realistic, as the actors could talk naturally, and the animation was able to capture their mannerisms and vocal quirks. This was another huge element in the disjointed feeling between a childhood memory and what’s happening in the here and now.

Quite a few people were scared that any dub of the movie would lose sight of this, and both sides of the story would be homogenized and just sound the same, but I’m happy to report that this is not the case. The people who dubbed this title knew damn well what they were doing, and while I can’t really put my finger on why, the performances on the pre-lay side of things sound far more grounded and down to earth than the ADR characters, who sound more like what you’d expect from an older anime dub… If I had to guess, it might be because while her childhood memories are populated mainly by actors who mostly each have a significant background in voice acting, the actors playing the two main roles in her adult life don’t have this benefit, having not done any voice work outside of video games prior to voicing for this film, and thus were a much better fit for what was supposed to be the more natural sounding side of the dub.

Who are these actors, you may ask? In typical Ghibli fashion, the lead roles aren’t played by career voice actors, but by predominantly Hollywood actors, and I’d dare to say that it works better here than it does in most of their films. Taeko is played by Daisy Ridley, whom the worst of you know as the Mary-Sue who ruined Star Wars with a pro-feminist SJW agenda. Screw all y’all, I loved her in the new Star Wars movies, and I love her in this dub, where she puts aside her British accent and manages to sound convincingly older than she really was at the time, being only 24 when voicing the 27 year old Taeko, and her voice actually sounds a lot deeper and wearier than she actually sounds in interviews. It’s honestly kinda hard to tell that it’s her without knowing ahead of time. I would call her the best performance in the dub, but surprisingly, I’d have to instead give that honor to Alison Fernandez, an American child actor who played her younger self in the flashbacks. She’s been acting since she was seven, and she’s built up a pretty solid resume since then… If you need a great example of this, she was in Logan.

Dev Patel, who rose to fame in Slumdog Millionaire and tried his damnedest to not suck in The Last Airbender, was NOT able to ditch his British accent for his role as the lovable Toshio, but that’s one of the things that become more tolerable when you find out that he just recently moved to the countryside to farm. His accent kinda sticks out, but his performance is good enough that you can suspend disbelief and take him seriously. Ashley Eckstein, whom you may know as Ahsoka from the recent Star Wars cartoons, plays one of Taeko’s older sisters, arguably the one who’s featured most prominently, and she was a good choice for it, as she and Alison have the right kind of tough love dynamic. Tara Strong has a small but substantial role as Naoko, a teenage member of Toshio’s family, and while there isn’t much for her to work with, she still makes it work. The only real issue I have with the dub is that the adult portion happens in the eighties, but there’s still some modern slang in there… At it’s worst, Taeko saying “Sho nuff” is a bit cringey, but it’s still a dub that shattered expectations.

So if you knew anything about this movie prior to 2016, you probably knew it as one of the mysterious two Ghibli movies that had somehow not been brought to america yet. These movies remained something of a mystery for any anime fan who wasn’t desperate enough to scrounge for a halfway decent fandub, if for no other reason than to figure out why they’d been left behind. now, for Ocean Waves, this was easy… It simply wasn’t very good, and unlike the worst of Ghibli’s output, it wasn’t interestingly bad either. It was just an unremarkable film that didn’t make a compelling case for existing. Only Yesterday, on the other hand, was much more successful, and had some actual acclaim behind it, so why was it forgotten? Well, from what I’ve heard, Disney got a bit shy over an extended flashback that dealt with puberty and children getting their periods. That may seem ridiculous to you now, but this was over twenty-five years ago. Going back just ten years ago, to the 2000s, and kids media couldn’t come within spitting distance of the topic of death, so it makes sense they’d have found this questionable back in the early nineties.

It did eventually get a theatrical release two years ago, alongside it’s cousin Ocean Waves, and if there’s any specific reason for it, I’d venture that there were two reasons; The first is the existence of the internet and the film’s rising cult popularity, and the second is that Only Yesterday was never really a children’s’ movie, and only in the last few years has the appeal of the animated medium to adults become more obvious to studios. This is a very adult movie, and I’m not referring to content… It’s technically safe, provided that a child has the proverbial parental guidance to explain the period-stuff, but I’m honestly not sure it would successfully hold a younger audiences’ interest, especially at it’s already taxing two hour run time. This is a decisively mature film, and it’s meant to be viewed by mature people, almost any of whom will find something relatably nostalgic in the deeply intimate narrative.

Of course, that’s not saying you have to be a child to find some parts of this movie boring. I certainly did, at least the first time around. It is, at it’s core, a slice of life movie, and a lot of what happens in it doesn’t initially seem to be important. There are several long, extensive conversations that seem to go nowhere, particularly in the adult portions of the story, and there are some scenes where they spend full minutes not even doing that. This isn’t the kind of storytelling westerners are used to… It doesn’t really follow any standard rules of story structure, very little ever comes back in any obvious way, and with it’s considerable run time, it can feel overstuffed at even the best of moments. It’s obvious that Takahata was going for a more realistic feeling story, as though it were a sequence of events that was more true to life than the average story, but that kind of thing rarely works in cinema, with the bulk of M Knight Shyamalan’s filmography being the perfect example of how this can go wrong… So how does Only Yesterday do it right?

I’ve seen this movie twice, and to be frank, I loved it SO much more the second time around. The first time, I WAS getting bored, I WAS wondering what all of the fluff was leading up to… And then, like a lot of other viewers(and in fact, like a lot of other REviewers), I was finally able to put it all together in the final minutes of the movie, right after the credits began to roll and The Rose started playing. In the final scene, everything clicked. I won’t spoil what happens, but to put it in vague terms, Taeko is given a choice to make, and it’s potentially one of the most important choices of her life, and the follow-through made for an immensely satisfying conclusion. This is a movie about growing up, which is common for Ghibli films, but where most of them are about children becoming adults, this one is about adults becoming adults, and that’s by no means a rare topic in Western media, but it’s still rare in anime, and  it’s refreshing to see it done in this way. It’s a reminder that as adults, we have a kind of agency that we didn’t have as children, and there’s no reason we can’t pursue what were once impossible fantasies. We choose where we belong, we choose where we end up.

Of course, there is one glaring flaw in the film… As amazing a director as Isao Takahata was, he always had a habit of sneaking social commentary into his work, and while this may have worked out well in Grave of the Fireflies, which contained a message that the Japanese youth of the time desperately needed to hear, this one feels like extremely slanted propaganda in favor of people getting into traditional farming. Toshio will NOT shut the hell up about his feelings on the subject, how it’s a field of work that needs to be kept alive, and how important it is to be connected to nature, and while it’s easy to write off his zeal as the passion of one whose eyes were opened to it late in life(everyone who was raised on it is much more easy-going about it), it oversteps it’s bounds by constantly insinuating that country folk are all around better quality people than city folk, painting them as superior in worth and attitude, when this really isn’t fair. Both walks of life contain good people and shitty people, which can leave the film feeling heavy-handed at points. Thankfully, it’s not a big enough issue to sully the experience.

Only Yesterday is available from Gkids, on both DVD and Bluray format. The original 1982 manga of the same title by Hotaru Okamoto and Yuko Tone is not available stateside.

Only Yesterday is a wonderful film, and I’m so glad that it was able to reach our side of the world while Isao Takahata was still alive. It may not be his best film, as Grave of the Fireflies was obviously superior, and it may not be as an powerful experience for you as it was for me, but it’s still my personal favorite, not just of his movies, but of Studio Ghibli’s movies. It falters a bit from making an unconvincing first impression, and from it’s ham-fisted agenda, but it all comes together in the end, making for a much more engaging experience the second time around. Your mileage may vary, but I found myself crying at the end upon both of my viewings, and in a weird way, it was one of the factors that led me to deciding that I wanted to come back to writing reviews again. It’s stunningly directed and animated, making it easily Studio Ghibli’s most underrated films, although maybe not one of their over-all best, but that’s not saying much when you consider the amount of perfect and almost perfect films that make up their filmography. I give Only Yesterday an 8/10."
19685,"This show is an absolute clusterfuck.

Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara, or If Her Flag Breaks, is a 2014 anime about a boy named Souta Hatate who can see flags. It is properly abbreviated as ""gaworare,"" but I'm going to call it KanoFlag because I never bothered learning the proper abbreviation when it aired so I'm sure as hell not going to bother using it now.

KanoFlag belongs to an increasingly common subgenre of the harem that I like to call ""gimmick harem."" Like other harems, it has a notable cast of girls, most of whom have at least some sort of vaguely romantic interest in the generic male protagonist, but instead of being based around wacky fanservice hijinks, the show focuses on some novel, out-there idea. [Noucome](http://anilist.co/anime/19221), for example, where the protagonist deals with being forced to make difficult decisions. [Invaders of the Rokujouma ](http://anilist.co/anime/20638/InvadersoftheRokujoma)is another, this one centered around all the characters fighting for room in the apartment. Most of these are adaptations of light novels, and presumably because the writers wanted to write harems but didn't know how to do fanservice in text form, they are almost entirely devoid of actual ecchi material--which as I'm sure you all know, is a large part of the reason you'd want to watch a harem in the first place. It's a terrible genre, and KanoFlag is one of the worst examples of it that I've seen.

KanoFlag's gimmick is that Souta can see flags, presumably referring to event flags, and knows how to break or advance them. This ends up being a vague power that the writers seem to have no idea how to handle consistently. Sometimes flags are things like romance flags or death flags. I can get that. But when you include things like a flag denoting the direction a character is going to kick a ball, or have flags he can't break or that respond differently to being broken, things become a lot more convoluted. It's either the most OP thing ever, or it's completely useless.

The plot seems to aim for complex, but it only manages to hit other adjectives starting with C: complicated, convoluted, and confusing. I've watched this show twice (for some reason) and I still haven't quite managed to grasp the plot, which seems to have something to do with an old king and a guy becoming a flag. It really doesn't help that the show paces the plot in a horrendous way, alternating between episodes packed with nothing but generic harem fluff and episodes where all the exposition happens at once. And the plot it tries to focus on is pretty heavy, too, so the tone of the show ends up getting whipped around, snapping back and forth like a flag fluttering in the violent wind. At the end of the show, they go to an alternate reality, everyone turns into a D&D class, and they fight a boat.

Then, of course, there are the characters. This show has some of the blandest, least interesting characters I've seen in anime, and it has a lot of them. The harem has over a dozen members by the end, in fact. Keep in mind that this is only a 12-episode show, meaning that the show is absolutely bloated with these boring, bland faces with unmemorable character designs. With so many characters and with a convoluted plot to cram into such a short space, they receive almost no development and remain generic archetypes. In fact, they fail to even live up to the standards of most generic archetypes, instead feeling more like tokens. You have the token onee-chan, the token tsundere, the token trap, the token robot girl, etc. No one develops past that. They just stay a sea of boring, redundant faces.

I honestly don't know why I stuck with this show to the end, despite being able to tell it was so bad from early on. There were only two things I actually liked about this show, and that's Megumu and when they went ""gao, gawo!"" at the end of every episode. Don't watch this show. I don't know how anyone could actually enjoy it, especially when there are better alternatives. It's dumb. Just...don't do it. One star."
108577,"I went into Soraao expecting something like an Ano Hana 2.0 with the whole adolescent melodrama with ghost/spirits vibe that its trailers and synopsis portrayed the movie out to be.  I wasn't too huge of a fan of Ano Hana, and so I was very, very pleased to see that Soraao was not Ano Hana 2.0.  Soraao was a movie that, amidst the clearly fictional elements of the plot, told things as they are, and as they should be.  It was a complete film that knew its goals and direction, and never lost sight of that the whole way through.

The most pleasant surprise of the movie for me was its direct and clear communication and understanding between characters.  We have Shinnosuke and Akane in their early thirties, Aoi and Shinno in their late teens, and Tsugu in primary school.  With such a wide age gap, I expected that, somewhere along the line, the age gaps would come into play to create miscommunication, or the general ""you wouldn't understand"" vibe would come into play as a way to create some sort of tension or conflict that needs to resolved.  Yet throughout the movie, the characters were very clear with their feelings and their position.  When the boat was rocked, Tsugu firmly lets Shinno know his personal feelings for Aoi.  When Aoi points out that Michinko has feelings for Akane, Akane gently explains that even with that knowledge, there are things that are understood but must not be said.  When Aoi confesses her feelings for Shinno, she clearly (though, with passion) exclaims what Shinno shouldn't do in the moment.  The characters understand each other, and themselves, and because this understanding is a very clear given in this movie, the Soraao team was able to explore some deeper and realer aspects of relationships, which was the real meat of the movie.

My favorite aspect of Soraao was its masterful use of unspoken dialogue and parallel plots to drive the movie.  We are never explicitly told why Shinno existed as a physical spirit in the first place, but we are able to figure that out ourselves by following Akane's decision between making kombu and mayo/tuna onigiri throughout the story.  A seemingly light plot point that did not hold much weight in the beginning ended up allowing the viewers to understand (in addition to the main plot) that Akane had decided to give up on her future in Tokyo with Shinno because she loved her sister more.  The moment Akane exclaims that perhaps she will make mayo/tuna onigiri next time, Shinno disappears and we the viewer understand that his existence was a consequence of Akane's decision to support her sister over pursuing the life she wanted with Shinno following their parents' death.  These sorts of stories underneath the stories allow for the thoughts of the Soraao team to hit hard like a one-two punch.  It's like Okada Mari and Tatsuyuki Nagai took a good look at what worked in their previous films and threw that in to Soraao.  And when the Soraao team couples these sorts of working aspects with a soundtrack that dynamically adapts to match the tension and mood of scene, it's a total K.O. for me.

All in all, I think Soraao was a very pleasant movie saturated with delicate thoughts and interactions.  Its characters knew who they were and who others are, and their no-nonsense approach to communication allowed for the genuine expressions of love and understanding to take hold of my own heart (onions may have been cut during the film).  This one is third movie I recently watched with Okada Mari listed as key staff member of the production, and all three of them had that delicate touch of complexity that I am really fond of.  I'd like to believe that is due in part to her involvement, and so I will be on the lookout for other anime and movies that she may be a part of in the future.  If I really had to put my totally unnecessary critic glasses on, I guess something that didn't really work for me at times was a few awkward transitions here and there (not too huge of a fan of fade-to-black transitions), and we never really got a good chance to understand why Shinnosuke ended up the way that he did.  The movie was a bit cookie cutter at times when it came to plot progression as well, but those are all really, really minor and unnecessary points of distaste though.  I really enjoyed Soraao, so taking into consideration how I have rated other movies in the past that have impacted me positively, I give this movie a 90/100."

I wish I could live in a dorm surrounded by a loli, Not Ram, a onee x loli lesbian, and an ara ara onee chan & her gyaru sister. This is a slice of life anime that once you've watched it, you'll wonder what you were doing with your life beforehand, why weren't you watching this, because of people like you, there is no second season yet. This anime puts a new standard into what a masterpiece is. 

Characters: 10/10
Lets go over the characters. You got loli class president, her character is she's insecure and short. Then you got Not Ram, she looks like Ram and is sadistic. I wish they had an anime figure of her, I would buy it, until then, I'll have to buy a figure of Ram and pretend its her. There's the Onee x Loli girl, her shtick is  she wants the loli class president. Then you got Miss Sunouhara's caretaker, she's got big ones, god I wish that were me living in that dorm. Later on in the show, they introduce another character, the Gyaru sister that I'm pretty sure is a pedophile. She just wants Sunouhara's monster energy. She's like the one piece of japanese art, where the taller girl has the monster energy drink or the GTX 3080TI and is teasing the short young boy with it. God I wish that were me.

Story: 10/10 
The anime is pretty much a slice of life of a not masculine boy trying to woo Miss Caretaker, who you can tell is into shotas. He gets stuck in the dorm that is primarily lived in by women (god I wish I was in that situation). They all go to school, but we don't see that stuff, cause who really cares. We just want to self insert as Sunouhara as he gets into all of his shenanigans.

Visuals: 10/10
You got the boy, you got the women, it is lewd. No nudity cause this is a christian anime.

Music: 10/10
idk its music

Sound: 10/10
idk its sounds

Plot: 10/10
I watch this for the plot. Miss Sunouhara's caretaker has the largest plot in the series, followed by the sister, then Not Ram, then pedo girl then the loli. Oh yeah, there's also two other girl characters that want Sunouhara when he's at the pool. God I wish that happened to me.

Opening: 10/10
I like it. It sounds nice and is pretty catchy.

Ending: 10/10
I also like this one. The opening is better though.

Lasting Impact:
After finishing this anime, you'll spiral into a depression, why isn't there anything as good. I saw a similar anime with a similar plot, it had nudity but I dropped it two episodes in  cause it wasn't as good as this one. It just couldn't invoke the ""God I wish that were me"" feeling that Sunouhara Sou evoked. Afterwards, there is also a manga you read that can continue the story, I am in the process of reading it, but the anime is much preferred for its animation. Watch this and every single time  you go ""God, I wish that were me"" take a shot. You'll probably overdose."

Disclaimer: I have limited knowledge of the Fate-universe so this will be apparent in my review.


Sense of place. The term can be used in many different ways. For some it may be unique places like ones bedroom, for others it may be about an attachment to a group of people where one feels safe and free to express oneself. We all seek a place to belong, somewhere where warmth emits. Some are lucky to find attachment early during their childhood while others struggle to. When you do not find a place, you feel left outside, alone, scared, cold and that is when one is the weakest and perhaps most aggressive; acting with hostility towards those who have taken your comfortable place out of frustration and fear. 

2wei! is a story about finding a place to belong.

The sequel to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei! continues the journey of the two girls, Illyasviel and Miyu. After completing the task of collecting the class cards, Illya and Miyu adjusts to live their life normally after the events. But that does not last long since there is trouble brewing in the complex space. Illya and Miyu are once again needed by Rin and Luvia to deal with the side effects left by the cards. Following the restoration we are introduced to Kuro, the new addition of the story.

Being reminded that others have a normal life does take a toll on one's self confidence and balance, and this is what happens to Kuro. With Illya being surrounded by friends and family, Kuro is constantly reminded of what she lacks. When Illya expresses that she wants her life to return to normal it triggers Kuro making her loathe Illya all the more. Even though surrounded with demoralizing scenes she tries to find a place by taking advantage of Illya’s desires (which Illya is not able to act on because of fear) and attempts to push her out and replace her. This is shown when she advances towards Shirou (who Illya holds a dear crush for) and being sexually suggestive while flirting with him. Her attempts on phasing Illya out eventually ends with a fight and it being interrupted with perfect timing (a bit too appropriately) by a third party, the source of Kuro’s problem itself. As the show progresses the influence of Illya’s continuous friendly advances leads to Kuro being able to find a place in her former enemy’s warmth. Although minor, Miyu plays a role in the story when Kuro challenges the validity of her friendship with Illya which Miyu responds with a strong resolve, and it shows that Miyu has developed during the course of the series.

Even though they had the first season to reflect and improve their show, 2wei! is sadly not an improvement over the first season and the series is faltering.

The themes of friendship and trust that was dealt with in the previous season are now shifted away to give way to the new theme, a place of belonging. Early on the show loses focus on the themes it attempts to deal with. Episodes leading up to the climax favors comedic events spawned from Kuro’s interactions and these events take too much time of the shows constricting episode count. Episode 4 being the biggest offender with it being about a game of dodgeball which is dragged out to the point that would make a taffy confectioner jealous. The dodgeball game serves little purpose in the narrative with its intentions being about eliciting chuckles and to mystify Miyu and the school nurse, perhaps hinting the upcoming events of the series.

The theme is vaguely hinted throughout the story from Kuro’s hostile and apathetic actions towards others, and her reaction from Illya’s questioning about her reason to remove Illya out of the way. It is later clarified why Kuro acted the way she did, but it does not leave a satisfying conclusion. There is a sharp contrast with how light and playful the the story was compared to the event leading up to the climax, and the bridge leading up to it gives little time to empathize with Kuro. With these reasons the climax did not reach its full potential and in the end falls flat.

Although humor is a part of the series, anything but the interactions between the main characters are so weak that they detract time only to attempt a flat and dull gag. It also feels artificial and forced. The shows side characters are significantly degrading ones experience, to the extent that you cannot enjoy the show whenever they pop-up. Tatsuko being the energetic and feisty troublemaker, Suzuhana the mature one, Nanaki the one who just goes along with anything and Mimi the one with lacking presence. They are all simplified, fitting common tropes and serve to share the burden of the main cast to supply amusement. This shows a lack of trust given to the main characters ability to elicit laughter. The memorable and great moments of fun are risen naturally from the main characters interactions.

One side character to note is Shirou, that lacks any purpose in the story other than to make the main characters, as well as Rin and Luvia, lose control and behave out of character. Two notable scenes are when Miyu clings to Shirou like a vulnerable puppy and scuttles away, and Rin and Luvia trying their best to look impress and get his attention. It feels out of place and is one of the downsides with the show. The influence he has on the girls and their feelings for him feels out of place whenever they are in the same scene. We are never explained why the girls feel the way they do towards him, and it does not have any impact at all. It just gives rise to an awkward and confusing scene. It also gives a sense of a subplot being that the girls are a part of a harem romcom with Shirou being the typical dull and oblivious main character.

Although flawed, the series is enjoyable to a certain degree. The interactions between the characters does spawn great moments of comedy; in particular, the way Illya reacted and her face when she was seen by her classmates in her magical girl outfit is one the funniest parts of the show. The scene in episode 2 where Kuro explores the mysteries of Miyu’s mouth might be weird to watch, but it sure offers a kind of fan service that is tasteful without detracting the characters to simple sexual objects. How the camera angles during that scene showing Illya in the background with the two girls kissing in the forefront and the fact that the camera lingers shortly close to them and quickly backs away to give them space gives the idea of the camera respecting their moment. The way Illya observed them during that scene reflects perfectly how I reacted to it, and it shows that the producer knows its audience and what reaction they expect. Interestingly enough there is a reason behind Kuro’s kissing, however it is not convincing enough to pass it off since there are other ways she can recharge her mana which does not require her to force herself onto other girls.

It is also a pleasure to see how Kuro slowly warms up to the rest of the cast as the show goes on. The antagonist that is introduced later in the second half ramps up the girls relationship. The battle that follows shows how well the CGI complements the action that is displayed. The animation of the characters are well done and smooth, and it does not detract the exhilarating action. In contrast to the light and bright scenes in the first half of the show, the dark arc in the end fits well since it serves to strengthen the girls bond by inserting a common enemy which they will have to work as a team in order to defeat it. This allows the girls develop their characters even further, and gives Miyu, Rin and Luvia some needed screen time.

Illya’s character design has never looked this good before, making other works design of her look poor in comparison. Miyu and Kuro are no exception to the lovely design as well. Silver Link’s strength regarding animation are character design and CGi, and they sure do know how to draw characters with a great consistency. The shows CGI looks amazing with its natural presence unlike other shows which feature CGi that looks out of place. The lighting applied to the scene are nicely represented, and the shadows covers and wraps around the objects and characters they are on decently giving a decent overall look. Other than the CGI, the overall animation quality is decent The soundtrack and background music does not impress. It does its job, but being simple regarding synths and tunes, as well as the background music during the fight scenes feeling more like a dance than action pumping sound it leaves one unfulfilled. There are not any notable or memorable soundtracks. At least the ending song is nice, fitting well into the shows light and magical feel with its instruments sounding very light and giving a cheery and girly overall sense.


OP: youtube(z3DtDuRKuk8)

ED: youtube(8vk4goYHbF0)

Sometimes there are shows that pop up which are incredibly popular with the help of it being a part of a popular franchise or something else. Prisma☆Illya is one of those shows, risen to heights with the help of the Fate-franchise immense popularity. Even though mediocre, it offers fans of the Fate-franchise a mahou shoujo spin-off with the ever so popular girl, Illyasviel.

Cute girls in cute outfits is what Prisma☆Illya is all about. With a heavy sprinkle of magic, friendship and acceptance it paints itself like any other generic Mahou Shoujo but within the Fate universe. Although the show handles itself decently at some aspects its dynamic between philosophy and humor falters, and it offers nothing new and should be treated as nothing more but sugar. For the fans of Illya, I suggest hopping onto this series since Illya has never before been more beautiful and cute. She looks lovely but the shows she stars in are anything but."
19315,"""Warning! Pupa is disturbing. In several ways. And perhaps not in the way the creators had intended. This review will be delving right into that completely unhinged.""

Pupa? More like... POOPA! There you go. The single and only joke I will be making throughout this entire review. It was a pretty good one in my opinion, but I feel as if I could have probably done better if I had tried. But I decided not to try because if these people making these shows didn't feel like trying, then why should I?

Nonetheless, a little thing before we start. Pupa has forced me to introduce a new concept to these reviews. Let me introduce the brand new staple of the TGG Review Series™: The Pupa ""Please Let the Suffering Stop"" Alert Stamp™.



Prepare to see this throughout the review. Whenever a train of thought goes a little too far or too deep down the rabbit hole or when the review just generally needs ""to stop"", this thing shall appear to hopefully curb the unpleasantness. After all, I wish for all of my reviews to be family friendly if nothing else.

...It's too bad that one of this show's largest themes is inces

img220() img220() img220() 




Pupa is an anim--is a show--is a TV short adaptation of the [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/75613/Pupa). Some background information first. Apparently there was [hype for this]()? Really the only reasoning I can use to understand this is that people just weren't aware what Pupa was gonna be. I mean, if you only have the cover of the anime or the manga to go off of... or even just the description...

img440()

But then it turned out to only be a TV short... then it was [delayed](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-15/pupa-anime-delayed-until-january)... then it aired and people realized oh holy shit it's [so bad](). IT'S [SO BAD](). 

But just because a show has an overwhelming negative reputation doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. Hey, what does everybody else know? Everybody has their own tastes and that's fine, and hey, maybe it's just an exaggeration.




Okay, so let's very briefly put together of all of the flaws that really bother me in Pupa.

1. Episode six.
2. There is no plot. Things just happen.
3. Trying to do entirely too much when the episodes are four minutes each.
4. Horror is more than just gore. Please. PLE[A](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another)SE.
5. Revealing the monster as soon as possible.
6. The monster form eventually being replaced with the character in human form but with tentacles.
7. Brother and sister relationships done the way Pupa does them.
8. Cannibalism done the way Pupa does it.
9. The whole point of the show is the cannibalistic incest and it's the worst part of the show.
10. Final episode being a flashback episode when nothing about the plot is resolved at all.
11. Unclear origins of the monster.
12. Just outright dropping a huge plot thread and never returning to it.
13. Horror cliches.

Wow, okay. That is a lot of things. How about a positive counterpart of that list? What are the things I liked in Pupa?

1. The opening.

...Yeah, that's about it. It's unfortunate that the only reason why that's a positive is I think having your theme or your opening actually say the name of your movie/show is just such a wonderfully cheesy thing to do. Of course, they probably didn't think it was cheesy themselves. But that honestly only makes it better.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO4MrI-9tIc)

In any case, I'll try to go over all of my negative points without making this review stupidly long. I might not get to all of them, but I want to get to the major ones.




Okay, so the sister is walking home from school, she passes by a lady dressed entirely in black with a scarred (burned?) face who tells her to go home before she sees red butterflies. We see the sister's weirded out face for a second and then immediately, there's red butterflies.

img440()

Are you serious? The stranger in black JUST told you to not look at red butterflies. Obviously, the red butterflies are symbolism or some trigger that'll cause you to turn into a cannibalistic monster creature and--oh okay, that's a dog.

img440()

Well, it's not like the random stranger warned you about dogs. It was about butterflies, and the butterflies did nothing. So just go right up to that stray dog and pet it. What could possibly go wrong?



...The random dog exploded into tentacles that attacked the sister. Not ideal BUT--okay now the brother's here. Okay, now the sister just exploded into blood. Okay, now the sister has immediately become the monster and is already just cannibalizing the shit out of anything that's near her.

Oh GOOD.

img440()

...This is the very first episode. Can you calm down a bit? Look, when the whole thing is ""there's a monster"" you should try and build up the monster. The worst possible thing you could have happen is the monster just showing up right out in the open and completely visible. This girl's entire transformation into this monster creature just happens as a result of her trying to walk home from school.

If this is not outright the most bizarre chain of events I've seen in an anime that's trying to be taken seriously (???), it's definitely up there.

A few episodes later.



Oh my god no. Them being monsters aside, they're brother and sister, S T O P

img440()




We see throughout the show that these siblings have not had a good life, what with an abusive father and all. The father is abusive to an almost ridiculous extent. Every single flashback we get of him is exclusively when he's being abusive. Like it's as if the only purpose this guy has in life is to go home and literally beat his kids for no reason.

But then. Then the show drops a bomb. The mother was even worse than the father. 

img440()

Let's not even stay on this train of thought too long, because this section of the review is going to cause people's opinions of me to plummet down into the fucking gutters as it is, but. I will give the people who made this anime this much credit. This baby is one of the creepiest fucking babies I've ever seen in an anime/fiction/etc.



The entire episode about the siblings' mother is just downright bizarre. This might end up sounding strange, I know, but this episode is I think the one that actually got the closest to ""okay if this was done better, this could work as a downright creepy and psychological horror thing"".

The moment I saw the mother open that drawer. 

img440()

I thought... there's no way. There's no fucking way they're going to do this. And for a brief moment, the schlock horror fan part of my brain took over as I realized yes, they were absolutely going in this direction.



Assuming the father was about as abusive to the mother as he was to their kids, we can sort of see that the mother is probably psychologically damaged. And a mother seeing her newborn daughter as some sort of inhuman monster and then proceeding to try and kill her, only for the baby to not only survive but then go chomp on an injured bird...



""Wow, what a cute baby. Wait, why are you biting my face please stop--""

That's completely fucked. But the beginning of the show is Yume being infected by the monster. We're never really given a clear answer as to whether the mother was right or it was all in her head.

The most bizarre thing about this episode about abuse and just general background information about how fucked up the relationship between these two siblings became is that this comes right before episode six. Episode six being where Pupa just outright drops the facade and just






""That was a pretty fucking weird episode that came out of left field. Baby stuff in horror is a bit... cliche, but I certainly  didn't expect them to go full on attempted baby murder. Let's move onto the next episode...""



""Oh geez. I can't believe this. The Pupa “Please Let the Suffering Stop” Alert Stamp™ must have just completely broken. This is why these reviews can't have nice things. Something gets used too much and too frequently, and it loses all effect. Repetition ruins everything. Let's just get to episode six.""

img440()

""...That's weird, where is this sudden deathly chill coming from?""



""Oh no. I will give you so much money to stop what is happening right now. This doesn't have to happen. We can go back to baby murder which actually could have sort of worked in a genuine horror way. There's no way they would just do an entire episode of this. Wait no shit, I said that about the baby murder too--""

img440()

img500()




I'll never not heed the warnings of the Pupa ""Please Let the Suffering Stop"" Alert Stamp™ ever again. They really did just do a complete [episode of nothing but the sister eating the flesh and drinking the blood of her brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPGn6zw2mdE). To an unforgivably graphic extent that is almost appalling. Then in a following episode, the brother basically states that he's apparently happy being eaten day after day by his monster cannibal sister.

I'm not a masochist. I just enjoy being eaten alive every day. What the fuck's the big deal.

This show isn't about abuse, it isn't a monster horror... it is a show about this incestuous cannibalistic relationship. Because even if the sister does briefly here and there kill people and show flashbacks of their fucked up parents, it always ends up going back to the familiar scene of the sister on top of her badly chomped on and bleeding to death brother. Like the whole point of the show is these scenes. Even basically the only conflict of the show is the sister rampaging against the government/a research group (???) who captures both of them so she can get her brother back so she can go back to eating him.

Everything else is just salt into the wounds. The nonsensical plot, the continued besmirching of the horror genre, the cliches... like oh god... why butterflies? WHY BUTTERFLIES? A REALLY BAD AND GORY SHOW WITH BUTTERFLIES? [HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace).

It's just... oh god. This show is a cacophony of misery. Everything is wrong.

1 out of 10."
97833,"I entered with low expectations about this anime given the low overall score that the public threw but i really liked it, i appreciate the characters, history and animation,  they are flawed and sometimes painful to watch, but they also progress as the story goes, and all of them end up with a better understanding of the situation and personal growth, as well as coming to terms with differences in views. 

With parts that weren't always satisfying to watch is undervalued and totally misunderstood anime. A frustrating story but it makes sense because that's the premise. Even as it was painful, seeing the character meet or fail my expectations was what kept me cannot stopping watching.

The innocent Yuma and the seductive Hotaru, Takeda, an inexperienced and responsible boy and Fujiwara, a playboy, the story is reduced to these four characters in one complex spiral.



For me the most murky character is Hotaru, a psychological torturer, masochist and sadist at the same time, all in one but that you don't stop loving.

The key of the anime for I was watching someone deal with and break out of the tsunami of denials that internalized homophobia forces onto you. I do not often see the internal conflicts that can come with being gay, where you're fighting against your own subconscious attempts to reject a significant part of you like Hotaru's self-destructive tendencies or the heartbreaking thought processes you experience while in that Yuma mentality.

Sentences like  ""Are you still playing lesbian?"" →  ""It's not a game""  make the anime really strong and important, not making it the typical yuri in a fantasy world but entering into social criticism.


Unfortunately, that's the universe a lot of people live in. It seems that acceptance of the LGBT community isn't as widespread yet in Japan, so I think it's ok to portray such a community exists - especially since the characters ended up rebelling against that line of thinking (that girls can't be in a romantic relationship).

I loved how Yuma manages to overcome that and get a happy ending, that's all I wanted.

Definitely not a anime for everyone, but I'm glad I show it.  I feel like people aren't giving it credit for having girl characters actually realize and admit they they are lesbians in a real world situation where they were dating boys to begin with or by believing that it is a simple yuri ecchi without fanservice and without depth.

The anime that concluded with 12 episodes with a 6-minute (without opening/ending)   wasn't really NTR, but a realistic and complex yuri romance (after some entertaining angst!)"
13367,"Shogo Mikadono had been living a comfortable, carefree life up until high school. As the only child of the Mikadono group, a wealthy network of the Mikadono family and it’s friends and business partners, he’s been selected as the sole heir to the company and family name that his father, Kumagoro Mikadono, has dedicated his life to strengthening and expanding. Unfortunately, on the day of his ageing father’s death, when Shogo is finally given a taste of what’s written in the family patriarch’s will, it’s revealed that in order for the young heir to inherit his father’s very lucrative estate, he must undergo one final task; To enroll at a certain high school, fall in love with a dignified and agreeable classmate, and make her his fiancee, with whom he’ll be sharing untold riches on the day of their marital vows! It might not be the most romantic grounds for a proposal that anyone’s ever heard of… Still beats the idea of having to come together to repopulate the earth, when you get right down to it… But for a rich man to marry an attractive woman who’s only interested in business and money isn’t a new concept, and it certainly isn’t unheard of.

However, as is the unfortunate pattern of life, even the simplest plans must become complicated somewhere down the line. Not long after hearing about this stipulation, he’s confronted from just out of reach by a soft, reassuring voice that he won’t always be alone… That the owner of the voice is his long lost sister, who has every intention of marrying him and staying by his side forever. Wait, did I say soft and reassuring? Because I meant deeply concerning, as it turns out that his father did in fact father an illegitimate daughter who’s been separated from him since birth, and to make this revelation even more shocking is the fact that the girl with the voice is also going to his new school! Now, his attempts to pluck a bridal rose from a garden full of crazy weeds is being hampered by the fear that one of his sultry suitors may actually be his secret sister! This matrimonial minefield is made even harder to cross by the fact that with each step that moves him forward, he’s being confronted by red herrings that are only pretending to be his sister for their own ends. Can Shogo safely pick the woman of his dreams and collect his rightful inheritance, or is the only thing he’s bound to inherit a deformed child and a one way ticket to Alabama?

You know, the longer I do these reviews, the more likely I am to cross every single animation studio off of my list at some point. This time around, we’re talking about Studio Gokumi, a company that spun off from Gonzo in the early 2010’s. The name literally means Studio Group 5, which… I don’t know. I have no idea what that does, or even COULD mean on a larger scale. In any case, they haven’t done very much work, although I have seen two of their shows before, namely A Channel and Yuki Yuna is a Hero, two shows whose best qualities were their visual qualities. A Channel, like most of Gokumi’s early work, was low budget, but managed in such a way that it’s lack of funds could never hurt it in any noticeable way. Yuki Yuna, like most of Gokumi’s later work, was gorgeously animated with a lavish budget that the producers took full, appreciative advantage of. Between the two, Nakaimo is closer to A Channel, being one of the studio’s earliest projects, and it looks way better than it really needed to look, given the nature of the material.

True to form, Nakaimo looks perfectly fine. The visuals aren’t mind-blowing of world-challenging, but they’re more than serviceable enough to be above complaint. The animators were very clearly working with a tight budget, so the movement on screen is never exactly fluid, but the characters still move just as much as they need to to convey a sense of life. There are shortcuts taken, which is kind of inevitable in such a situation, as movement occasionally has to be limited to save some money, but it’s never prominent enough to bother even the most astute viewer. Not to mention, these shortcuts pay off with interest when the show DOES want to dazzle us with more impressive shots, such as one of the main characters swimming in beautifully animated water, or when they need to show us random CG effects like a can flying at someone’s head from off screen. I’ve said before that given the choice, I’d prefer a well-managed low budget over a lackadaisical high budget at least seven times out of ten, and Nakaimo easily delivers on what I wanted to see from it.

The artwork is also very pretty, with it’s only real flaw being certain shots where the background has an unnatural sort of heavenly shine to it. It doesn’t happen often, thankfully, but it’s irritating when it does. The backgrounds are fairly well drawn, and while most man-made backgrounds to have a surprising level of intricacy in their design and range of details, things like grass, trees and bushes do blur a bit when you look at them closely. The characters themselves are drawn to type, milking the most cliched archetypes of the ecchi genre dry, extending all the way to the teacher being a little girl. You’ve got the cosplaying loli, the pigtailed flat-chested tsundere, the overdressed goth-loli sweetheart girl, and of course Itsuke from Haruhi as the protagonist. It’s saving grace is that once you get past the clichés, the characters are still designed and drawn really well, although the constant blushing can get extremely annoying. The lighting and filtering effects are also utilized well, if not very often.

The soundtrack is a bit on the generic side, but it’s not bad by any means. It’s very pretty in it’s orchestration, but it’s also really repetitive, as any given track just loops around every few seconds or so. It does it’s job well enough, and you’ll hardly notice it, unless it’s doing the one thing about it that impressed me… Instead of playing off the little sister mystery as sexy or romantic, moments dealing with the mystery… AKA phone calls allegedly from the sister and certain off-color remarks tying into it… Are paired with music that actually manages to make the concept feel creepy or ominous, which is how it damn well should feel, so props for that. The opening theme, Choose Me Darling by StylipS, is your typical fast, catchy song from multiple harmonized female singers, but what makes it awesome is the percussion underneath it, which creates a pretty memorable beat. That, and i’m pretty sure a decent amount of the animation budget went into it, as it makes for a pretty awesome watch, and it goes out of it’s way to introduce the characters and several plot points that happen throughout the show.

The English dub was produced by Sentai Filmworks, and before I start doling out the praise… Of which I have plenty to go around… I’m going to have to go into some negatives, because Nakaimo’s dubbers made two huge mistakes. First of all, I was shocked to see that Steven Foster wasn’t on this dub. Yeah, he quit a while ago, but I’ve only ever seen lip-synching this bad under his direction. In his heyday, his response to the critics blasting him for his translation choices was to release dubs where he stayed true to the original Japanese right down to the letter, and stopped giving a fuck about lip flaps. These were his better dubs, so I’m kind of assuming the company figured out from him that they can do this to save some time and effort and still remain on peoples’ good sides. This purely speculative explanation, whether true or untrue, doesn’t excuse the final product, where characters talk while their mouths are closed and stop talking while their mouths are still open. It’s over-all a pretty sloppy job, but the other mistake is even worse.

See, there are several voice actors in the anime industry who have immediately distinctive voices. I like to bring these individuals up as… How can I put this gently… Target practice for beginner voice chasers. You don’t need much experience in voice chasing to recognize voices like Greg Ayres, Luci Christian, Monica Rial, Brittany Karbowski, J Michael Tatum or Hillary Haag, because while these are all fantastic actors, they can not disguise their voices for shit. This usually isn’t a problem, as you don’t need to be a chameleon to be a good actor, but Nakaimo presents a unique circumstance. The plot of the story revolves around finding out which member of the harem is Shogo’s little sister, and right in episode 1, we’re given a brief clip of the sister’s real, unfiltered voice. Sentai was clever enough to not credit this voice, but it uses the same actor as the eventually revealed sister character, and they used the most distinct-sounding voice actor they had. They could have used Emily Neves, who’s actually really good at disguising her voice, but nope! Even the most unseasoned of viewers can figure out the mystery as soon as the sister talks again.

For this reason and this reason alone, I almost want to recommend the Japanese track with subtitles, as the sub didn’t make this mistake, but if you did that, you’d be sacrificing what actually turns out to be a pretty awesome dub. I’ll admit that Clint Bickham is a bit awkward in the beginning, but he grows nicely into the character before long. Monica Rial and Brittany Karbowski play his two most prominent love interests, and of course, they’re more than reliable even with the worst material, which is good, because by the end of episode 1, they’ve respectively gushed to themselves over how puffy and cream-filled their boobs are and tried to badger Shogo into sticking his tongue into them through convoluted logic. I would not trust lines like this to any other actors, so thank god the director knew what material to drop in front of what actor. Most of the actors are newcomers and less-popular names, with the exception of veteran Tiffany Grant as the trio’s homeroom teacher, and while everyone does a pretty damn good job, none of them stand up enough to be brought up on the same platform as our three leads. If it wasn’t for the serious misstep I mentioned earlier, I’d tell you to skip the dub and watch it in Japanese… You know what? Screw it, just do that. Good acting isn’t worth spoilers.

Off the top of my head, I can pick out two genres and one trend that have dominated the anime landscape in recent years, earning an equal amount of ire from anything but the lowest common denominator of the anime viewing community. These genres are Harem and Moe, and the trend… One that many critics wish would just go away and die already… Is incest. Specifically little sister incest, because incest without focus apparently isn’t abrasive enough. The harem genre has been a mainstay for decades at this point, and in it’s trek through time, it’s become one of the laziest, samiest things imaginable. I mentioned earlier that the characters were drawn to type, and that’s because there are a lot of repetitive types to draw from. Moe hasn’t been around quite as long, but it’s become just as repetitive with it’s sexist characterizations and shameless melodramatic tragedy porn. These three elements are copied and pasted to death because they work… People flock to them, both here and especially in Japan, so nobody bothers changing it. That would be all well and good, if it wasn’t for the crushing feeling that people pushing out this material know damn well that they don’t have to try.

Well, this was more or less what I was expecting when I bought the series on DVD, but I was very quickly astounded to notice just how much this series DOES try. It puts forth genuine effort to be more than the some of it’s parts. If you haven’t had the mystery spoiled for you… Which means you’re probably watching the sub… It’s a shockingly good mystery, played out through a story that’s way more interesting than anybody should justifiably expect it to be. A character is introduced in episode 2 who’s supposed to be the show’s stand-in for one of the worst harem tropes imaginable, the ever insulting “Trap” character, and while I won’t tell you just what their deal is… It’ll be more satisfying that way… I can think of two reasons the character was introduced. The first I’ll get to later, but the second ultimately makes them my favorite character in the show. Instead of acting as a member of the harem, they exist to help Shogo unravel the mystery of his sister through their epic set of ninja investigation skills. This in turn adds a little more depth and attention to the plot, which can often be forgotten among the tons of fanservice.

The story has many twists and turns, and a handful of the characters do get individual arcs, which is a common enough way for a story like this to explore each member of the harem, but Nakaimo does it a little differently. While each arc ties into the fleshing out of an individual character, they also revolve around the mystery of his sister’s identity, with each one setting up what we’re supposed to believe is a new red herring for him and his gender-neutral ninja sidekick to discuss and solve. Each character with the exception of the student council president has their own backstory, their own tough circumstances, and their own reasons for getting tied into the mystery. What they don’t have, however, is individual reasons to pursue Shogo, because guess what? Half the harem don’t even really want him! Only three of the six girls compete over him, with the other three busy pursuing their own interests that he may or may not be relevant to. It’s a pretty sad commentary on the repetitive nature of the harem genre that THAT’s a breath of fresh air. Having said that, I liked these characters, underwritten as they may have been, and I genuinely cared what happened to them. Shuffle and Maken-Ki didn’t make me feel that way.

After all that praise, you’re probably expecting me to call Nakaimo a genre defying masterpiece, right? Oh God no. It may be one of the better products of it’s genre, but it’s still a product of it’s genre, and as such, it comes with a lot of the same trappings. When it comes to the writing that carries the series to it’s full run, coincidence is the rule, not the exception. It’s hard not to roll your eyes at how the different arcs incorporate themselves into the little sister theme, from a girl claiming to be his sister to promote her little sister maid cafe to the entire school thinking Shogo’s so awesome that calling him Big Brother becomes a trend. Even when the plot gets really interesting towards the climax, it doesn’t… DO… A climax, and very little is actually followed up on. Also, I should probably mention that there’s a ton of nudity in this anime. Not only that, but they go out of their way to show every female character named at some point… Well, thankfully, this excludes the little girl teacher. I generally separate nude scenes into categories of integral, incidental and forced, and while Nakaimo’s are all over the place, most of them feel forced. Hell, the other reason the gender-flip character exists is to guarantee maximum flesh output. Seriously, their excuse for casual nudism makes the chick from MGS who breathes through her skin seem legit.

Oh, and by the way, if you’re one of the special little snowflakes who gets triggered when they hear a work of fiction called ‘sexist,’ you might want to jump on over to one of my other works. “You can’t call a fictional work sexist, that’s stupid, it’s not real!” Yeah, well, there’s a reason the term pop culture has the word culture in it. The way you write people is a reflection of the way you view them, and the popularity of the work is a reflection of how accepted that mindset is. Nobody watches Coal Black without thinking “That’s racist.” On that note, there are several character constructs of the harem genre that I consider sexist, and while Nakaimo only hits a few of them, it’s still really bad. Girls holding onto a crush for well over ten years is sexist and unrealistic. Girls becoming obsessed over a boy over a misunderstanding that makes her think they’re betrothed is sexist and paints women as idiots. Girls being so thirsty for the D that they claim being a pedophile is better than being gay is… Well, I’ll give them this, at least it’s a new one. But it still ties into the harem genre’s age-old insistence that girls will obsessively want the self-insert male character, and through him, the lonely male viewer.

If there’s one area where this show actually did come close to impressing me, it’s with the actual little sister character. While the series begins on a note that some sexy, exploitative Imouto hijinks are about to go down, you find out by the end that while the plot line is wildly misguided, it does manage to follow a more scientific interpretation of incestuous feelings, ala the idea of Genetic Sexual Attraction. In a nutshell, it’s been more or less proven that when two blood siblings aren’t raised as siblings, they’re genetically predisposed to find each other attractive later in life, and yeah, Nakaimo does adhere to this, whether intentionally or not. Unfortunately, I don’t think the writers really know what they had with this material, because it’s an uncommon enough subject matter that it still deserves to be taken seriously, and some serious groundwork needs to be laid down before it can ever be approached with this level of ecchi kitsch. I won’t spoil how the series ends, obviously, but like with all of it’s other promising aspects, it winds up dropping this ball pretty hard. Like I said before, I do appreciate it for trying.

Nakaimo, My Sister is Among Them is available from Sentai Filmworks, and can generally be found on Blu-Ray and DVD at a very generous 30-40 dollar price range. The original light novel by Hajime Taguchi is not available stateside, and I’m kind of feeling like that’s a good thing, because it continues way longer than the anime, and some of the spoilers I’ve heard about the extended story have been pretty cringeworthy. The manga adaptation, illustrated by Mottun, is also not available stateside.

Despite it’s unfortunate history, harem anime don’t have to be bad. They can be great, just like any other genre. The difference is that all the good harem titles I can think of were high concept works that used the genre as a backdrop for a clear, ambitious plot that received most of the writer’s focus. A few good examples would be Chobits and some versions of Negima. I wouldn’t put it anywhere near the same playing field as those titles, but for what it’s worth, Nakaimo DID vastly exceed my expectations. Of course, I was expecting it to be a 1/10 piece of filth, so that’s admittedly not saying much. It tried, and at the end of the day, that alone made me develop a soft spot for it. There was some genuine effort that went into making this title stand out among it’s genre, and while that effort might have ultimately been bogged down and silenced by the trends and clichés of the genre, it still makes enough of an impact to show what the genre CAN be. I enjoyed this show, I’d watch it again, and I’d even recommend it to a few people, but I’d be a bad critic if I didn’t judge it as a whole. I give Nakaimo: My Sister is Among Them a 4/10."
1117,"The world of Pokemon can be a strange, wonderful, and often terrifying place. Along with humans and a select few diminutive and unimpressive animals, this world is inhabited by a race of peculiar creatures known as, of course, Pokemon. These creatures come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny moles and worms to giant whales and rock-snakes, and while some of the smaller ones might make good pets, almost all of them are capable of devastating feats. It’s understandable that some people may give Pokemon a wide berth, avoiding them at all costs, but there are a few brave souls among us who dare to encounter them up close and personal on a regular basis, bettering themselves in order to overcome any obstacle the world’s Pokemon might put forth. We call them Pokemon Trainers, and the very best among them, who’ve captured or at least owned one sample out of every known Pokemon, are considered Pokemon Masters! Of course, realistically, there can only be one Pokemon Master, as a select few Pokemon are one-of-a-kind, and capturing just one of them destroys the chances for anyone else to achieve said accolade. Seriously, what’s up with that?

Among these unique creatures are the legendary birds, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. These Titans of unimaginable elemental power live on a series of islands near Shamouti in the Orange Islands region, engaged in an ancient stalemate over their territory, unknowingly guarding the dormant beast of the sea. Should any one of those three be captured and removed from the scenario, that beast will roar to life and throw the world into chaos. This legend has attracted the attention of Lawrence III, a Pokemon collector with a hunger for the rare and valuable. Using his incredible technology, he has every intention of capturing these titans in order to lure out the beast of the sea… Who he believes to be the legendary Lugia. Unfortunately for him, an old prophecy states that when the balance of power taming the beast becomes perturbed, a chosen one can step in and make things right again! And as it just so happens, Ash Ketchum and his friends are passing through the area on the way to their next Orange Islands gym battle, when they wind up getting dragged into the conflict. When the world turns to ash, will one of these brave souls step up and take the world’s fate into their own hands? Or will humanity become the next one-of-a-kind species?

Remember in my review of the first movie, how I said it struck the right balance between CG and 2D animation, and that the balance would get progressively worse with each passing movie? This is where it starts, and oh boy does it get off to a noticeable start. Right off the bat, we’re shown Lawrence’s Castle in the Sky, a giant floating base somehow kept in the air by slowly turning propellers. If this movie had come out a few years later, it would probably be paired with Feel Good Inc as it’s pop song BGM. Anyway, this thing is the most obvious, out of place computer-generated construct since the tongue beasts in the first Resident Evil movie, and two dimensional characters appearing in the same shot look about as real and natural as paper dolls taped to a very expensive child’s toy. It’s also pretty obvious how much money went into this thing, because about half of this movie’s animation is about as low quality as the show, with talking heads moving and freezing on still canvases, and barely any background movement in shots that have lots of people on them.

If that’s not bad enough, there’s a scene very early on where the team is traveling by boat, and they’re hit by a storm that causes some turbulence. There is a shot where Pikachu is standing nervously on the rocking boat in a close-up, and I swear to Arceus they just took the still image and shook it around to give the illusion of movement. Characters often seem to freeze into the background whenever they’re not talking, some of the scenes are very poorly shot(like Ash’s arrival on Shamouti), and a lot of the movie is distinctly out of frame, due to 4Kids’ decision to convert the film from widescreen to fullscreen. Another obvious CG effect is an entirely pointless scene where hoards of Pokemon are stuck on an ice sheet staring out into the water, but can still be seen moving from a mile away, including Kangaskhan doing her little sumo stomp. The only moments where the CG and 2D elements blend nicely to the tune of a decent budget, and thus the moments that differentiate it from future movies, are the action scenes, most notably when the legendary birds are fighting either Lawrence’s devices, each other, or both. The animation for these moments are breathtaking, fast paced, and over-all a joy to watch, to the point that I’d actually say it’s worth sitting through the rest of the movie’s animation to get there.

The music, however, is a step up from the first movie. The score is powerful and epic, particularly with the music that accompanies the action set pieces. Rather than a Danny Elfman sound, like the first movie utilized, this one has more of a John Williams sound, which is equally appropriate. Where the first film had a dark and ominous tone, this one plays out more like a grand, sweeping adventure, so the music has to be a lot bolder and, well, for lack of a better term, bigger. This does unfortunately result in a lot of the tunes sounding a bit homogenized, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as this type of movie kind of calls for it. It only tends to get annoying when it comes to what I can only describe as the musical motif of the film, a certain wind tune that a new female character introduces us to. She never states what she’s playing, and I can’t identify it by ear, so we’ll just call it an Ocarina. It’s important to the plot, so I can’t harp on it too much, but suffice to say it gets old pretty quick. Thankfully, with Lugia’s Song as an example, it rarely ever plays in the background without evolving into something far more awesome.

The soundtrack in this movie is nowhere near as embarrassing as the first one, as it seems to have been put together with a much better focus than it’s pop-song grabbing predecessor. The Ocarina motif that I mentioned before gets expanded into a full song by Donna Summer, which was based off of one of this movie’s three names, The Power of One. It’s a pretty great song, not gonna lie, but it’s very nature carries one of the most unfortunate problems with the english version of the movie, which I’ll get to later. The pop version of Pokemon World is also pretty awesome, even though it’s being sung by two nineties bands that haven’t been mentioned by living people for over ten years. Yeah, the song itself is fun, but it only really becomes cringeworthy if you watch the two bands performing it onstage, which is totally a thing on the DVD extras. Those poor teen bastards. Even the actors from Pokemon Live came away more dignity than that. Flying Without Wings by Westlife is a pretty decent song… well, at least the cut the movie used… And for a bit of unexpected weirdness, Weird Al actually pops up in the credits to combine the Pokerap with his own Polka trend.

It’s not what I’d call a perfect soundtrack, but at least they tried to keep things relevant this time around. But much like the first movie, there are tunes on the CD that didn’t make it into the movie… Dreams by Alysha Antonino has the makings of a pretty good song, but the production features the absolute worst flavor of the late nineties. The lyrics themselves are almost poignant in their message, but the orchestration is just butt ugly. The Extra Mile by Laura Pausini is really generic, and could easily be placed in the credits of almost any film without feeling out of place. I hate to get mean over a song that’s been lost in time, but when I buy a CD and load the songs to Itunes, this is the kind of song I leave off. The same could be said by One Heart by O-Town, which probably the most memorable forgotten band in existence, and With All Your Heart by Plus One. The only songs present that are as entertainingly bad as the last CD are Chosen One by The B-52s, which almost seems to be making fun of the movie’s prophecy, and They Just Don’t Understand, a song by a bunch of twelve year olds called Dream Street about their love of the franchise. This one also appears on the DVD in all it’s cringey glory, you’re welcome.

For the most part, there isn’t much I can say about the english dub without talking about the series, as the acting in this movie is pretty much the same as the series at it’s best. I’ve always felt that the acting was the best part of the 4Kids dub, with the writing always being more hit-or-miss, heavy emphasis on the miss. I will concede that Ed Paul as Tracey is slightly less annoying than Eric Stuart as Brock. That, and while it might just be my imagination, Addie Blaustein was putting forth a bit more effort than usual as Meowth. Another performance of note comes from Veronica Taylor, who we’ve all gotten used to hearing as Ash, but also gets to play Ash’s mother in this film, and she gets a really heartfelt exchange with him later in the movie. Eric Rath was a bit on the forgettable side in his turn as Lugia, and despite having just as little voice acting experience, Neil Stewart was quite a bit better as Lawrence. Nathan Price, who’s done a bit more than those two, does a great job as Slowking, making the character sound like a slow, dim-witted person who’s somehow come upon great intelligence but still speaks like he used to.

The worst thing about this dub are the changes it made to the material, of which there are far too many. There was at least one plot point that I hoped was a rewrite, but no, it wasn’t… The rewrites that do exist are way worse. The relationship between the Legendary Birds and the Beast of the Sea is given a much better explanation in the Japanese, although it’s still a work of fantasy, so it’s not THAT much better. There was originally a moment when Tracey was allowed to shine by helping his friends to science their way out of a jam, but that got cut, so he’s basically as useless as his Venonat was in the opening short. Much worse than these, and probably much more shocking to westerners who’ve never seen both versions, is the fact that the whole “Power of One” idea was entirely a dub-only concept. In the Japanese, not only was there no such thing as a ‘chosen one,’ but from what I’ve been told, there was no prophecy, either. The film actually had a heavy emphasis on teamwork, which makes more sense considering how much help Ash needs throughout. Much like the pacifism of the first movie, this just goes to show how confused 4Kids can get when it comes to teaching western-friendly morals. If you can, stick to the sub.

If you knew me around the turn of the century, you’d know that I was a huge Pokemon fanatic. If you were also a member of the Pokemon fandom, you probably also knew that I was a huge fan of the Orange Islands arc. To this day, it’s still my favorite season of the original series, and the only season that I own on DVD. It was just so different from anything that came before, or that’s come out of the series since. As far as I’m aware, it was the only season to not be connected to the games, although I did at least attempt to run the fan-made Pokemon Orange-version on my piece of crap MacIntosh. I loved how much creative freedom it had, as it wasn’t tied down to the formula of the Kanto region, as they didn’t have to dedicate each episode to revealing a new Pokemon, and they could just write episodes revolving around new concepts of older, already established Pokemon. Some very popular iconic Pokemon got to take center stage, like Lapras and Snorlax, and the battles didn’t have to be actual battles, and there was a lot more material for Pokeshippers. It was a breath of fresh air, and the news of an upcoming movie finally got my ass into theaters.

So how did it hold up? Well, you hardly need me to tell you how popular it is. While the critics were notoriously tough on it, giving it only a one point advantage over it’s predecessor, it is one of the most common fan favorites among the actual Pokemon fandom. It’s lowest review score on Myanimelist is a 6(until now), and none of those reviews lasted more than a single page(until now). It’s not hard to see why, because this was the first Pokemon movie to feel like an actual movie. It had a more epic, theatrical feel to it, with higher stakes and arguably a more ambitious story than most other Pokemon films. It introduced two Generation 2 Pokemon, not counting Elekid in the opening short, and the ones it did introduce in the main story were actually important to the plot, not cannon fodder in a random opening battle. It’s not often considered the best movie in the Pokemon line-up, that honor often goes to the Entei and Lucario movies, but it is a generally respected and highly regarded movie… Which is why it might surprise you to hear me say that it really isn’t THAT much better than the first film.

Now, credit where credit is due, it does a much better job following the traditional three act structure. In the first act, we meet the villain. We learn about who he is, what his plan is, and what will happen if said plan comes to fruition. We also get introduced to the main character, why he’s in the area, and how he gets drawn into the conflict. We get all the backstory we need, and then some, as well as intros of basically every single plot point that’s going to matter. In the second act, the plot picks up, and we see the main character set out to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible, even though the conflict is way bigger and more dangerous than he initially thought, and his inability to solve the problem leads him into a worsening situation, where things basically hit rock bottom. Finally, in the third act, the worst case scenario happens, the main makes a much grander stand, and it all builds to a climax that delivers on everything that set it up. Power of One follows the three act structure so well that it’s almost like the writers made a conscious effort to do so, and it’s ultimately the reason that the movie feels so much more like, well, a movie.

Having said that, a three act structure doesn’t guarantee the movie will be good, and for all of it’s grandeur and epic nature, this movie has just as much stupid, lore and continuity breaking material in it as the last one. First of all, harping on the English dub, the prophecy is completely pointless. Not only does it feel mind-numbingly stupid that some ancient prophecy knows who Ash is and decides that only he, one of the most incompetent heroes in anime history, can possibly set the world back to right, but there was nothing in the prophecy about Lawrence starting all of this conflict. It also doesn’t work in terms of the story, because Ash doesn’t need a prophecy to tell him to go into action and save the world… He’s a good person, he’ll do it anyway! Hell, I wouldn’t even make that point if it wasn’t for the fact that (mild spoilers in this sentence) Team Rocket, the show’s signature antagonists, decide all on their own to turn over a new leaf and act heroic for the sake of saving the planet. Ash needed a prophecy to call him out by name(In an oh so clever pun that fooled absolutely nobody), but Team Rocket are the altruists in the scenario? Bull to the motherfucking shit!

Going right back to act one, not only does Lawrence have a Pokemon trading card… Which just throws all kinds of logic out the window, because this isn’t Digimon Tamers we’re watching… But the exposition he gets from his computer makes no sense. It identifies the prophecized Titans as the legendary birds, which means he likely didn’t know that yet, and since the prophecy mentioned nothing about Shamouti, how the hell is he already in the area? And why are Ash and friends taking a ferry, when they usually just ride on Lapras’s back? It would make sense in a Pokemon game, but they never had random encounters on her back before. Also, how did Lawrence and Ash move into position on the exact annual day that the island was expecting this exact catastrophe to occur? Then in the second act, we get such gems as Tracey being useless, a flying sailboat, Ash trying to tackle an electrified cage, and to top it all off, there’s a strong implication that in order to catch all existing Pokemon… Or to “Catch’em All,” which is explicitly the catch phrase of the series, you would have to destroy the world as we know it in the process. I don’t think they really thought this through.

Then the third act happens, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it damn near justifies everything. In the first movie, the “third act,” if you could call it that, is where it failed hardest, as it used it’s climax to crawl right up inside it’s own ass. This, however, is what a third act is supposed to be. Every single plot point, even the worst ones like Misty bantering with Melody over her crush on Ash, comes to a satisfying conclusion. Even though there’s well-animated action scenes throughout the movie, this part of the story upstages all of them, as it should, with Lawrence being largely written out of the story so the birds themselves can fight among themselves, and it’s as awesome as it sounds. That’s not to say nothing stupid happens… Bulbasaur and Squirtle are shown to run as fast as Charizard flies, in a scenario when he really should have tried to call out Lapras, and the dialogue between Melody and Misty ends in an exchange that doesn’t make much sense… I’m assuming only one person in that group has any idea how to play the Ocarina… But it doesn’t matter, because every moment leads to something great. Does that make all the stupid crap that we had to sit through to get to that point okay? No, not really, but at least there’s something at the end worth sitting through it all for. It’s not much, but it’s something.

Pokemon the movie 2000, also known as The Power of One and Revelation Lugia, is available from Viz Media in both single format and a three-pack with the first and third films. . You can also find the out of print original DVD from Warner Home Video, albeit at a much more expensive price. Unlike the first movie, you can also find the soundtrack and score on the same CD, although brand new copies are quite a bit more expensive. Netflix generally has about four or five different Pokemon movies available for legal streaming at any given time, and this is occasionally one of them.

Despite my criticisms, this is my favorite Pokemon movie, and it’s the one I have the most nostalgic feelings for. There are at least two scenes in it that make me cry… One involving Team Rocket, the other involving Ash’s mom… And that’s something no other Pokemon movie can say. It also expands upon the lore in a lot of interesting ways, such as giving a few characters first names for the first time. Of course, just because it’s my personal favorite doesn’t make it one of the best ones. I wouldn’t even call it one of the top five. Looked at as a sequel, it just barely surpasses the first movie in terms of scale and execution, but the story is still based on coincidence, there’s still a lot of dumb and inaccurate material, and it breaks the fourth wall more than any Pokemon movie should. It doesn’t fall into the trap of pushing a confused and hypocritical moral, but it only pulls this off by not trying to push ANY moral… Which is probably the smart way to go, but it still doesn’t convey the kind of growth that a sequel should go through. It’s sense of pacing, structure and emotional resonance, as well as it’s killer third act ultimately saves it, but doesn’t vindicate it. I give Pokemon the Movie 2000 a 5/10."

8 Months since I completed Vampire Hunter D (1985)
7 Months since I completed BLOODLUST (2000)
And 7 months since I first started indulging in the Light Novels 

This review marks the beginning of something that I’ve been waiting to do for a long time ever since starting my journey with Vampire Hunter D and I’m not stopping here I plan to do a total review of the original adaptation film in 1985 and complete it off by doing a comprehensive review on the Light Novels both one for a blanket review on the series as a whole and individual novels which I make posts on

VHD takes place In the year of 12,090 AD the earth exists as a post-nuclear holocaust world that used to be governed by Vampires that ruled over humans using occult science and technology humanity had forgotten about after they had destroyed themselves in mutually assured annihilation

Though after an era of being ruled over an unknown shift within the Nobility saw to it that their race began to diminish with the humans gaining enough power to seize the capital from the once monolithic and timeless rulers of the night

Among this period rose the job of the Hunters which propelled forward imbued with predatory skills ranging from the biologically enhanced bio warriors to mystical and extramundane sorcerers though one thing was certain which was the cold and cutthroat nature that attracted the fringed minded to a particular class of hunter

The Vampire Hunter  and among them, one stood head and shoulders adept beyond the ephemeral and fallible humans 

 a half human half vampire.

 Previous Discography and How an aptly fit they were for D

Before I gorge myself in rambling about this film I think it’s worthy to note Kawajiri and his timeline of credits preceding Bloodlust which each felt like pulsing increments that had paid headway into the culmination of this flourishing kinetic, gothically lavished, viscerally violent action epic chase


--

To start this isn’t Kawajiri’s first tackling of adapting author Hideyuki Kikuchi’s writing- to the 2D plane with in fact multiple of Novels being turned in films like Wicked and Sin City

But I believe it's Kawajiri’s resonance with more “Darker Animation” that lead to a melding and resonance with VHD whose pulpy action and horror adventure attributes made it popular in the west

pursuing even a second through the man's storyboarding style shows off how potent Kawajiri is when framing different shots with a grandiloquent fashion whether it's the appearance of his main hero or a character cocking and readying his aim with grim resolute

or displaying creative environmental ordeals and fights that burn themselves into our retinas with the ingenuity of the aforementioned elements to test the mettle and adaptability of our characters

Kawajiri brings the visual flair to match Kikuchi's literary prose that dabbles in highly detailed verbose metaphors that illuminate flashes of spectacles and savage skirmishes

>“The crescent blade flew from the hand of the man in black. While it wasn’t clear what it was constructed of, it wove through the trees, speeding to the spot at which the giant glowered. It was an assault devoid of ceremony but steeped in murderous intent.
There was a beautiful sound. A silver flash of light coursed back out between the trees.
Behind the two men who yelped and jumped out of the way there was the sound of steel cleaving darkness.”

>Excerpt From
Demon Deathchase
Hideyuki Kikuchi

it's due to this that gives the impression that Kawajiri is at home with Vampire Hunter D not simply trying to execute Kikuchi's vision (though from an interview the man holds no deep fervor for animation) but understands Vampire Hunter D as a series and in some ways its the model mold for his talents


img {
  border-radius: 8px;
} 

and most importantly transferring the awe and glamour of D to the visual animated fronts

--



Kawajiri wasn’t the only one to be noted as such members like Takeshi Koike’s contributions to such strong action and gorgeous movement can be well illustrated as every scene seems to be charged with even the most minor of momentum on the character's profiles lending to blistering visual exchanges and all of this seems to fall well in line with Koike as a man seemingly obsessed with the idea of motion that ripples the fabric or distorts the visages of the characters, especially with one of his most prominent animated feature films Redline seemed to be quite hinged and predicated on such a founding philosophy 

webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a3751d5dd2c520552ad4cac39777e080.mp4)



Actually there can be several recognizable aspects between Redline and Bloodlust in terms of fluid action and the visual designs of the characters sporting distinct and lavish shadows that would be quite a challenge for any animator to try to track in movement but both films do quite an expert job



Though in terms of aesthetic styles Redline leans far more into being a dapper, comical, raunch, and pulpy greaser which matches step for step with its insane volatile dare-devil race to the extreme plot line seemingly enhancing the extremes

Whilst Bloodlust is more predisposed towards a gothic horror and pulpy action epic flick whilst still maintaining an uninhibited grimness that stems from the dark post-holocaust setting it finds itself in combining elements of romanticized horror and westerns with a ruthless polarity that befits Vampire Hunter D as a series

 Story Elements of Bloodlust



in contrast to 1985 Bloodlust has a more active plot with 1985 being more in line with a Castlevania game I mean there's an entire segment of D making his way through various traps and enemies that range from mutants to even demons roaming the castle and even spectral non-tangible enemies also helps that Vampire Hunter D helped sow the seeds for Konami with heavy omages to D and Alucard and D sharing a somewhat similar character setup up ethereal half-vampire beauties that are swordsman on a quest for Dracula (or in D's case The Sacred Ancestor) and are descended from them or in D's case HEAVILY IMPLIED

not to mention the castle shot in the beginning of Castlevania and the Whip being signature references taken from the 1987 Vampire Hunter D movie


img {
  border-radius: 8px;
} 


the story having more exposition into the world of D wether its on the precedent history the people of the frontier have with the Vampire Nobility, various details on the Nobility, or even little bits of info that gleam into a long-since forgotten part of history when it comes to the lore of Vampire Hunter D's dense world and history

Bloodlust on the other hand takes a stance more focused on brevity at times that leans towards Kawajiri's strengths of strong action sequences and dynamic shots that ooze cool 

in 1985 the dialogue had more patronizing dialogue that focused on explaining things to the audience and it was rapid fire at times and you can argue the importance of some bites of exposition in terms of narrative importance over others. Bloodlust on the other hand is more succinct and terse which can somewhat fit a more action centric and grim narrative where a lack of dialogue on what the characters are feeling over palpabley experiencing the waves of shock or mixed and unsure resolution make the experience more poignant 


img {
  border-radius: 8px;
} 


this can really show in the contrast of action moments to moments accompanying a sense of silence or peace in a lulling manner that doesn't bear the hearts of the characters straight out but lets you gleam into them in a very human manner that some anime with more ""say what you feel"" dialogue doesn't.

when it comes to D's design I have a bit of a gripe with 1985’s design work for D which has a weird sci-fi 80’s western cowboy design aesthetic with spandex and a flamboyant cape with a pointed outward collar at the base of the neck creates a bizarre and mismatched design


img {
  border-radius: 8px;
} 


besides all the clothing there's the primary issue I have which is that skin tone of D feels very displaced from what any sense of a hybrid half-vampire/dhampir though the first instance of the term originated from Balkans folklore though I digress

even going from the official artwork and illustrations made by Yoshitaka Amano a big feature is his pale skin that evokes the color of moonlight

with Bloodlust I feel like they tried to balance the aesthetic precedent key features of Amano's artwork and meshed it with Yoshiaki Kawajiri and Yutaka Minowa who has worked on Ninja Scrolls which I previously referenced 

D in this version wears a skin tight black body suit that outlines the countors of his muscular frame which personally fits more in line with making D a more intimidating figure and I'm personally more for this Kawajiri's design take as it mixes a bit of a steely and grim tone

for brevity's sake and not to get too derivative with the review I'm not sure what next I'd want to review here's some of the things I'm thinking about writing about and things I already have a framework for and are already writing

- Kyoko Honda


I never expected in my entire life to have an opportunity to get to Japan for the first time in my entire life. I considered myself, one of the luckiest people on the whole, to get a chance to see this film. And in the end, it was worth it. I'll just make a quick review of this film.

Fruits Basket prelude is a new film made by TMS Entertainment, from a new story of Natsuki Takaya, and covered some chapters that didn't include in the final season. The story covered the summary of the three seasons, the story arc of Kyouko and Katsuya, and the aftermath story of Kyo and Tohru after the events of the final season, written by Natsuki Takaya, respectively. We all know that having a recap from a show is entirely useless. But some recaps are bearing to watch and they can find it enjoyable. This is one of those shows, that had some recaps. But do you think it was worth it?

The first act of the film was the recap of all the seasons of the TV series. I think it lasted half an hour or less? Well, watching this recap made me remind the recap version of the entire Clannad series. It was pretty good for a recap, even the pacing was like a rapid-fire. I certainly felt some emotions, but it's not the same feeling as I felt from the TV series. The execution of this recap is better than Orange Mirai movie, in which the recap from that movie was poorly executed. I understand why they had to condense it. Because the movie will be short if they didn't include the recap. Overall, it was a good nostalgia for those who cherished the TV series. Guess who was the narrator for the recap? Just wait and see.

The second act of the film was the arc where the real magic starts. The story of Kyoko and Katsuya. For those who are saying this is a controversial story, may I remind you this was written way back in the 1990s. Well, it's your judgment if you find this pretty bad. So back to the topic, this story is one of the most beautiful, yet very tragic stories I've ever seen. I read this part from the manga but seeing this on the big screen made my heart flutter but at the same time, my heartaches. It's because I knew where this is going. Katsuya is a cool teacher to his students, especially Kyoko, But seeing him make Kyoko turn from a violent and problematic student to a better person and a better mom to Tohru was very heartwarming and touching. You may need a box of tissues for this.

So the final arc is the aftermath of the TV series and it's written by Natsuki Takaya. In the final act, I'd got to see again the main couple of the series, Kyo and Tohru, as well as the other characters. I didn't expect what happened in this arc but it was so lovely. Seeing those two being together made me tore a bit, after those many struggles they had faced, as they sought many answers. In the final episode of the final season when the two held hands like an old couple, I got to see it again but from a different angle. Although the final act was not as long as I was expected, It's still pretty solid and worth the wait.

The animation and the sound were still the same from the TV series, but they added a few details, especially the beach scene from Kyouko and Katsuya's story. The art was very stylish and sparkling. The amazing soundtrack from the TV series brought back the rollercoaster ride of emotions in every scene. Just like the emotions that I felt from the TV series.

Overall, I would give this film a grade of 9. While the previous seasons were very amazing, I wished this film could be longer than its initial time run. I hope many people watch this film on the big screen because it was an amazing experience.  If you're going to watch this, kindly bring a box of tissues. Because most of the parts were tear-jerking. Thanks for reading and once again, hands down to Fruits Basket and Natsuki Takaya. It's a two thumbs up for me."
7338,"Darker than Black: Origins as known in English is a wonderfully short but succint look into the events that transpired between the first and second seasons of the series. Having aired in Winter 2010, after the second season which was in Fall 2009, it can be considered a sort of midquel. I for one due to lack of information watched this between the two seasons, and honestly I'm glad I did. Season 2 would have had a lot of confusion if I had seen that directly after Season 1, and I don't think filling that in with Origins would have worked. Like some other series, I believe chronological order is a better watch than air order. But with that out of the way, let's move onto the specifics:

Plot: 6/10

Perhaps due to only being a 4 episode OVA, Origins doesn't really need to develop sub-plots to flesh itself out. We follow our protagonist and deutaragonist after the events of Season 1, and the consequences of their actions are played out. If you have seen season 1, then you will have a rough idea of the amount of work that goes into this, although it feels simpler and more cohesive here, which leads to a slightly improved rating.

Characters: 6/10

If anything took a knock in between 26 episodes and 4 OVAs, it would be how expansive the characters are being written. In the series defence, for the runtime, we actually get a lot of conversational scenes between many characters, and our protagonist Hei has his caring side fleshed out a good deal. However there just isn't much time to introduce any vital new information in this season, and basically all of the newly introduced characters are either one scene villains or internally resolved conflicts within the arc.

Animation: 10/10

God damn. The fights in this OVA are spectacular. From the very first scene we get an amazing three on one fight which cements the Black Reaper's skills and ruthlessness. Yutaka Nakamura (an animator) works on several of these fights and his work can be clearly seen for its brilliance (for an idea of his work, he did Deku vs Todoroki in MHA and also worked on some of Kekkai Sensen, Space Dandy and One Punch Man's best fights). There is only so much I can talk about really, but expect a mix of both quick skirmishes and extended multiple minute frantic fights, all with consistent animation quality.

Soundtrack: 10/10

Yasushi Ishii returns from working on the second season of the show and shows a perfect grasp of the type of series this is. He is known for specializing in experimental, jazz fusion and hard rock (having worked on both the original Hellsing anime and the 2016 Drifters anime), and this is clear to see here. A lot of the music in this OVA is admittedly shared with Season 2, but there are also plenty of original tracks. While Yoko Kanno's more sombre, subtle tones were indicative of the nature of the first season. The explosive and eerie tones of the latter seasons complement them well. And despite being a long time fan of Yoko Kanno, Yasushi Ishii's work here is nigh perfect and creates an incredibly unique sound, something which gets him full marks here.

Conclusion:

It is clear to say that I believe that Darker than Black: Origins is the peak of the animated series (I have read the manga sequel, but that may be for another time...), and it is a fun ride with only the commitment of seeing the first season. And even if you haven't, it is probably still serviceable to watch this first to get you into the series before backtracking to the first season."
8424,"This review may contain spoilers.

I completed this anime when I was around 16 and rewatched the first 3 episodes as a 22 year old. The review is based on those 3 episodes. The reason I rewatched it was because I didn't remember what I thought of the anime after going through my list and assigning new scores.

The story is set in the stereotypical setting of a highschool club filled with ""weird"" people. The characters have issues which they're trying to solve and the comedy comes from their struggles in doing so. Despite being a comedy, the anime fails in making me laugh.

The character designs are bland and the characters themselves aren't as funny as characters from series in a similar setting like [Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou](https://anilist.co/anime/11843/Danshi-Koukousei-no-Nichijou/) or [Seitokai Yakuindomo](https://anilist.co/anime/8675/Seitokai-Yakuindomo/).

The animation is okay.

The sound is okay.

I recommend watching Seitokai Yakuindomo instead of this anime if you are looking for something in a similar setting.

It is nice that the main character and his best friend can remain friends after his best friend reveals him his cross-dressing hobby.

Dislike

The story is set in the stereotypical setting of a highschool club filled with ""weird"" people.

Mio won't be able to cure Taro's masochism by torturing him, because he gets aroused by it. I understand this is done for comedic purposes but it didn't make me laugh at all.


Like

The main character, Taro Sado, and his classmate Arashiko Yuuno both understand they have issues and work on solving them. It's also nice that they support one another in trying to solve them. An example of this is how they went to the zoo and Arashiko tells Taro about the origin of her fear for men. Taro later on confronts the person who started Arashiko's fear and threatens him if he doesn't leave Arashiko alone. It works and she can leave her house after locking herself up in there due to anxiety after randomly meeting him.

Dislike

The god complex of the other main character, Mio Isurugi, annoys me. It's nice she wants to help people, but that narcissism bothers me.

The character designs are bland and the characters themselves aren't as funny as characters from series in a similar setting like [Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou](https://anilist.co/anime/11843/Danshi-Koukousei-no-Nichijou/) or [Seitokai Yakuindomo](https://anilist.co/anime/8675/Seitokai-Yakuindomo/). Mio's design stands out for me, because I like her bunny-ears like head accessory.

Taro's incestious mother and sister are annoying and not funny at all.

72,"I’ll try to keep this short and may revisit this as I have time.

Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu is an interesting anime because it marks the beginning of an era. As the first work from the groundbreaking Kyoto Animation studio, it represents the studio’s initial stretching of its legs and discovery of their signature style. FMPF features so much of the KyoAni feeling that we experience even today, from the music to the art style to the characters to the comedy. It’s almost its own history lesson into my favorite animation studio.

First – the bad. This show leans very heavily on fanservice, which I find to be really off-putting in a show that is designed to be comedic. It definetely finds its audience in those to whom crudeness is an appealing trait. What’s most frustrating is that there is very rarely an instance where this sort of use is actually beneficial to the comedic purpose of the show. Some of the most memorable episodes are those that lack any sort of fanservice and rather draw their magic from the character interactions. I found myself skipping almost entire episodes due to how frustrated I was with how heavily Fumoffu relied on sexualizing its characters and story. To be fair, however, as Kyoani’s very first work it’s conceivable they were attempting to not overstep the source material, and Shoji Gatoh’s work definetely targets a certain demographic in its crudities. However, I still found the sheer prevalence of fanservice in FMPF to be incredibly distracting, particularly when Kyoani demonstrated so well in the first two episodes that they could write an excellent comedy without such tactics. 

Next comes with some of the characterization. One of the MCs, Kaname Chidori, draws far too deeply on the raw tsundere stereotype. I realize that this is the main purpose of the show – to contrast the two MC’s polarizing personalities – but there is so very little to redeem Chidori’s character in my mind that she almost becomes a drag on the series on the whole. While this is a pretty obvious carryover from the original Gonzo-produced series and is definetely dealt with in The Second Raid, her constant presence in Fumoffu is almost irritating. Meanwhile, almost the entire rest of the cast (with some exception) is quite forgettable.

Secondly – the good. When this show is good, it’s actually fantastic. The first half of the second episode is my favorite 15 minutes in just about all of anime, and is something I’ve rewatched an embarrassing amount of times. The humor, while some may find it slapstick or banal, is just the right amount of ridiculous that you almost can’t help but laugh. Kyoani leans heavily on their use of well-placed one-liners and repeating shots to really hone in a certain type of humor that’s hard to describe. If we are talking about humor, then we will need to talk about the single greatest part of the entire series (and while we’re at it, the anime as a whole), the MC.

Sagara Sousuke is perhaps my favorite male character in any anime, ever, and really makes the humor in this show what it is. Sousuke is military kid taken to the absolute extreme, lacking almost any sense of how to act as a normal member of the society in which he finds himself. Sousuke is the antithesis of the show’s unfortunate crudities, an absolute juxtaposition of complete innocence in spite of his war-torn mercenary upbringing. Sousuke’s solution to everything is always in sheer contrast to what the rest of the cast expects, and his utter resolution to his duty and way of work makes the show a joy to watch beyond just its comedic merit. If you don’t watch FMP for the fanservice, you watch it for Sousuke, and rightly so. While these aren’t developed (and intentionally so) in FMPF, he also experiences some of the most outstanding character development I’ve ever seen throughout the course of the franchise, but that’s a story for another day. Sousuke turns the anime from a stupid wannabe comedy into something that’s truly funny and enjoyable.

So what else can I say? There’s no timing, no plot, no character development, just either straight comedy, weird fanservice, or somewhere in between. There’s some really fantastic frames and some really lackluster ones at the same time. Watch the good episodes in this anime, and skip the ones that don’t cut it. Enjoy the absolutely fantastic opening and ending (seriously, these were the very first OP and ED this studio put out, and they are both amazing). Love this show for what it should be, because the rest of the franchise is very different."

Naka no Hito Genome [Jikkyouchuu] (The Ones Within for short) tells the story of Akatsuki Iride and seven other fellow gamers who are caught by a guy (who for some reason is covers his head with an alpaca one) and are forced to play different games or else will die... figuratively, because that's the first problem of the series. Although throughout the series, Paka (and the anime in general) tries to make us feel worried about the safety of the protagonists, it fails miserably. Because, although The Ones Within is supposed to be a game of life or death, there are few moments when the characters are really in danger. I mean, they are obviously in dangerous situations in almost every game, but none of these situations feels this way for the viewer too. Being a series that tries to mix mystery and comedy at the same time, it's not surprising that one of the genres intercepts in scenes that it shouldn't, and therefore the scene doesn't manage to create the atmosphere that it wanted (mostly, comic themes in scenes that try to be serious). Although I could give examples, I wanna try to use spoilers as few as possible. 
On the other hand, another serious mistake made by the adaptation is to skip all content of the manga related to the context of the kidnapping (the goal of the game's existence, the actions of the participants' family after discovering their disappearance, Iride's past, etc.). Because of this, the anime became much simpler than the story really is, leaving in its adaptation only the games in which the characters participated and maintaining an episodic formula. Therefore, it's not surprising that the ending is unsatisfactory, leaving many loose ends for a second season that will probably never come (at the time I write this there is an OVA to be aired, but being an original story it doesn't change the anime's current state so much). However, not everything is mistakes in The Ones Within, only its structure.

Most of the characters, however, do work for their purpose. Each of the eight gamers is a specialist in a different genre of video games, but I won't touch on this subject because it's almost never important in the anime, with small exceptions. First we have Iride, who is the main character and the worst in the octet in terms of development. Throughout the anime, a mystery unfolds about Iride's past and his person, which never comes to anything. Although I understand that even the source (the manga) isn't over, I'm sure there are better ways to deal with a mystery of this kind that simply presenting it and hoping for people to read the manga to know the answer. Thanks to this, Iride has no evolution throughout the anime unlike the other participants. On the other hand, characters such as Onigasaki, Roromori, Oshigiri and Kudou do develop throughout history, which causes one as a spectator to become fond of them to a greater or lesser extent. Finally, we have characters like Karin, Aikawa and Paka himself, who are only ""there"" and maintain a static personality state during the course of the series.
!With regard to the secondary characters, those with the greatest participation are Sakura, Nanami and Chihiro, three former players who hide under the facilities. The three appear quite little in the series, so we don't get to know much about them individually more than the fact that a love triangle develops between them.!

However, aside from what I have said, I must admit that the series IS indeed enjoyable. If you put aside those problems with Iride or the characters that do not advance, each episode is entertaining. In fact, although I said that the fact that we cannot feel fear for the safety of the characters is a problem, it's also a plus point. By this I mean that, since we know that the characters always end up safe and sound, the viewer can relax and enjoy the show for its comic side."
721,"A lot of people have said that Princess Tutu is not what it looks like. It’s not as girly as it sounds. Don’t judge a book by its cover. Well… I actually disagree with this. In many respects, Princess Tutu is exactly what you might expect. It’s a magical girl fairy tale with romance, ballet, a female lead, and a big bad villain who wants to ruin everything for the protagonist and keep her from her true love and there are several points that might make you feel like you’re watching a classic Disney Princess movie. BUT! I do not think that should stop you from watching this. Princess Tutu is truly a hidden gem. I had a lot of fun with this anime and I honestly think anyone of any age, man or woman can still love this show.


Princess Tutu in a nutshell is a story of a story. Once upon a time a man wrote a story of a prince who fought against an evil raven. During their battle the two managed to literally come out of the story and into real life. Eventually the prince prevailed and managed to lock the evil raven away forever. However, in the process he had to shatter his own heart in order to do so. Thus leaving him emotionless. Skip ahead to the present and we find that all the characters of the story now reside peacefully in a small town where they all attend a ballet school. This is where our main protagonist comes in. Ahiru. Who’s name literally translates to “duck” Which makes sense since she herself is in fact a duck who through the power of a pendent is able to take on the form of a human girl and it is her role in the story to collect and return the shattered fragments of the prince’s heart. At the same time our main antagonist Princess Kraehe attempts to prevent the prince from regaining his heart while also trying to free her father the raven.

This is definitely one of the more unique stories I have heard among fairy tales and while it may sound like just another typical fairy tale, the story’s execution is fantastic and it tells itself in a very realistic way and there were never any moments that felt too sappy, cheesy, or sugar coated. The story is exceptionally well written and contains a perfect blend of comedy, romance, drama, and even some dark epic moments.


The characters were definitely the highlight of this show for me. I immediately fell in love with ALL of the characters and I was only 2 episodes in when I just HAD to add Ahiru to my favorite characters list.

This show focuses mostly on five main characters.

Ahiru/Princess Tutu – Our goofy, kind and caring protagonist who’s only real desire is to restore the prince’s heart as she wants nothing more than simply to see him smile.

Mytho – The prince of the story who having lost his heart is left with no emotions or even any understanding of emotions.

Fakir – The knight of the story dedicated to protecting Mytho and doing what he believes is best for him though at times he comes off as very controlling.

Rue/Princess Kraehe – The primary antagonist of the story. Also in love with Mytho, she hopes to prevent Mytho from regaining his heart and is constantly getting between him and Ahiru.

Drosselmeyer – The writer of the story of ""The Prince and The Raven"". Having died after both his hands were severed, he now resides in another dimension where he watches over his tale as it unfolds before him.

The characters all act and feel very believable and they each have a good amount of depth and focus in the story. There is also great character development with not just the protagonist but with all the characters. As the story progresses and we learn more about the characters, some of them turn out to be quite different from who we originally thought they were and they develop very naturally throughout the course of the show. Even the villain goes through some growth. Every character is great and even the minor characters like Neko-sensei are very memorable. Because if you don’t do well in Neko-sensei’s class… He will have you marry him!


Princess Tutu is a fairly old anime dating back to 2002 and as such it has the art style you would expect from an older show. Despite this, the art is quite good for its time. It is very suitable to the show and has a real charm to it that makes it quite pleasant to look at.


Big fan of classical music? You’ll love this show. The majority of the soundtrack consists of popular classical tunes. Mainly those from the Nutcracker and if there was ever an anime that used classical music well, it’s Princess Tutu. The intro also has a very classical feel to it and goes great with the show. Same goes for the outro.

As for the sub or dub debate, Princess Tutu has one of the better dubs I’ve seen. None of the voices sounded bad and Luci Christian was an excellent choice to play the role of Ahiru (or as she’s called in the dub “Duck”) The original version is also spectacular and is worth watching as well. Want to watch the Japanese version? Every voice fits PERFECTLY. Want to watch the dub? The voices still fit perfectly. So watch whichever version suits your tastes. Or if you have time, watch both!


Princess Tutu is a highly under appreciated show that deserves far more attention than it gets. If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend it. Definitely one of if not the best magical girl anime out there."

No spoilers.



Chihayafuru is just brutal. It pulls no punches, ever. It has no hesitation about slapping its characters down. Everything does not always work out in the end. And despite that all...it’s hopeful. It’s truly joyous. When the protagonists win, it seems to matter in a way that doesn’t make an awful lot of sense from the outside. It feels, for lack of a better word, great.

And Chihayafuru is weird, too. It’s about a weird, niche sport that nobody outside of Japan has ever heard of, and probably one that precious few inside Japan care about. Karuta is a sport about memorising poems and then touching the cards with the second verse of those poems on them. What? How could this possibly be exciting? Yeah, okay, when you watch the real-life equivalents, they really are that fast...but the matches are kind of boring and kind of long.

I’m going to try and get into how it’s possible as much as I can. But it’s awful hard for me to explain some of this in words. I’ll do my best, but since a lot of the work Chihayafuru puts in is as much about what isn’t said as what is, maybe the only way to really figure it out is to watch it and read between the lines for yourself. Oh, and one more thing. I’m reviewing the series as a whole, so I’ll talk about stuff in the first and second season as well. As far as I’m concerned, this season stands on the work of the first two, but the first two are brilliant of themselves as well. Chihayafuru - in the anime, anyway - is not yet a finished story. So this review might change. The way this ends will matter a lot. But the going - the journey - matters too. And it’s an awful good one. But there's still a ways to go from here. And I’ll be along for the ride, whenever and wherever Chihayafuru decides to take me.

>Like a boatman sailing\Over Yura’s strait without a rudder\I know not where\The depths of love will take me - Story



Chihayafuru’s story is framed in a bit of a weird way to start. It seems a lot like your standard romance fare. A childhood friendship combined with some strong character dynamics initially establish a strong sense of place, but where Chihayafuru does the best is in establishing goals in terms of the plot.

There’s always a sense that the plot is regular, meaning things are going a certain way for a certain reason, and that means that the plot is often more about how the events drive the character relations rather than the other way around. For example, placing in a tournament is important in terms of its knock-on effect on the character interactions between Taichi and Chihaya. The people that the characters face in matches matter, not so much because it’s about who wins or loses, but because who wins or loses affects both players so deeply.

When Misusawa High School competes in a team match, the winning and losing matters besides just the simple fact of victory. When they win - and lose - it makes a difference to the characters. Ultimately, because we care so much about the characters, and I’ll talk about this more in a second, each match is so heavily freighted. Characters have defined goals, which means that in-narrative, there are serious stakes. That doesn’t mean characters will die if they lose. That’s lame. It doesn’t mean that it’s just as simple as romantic relationships are wagered on matches. Chihayafuru is better than that. What’s physically at stake in the matches is almost nothing. No money (as far as we know!), barely any prestige outside of the insular world of karuta. It’s just winning and losing. But what’s mentally at stake? A-ha. That’s where the whole nut of the thing is.

That is to say, the plot gives goals, and the character dynamics drive the stakes of the piece. 

And these stakes are regularly invoked, because characters lose, and lose hard. In those rare moments when Chihayafuru allows - yes, “allows” is definitely the right word - a second of respite from crushing loss, it is all the more cathartic and fulfilling. These players are no monstrous sports gods on a training arc toward their inexorable victories. They are fallible, and fail. Chihayafuru’s confidence that when its characters are knocked down, they’ll get up again, is second to none. And that confidence pulls watchers along with it, fervently hoping that maybe this time will be the time. That creates a lot of tension in the matches. Because you think they’ll lose. But maybe - just maybe - they could win when it matters. 

Here seems like a good time to mention that I really like the way that some cards are given in -narrative meaning. The obvious one is ""Chihaya's"" card - ""Even in the age..."", but there are some others. The show does itself a big favour by having poetry as a subject, which means that it can afford to be a weensy bit on the nose sometimes with which cards get read when. But...honestly? I don't really mind that much, especially when the poetry is so great.

On the surface, Chihayafuru is a sports anime, and one replete with all the tropes of that genre. Tournament arcs, competitions, long internal monologues during matches, side characters offering running commentary, the whole nine yards. And then another level deeper, it's a shoujo anime - in fact, it’s even got character designs reminiscent of that genre. Two pretty boys, a boyish girl, love triangle, you’ve seen the script before. Except it’s not. It’s something much more impressive and much fuller than just a sports anime or just a stereotypical romance-drama. With consummate skill, careful writing, and gorgeous animation, Chihayafuru realises a whole mental world in a way that I’ve only seen in a few other shows. It is a story that is worth telling. And maybe more importantly, it has a cast of characters that are worth knowing.

What it is actually under its exterior is nothing less than a brilliant study of character dynamics. That is especially impressive, given that one of the main characters spends almost all of the first two seasons, and a good portion of the third, completely offstage. Selling character dynamics like this is astonishingly hard, and Chihayafuru pulls it off with ease.

>Even in the age of swift gods and miracles\ I have never seen\Such burning autumn red\As drenches the Tatsuta River - Characters



You can sum up Chihayafuru’s characters by saying simply that you root for them. Always, always. Because nearly everyone in this story is basically a good person. Chihayafuru is better than having the foes of the main character be easy, hateable villains. Even Wakamiya, the character that you’d expect to just be a one-note “kuudere” antagonist, becomes so much more than that by midway through the second season, and even better in the third. By halfway into the show, there’s a very big cast of characters which the writers can call on almost at will to hang some new ideas on. And the confidence that the viewer will buy into the world enough to remember all the characters is nice. But, best of all, I think Chihayafuru does a great job at establishing a sense of place about the hobby. I noted this in my review of [Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju](https://anilist.co/review/7278), but I think one of the best things a piece of work about a hobby that is relatively niche can do is let the reader feel familiar with the world that it creates. Things like recognising readers, cards, and so on all really hook you in. The big interlocking network of characters Chihayafuru expects you to buy into allows for every single interaction to matter in the grand scheme of things.

But make no mistake, this is and was always Chihaya, Arata, and Taichi’s show. Although other characters may steal the limelight for a couple episodes, they always give it back to those three in the end. I think that the bond the author creates in the first few episodes, and then proceeds to explore and sell throughout the rest of the show is awfully good, and is a much better way of going about it than just a simple (boring!) love triangle.

The likeability of these characters stems from the fact that they’re always at least partially realised. I think we get a lot more insight into the motivations of the main three, but I’m always aware of the subtext of what almost everybody is doing. There are exceptions to this, of course, and sometimes Chihayafuru does just straight-up tell you what the characters want, but I think usually it’s left to your imagination. This lets character interactions feel heavy and meaningful. But there's such a light touch at play here, so gentle and so careful. Chihayafuru has good jokes and sharp moments to relieve tension. I think there are less of these running gags in later seasons, but they punctuate the story well.

Ultimately, characters are believable as people, and not just as 2D cartoons (joke intended). Chihayafuru gets you invested in what happens to its characters unlike almost anything else, even though the stakes are relatively low. That’s a testament to how worthwhile it is to know what is going on - how worthwhile it is to care.

>Though the waterfall\ceased flowing long ago\and its music is stilled\its name yet flows\and in fame it can be heard - Music and Sound



The sound design is probably a weaker spot of the show, if I’m honest. It does itself a lot of favours by being based on sound, and the voice acting in the reading is always really good...but sometimes things just feel a weensy bit off. I think this kind of works in Chihayafuru’s favour insofar as matches aren’t tense because of tense music but instead because of the plotting and characters, but there are definite missteps here.

Similarly, I think the OP and EDs are...fine. They’re all generic J-rock fare, with the first season’s OP being actively good and the subsequent ones being just passable. Animation in the OPs is good and well-synced, although it doesn’t matter an awful lot. Insert songs...could have been better. Nothing to write home about, really.

However, the voice acting...oh boy. Almost everyone turns in a hell of a performance, from the readers reading the poems, to Asami Seto as Chihaya and (by far the best) Kenta Miyake as Dr. Harada. The VAs sell everything from emotion to joy with equal range. There isn’t an awful lot for them to do sometimes - Chihayafuru is very visual, but they do a sterling job with what they are actually given.

>Gust of wind carries\leaves from the trees,\Giving the name of storm\to the mountain wind - Animation



OK. I could write thousands and thousands of words gushing about how brilliant and wonderful and incredible the animation by MADHOUSE is. I’ll try and keep this as non-hagiographic as possible, but it would be amiss of me to go any further without mentioning how transcendentally brilliant the animation of the karuta matches are. I might go so far as to say that they actually carry the show in its entirety. Without properly exciting karuta matches, this show is nothing. That’s why the animation matters.

I’m going to pick out a couple of things, though. First, the depiction of movement is so rock solid. The low frame-rate of anime makes it impossible (and impractical) to show people moving as fast as competitive karuta players do. Instead, MADHOUSE uses carefully framed freeze-frame shots to show speed, as well as animation of things like hair and fabric (oh god, the fabric animation is SO GOOD) to depict motion. There’s a real sense of weight to things onscreen, and it’s awful hard to imagine almost any other studio doing this.

Second, the show is very good at depicting skill. Probably the best example of this is the introduction of Master/Meijin Suo. By this point, we’ve seen an awful lot of players we know are very good. We’ve seen Wakamiya obliterate her competition with ease and unbelievable speed. And then Master Suo takes his first card and in literally one frame he just slams his hand down on it. It’s genuinely a jaw-dropping moment, as the true insurmountability of the best karuta players becomes clear. The sense of oppressiveness that comes from a brilliant player of this game is conveyed so well.

Third, the blocking and shot composition is almost always brilliant in the matches. While just ‘fine’ in the school scenes, in the matches (where clearly the majority of time was spent), every movement is so carefully storyboarded and framed to create an extremely kinetic and inertia-laden sense of movement and rhythm to the matches.

Finally, I think the show kind of does itself a favour by having romantic poetry as its subject matter (well, one of its subjects, anyway) because it gives it an awful big stock of imagery to draw from. But MADHOUSE doesn’t waste those ideas at all, giving each their fair share of screentime by far. 

If I had one criticism, I think the use of CGI flower petals, especially in the third season, sometimes gets a little bit much. I’m not sure how consonant it is with the general (general) realism of the piece to suddenly take a left turn like this. I don’t think it’s awful, and I think it’s generally used to good effect, but sometimes it can overwhelm all the other careful decisions.

>On and off, I think of former days\and how I long for thee.\More than e'en the clinging vines hanging\beneath the ancient eaves - Final Thoughts



I think Chihayafuru is excellent, but I don’t think it’s great. Why not? Because it is not a finished story yet. We’ve seen the main trio and the side characters develop an awful lot in competition and out of it, but their story isn’t even close to over. It’s barely begun, really.

Similarly, I think the story oftentimes moves on from moments a bit quickly for my liking. There are a lot of moments in the narrative which had some really great impact, but I always felt there might have been a bit more. Maybe it’s asking too much to hang so much on a silly game. But I don’t think it is. If there’s any show that can do this, Chihayafuru can. It can definitely become truly great - a true, moving, cathartic 10. There are moments I can think of that are possible within the narrative which, if executed well and animated to the highest standards, would top almost anything else. But they haven’t come yet...and I don’t know if they will. Look, I wish I liked Chihayafuru more than I do. I love the concept, I like the characters so much - some have become some of my absolute favorites. I wish I could give it a 10, a 90+ - I want so much to do so. I want it to move me deeply and touch me, I'm rooting for it. But it's not there...yet.



But you should watch Chihayafuru. You really should. It’s an awfully good time. And maybe, like me, you can join the ranks of people waiting. Waiting for the author to open her mouth and read the next card.

139821,"I have arrived in defense of one of my favorite releases of the season. Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is dramatic, angsty, beautiful and SO shoujo. 

img()


As someone who is a massive shoujo consumer, be it in manga or anime form, I can with confidence say that it has been a while since we got a shoujo adaptation that had a big budget and where the studio didn't seem to give up on it halfway through the season. This is a massive plus in my book because shoujo deserves GOOD adaptations as much the shounen and seinen demographic (don't even get me started on josei because we live in the trenches). 

The story of Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is very dramatic but at the same time also very slice of life. Personally, I think that they balanced these two very well. There are some extremely annoying characters in this, but also some lovely characters. Our MC Ann is a flawed protagonist; she's a hypocrite at times, she's idealistic and she's very stubborn. These characteristics, however, are what make her interesting and multidimensional. We still have a lot to learn about Shall, as of now he's mostly a mystery to both the audience and Ann. I'm excited to see more of him in July. The side characters are less developed, but they all have their own quirks and motivations that we slowly see throughout the season. Mythrill Lid Pod might have been my favorite character of this series, his presence is delightful, and he brings lots of happiness to the show.  

The art and color palette are beautiful. The animation is smooth, and it is one of the best we have had for shoujo in recent years, J.C. Staff did an excellent job.

Certain aspects of this show, such slavery, are for sure problematic. Nevertheless, there's also commentary on these topics and they aren't just brushed off and never brought up again. Most characters are very flawed and the villains are sometimes just too corny. I do like how the story touches on e.g. sexism and misogyny, even if it is a fantasy setting. 

![SPOILERS FOR EP 12] The finale was definitely bittersweet, I may or may not have shed a few tears. This just shows that I have grown to really love Ann and Shall these past few months. I'm going to be honest, if this show didn't receive a 2nd cour it would have affected my opinions on it a lot. For now, I'm hopeful and look forward to their reunion. Based on what we have seen from Ann we can definitely expect her to not give up on Shall!

Overall: I can 100% recommend this to fellow shoujo & josei fans and if you are new to the demographic, I hope you can watch this without bias. I'm so happy that the shoujo demographic has received a worthy adaptation, and I can't wait for the return of this show!"
3652,"The controversy surrounding the recent Higurashi GouSotsu series was amusing to watch because I purposefully chose not to watch them. I’ve always felt that Higurashi is the type of series that shouldn’t have had any side stories or direct sequels that take place after the last episode—because of how conclusive it was.

For those who don’t know, Higurashi Rei was the first set of side stories following the main story of Higurashi and Kai. Episodes 1–8 of the Higurashi visual novel and their anime adaptations (Higurashi Season 1 and Kai, or Season 2) were overall great psychological murder mysteries with a Groundhog Day-like scenario, and the way things built up toward the end was excellent—even if the pacing was a bit slow at times.

Higurashi Rei was clearly the first of many attempts to cash in on Higurashi's legacy and squeeze more money out of the franchise. Unfortunately, for the most part, I wasn’t really a fan of these OVAs.

The best way to describe them is that they’re half slice-of-life fan service and half a brand-new side story that focuses on Rika once again.

The slice-of-life segments are more or less what you’d expect from Higurashi—a lot of characters playing games and trolling each other. But this OVA leans more into generic fan service, with some harem teasing for the main male character, Keiichi. These moments are mostly inoffensive, but since I was never super into the slice-of-life aspects of Higurashi, I just found them whatever.

The main selling point of Rei, or its ""serious"" story arc, is Saikoroshi-hen (Dice Killing Chapter).

Without getting into spoilers, this is a direct sequel to the serious events of Higurashi Kai, where Rika is put in a situation that forces her to reconsider the choices she made regarding fate and everything that was built up in the first two seasons. Essentially, she is given a chance to live in a supposedly ""perfect"" world—one without all the drama, murder, and suffering. However, this comes at the cost of losing all the camaraderie, sacrifice, and character growth she and the others went through. Rika herself would also be a stranger to many of the people she once knew.

In theory, I like this idea. But in execution, it just felt like a cheap way to bring back drama. Higurashi Kai had a perfect ending for the serious parts of the story, and this side story felt unnecessary—arguably even insulting—by forcing Rika through melodrama again. The entire point of Seasons 1 and 2 was for her to develop beyond this struggle, yet this arc drags her back into it. The fact that the ""serious"" part of Rei happens because of a convenient mistake on Rika’s part makes it feel like an even bigger slap in the face.

Overall, the plot of Higurashi Rei isn’t a terrible idea—just something that honestly didn’t need to exist in a standalone entry like this. Given how bad nearly every Higurashi spinoff has been, I highly recommend sticking to Higurashi Seasons 1 and 2 by DEEN and/or the main eight chapters of the visual novel. Don’t bother with the spin-offs—unless you want to lose some brain cells."

“I believe in everyone!”

In the grand scheme of things, the 2010s are only just over. In every artform, at every level of discourse, there are discussions to be had and evaluations to be made. What defined the New ’10s, now that they’re in the rear view? Perhaps more importantly, what deserves to be taken into the future? 2011’s The Idolm@ster turns ten next year, but it remains the gold standard by which nearly every other idol anime since has been judged. If it’s not the best idol anime, it can feel, especially at its heights, like the only one that truly matters.

The first interesting thing about Idolm@ster is how unselfconsciously normal it is. This is an idol anime with zero gimmicks, perhaps simply due to being from a time where you just didn’t need one. (Being adapted from an already-popular IP probably helped too.) Instead you have a large cast of characters, a shared dream of stardom among them, and some snappy sugary J-pop to soundtrack it all.

img880()

Despite these simple and few ingredients (and the aforementioned size of the cast), Idolm@ster never really feels like a marketing tool, even though on some level it is. The earnest, unfiltered look into the lives of twelve girls who are, at the start of the show, working-class entertainers, conveys a kind of honesty more associated with rock documentaries than it is the idol industry.

This is not to say that The Idolm@ster is realistic–that would be absurd. Rather, it has a kind of focused idealism. The Idolm@ster does not depict so much the realities of becoming an idol (though they’re an influence on it), but rather the dream of becoming one. The series imagines a world where the truism that hard work and dedication can lead even the most humble of person to fame and fortune is not just true, but provable. This is an important distinction, because for all the mundanities it does depict, especially in its forehalf, The Idolm@ster is interested less in being about idols than it is being about people who want to become idols. It is a series, at its best moments, of character study, which elevates it above idol anime that come off [as simply trying to sell something.](https://anilist.co/review/6198)

img880()

In an impressive feat of economy, over its 24 episodes nearly every member of its cast (including a few who aren’t members of the core 765 Pro group) gets at least one focus episode, a few get full-blown arcs. Chihaya’s, where she comes to terms with the death of her brother and learns to sing for herself, is probably the best, but several others are also very strong. This includes Haruka’s, also something of a broad-reaching arc for the group itself, which concludes the series. Not all of them quite get the screentime–or the consideration–they deserve, and The Idolm@ster‘s few flaws are always somehow tied to this. Makoto’s abbreviated story never reaches any satisfying conclusion; the gap between the masculine way she is sold to her audience and the feminine way she wants to actually present herself is never properly addressed, and it is the series’ sole serious misstep.

Importantly though not a single character feels like anything less than a fully-fledged person. Even those with somewhat silly personalities (such as Hibiki and her affinity for animals) have layers to them, and the show is keen to show off its writing in this regard. Haruka’s aforementioned show-concluding arc takes a sledgehammer to her surface personality as a hardworking ‘good girl’, only to build it back up with a healthy dose of magical realism (present in a few of the show’s strongest moments) in the penultimate episode.

img880()

img880()

But of course, as with everything, technique is only as valuable as the resonance it creates. The thing with The Idolm@ster is that even though, statistically speaking, most people watching it are not, and will never be, idols, it is shockingly easy to relate to what these girls go through. I suspect what connects with whom varies somewhat, but, going back to that character writing; every character’s motivation is simple, concrete, and dead-easy to get your head around. That means that when you see them struggle, you can put yourself in their shoes.

I love, for instance, Zombieland Saga, but most people are not (say) undead biker-delinquents, and struggles that stem from being one require a lot more levels of abstraction to really hit the audience in the heart. By contrast, and to return to my earlier examples, things like Haruka’s fear that her friend group is drifting apart, Mikki’s simple desire to be the center of attention, and Chihaya’s near-compulsive need to keep singing are all things that will touch different kinds of people in a very immediate and personal way. I write about anime because I love doing it, and I often find myself internally debating whether or not doing it just because of that is okay. Chihaya sings, [as she eventually comes to terms with](https://anilist.co/activity/108362740), because she loves doing it, and struggles with whether or not that’s okay. We are, by any reasonable metric, vastly different people, but The Idolm@ster‘s strength of craft is such that I can see myself in someone who is fundamentally very little like me because when she bares her soul at the climax of her focus arc, belting out “Nemuri Hime” acapella, I feel it in mine. What is art even for, if not that?

And that, ultimately, is what I intend to reflect here. This is a show that gets it. The appeal of a lot of anime is that everyone, fundamentally, can sometimes use a glimpse of a world where pop music or some other silly thing really can save your soul, and getting there requires a deft touch and a subtle command of high emotion. And Idolm@ster is very emotional indeed.

So, nearly ten years later, it feels safe to say that we can–and should–bring it with us into the ’20s and beyond. This is the one almost every idol anime since is still vigorously copying notes off of, and it’s easy to see why. Something this focused on looking forward could only age amazingly. “Onward to a sparkling future”, as one of the show’s many songs would put it.

20629,"Cucarachas Gigantes > Buena Historia

Bueno, hagamos un intento por ser objetivos y marquemos los puntos buenos. 
1. El opening. La canción tiene bastante power, aunque como intro puede ser un tanto ""mentirosa"", por cosas que aclararé en spoilers.
2. El diseño de las cucarachas. Es bastante repulsivo de por sí, imaginar luchar contra cucarachas gigantes que vuelan, saltan y demás. Pero el diseño ayuda mucho a la incomodidad visual, sobretodo en sus primeras apariciones. 
3. Deja la puerta abierta, para aquellos que les interese seguir viendo, a la temporada dos de manera bastante inteligente. Se van dando pistas de un subconflicto principal, desde el inicio, y se va consolidando desde la mitad en adelante. 

Pero, vayamos a lo malo. ¿En qué falla tanto la serie? Bueno, en un punto que debería ser el fuerte: los personajes. La mayoría se dividen en dos tipos: inútiles (carne de cañon, o sólo sirven para hacerles primeros planos con caras de horror y rellenar tiempo en pantalla) o súper complejos con un pasado súper abundante que a nadie le importa porque se desarrolla mal o en el peor momento posible. (Medio larga la segunda categoría, pero no supe ponerlo de otra forma)

Y es que, partamos de la base que para ser un anime que va a centrarse en la acción y la lucha, tarda 3 capítulos en darnos el contexto. Contándonos con un narrador (ya voy a llegar a eso) el trasfondo del ""protagonista"", la tierra, las operaciones, el viaje y la mar en coche. Akari, que tendría que ser el protagonista, tiene dos/tres momentos de gloria, en los que además tiran por la borda el pasado que le construyeron, mientras que a otros por cada minuto en pantalla nos agregan un minuto de flashback sobre sus vidas.!Dicho sea de paso, con personajes que no conoceremos porque están bien muertos o los que estarán muertos serán ellos. Como el caso de Adolf, que tarda tres capítulos en morirse y nos cuentan toda su vida subdividida con las escenas de pelea propias del capítulo.!
Después, los personajes femeninos (aaay, los personajes femeninos). ¿Es que no podían hacer un seinen donde los personajes femeninos sean más que un par de pechos que gritan y lloran? Ni siquiera es tan viejo, ¡es del 2014 por amor a Jebús! En un anime noventero te lo dejo pasar, pero en una década donde existen tantas protagonistas (y a veces, incluso son sólo extras) con una personalidad interesante, un trasfondo bien hecho y una habilidad que vaya más allá de su cara, ya no. Si algo tiene de horrible este anime, son las protagonistas femeninas. Excepto Michelle, a la que pintan como fría y que no tiene interés en nadie que la rodee. Porque, claro, para ser buena en combate y tener personalidad, hay que también ser asexuada. 
!Cada minuto en pantalla de Eva era una agonía (para mi vista y oídos). Una mina entrenada en combate, con una operación ultra compleja, no puede hacer más que llorar y gritar cuando llega el momento de la acción. Ah, sí, y pegar una patéticos puñetazos a bichos del doble su altura. Sheila que más o menos tenía una personalidad interesante, muere en el capítulo 5, de forma rápida (A pesar de que la pintaban como principal en el Op, ni siquiera la vimos transformada). Previo a eso no nos habían contado nada de ella, pero en un intento porque empatizemos con la muerta, de golpe nos cuentan toda su historia y la relación con Alex y Marcos. No, no, lo siento. Ya la mataste, ahora no me da pena. !
Para cerrar, volveré a tocar el tema del narrador. Porque en este anime, a falta de uno, tenemos dos. 
Ya de por sí, tener un narrador en 2014 es bastante molesto, sobretodo cuando su trabajo no se limita a contarnos detalles que puedan ser importantes que no se nos escapen, sino que además adivina el futuro y nos cuenta lo que va a pasar a continuación o nos anticipa el resultado de una batalla. Súper molesto. En adición, tenemos otro personaje, que nos va contando todo lo anterior en una situación de bar con un miembro del proyecto anterior, y lo que no cuenta el narrador, lo cuenta este tipo. Capítulo, tras capítulo, no hacen más que hablar y hacer revelaciones (supongo que a ojos del autor ""sorprendentes"") que no sólo son predecibles, sino que se acaban por tornarse tediosas. 

Así y todo tiene casi un 6. Creo que fui bastante misericordiosa. No creo que sea basura, ni que no haya que verla. Pero sin dudas es una historia que no tengo intenciones de seguir, y que podría haber estado mucho mejor. Y claro, todo esto es mi opinión."

After the third episode, the show went on a break because of Covid. On  return, the fourth episode delighted  with a moment from Takatsugu Umeda, an effects specialist.


The end of the 19th century, a race through the territory of the still wild West. Although, the historical setting here takes second place, giving way to a fun adventure. Appare ([Senkuu)](https://anilist.co/character/124142/Senkuu-Ishigami) makes a car-boat, invents segway, a  samurai friend beats off a bullet with a katana and participates in a cucumber cutting competition. A fleeting meeting with Thomas Edison, a visit to the American hot springs - an adventure generously for fun.
General absurdity is quite entertaining and, most importantly, does not cross the line of tolerable absurdity. 

And all this with the support of good animation.

I have no idea how hard it was with this design

The design turned out to be unsuccessful. Trying to keep up with the general atmosphere, it came out overloaded, too bright and repulsive.

 The backgrounds of [Easter Studio](https://anidb.net/creator/2287) are not bad either, but they still can't reach him, and in the spring season they had a bigger job.

It wasn't bad in general, such an ordinary anime, the plot of which you have seen more than once in other guises, but it knows how to entertain and does it.
Next in line for the studio is a [new project](https://anilist.co/anime/118419/Kamisama-ni-Natta-hi/) of Maeda Jun, which will definitely be more popular. Appare will be forgotten, but I would like to note that this is the first successful original project of P.A. Works after the unsuccessful two seasons of [Fairy Gone](https://anilist.co/anime/107418/Fairy-Gone/), [Irozuku Sekai](https://anilist.co/anime/101316/Irozuku-Sekai-no-Ashita-kara/) and [Sirius the Jaeger](https://anilist.co/anime/101361/Tenrou-Sirius-the-Jaeger/).

159808,"For the sake of leaving no seasonal unreviewed.

The Vexations of a Shut-in Vampire Princess (or Hikikomari for short) is an anime that, based on its premise, I expected to enjoy far more than I actually did. The biggest draws for this series are its cutesy character designs, its GL-baity atmosphere (no actual romance here, sorry to disappoint), and the “gap” between the previous two elements and its always-at-war setting. However, I feel that this anime failed to follow through on what could have been a quite enjoyable anime to the extent that it could have.

The premise of Hikikomari is that Terakomari Gandesblood, a chronic shut-in vampire who is entirely unable to drink blood, is tricked into serving as a commander for the Mulnite Imperial Army, one of seven “Crimson Lords”--incredibly powerful vampires, each controlling a just-as-fearsome army--warring for candidacy to become the next empress of the continent. As commander, she is expected to constantly and consistently lead her army to victory in battles against the other Crimson Lords. However, since she’s unable to drink blood, Komari (I will refer to Terakomari as such for the rest of this review) is extremely weak: unable to use magic, she must rely on trickery to keep her troops loyal to her, as any one of her soldiers would attempt to overthrow her at the first opportunity, for the possibility of becoming a Crimson Lord themselves. This “always-at-war” premise is given a bit of a “cutesy” (for lack of a better word) twist towards the end of the first episode that I will not expose here for the sake of keeping this review 100% spoiler free, and the rest of the execution of the premise follows a similar “cutesy” route (much more similar to Handa-kun than Talentless Nana). This path could have been pulled off far worse than it was, and there were only a few issues I had with its execution as a whole. There is a reveal towards the end of the first arc that causes viewers to scratch their heads a little bit, as it causes a disconnect between the viewers’ and Komari’s perception of herself and also takes one aspect of the drama out of the series as a whole (and this disconnect is never really addressed, so it just leaves the audience shouting at their screen most of the time).

One would be able to pretty easily imagine a template for each of the episodes of a mainly comedy anime with such a premise, and they wouldn’t be too far off. There are twists and plot points introduced further down the storyline that prevent the premise from stagnating for too long, and the comedy is generally funny enough to pass. Vampire powers are introduced not too far along, and they soon become the main force driving conflict in the story. With all of that said, I feel like this is where the anime meets its first big stumbling block. 

The story of Hikikomari, despite existing just enough to allow the comedy to breathe a little bit, fails to do much more than that. Given how much time I had to devote to explaining the premise (this AND MORE is explained to the audience power-point-style within the first five minutes of the first episode), one can surely imagine the author’s propensity for introducing complications that, more often than not, end up muddying the comedy/slice of life elements that are Hikikomari’s true strong point. Despite all of these plot twists and story developments, large sections of Hikikomari’s story still manage to be uninteresting. By the end of episode 10 or so, I was forcing myself to make an active effort to invest myself in each new plot development, and yet I still found myself out of it more than once before the anime concluded. Had the world building been done in a manner that felt like anything other than a poorly adapted infodump from the light novel source material, it might have even been praiseworthy. However, it doesn’t do the best of jobs at communicating information to the audience efficiently, either infodumping with tremendous amounts of dialogue or expecting the audience to pick things up through context. After reading brief portions of the manga adaptation, I can say that at least the opening portions were handled slightly better, and it felt a bit more enjoyable and smooth as a read, but this isn’t a review of the manga, nor have I felt the need to devote the time to fully reading it either. 

The comedy, as mentioned above, gets a passing grade most of the time. Story (and a single character that I'll cover in more detail in the next section) aside, Hikikomari generally manages to pull its comedy off quite well. Despite being one of the most prominent aspects of the series, it hardly gets in its own way, allowing its characters, plot, and art to shine (as well as they can, that is.) This is not to say that it doesn’t have its own issues, however. Far too often, Hikikomari’s comedy involves one of the many of the characters around Komari being infatuated with her, which usually leads to the punchline being sexual harassment (mostly verbal, not physical, thankfully) of some form, but the audience is expected to find it cute instead of creepy because they’re all girls.

The characters of Hikikomari are probably one of the best aspects of the series. If you’re looking for thoughtful character development or empathetic and heartbreaking decisions, however, you’re in the wrong place. What you will get out of this anime are characters with standout, but (mostly) not overplayed “gimmicks” that manage to be funny enough in their own right. It works quite well with the slice of life elements of the series, and managed to get a chuckle out of me at least a few times. With Hikikomari’s crowded cast, each of these characters are generally kept from being on-screen enough for the audience to tire of them or their gimmicks. That is, with the glaring exception of Villhaze. Being Komari’s personal attendant means that she’s present in almost every scene with Komari (ergo, just about every scene in general.) This would be fine, were Villhaze either thoughtfully constructed or complex in any way. Instead, she has exactly two character traits: First, a frightening infatuation with Komari that goes past “star-struck admirer” and falls square into the camp of “straight up stalker.” Second, a complete lack of personal shame and boundaries. These two traits add up to Villhaze sexually harassing Komari at just about every chance she gets. How okay Komari is with this treatment is, of course, never directly addressed, but her reactions it’s clear that she’s mildly uncomfortable with it at best, and at worst only able to put up with it because of how essential Villhaze is to Komari’s functionality as a Crimson Lord. Your own mileage may vary with how funny or tolerable you find this portion of the anime, but I found myself sighing far more often than laughing when it came to these “jokes.” It’s also worth noting that Villhaze isn’t the only character who harasses Komari, nor the only one infatuated with her, but she’s by far the worst offender, and no other characters repeat their behavior to the point of causing actual problems like Villhaze.

Another aspect of the anime somewhat worth mentioning is the drama. I didn’t expect Hikikomari to have as much drama as it did, but I don't think it was particularly terrible either. At some points, I even felt it melded quite well with the direction and art, helping me understand and empathize with characters and their emotions. However, these moments were relatively rare. Far more often, one or all of these components didn’t properly line up and much of the emotional impact missed its mark, making the whole thing feel just a little bit “off.” 

This brings me to discussion of the direction of Hikikomari. Although I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the world of direction, or particular directors’ quirks, habits, strengths, etc, I hope my amateur opinion can help you get a general feeling of what to expect. There were certainly moments that I felt the direction positively impacted my watching experience (as briefly mentioned in the drama section), but there were certainly moments that felt “off.” 

Another thing I noticed while rewatching portions of this show for this review was just how much fanservice Hikikomari was able to fit into each episode. It wasn’t completely absurd, like some anime where the fanservice was suffocating enough to cause issues enjoying the other aspects, but it was still noticeable. It would be quite difficult to accept “oh we just wanted the characters to look cute” as an excuse, given the jokes, settings, camera angles, etc that were used far too conspicuously to be simply for humor or stylistic choices alone. The reader can decide whether or not this is a positive for them, as everyone watches anime for different reasons. If you enjoy fanservice, you might enjoy this show more. I don’t feel that it elevated the experience, however. I should note that, despite the all-too present trope of vampires looking 12 but being 3000 years old (more often than not used as an excuse to objectify characters that look uncomfortably young), Komari the vampire is actually 15 years old (with no disconnect between listed age and character design), but this isn’t worth praising when she ends up being objectified and consistently put in fanservice-y shots anyway (do i need to mention the whole sexual harassment thing again?)

The soundtrack and the voice acting are both of similar quality. Both are adequate, rarely conflicting with the direction that the rest of the anime goes for. Both also consistently fail to impress, with just as few standout moments as failures. Further discussion in this section is practically fruitless, so I’ll move on.

The final main aspects of the anime that I will be discussing in this review is the art and animation. The art style of Hikikomari was actually one of the things that drew me to the anime - the character designs and the rest of the art looked nice enough to warrant a watch, and they mostly delivered. Hikikomari’s character designs, backgrounds, and expressions are generally well done, complimenting the other aspects and combining to create a generally solid-feeling production. 

The animation is admittedly worse than the art, but it’s still decent. With that said, this isn’t a very high budget anime, and the directorial choices made to reduce the tax of animation at the expense of visual information communicated to the viewer (particularly during action scenes, the slice of life moments feel more well done) are obvious. This does allow for a few visually impressive scenes here and there, but the audience is left wondering if this was for the best. 

Overall, I’d say that all of these aspects combine to create a slightly below-average anime that, while consistent, leaves a lot on the table. If some aspect of what I've mentioned above appeals to you, or if you feel that Hikikomari is something you’d enjoy anyway, then feel free to watch it. Fantasy/SoL-ish anime are hard to come by after a while, so it may be worth watching for those aspects alone. With that said, I don’t think I’d give this anime a strong recommendation. If you’re on the fence about watching it, or if you have reservations, I can’t really assuage your concerns or recommend this show to you. 
I’d give Hikikomari a 5.5/10."

Note: This review is about the series in general, not just Season 2

Boobies and butts make the universe a pretty awesome place to exist in. How is this so? Just ask Dandy himself, and he could tell you all about it in glorious enthusiasm. This Dandy I speak of is named Space Dandy. Imagine if you mixed the best of western and eastern humor in TV animation shows and combined them into one neat package. That should tell you that Space Dandy destines to be different and fresh without making an overly big deal about it. Regardless, you certainly can’t beat this hot, fun garbage series with other garbage entertainment, anime or otherwise.

It should be noted that Space Dandy is not a Shinichiro Watanabe-directed anime in its purest sense, the director of such classics as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Even though he is the overseas chief director for the show, this is essentially a conglomerate of different anime directors putting their directorial spin on the series. That should tell you that Space Dandy does not follow any direct narrative from point A to point B. Episodic episodes spliced together to follow Dandy and his band of various misfits create a western-style animated series vibe that can be nostalgic for those of us growing up as kids watching these shows day by day. So if you thought this was going to be a Cowboy Bebop-style show, be thankful that you will be getting the filler episode portions of Bebop.

img1000()

Nevertheless, that should not entail that Space Dandy is nothing more than a comedic version of Bebop. In actuality, it brings forth a unique style to formulate charm to its humor and characters. Almost all jokes prevalent in Space Dandy hit all of the notes perfectly with nicely done comedic timing, and on top of it, they don’t just make all of the jokes onto one subject matter. Sure, the main focus of Space Dandy’s comedy is purely sexual with its constant pandering over butts and boobs, but once you further yourself into the show, you’ll realize that it is not the case. Many tropes are satirized from what you would typically see in any animated show with male characters like Dandy, always getting what he wants at the end that quickly falls flat over him.

There are genuine surprises thrown in here and there. For instance, it is probably one of the few anime you will ever see with its musical number. Even with its comedy, the writers delve into introspective subject matter that becomes insightful while still maintaining its humor without exemplifying it. Rarely would I ever applaud a show for being able to achieve both of these elements. The reason is that the jokes are written in a very clever fashion its intricate pacing and punchlines. Never is there a dull moment between the hilarious banter of Dandy and his friends.

img1000()

Dandy is quite the protagonist in keeping the show at an evenly paced comedy with his larger-than-life charisma and presence. Generally, a man who constantly obsesses over booty and tits can be grating over some time. Dandy is an exception because they do not shove the obvious joke down our throats continuously, although in some parts, they do, especially in the earlier episodes. He proves himself to be an exceptional main character, but that’s not to say he’s the only one who can do that in Space Dandy.

After humiliating him in the first episode, Meow, Dandy’s right-hand man, isn’t similar to Dandy in terms of personality. Meow would be the one to set him straight to focus on their missions, even though Dandy himself isn’t a total idiot in most cases. QT, Dandy’s robot sidekick, is the same way in this aspect, where he is always trying to keep things in order over Dandy’s typical behavior. These leads are lovable because of the perfect chemistry between them and Dandy. Even when their relationship seems atypical, goofy trite at first glance, they eventually warm up to be a match made in heaven.

img1000()

What good is it to talk about Space Dandy without mentioning its elaborate music? Zilch. I will speak in no hyperbole whatsoever in stating that Space Dandy has the most infectious Opening I’ve enjoyed listening to. The word contagious is meant in the most positive sense possible. Newcomer Kensuke Ushio made himself quite a success story in 2014 with this and also composed for Ping Pong The Animation. The opening itself sets the mood for the entire show and lets you know that fun is about to come your way like any other good opening does to any other show.

One crucial thing to note is the artistic direction and how diverse the animators decided to put into creating this very elaborate, kooky universe. All of the alien creatures are unique in design, a mix mash of previously imagined aliens and putting in their vision. The elegant colors are set with great care, so Space makes Space Dandy pleasing to the eyes. It also helps that the animation is nice and fluid to further the aesthetic to new heights. Also, because there are multiple directors for each episode, some even put their artistic vision into the spectrum. One notable is Masaaki Yuasa, director of The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong The Animation, who filled in one episode for animation direct in episode 3 and put a whole different spin on the series in terms of animation.

img1000()

There is nothing like Space Dandy that you often see in anime. In some ways, it’s Japan’s answer to western animated TV shows and saying, “Hey, we can make episodic goofy comedies just like the rest of y’all!” Whether that was their true intention, it speaks volumes by analyzing how Space Dandy can work both as a satire or a genuine comedy. Japanese anime purists may watch this with disdain because it's not the archetypal anime, even though we are used to comedy standards. If you’re willing to give credit where credit is due for a Japan-produced nostalgia trip of the late-’90s to early 2000s animated shows, look no further.

Grade: A-"
111324,"Ikebukuro West Gate Park is a strange beast. On one hand, it explores serious real-world issues like racism, but on the other hand, it attempts to fit those conflicts and tell episodic stories with its diverse cast of characters that can sometimes hit home greatly, or miss by a long shot.

Story-wise, IWGP is an interesting take on the “gang” genre. The main character gets involved with different kinds of conflicts and attempts to resolve them without using forceful methods for the most part, but occasionally seeks help from his friend, who is the leader of a gang, to help him out when things aren’t smooth-sailing. These conflicts are certainly great choices to tell multiple stories that happen in Ikebukuro, but there are times where it feels as if the episodes that tackle some of these conflicts feel like they are lacking the extra punch or “oomph” to really give viewers an impact that will be felt long after the ED plays, save for a few that are actually pretty solid because it does have that extra punch like the two-episode arcs.

On the positive side, IWGP’s characters feel grounded to reality, which makes sense as this anime basically is grounded too. Their experiences in life mostly revolve around the conflicts that the episode tackles, which is a good way to set up the mood of the episode. While on the topic of characters, the main character, Makoto, fights for justice and will use any means necessary so long as violence is avoided for the most part. Aside from that, he also empathizes with those who seek help from him and help them out to make Ikebukuro a better place. Of course, there are characters that are one-dimensional, but they are mostly just there for the plot and are unimportant for the most part. One drawback, however, is that I don’t really feel interested or invested with some of the characters, but for most of the time, they manage to keep my interest.

Moving on to its art and music, it’s certainly not bad. Its minimalistic take on its character designs reminds me of another anime from this year from Doga Kobo, which is Sing “Yesterday” for Me. Speaking of Sing “Yesterday”, IWGP is kind of similar to it in a way that it doesn’t really use too much music aside from a few scenes, which makes me more focused with its dialogue and what’s happening on the screen. Now while all these things sound positive, I think that overall, there is really nothing to write home about with IWGP in terms of art and music, as I think it doesn’t really make enough effort in order for it to at least let its art and music stick with me.

In conclusion, Ikebukuro West Gate Park is neither a great nor bad show. It is simply an “okay” show from Doga Kobo, and here’s to hoping that they manage to produce great shows in the future. Would I recommend it? If you have the patience, I’d say go for it, as there are certainly aspects of the show where I can see people enjoy it, but if you don’t have the patience, it would be in your best interest to skip it, as you are not really missing out on a ton. (6.2/10)"
21803,"This review is a tangent that doesn't concern the anime really (and so, spoilers free!), but hopefully, the amount of time I put into writing this should entice you into watching it. It is another favorite of mine by Nisio Isin, who wrote the Monogatari Series.

I thought this would be stupid considering I only remembered this anime through a game called ""Among Us,"" but then I thought I would talk about how fascinating Murder Mysteries are. And how much I was fascinated by getting around the message of this anime into this review.

But-

Nothing is fascinating about Crime Fiction specifically, nor is there with Mysteries in general. Honestly, I barely even read or watch mystery novels in the first place. The thing is, it probably communicates with the audience more than it does, as my friend expressed that ""the stories you can come up with, this anime tries to encourage it.""

That's the starting point where I break the mold with mystery fiction, at least in conclusion. The narrative gives you a lead, lets you experiment with your evidence. It has to do with ""how can I decode this particularly,"" which would make you feel great if you solved the mystery earlier than the protagonist (that dopamine stuff is nice).  It goes back to the models of communication, where we have the sender and the receiver. It is like a comedy where everyone would have a good time if the message were clear and precise. And you were given an opportunity to investigate something even if it is outside your control.

And yet I generalized the whole mystery genre with a single anime like this. I believe I understood the premise, just as I was so sure I got the murderer in the first place.

But that's the point of getting the message across. Or is it?

It's hard to decipher what the author wants. Is it to break awareness, thinking outside of the box? Or is it to listen to their rants, where none can be accurate to the statement of straightforward just making up mysteries and solving them just as if we solved something crucial? We said it in another form: why do we break things and make things. It is asking the fundamental question of why engineering, why science exists. Why do we satisfy human knowledge? Or rather, why do we have an existential crisis?

The answer is: we really don't know. None of us knows what we're doing, why we're doing it, and when we're doing it. When we have a clue to that mystery alone despite our basis being too few, as long as there's confirmation bias: we have found ourselves a purpose.

The gratification of understanding everything around you, it sums up what mystery fictions are in general. All of this despite not reading much into it.

But what do I know?

What do I really know?

Even if you start to get everything piece by piece, the puzzle becomes bigger and difficult. You really can't be ignorant of those kinds of things, and it's probably a good part of growing up. And so the message of this anime, as to how I interpret it, is:

""You'll eventually learn when you learn.""

In the end, I realized that I mostly referred to philosophy. And so I'd also refer to a short quote by Lao Tzu:
""Knowing others is intelligence, but knowing yourself is true wisdom.""

So I do know something.



Yes, I don't read much into Crime novels. A friend of mine that I mentioned recommended me to watch this since she thought I liked mysteries in general. Honestly, I am only an avid fan of lighthearted shows so I don't know if there's a better show out there, but for me, this is probably a good time to start tackling them after I finish philosophy. But I really liked this anime and so I thought I would dig deep and emphasize."

an adaptation i’ve been hoping for for over a decade now (⚬◜ᴗ◝⚬). then again, the manga releases monthly, so it’s hard to be quickly adapted, but i’m saddened with how this only received 12 episodes when it really deserves 24 or at least a confirmation that it’ll get a second season (੭ꐦ •̀Д•́ )੭⁾ i truly believe this is more injustice towards shoujo mangas. because there are so many other anime (centralized around romance) receiving a second season or more episodes than honey lemon soda. time and time again, i can’t help but feel it’s because those stories tend to be shounen or seinen-centric that they gain the upper hand. this isn’t to say those stories are bad in any way, but when it’s clear which narratives are allowed to be told to their best extent and which are disregarded. 

moving on to the anime itself, it was romantically nuanced, laced with youthful undertones of self-growth. i don’t think it takes one to relate to a story to understand such as this one, however, i take one’s ability to comprehend the characters themselves as individuals. an increasing problem with media nowadays is how everyone indirectly inserts themselves into a character, whether conscious or not, degrading the storyline. while it’s common for a person to imagine what they would do if they were in the same environment as the characters, they tend to forget one thing: they aren’t. honey lemon soda is derived from three main aspects of youth from the title. honey: the sweetness of leaping into a new world of adolescence. lemon: the slight sourness of the sheltered past of one’s childhood lingering. soda: the unexpectedness of the unknown future that bubbles inside someone. these aspects encapsulate the story of ishimori uka. this isn’t a one-off episode where a girl finds her confidence overnight. it’s about the ignition of ambition being lit within a soul. where an inner voice can break the shells of a sheltered nest they’ve been sitting on for long and take flight. 

this anime showcases the brightness held within the youth while gradually building the unknown paths one might face when moving forward. adolescense isn’t perfect. the road moving forward will be tumultuous, painful, or broken. nevertheless, so long as one holds their head high, one step at a time, confidence slowly builds to deflect doubt. now, let’s move on to the characters.

img4000()

ISHIMORI UKA ❁ 
she is so precious, it makes me want to defend her from all negativity in life (੭ ˊ^ˋ)੭ ♡ honestly, reading through the discourse regarding uka left me quite saddened. naturally, i’m not surprised people have opinions or critiques about a story or character, but the most reiterated sentiment seemed to be ‘she cries too much’ ∘ ∘ ∘ ( °ヮ° )∘ ∘ ∘i-i’m sorry, did i hear that correctly? c-cries too much? (⩌⩌) heaven forbid a girl shows her emotions too much, especially in this context. there’s a reason for this, a recurring factor. uka was a sheltered kid (,,⩌'︿'⩌,,). from the moment in episode 1 where kai approached her, he was quite literally the sudden light in his life. while her nickname is ‘stone’ (expressionless/emotionless), i’d say she’s more of a locked bird who hasn’t learned to fly yet. uka is book smart, not solely due to the expectations from her parents, but that was the only thing she could pour her heart into at the time to please others. to stay in her lane, so to speak. yet, it was that faithful day she met miura that he gave her the push to step forward. 
some might interpret this as gratitude for a small act a stranger did for another or blunt advice that could’ve been brushed off, but to uka they were words she’s always wanted… no. always needed to hear. for so long, she held in all her pain. the ridiculing, the bullying, the torment, the pressure. mass amounts of pessimism stored up in a jar until it cracked. a reality shattered all thanks to kai’s words. in that moment, uka not only felt thankful, but she felt love. a warmth radiating like she’s never felt, opening her eyes to a new world where she could have a chance at living. even after her transfer, the story makes sure to not show that her bottled trauma can’t be healed overnight, or that the school she thought was a utopia, off the whim from words she heard from kai alone could fix all her problems. this is where the emotional upheaval comes from. 
uka emotional growth is that of a very young grade student, yellow newborn chick, or a caterpillar. she’s spent so much of her life being passive, not in a sense of a pushover (slightly, but it was for emotional survival). no tears, being ‘selfish’, or being eloquent. which is why every conversation, word, advice, event, and moment hits uka like a train. think of it as a cyclone of colors hitting her at once. someone who’s only hidden their thoughts and suppressed pain, when met with true kindness for the first time, i’d think anyone would break into tears. ishimori doesn’t cry to gain pity, sympathy, or attention, as many relate the act of crying to be. she cries because she’s experiencing waves of new experiences that make her feel all sorts of emotions that words alone can’t explain. sometimes even she questions why tears are falling in certain situations. 
her interactions with not only kai, but ayumi, serina, yuru, seto, etc. is the push she’s given to grow her own voice. this allows her to better articulate her thoughts, speak up, communicate her truth, and stand her ground. episode 9 especially broke me. hearing the words from uka’s father, his actions, watching the scenes play through of how much control he had on her life, hit too close to my heart. in that aspect, for a moment i felt as if i was watching what my life would’ve been had i not grown my own voice, because i didn’t have my own miura kai. i felt so proud when she stood her ground to her father, that entire episode was me in a pool of tears. 
naturally, there are many aspects where one might not understand or find the whole premise of uka to be weird. to that group, they’re in luck. they represent the people around ishimori, as if the author knows how basic people would react to uka’s personality without looking at the full picture due to a lack of nuance. like sand, it’s all on the surface. which can’t be said for uka. everything she acts upon is at her own free will and endurance to create new memories full of color. something she can learn from, whether good or bad, in the end, it’ll be hers to cherish. 
img4000()
img4000(v)

MIURA KAI  ☆
the focal point of the title, probably. he’s the flashy yet reserved character in this anime. similar to his hair color, he is the light in uka’s life. what she doesn’t know about him is that he is that to her. she believes kai is brave with a strong moral, when he sees that in her. his love might not have been as upfront as uka’s, but his feelings grew with time. he found himself drawn to her as if become second nature. i think all the meddling (it’s a recurring aspect throughout the story) slowed his progression when it came to his feelings. but, once he came to, he always put himself out there when it came to uka while not trying to overstep his boundaries. kai is always an ‘act before thinking’ person, or that’s what he used to be til uka reminded (indirectly) he needs to be aware of his actions. in that aspect, they switched methods. he learned to be more adept while she became the ‘act before thinking’ persona. 
people like to point out how ‘harsh’ kai’s words were. except, they’re not meant to be. not to uka. from an outsider’s perspective, one might see kai’s blunt attitude as brushing off uka’s journey to self-confidence, when in actuality his words are laced with caution. he doesn’t look down on her, he’s worried. in his own way, as he learns how much uka’s willing to push herself. they’re direct because if he doesn’t say things as they are, uka won’t build herself up. she’s been sugar-coated words or has had to read between the lines up until she met kai. those kinds of things have only hindered uka’s chance to better herself. he’s doing the complete opposite. his words cut deep so as they are not to cause miscommunication, he’s using them to open up bit by bit to her. 
kai drew me in as a character because of his mysterious filter. it’s probably one of the reasons uka fell in love with him as well. someone who looks her way to give her a cherishable youth, one can live and learn from. it’s only fair to wonder who he is underneath the mask he hides under. even when uka believes kai’s not looking her way, he points out her strengths, weaknesses, characteristics, and more. he’s the type to show he might not care or listen, when in actuality he does. from his actions, i think he’s the type to show he protects those closest to him. because he never had anyone or a similar influence while growing up. the anime doesn’t bring up or show what kai is like (since we’re focusing on uka’s growth), but i can assume from the little details what kai’s past was like. he’s the only one who didn’t criticize uka’s curfew or make fun of her for it. 
furthermore, in episode 9, where all of uka’s friends took the direct approach in telling mr. ishimori, he’s in the wrong (which he totally is), kai takes a more understated attempt. unlike other stories where the male lead may play protector, fighting for the heroine’s love by taking the lead, kai lets mr. ishimori as he is. of course, he does sneak up to give uka his usual push or advice, but ultimately, how uka’s parents learn of her true self, her past, and importantly, what she wants, comes from her, not from miura forcing his way in. uka could easily tell her parents off and run to kai, but she cares for her family too much to do such a thing. moreover, seeing as kai doesn’t mention his past or family dynamics, i can assume he doesn’t have a family. being the lone wolf character, where someone has to carry everything on their own, can be taxing. i believe that’s why even though uka’s parents act overbearing, he views her as lucky to have people in her life who care for her that much when he had no one. in the wake of the fruits of his labor, he’s found uka, who showers him in love he didn’t realize he needed. it’s why his first relationship didn’t work out. because he was always giving. whether he might’ve believed during the time he didn’t want to receive, indeed, kai is always giving to others. this is why he loves uka. she tells him she wants to give back the same amount of love he’s given her and is willing to always be there for him. compared to other girls who simply only like him for his looks and fail to even understand him as an individual.

KANNO SERINA ୨୧
serina doesn’t enter the scene till a bit later. originally, i had a terrible view of her. since i haven’t read the manga, i feared she was written in as an annoying wedge or the start of an unnecessary love triangle. my worries worsened when it was revealed that she was kai’s ex. which i have to say, i don’t know what universe these characters live in but everyone. and i mean EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER (minus the main cast) seem to be nosy as hell. the minute people found out serina was kai’s ex they started shipping them together? knowing they’re EXES?!??!?! ಠಠ with that in mind, i was suspicious of serina’s motives around uka. but, turns out she had the opposite growth compared to ishimori. it was clear serina was being treated badly, yet she kept enduring. both her and uka uplift each other and really don’t let kai get in between them. since serina’s more experienced and knows kai (to an extent) she knew she was out of the running. which i loved because this meant no unnecessary drama. now, did revealing her story make uka question her chance with mirua? yes. but did serina gain anything or start dating kai again? no. because she knew as much as the audience (hopefully (ᴗ ᴗ。)) that they were meant to be together. 
when i heard serina was kai’s ex, i assumed he was the one who broke up with her. as it would explain her introduction of having lingering feelings for him. however, as it turns out, serina was the one who broke up with him. she never wanted to, but she did the healthy thing by making the first step because at the time i sure as hell don’t think kai would’ve. she broke up with him because she relied on him too much. there was no self-growth with how much she depended on him. this isn’t to say a girl can’t rely on their boyfriend, but they must know how to stand tall without them too. and at the time, kai being absent for just one day broke serina from the bullying. however, i’m proud she never pinned it all on miura. of course, it hurt to break not only his but her heart too, but this was for the best. because it allowed serina to deal with her problems head on and not hide behind someone constantly, which might’ve led to a mental breakdown of the other party. serina still confesses to kai, but i think she knew the answer at this point. her confession was just as a means to close the chapter that was roughly managed in the past. it allowed closure. 
yet, even through all of this, she supported uka and her endeavors. if anything, she encouraged her to go after kai. she never let the words of onlookers waver her feelings into jealousy or hatred. how could she? when uka saves her, knowing what she feels, yet cares for her anyway. serina is mature in learning from experiences to grow, move forward. especially since she knows she was the one who initiated the breakup up she knew there was no way to change time. does she have regrets? perhaps. nevertheless, she doesn’t dwell on actions that can’t be changed and looks forward. and for that, she’s such a good character. wish i could see more girls being, well…a girl's girl. instead of fighting or breaking up a relationship.

ENDOU AYUMI >⩊ ω ᨓ<,,). honestly, all the overbearing people. like what is this universe? why the hell is everyone nosy as hell?! besides that there's also the part where uka met up with her bullies again. i’m not saying one should hold on to the past, but the bullies did irrevocably damage uka’s early years. they almost ruined her current environment had she not stood up for herself. also, the head girl sent out her boyfriend to hurt uka by any means after she retaliated once. ONCE!?!?! and everyone is supposed to hold hands and move on? but, i digress because i don’t think uka will ever forget. but she forgave to moved on since she’s grown to be a different person. in turn, her kindness was repaid when the bullies came to show mr. ishimori how controlling his parenting was towards uka, showcasing what world uka’s been living in, not the singular filter he’s been seeing the world to be. the color palette stands out to show the pops of color, like watercolors. although judging from some of the cover art i’ve seen the manga is better in regards to art. moreover, the romance in this story is so refreshing. both uka and kai drop such heartfelt lines throughout the season, but my favorite has to be from kai. “you might be a stone, but you’re a gemstone” (episode 2). that line is the closing of one story and the start of a new journey. love runs deep, and it shouldn’t be used as something as a weakness. uka loving kai is her strength. the love she has is selfless and a bit greedy, unexplainable in simple terms, but powerful enough to search for confidence. to her, just being accepted, having small moments, and being by kai’s side was enough for her. that’s how much she loves him. he’s the same. kai pushes uka to be her best self while not being overbearing. he doesn’t always have the answers and learns what it means to put down a facade and take a breath. in fact, he loves so strongly that he’s restraining himself to follow her pace and not overstep. he always seems to be the one doing the rescuing, it might’ve never occurred that someone wants to protect and save him as much as he’s willing to do for the people he cares about.

1462,"Memories is a 1995 animated anthology film series composed of three unrelated sci-fi stories, focusing on the individual themes of each story than a core theme throughout. However, they do all share a technical and inspired approach to their visual style, boasting some of the most spectacular animation Japan had ever created for its time. All three shorts were based on stories written by Katsuhiro Otomo, known for creating the visual spectacle that is Akira, and here he serves as producer and the director for the last episode, working with some of the industry’s biggest names to deliver arguably the greatest anthology series in all of anime. Because of the structure of Memories, this review will look at each separate part in chronological order, starting with the most “memorable” part.


Magnetic Rose



To put it in one word, impressive. It boasts some of the most resplendent animation and music that compliments the unnerving tone and setting, along with the script being in the hands of Satoshi Kon. The short chronicles how the Corona, a salvage freighter in deep space comes upon a strange space station after responding to a distress signal. The two engineers of the crew, Heintz and Miguel, enter and discover a luxurious European interior that once belonged to famed opera singer named Eva. As the two engineers further explore they both become engulfed in Eva’s memories through a series of paranormal encounters, with both men each reliving their own memories.

For a ghost story, this is one of the best I’ve ever seen. In a 40-minute duration it delivers on capturing the essence of the anthology title, creating a haunting yet intriguing world of one’s past, and presents a disturbing message of the dangers of living in the past. Eva is a literal representation of that very message and attempts to lure both men into her past, and while some may resist, others might be more willing to fall into the trap, seeing it as an escape to a better place. Magnetic Rose explores love lost and the desperation of a lonely person determined to regain a kind of love so precious, no matter what the cost. This idea is woven masterfully into the plot, making it as thought-provoking as it is terrifying. Kon’s style of storytelling is also present here, blurring the lines between reality and hallucinations and keeping viewers thinking throughout its duration. Fun fact for any film buffs out there: This short also holds references to other sci-fi films such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey with certain scenes, yet never feels cheap or derivative. Magnetic Rose has these familiar elements and makes them feel fresh, a testament to the staff behind this show. The overall story exudes intrigue and ends in a way that answers enough questions to feel satisfying and make sense, yet leaves enough to viewer interpretation to leave its mark. 

Satoshi Kon was also behind the art direction and like the story, it’s stunning. The fluid animation, cinematic techniques and overall attention-to-detail make Magnetic Rose a marvel of animation. Considering this came out over 20 years ago by the time I’m writing this, and still looks incredible. The scenes in space alone demonstrate how impressive the show is on a technical scale. Despite looking dated with its art style and not being vibrant or colourful, Magnetic Rose shows that there is more to animation than simple visual look. Meanwhile the sound was composed by Yoko Kanno and is mostly operatic, matching the setting and tone of the tragic story perfectly. Voice acting was great all around with Eva’s voice actress in particular being breathtaking in her role. Her version of “Madame Butterfly” is awe-inspiring, even if you dislike like opera, you will still probably appreciate the piece and the overall music in general with how it complements scenes so effectively. Magnetic Rose excels in so many ways that the only way I could see it have been better is if it were its own stand-alone movie. And on that note, I am very surprised this story has not even been rumoured at all for a potential Hollywood adaptation considering the high potential for a successful anime adaptation. It is the highlight of this anthology and is the part of Memories that you will strongly remember.


Stink Bomb



Here Memories transitions from haunting beauty to a dark comedy that uses satire to demonstrate how stupid humanity can be. The change of tone and pace can be seen immediately from the start, showing a rather overly cheerful television program with fitting music and colourful art compared to Magnetic Rose. Stink Bomb follows Nobuo Tanaka, a young lab technician of a hospital trying to cure his cold and when trying to find a new cold medicine under development, he takes the wrong pill; the ‘red pill’. But instead of finding enlightenment, this buffoon finding all his fellow employees dead and panicked, rushes to deliver the experimental drug he mistook for cold medication to headquarters in Tokyo. Unbeknownst to Nobuo, his mistake is the cause behind everyone in the hospital dying, with him now spreading death and destruction everywhere he goes without him even knowing. Because of this, Nobuo becomes a target of assassination and kidnapping by the government.

Most people find Stink Bomb easily the worst of the three entries, feeling like a 40-minute long dumb joke that wasn’t funny to begin with, however I feel as though Stink Bomb gets too much negative buzz than it deserves. It’s a light-hearted take on how foolish our species can be when in dire straits ala Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, ridiculing such in over-the-top comedic fashion. The idea that a lab technician is so unbelievably stupid is not something that I consider detrimental to the show; his density fits the kind of comedy the show is going for and is the perfect example for how one man can cause such disaster and trigger-happy militants can further the damage with both ease and lack of common sense. Even if you did not find the comedic style to your liking and I myself will admit that I did not find it that hilarious apart from some overexaggerated missiles, it is definitely an entertaining short that I never once found dull. 

The animation is the weakest of the three, lacking the technical quality, art direction and sheer unique look of both Magnetic Rose and Cannon Fodder. It also looks the most dated, but still holds up enough to not lessen the experience and contains some of the most action-packed scenes with fluid animation to match. The music is arguably the best part of the short, composed of lively jazz expertly incorporated throughout and is surprisingly appropriate for Stink Bomb’s chaotic style of comedy. Both the animation and sound add to the story’s light-heartedness, and that’s exactly what Stink Bomb strived for. If you come into this looking for some sort of hidden meaning, you will be disappointed. Its intentions are purely to elicit a smile on your face, and for me, it succeeded.


Cannon Fodder



Cannon Fodder is aesthetically the most intriguing of the three shorts, creating a world comparable to a communism dystopia filled with massively-oversized cannons that fire at an “enemy moving city” that is never visually confirmed by the show; clearly an allegory on society. Cannon Fodder is the most literal title this show could have had. Everyone’s life revolves about firing cannons; the men work the cannons, the women make the shells, and the children are taught on the mechanics of firing cannons. Cannon Fodder looks at the life of an average family on an average day in this bleak world. We see the father going through the motions as he loads cannons, only living to work, to the naïve child aspiring to someday be the man who fires these cannons. It’s a dreary 30 minutes that leaves you in a bleak state, having seen how bleak these characters’ lives are and that it won’t change. 

Cannon Fodder is certainly not for every anime fan. It’s a short similar to artistic anime like Texhnolyze that are merciless in their depiction of a hopeless world. It’s also a highly political film, with its critique of militarism, socialism and propaganda very noticeable throughout the story. It’s shown the leader of the city is nothing more than a chubby man, yet is portrayed through portraits and such as a fit, powerful leader and worshipped by civilians. An interesting fact: none of the characters are ever given names, another result of living in this kind of world where cannons are valued more than the individuals that work on them. The premise and story of Cannon Fodder is simple and not subtle in the slightest, making it even more frustrating to some viewers. However, considering how political first-world countries have gotten in recent years, I feel like this short is worth the 30 minutes it takes to watch.

The art-style for Cannon Fodder is ugly, no doubt about it, and it complements the dark, depressing vibe the world has. The palette of greys and browns gives the city a decaying, decrepit look that mirrors the people belonging to it. Steampunk elements blend into the city seamlessly, with cannons sticking out of every building present. The people themselves don’t even look human, with sickly grey skin and sunken eyes look more like they can straight out of a nightmare than anything resembling the kind of world we live in. From a technical perspective, the attention to detail is perhaps the best of the three shorts, but what really makes Cannon Fodder’s animation so great is Otomo’s direction. The entire short is one continuous sequence without a single cut. Can you recall an anime you’ve seen that has no cuts in its entirety? Otomo utilizes an array of cinematic techniques and transitions that blend in with the story and animated scenes so well that they may go unnoticed to the average viewer, and that is in my opinion the sign of a master of cinematography. Cannon Fodder is quite possibly one of the greatest one-takes in the history of cinema in general and like Akira, is a testament to Otomo’s ability as a director.

In conclusion, Memories is not your typical anthology series; it does not have any overarching narrative that ties the three entries together. But what Memories does contain is a unique collection of short stories that individually showcase some of best animation the industry had at the time and it still hold up. But saying that its value only resides in the animation undermines other great aspects of Cannon Fodder and Stink Bomb such as directing, atmosphere, themes, etc., and nearly everything about Magnetic Rose. None of these films should be ignored and are all worth the time it takes to experience each of these wonderful pieces of animation."
100714,"A gothic lolita witch, named Yurine, summons a demon snake girl from hell, named Jashin, to the human world. Jashin can’t go back to hell unless she kills Yurine, but until then, they’re living together. This is the basic synopsis of the Summer 2018 season’s, Jashin-chan no Dropkick! Jashin-chan no Dropkick is described by MAL as a supernatural comedy show, complete with demons, angels, and all of hell’s creatures on earth participating in this fun slapstick, bloody, slice of life adventure.

Jashin-chan no Dropkick is the newest addition to the newish genre known as monster girls. The 3 major demon girls, Jashin, Medusa, and Minosu, have the qualities of their mythical creature counter parts. Jashin wears no clothes and has the bottom of a snake, much like Miia from Monster Musume, with blond hair hiding her tits. Medusa wears ancient Egyptian attire and turns normal humans to stone when they look at her eyes. Minosu wears cow themed clothing and looks like what you think a typical cow girl would looks like. There’s also Pikola, who is an angel who has lost her halo and is stuck on earth until someone comes to pick her up, but in the meantime she’s homeless. She is also best girl.

As you can assume with this type of show, its mostly carried by the scenarios and personalities these characters bring to the table. Mostly interacting with the two protagonists, Yurine and Jashin. Jashin, being a demon, is a terrible person. She constantly does these deeply immoral things to the point it's even fucked up even for fiction. In reaction to this, Yurine often takes some overly comical weapon to do almost as awful thing to her back. Like bludgeoning her to death, or chopping up her tail and making it into stew, or sticking her into an iron maiden. You get it right? Yurine is a genuinely nice person despite her cold personality and the fact that she eviscerates Jashin everytime she does something horrible. Which is often. And she never learns. If Yurine wasn’t there to punish Jashin for her evil doings, then this show would just be a terrible person doing terrible things. Which wouldn’t be fun at all.

The show’s art and animation, in my opinion, is stellar for this type of show. For just some slice of life comedy it's pretty great. The characters have a chibi, shiny look to them with some fluid animation to boot. It really makes the slapstick hit harder. 

In conclusion, Jashin-chan no Dropkick gets a 9 out of 10 for me this Summer anime season. I always looked forward to watching it after work on Monday’s. It's reminiscent to Gabriel Dropout, except more adult, if that makes sense. So if you like that, then give this show a shot. This has been PixEFit’s spoiler free, but not really review on Jashin-chan no Dropkick."
4725,"“Você mataria alguém que ama por amor?”

Não há palavras mais adequadas para definir tal obra. Se a situação pedisse, você seguiria a razão ou a emoção? O que você faria caso a pessoa mais importante para você cometesse um pecado irreversível, cuja a morte fosse a única saída? Se a pessoa que você ama não fosse capaz de aliviar a própria dor, você o faria com suas próprias mãos? Você realmente mataria alguém que ama por amor? É com esse dilema que Ga-Rei-Zero inicia sua narrativa.
 Sob a direção de Aoki Eri (Fate/Zero 2nd, Kara no Kyoukai, Hourou Musuko), script de Takayama Katsuhiko (ef, FullMetal Alchemist, Koi to Senkyou to Chocolate), character design de Horiuchi Osamu (Full Metal Panic!, Hayate no Gotoku!, Last Exile) e uma excelente adaptação da parceria entre os estúdios AIC Spirits e Asread, Ga-Rei-Zero ganha vida como uma das melhores estreias da temporada de outono de 2008, e talvez o melhor show de ação dessa temporada.

Ga-Rei-Zero é um anime de 12 episódios que narra acontecimentos anteriores ao famoso mangá de ação e sobrenatural Ga-Rei (que foi trazido ao Brasil pela editora JBC). Kagura Tsuchimiya e Yomi Isayama são duas garotas que, por obra do destino, passaram a viver juntas e se tornaram irmãs. A história tem como plano de fundo uma realidade alternativa onde pessoas capacitadas se unem a uma organização para exterminar seres sobrenaturais que causam o pânico entre a população.
A história do anime não é original, e parece um tanto genérica, mas o seu desenvolvimento é admirável. A narrativa não segue a ordem cronológica, mas não é impossível de entender. Logo no terceiro episódio podemos perceber claramente que os fatos do primeiro e do segundo são apenas uma prévia do que iria acontecer no final. Sim, os dois primeiros episódios foram spoilers, e os episódios seguintes apenas detalham os fatos que levaram aquela tragédia, mostrando a infância das duas protagonistas. Mas o que tem de errado nisso? Uma narrativa confusa de início pode até gerar uma sensação de esclarecimento quando chega ao final. 
O problema é que nos episódios posteriores ao segundo, vemos uma Isayama Yomi carismática e feliz, diferente da que vimos nos primeiros episódios. Mas o que levou aquela garota carismática a cometer aquele ato de crueldade mostrado no primeiro episódio? E o pior de tudo é que somos conquistados pela futura assassina. Inclusive pensamos que no final, tudo o que foi construído durante o anime será destruído. A amizade entre as duas garotas acabará, e uma delas virará um monstro. Me lembro que fiquei receio de chegar ao final, não queria ver o clima do anime mudar, mas estava extremamente curioso para saber como aquilo aconteceu.
Que o desenvolvimento das protagonistas é a melhor parte do anime, ninguém pode negar. Kagura se torna mais gentil e passa a se abrir com as outras pessoas, diferente da Kagura do terceiro episódio, que procurava não demonstrar sentimentos ou afeto por alguém. Yomi vai se tornando fria e passa a se importar menos com as pessoas que a rodeiam. O mundo passa a conspirar contra ela, e a única pessoa com quem pode contar é a sua irmã, mesmo temendo machucá-la.
Mesmo assim, esse anime não possui um bom elenco de personagens. Se tomarmos como exceção as duas irmãs, as outras personagens servem apenas para influenciar na mudança de personalidade das mesmas. Metade das personagens estão ali para serem mortas por Yomi, e a outra metade serve unicamente para infernizar a vida dela. Claro, tem algumas personagens que servem para infernizar a vida da Kagura, mas não são a maioria. Enfim, o elenco se resume a Kagura e Yomi, portanto se não se simpatizar com nenhuma das duas, a possibilidade de não gostar da série aumentará.
A animação de ga-rei zero é muito boa, e as lutas são muito bem feitas. Temos lutas com armas, mano a mano, monstros arrancando cabeças, membros voando por todos os cantos, duelo de espadas, e até uma cadeira de rodas motorizada! Ga-Rei-Zero não deixa a desejar quando o assunto é batalhas, e sabe adicionar sentimento em cada uma delas. Falando do character design em geral, tenho que confessar que o formato da boca das personagens me irritou de início. Tem um traço desnecessário ali. Mas fora isso, não tenho nada a reclamar nesse quesito.
Existem, é claro, algumas diferenças entre as duas obras (mangá e anime), até porque, como foi dito mais acima, Ga-Rei-Zero narra acontecimentos anteriores aos do mangá. Entre as diferenças mais notáveis, estão os protagonistas e público alvo. Apenas Kagura continua como protagonista do anime, sendo que no mangá, ela divide o papel com o pervertido Kensuke Nimura, tal lugar que passa a ser ocupado por Isayama Yomi no anime. Não é necessário conferir o mangá para obter o entendimento completo do anime, mas, ao término do mesmo, se tornará obrigatório ler o mangá, afinal a curiosidade em saber o verdadeiro destino das duas irmãs falará mais alto.
A obra é, no geral, interessante e surpreendente. Tanto é que é impossível não se surpreender com o primeiro episódio. Esse anime mantém o equilíbrio perfeito entre vários gêneros como drama, comédia, ação, sobrenatural, romance, tragédia e até um pouco de terror para as pessoas com o estômago fraco. Com o seu início explosivo, desenvolvimento impecável e finalização dramática, Ga-Rei-Zero se tornou um dos melhores shows de sua temporada, e foi marcado como uma das melhores estreias de 2008."
189,"-Spoilers.

They say it’s a waste to live in the past, clinging to people you once knew and dreams you’ve outgrown. To live in the moment, and make plans for your future, are the cornerstones of responsibility, and you can never truly grow until you embrace them. But what if the past IS your only hope for a future? What if the only person who ever loved you was a brief acquaintance from your childhood? What if the promise to reunite as adults, bound by a common goal that will ensure their love will one day last forever? It’s easy to find the idea of someone devoting their adult lives to such a fleeting moment of happiness laughable, at least until you meet Keitaro Urashima, a 20 year old loser with a heart of gold and a body that would put a crash test dummy out of work. As a child, he made a promise to a mysterious young girl with whom he’d shared an unexpected connection. Upon realizing that they’d probably never see each other again, they vowed to one day get into the prestigious Tokyo University, a college that they heard has the power to keep loving young couples together forever. That actually sounds kind of romantic, right?

Well, it loses some of it’s luster when Keitaro, as an adult, has decided to work around his pesky undatability by holding onto this 14 year old promise well into his early twenties, optimistically believing that the love of his life is waiting just beyond the entrance exams of Tokyo University… Exams he has no hope of passing. Yeah, his ambition would probably be an admirable trait if it didn’t involve the Japanese equivalent of an Ivy League school, and even moreso if Keitaro himself wasn’t intellectually suited for, say, a for-profit school, or a community college at the very best. Nevertheless, he tries and fails, and when he refuses to set his sights any lower than the top, his parents realize with what I can only assume was dawning horror that they’re going to be taking care of their son for the long haul, and instead decide to ship his unemployed ass to the family hotel, Hinata Inn, to study while work as the building’s new manager! What they don’t tell him, however, is that Hinata Inn has recently been transformed into a girls’ only dorm, and it’s home to a flock of ferocious females who aren’t shy about letting him know where his boundaries lie. With these tough temptresses attempting to murder him over every little misunderstanding, will Keitaro ever be able to chase his dreams, or will he be too distracted by the angry teenagers chasing him?

Love Hina is a bit of a rarity in terms of production history… It was animated by two distinctly different companies, Production IG and Studio Xebec, the differences between them being like night and day. Production IG has a reputation for showing us the best visuals that the current technology of whatever year it’s working in have to offer, and this was no less true in the year 2000. Xebec, on the other hand, is to animation what a child with a plastic steering wheel attached to it’s carseat is to driving… Except with actual control over the car. These two radically different agents mix about as well as oil and water, making it embarrassingly easy to tell who’s behind the visuals at any given time. Now, to be clear, the animation in this show is never what you’d call “good.” It clearly had a lot of budget issues to deal with, which I’ve heard is partially responsible for it’s failure to secure a second season before it got canceled. It’s passable about half the time, with good old IG doing their damnedest to not let the series look as cheap as it was, and for the most part, it kinda worked. They did what they could to limit obvious corner-cutting techniques, animating character movements and framing conversations in such a way that key frames never become too oppressive, and awkward motion isn’t too distracting.

On the other hand, we have Xebec, who did the rest of the series, and to say they didn’t handle the fickle nature of the budget as well as IG did would be a generous freaking understatement. I guess the best example of the kind of job they do would be episode 16, the Monkey King stage play. This episode doesn’t just abuse key frame, it cuts back and forth between the SAME key frames, at one early point shooting it’s main characters way out in the background, with the entire rest of the frame filled with a simple beach landscape, the tiny characters barely moving as it cuts back and forth between this frame and another slightly more interesting one. It’s eventually revealed that the reason these excessive shortcuts were taken was so Xebec could show some action scenes towards the end, which probably would have made it feel justified if it wasn’t for the fact that the action in question isn’t even all that great. It’s not terrible by any means, but even a novice animator knows that it’s not worth letting 90 percent of your anime look like crap just to save your budget for a few mediocre fight scenes.

So yeah, the worst thing you can say about the animation over-all is that it’s inconsistent, but when it’s bad, it’s painfully bad. The same can be said for the artwork, which… Like the animation… Is at best, passable. The backgrounds are serviceable enough, as while they never really feel detailed or immersive, and extras existing in the background never really move or feel lifelike, it’s never so bad that you can’t imagine characters existing and living in them. They’re fine. The characters, however, run into some serious issues here and there. While it’s not a consistent problem, I do recall several instances of characters appearing off-model, frozen in time, or having the incorrect bodily proportions. There was one particularly egregious frame towards the end where Naru’s little sister temporarily went from a normal middle school physique to an inexplicable D-cup, and that’s not even at it’s worse. Motoko, the swordswoman character, had her face altered for this adaptation in a way that makes her look almost frog-like in the early episodes. Thankfully, that’s really the only deviation from the original character designs that I noticed. Anyway, the artwork is largely fine, but any given time, you’re only one rogue pause away from seeing what can only be described as bad fanart.

But you wanna know what’s consistently awesome, unlike the visuals? The music. Love Hina has a fantastic soundtrack, with it’s only real massive downfalls being the fact that you can’t really find all the sample tracks online, and the fact that several more recognizable tunes get recycled ad nauseum throughout the series. Not that the second issue matters, because the music is good, and you’ll welcome opportunities to hear each track multiple times. Unfortunately, the best track only plays once. It’s a solemn piano piece that plays in episode 12 between the opening theme and the title reveal, and it’s a classical track called Gymnopedies by Eric Satie. The rest of the music, which has been equally difficult to match names to, is overflowing with effort and personality, from the frantic upbeat songs to the beautiful insert songs that were all sung by the cast, and especially the more soulful tunes that get used for more sad or romantic moments. Songs dealing with individual characters carry the flavor of said characters, like Motoko’s traditionally eastern sounding themes and Kaolla’s exotic ones.

The opening, Sakura Saku, could almost be considered an ode to the fast forward button, as it just feels… Fast. from the song to the visuals, it’s an incredibly fast paced op where everything seems to be trying to catch up with each other. I get the feeling that this tone matches what Xebec and IG THOUGHT they were going for with this anime, but in reality, it doesn’t really match the tone of either the original manga OR the final product. It’s like, this is the op they commissioned when they though the show they were going to create was going to be slapstick, zany antics and physical comedy all the way through. Having said that, as fast an OP as it may be, it also comes off as a bit lazy, as it recycles visuals from the show… A pet peeve of mine, if you’re wondering… And otherwise introduces the entire cast through framed faceshots, a staple of the harem genre. Honestly, it’s a pretty annoying op that I found myself skipping over and over. The ending theme is better, employing a slower and more groovy song as it slowly pans across a single still image of the main female cast on the floor covered in nothing but loose white sheets, and while it feels completely out of place, it at least pleasant in comparison. Although, yes, I skipped it just as often.

The English dub has actually achieved notoriety over how terrible it is, as I don’t think I’ve seen a single reviewer attempt to recommend it over the sub… But honestly, I don’t think it’s really all that bad. Now once again, it’s not what you’d call good, but several of the performances are at least accurate, and the ones that aren’t are the product of bad casting and direction, although even in those cases I can kind of see what the director was trying to do. To start things off on a relatively positive note, Derek Stephen Prince’s performance is more or less what I hear in my head when I read Keitaro’s dialogue in the manga, and he’s able to stretch what should be a throat destroying role to some pretty diverse places and situations. He’s a good actor, but that doesn’t really make up for how annoying Keitaro’s voice sounds both in my head and in the show. Marginally better, albeit on the same note, is Bridget Hoffman in the role of Shinobu, the shy middle schooler who had much easier role to perform. Her waify Yamato Nadeshiko pitch would be a bit too grating for the original Shinobu, but with the bulk of her character development either removed or straight up replaced, she fits the part nicely.

When I’m having a discussion about bad, mediocre or middle-of-the-road voice actors, I always manage to shock the room by bringing up the prolific Wendee Lee. Yes, she’s had her fair share of outstanding roles, but she’s also been dragged down on too many occasions by poor direction choices that she just couldn’t manage to save. In Love Hina, she plays the energetic Kaolla Su as well as Su’s older sister Amalla in a dual role where she was asked to perform with an Indian accent… Even though the character is not Indian, and the dialogue even goes as far as to blatantly STATE she’s not Indian. Of course, there wasn’t much available in the way of other options, and there really isn’t a known accent attached to her people in the manga, and to her credit, Wendee does pull it off… When playing Amalla. When her range is stretched too far by the combination of acting, using a difficult accent AND playing a hyper character, the end result is just terrible. It’s still better than Barbara Goodson’s inexplicable southern drawl that’s supposed to act as a substitute for the Kansai accent, but ‘better’ is a relative term here, because they’re both virtually unlistenable.

And if you thought my criticism of Wendee Lee was hard to take, wait until you hear Mona Marshall playing Motoko Aoyama. Good God was this an awful casting choice. I’ve criticized her before for having a little boy voice that doesn’t sound remotely male, but that’s not to say the voice sounds like a natural woman, either… And she uses that exact voice to play Motoko, the kendo-obsessed girl and my favorite character from the manga. Every single word that comes out of her mouth sounds like it’s coming from the wrong person, like she’s the sad victim of a rogue ventriloquist. Rounding out the rest of the main cast we have Julie Ann Taylor doing a fine job with Mutsumi, playing her appropriately as a klutzy airhead, and Dorothy Elias-Fahn as Naru. This is one of Fahn’s two biggest credits, alongside Meryl Stryfe from Trigun, and to say the two characters are similar… Shouting, critical nags attached at the hip to doofus heroes… Is a bit of an understatement, but since Naru isn’t as well-rounded or fully realized a character as Meryl was, there’s also the problem that she doesn’t really click with the character as fast. She enters the role as a stuck-up screaming Tsundere, but to be fair, she does settle into the role as best as she can as the series progresses… Possibly even moreso than the character really deserves. It’s a dub that takes some tolerance and getting used to, but yeah, there’s no real reason not to watch it subbed.

Before I start to look more deeply at Love Hina, I should probably start by saying some things about it’s creator, Ken Akamatsu. As one of the founders of the modern harem genre, Akamatsu is a renowned mangaka whose works have been well received both critically and commercially, and his influence can be seen just about everywhere. He has seven unique titles to his name, but since Mao-chan started off as an anime, Kids Game is difficult to find and the less we say about Itsudatte My Santa the better, we’re going to focus on the way his work has evolved over the course of four of his most well known works; AI Love You, Love Hina, Negima, and UQ Holder. The first thing that I’d like to call attention to is that throughout his career, Akamatsu has had a penchant for inventive action scenes, PG-rated fanservice nudity, and deep, complex exploration of characters who seem at first glance to be nothing more than cheap tropes. Well those and all the weirdness, but the weirdness is largely unique to each title. It’s interesting to look at his body of work over the years, how it’s changed from title to title, but the most easily trackable change comes with the theory that he uses his fanservice as a crutch to keep readers interested throughout the story.

AI Love You was basically a rip-off of Ah My Goddess, with High School Keitaro in the lead role and Skuld being swapped out for a little boy. Not gonna lie, it’s pretty bad. The only thing it really has to offer is a generic slice of life story, disturbingly sexist undertones, and a lot of bare bottoms. It’s follow-up, Love Hina, had lot more effort put into it’s plot and story, with Akamatsu’s trademarked fanservice put into a more consistent context and more practical use as other elements and themes were experimented with. When Negima came around, Akamatsu didn’t even want to make a harem, wanting instead to try his hand at the shounen action genre, so he worked around his contract by using a beefed up harem as the roots and origin of such a story. Since the shounen action and magical adventures wound up being the most popular aspect of Negima, he wound up creating his most recent effort UQ Holder, a sequel to Negima and a pure shounen action series whose occasional fanservice feels more like a half-assed obligation than anything the writer’s really invested in. My point is, he’s grown as a writer, in maturity, craft, and many other areas. But Love Hina is still one of his earlier works, so you kinda have to expect an immature world-view going in.

Since Love Hina is the work that made him famous, it is the one most synonymous with his name, and it’s achieved a sort of iconic status in it’s own right, particularly as a gateway manga for a surprising number of otaku from both sides of the ocean. It’s appeal can best be explained by the way it utilizes it’s target audience, teenage boys and those who think like them. It works the best on readers who are lacking in experience with anime, manga and sex, and unless you’ve already spent your youth on it, it’s a surprisingly easy story to grow out of. Young readers are sucked in by the promise of crazy comedy, sexy antics and the bare bottoms of seven radically different female characters… But instead of just milking these impressionable young readers for cash, Love Hina introduces them to extended arcs, complex character writing, and a sense of conflict and themes that comes off as natural and never forced. For example, Keitaro and Naru aren’t just thrown together as the main prospective couple… In a house full of people who are only staying there to run away from something, they’re the only ones who are also running towards something, making them the most compelling members of the cast, and even when they’re battling against the literal force of fate, you still wind up rooting for them. There’s a lot more to this manga than just fanservice and slapstick, and it stays with you years later.

How well does the anime translate these qualities? Well, let me ask you this; after writing more than sixty anime reviews, how many times did I break the review to talk about the manga the series was based on, and why it worked? I did that here because there are tons of reviews that will tell you Love Hina doesn’t work, but I haven’t really come across any that went into detail about why. The manga works because in between every big memorable moment, there are volumes upon volumes of character development and a very specific order to the events which unfold. Because of this, it represents the best of a lot of otherwise regrettable tropes. Shinobu is the best “notice me sempai” girl, Keitaro is the best of the ‘obsessed over a childhood love’ characters, etc. Out of all the changes that the anime made, more of them being completely harmless than you might think, the absolute worst thing it did was rush the story, ignoring all of that glue and focusing solely on those big moments, and showing everything out of order. The characters are there, but the familiarity is gone. There’s no magic left in our bond with them, and with such terrible execution, nothing feels like it’s happening at the right time. This is a devastating problem for a story with so many imperfections that it needed that glue to cover up.

You can argue until the cows come home about Ken Akamatsu’s level of maturity, but he was not a stupid writer. One of the biggest complaints anyone has about the anime is how much abuse Keitaro suffers at the hands of his love interest, which is a complaint that isn’t heard nearly as often from the Manga’s readers, despite it happening about as often. This is where fanservice comes in. In the manga, almost every time Keitaro’s assaulted, it’s accompanied by either a peek at some panties or a flash of some flesh, and due to the static nature of a manga panel, the presumably 14-year-old reader has the option of lingering on the naughtiness, already perfectly framed, and then just glancing over the punch/kick/sword slash. In the anime, almost all fanservice is removed… Hell, girls don’t even enter the hot springs without towels until the halfway point! The abuse is left to it’s own devices, no distraction offered. This is why, among people who’ve only seen the anime, the character of Naru Narusegawa has the unfortunate stigma of being despised by otaku the world over.

I’ll try not to give too many examples of the disastrous changes the anime makes, at least in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but there are some that must be addressed. Keitaro lying about being a Tokyu U student is supposed to be a major plot point, one where he digs himself in deeper with each interaction, but in the anime, it’s swept under the rug soon after being brought up. Replacing the original Shinobu introductory arc with one that involves her parents feels forced and unnatural, especially since the most essential part of Keitaro’s lie was the way it affected her. There’s an incredibly important moment during a beach storyline where Keitaro is screwed by his friends into royally pissing off Naru, and it’s supposed to be a major speed bump between them that lasts three whole arcs, one of them being completely non-sensical for the sake of levity. Here, that levity arc is played first, and the initial friction arc is combined with another arc(that’s been shifted to three other characters) before being abruptly resolved under some generic fireworks. There are several new characters added, including a new romantic rival for Keitaro, Motoko’s harem of admirers, and Naru’s little sister, but none of them add anything to the story outside of writers’ conveniences.

Several new ideas, like Naru becoming an idol singer and Motoko dreaming she’s in a fantasy RPG game, are just as pointless, and often confusing in their logic. Even when the anime does something genuinely good, it’s still dragged down by mistakes that are even worse. There’s a tight focus on the mystery of who Keitaro’s promise girl is, and the love triangle that blossoms from it is handled well, unless you’re watching the episode where it’s suggested that she might have just been a haunted ball joint doll. The effect Motoko’s sister had on her life is explored thoughtfully, but we never actually meet her, so it ultimately falls flat. Kaitaro’s incest crazy sister was thankfully left out, which I’d give them major credit for if it wasn’t for the fact that A: She wound up getting her own movie and B: They wound up giving Kaolla and her siblings an incest episode that was even worse. The story wound up being incomplete because of budget issues that made it unfeasible to continue onto a second season, but if the right material had been cut, it wouldn’t have been an issue. The three movies that followed didn’t do the ending justice, rather they just animated some popular storylines that were left out. Seeing how ‘Read the manga’ type endings have affected me in the past, you can guess what my thoughts on this one are.

Love Hina was originally available from Geneon, and after they went out of business, it wound up being rescued and redistributed by Funimation. The original Geneon collections are still available online, such as the Complete collection set and the Perfect collection set, which includes the OVA episode and all three movies, or you can buy the two collections that Funimation has released… A thinpack box set with cover art that tried to make the material sexier than it actually is, and more recently an ‘Anime Classics’ collection that proves just how far they’re willing to stretch that term. The three movies can be found individually or in a box set, and while they’re technically out of print, they’re still fairly cheap online. The manga from Ken Akamatsu has been available stateside for so long that you can find the entire 14 volume set on Ebay for as low as 35 dollars, which is a deal I’d highly recommend. AI Love You is a bit trickier to find, and is thus a bit more expensive, even at only 8 volumes. A two volume light novel collection is also available stateside.

The word I feel best describes the Love Hina anime is incompetent. It does absolutely nothing right, and while it’s fairly easy to tell that it respects the source material, it’s just as obvious that it doesn’t understand the source material. The only episode that I found any enjoyment in was episode 12, which had me laughing out loud multiple times and sucked me into it’s story, with a little help from the aforementioned music. Aside from that one exception, every single episode of this turkey is tied for worst, and they all fail in such unique ways that I could have reviewed every single one of them on it’s own, had I wanted to. The comedy isn’t funny, the romance isn’t romantic, the drama has no stakes, the characters have no development, and I have the strangest feeling that they intentionally meandered throughout the entire run, thinking it was entitled to a second season that never happened, and were thus in no rush to reach any conclusion. I was willing for the longest time to give this title a few pity points, based on it’s good intentions, appropriately goofy nature and killer soundtrack, but that incest episode just sealed the deal. I give Love Hina a 1/10."
100245,"Back when I started the show as it aired on January 13 I liked Beatless. It had coloured me with joy and anticipation since it's first episode went so well. Compared to the other anime I started at the time, it felt like it could do a lot with it's premise. Tut Tut. It went out like a light for the whole first half and took a while to set itself on track, and unfortunately not the same track as I felt in episode 1, but hey, it had a direction, so that's already better than FranXX. 

Having said that, Beatless is far from perfect, despite throwing around it's ideology that robots do not make mistakes (and proving that wrong afterwards) it felt unnatural to see such robots (or hiEs if you may). The plot just kept on throwing random stuff at my face, sometimes Lacia is an idol taken straight from Aikatsu (Aikatsu Robot? Well that's redundant) and sometimes she's a fashion idol that makes Arato’s heart throb, not mine. Needless to say, it was inconsistent. It's inconsistent plot was evidenced in the first 7 weeks of it's run- I mean, episodes (will explain later) as it tried this thing or that. It began very badly after it's first episode and couldn't keep up till around episode 8 or 9 where it decided on one direction and stuck to it. How well that went is for us to judge, and my score can tell that enough. It was horrible in its first half. 

Aside from these inconsistencies we also had the shocking revelation that the voice acting for a few actors was bad. Namely Shiori and Kengo. They sounded very much fake, or robotic if you love puns as much as I do. Shiori sounded like she was making her debut and failed at it (I will be very surprised if I find out this actually was her debut). But out with that, a huge problem with the anime was it's convenience. Whenever a convenient problem came, Arato conveniently solved it and conveniently everything went according to plan. Not the best thing to do to be honest. Apart from that as mentioned these random irrelevant plot points just came along and made the show feel like a cluttered up mess (trying not to jab at FranXX a second time here). Many times I felt irritated by the show not trying to focus properly on whatever the heck it wanted to be doing but alas, rarely did the rabbit go down it's respectful hole. 



Moving away from that we come to another massively irritating part of the anime, the villains. Or should I say whatever the heck they tried to be. Let's start with Ginga. Watarai Ginga had a lot of potential since he was the former partner of the creator of the Lacia-class hiEs and his backstory could have been done better, but unfortunately they screwed up what could have been a great backstory and instead, mowed him down in terms of development during the series. He felt plastic. Not unlike cliched shounen villains who have no purpose other than “to destroy”. It was pretty irritating to be able to predict when Ginga would come or what Ginga would do, and though that ultimately let him to his super-predictable defeat (in the most shounen way possible), that's not an excuse especially when that's who you painted as the real villain. But ok, you do you Beatless. 

After that predictable defeat someone had to take his role of villain and they brought out the randomly created and introduced Erika Burrows, which I think is the most Nippon Western name I could come up with, but anyway, apart from showing how cryogenics can be successful (that's a debate for another day) she proved that Beatless could get a worse villain than Ginga. Her actions were unexplained, her motives were set aside (“I want something interesting”? Pls, you're rich, go get a PC and play games or something) and the way the show painted her personality was far from what I could call decent. I already complained about Ginga, so this can explain how bad she is. You might say she's not a villain, but if that's indeed true, then she has absolutely NO use in this show since she'd just become a nobody. 

Methode was introduced as that proud hiE who can beat em up and has good taste in sunglasses (trust me, those sunglasses, I need them) but she was pretty much another cliched villain who didn't improve. Although she had the motives, the way she carried it out and her brief appearances altogether shunted the true potential of this Character as well, another character with wasted potential. Now we move from bad villains to bad characters overall, namely our idiot MC, Arato. Arato was your average cherry boy. Apart from predictably falling in love with a robot his actions were as he said it himself, idiotic and uncalculated. In episode 19, they revealed what was the point of this incalculable mess of a character but not in the way you'd hope to call decent yet again. 



Then we move over to the other hiEs, Kouka was the one with a hard on Onee-san fetish but in all honesty I was rooting for her. She was literally the only character in the show I liked and as such I lost my mind completely in episode 16. If you like Kouka too, her actions in episode 16 will leave you in a fit of rage, since it was unexplained, random and rage inducing. Snowdrop was shown as that Loli robot (great diversity Diomedea) who eats other robots to gain power and can make humans lose their sanity (?) and do weird stuff which was noticed in the first episode just before Arato was rescued by Lacia. To date, I've yet to understand what she was doing and why but eh, let's move on, the last hiE to cover (Methode was covered above) is Saturnus, describing her will be a lot like Erika Burrows, in that it's a bit of a spoiler, although she has nothing to do in the plot I can freely tell you without spoilers that she has no use at all in the plot. Satisfying the maid fetish fans might have (yet again, great diversity Diomedea), all she did apart from that is go “yes” and “let's do this” and “alright”. Those were 80% of her lines for the whole show. Underused? You betcha. 

Now since I've been spewing all the negatives, let's neutralise with something that is both positive and negative, the sound. First the good, the music was great, the synth tracks used made it only the second show to extensively use synth tracks for it's soundtrack and BGM this year and needless to say it was well done. The OP/EDs as well did not disappoint. Now here comes the bad. Too much focus was kept into the music to do great in the other places. Production and budgeting wasn't done well since it was all about making that soundtrack and licensing the music, sadly this killed off the budget to focus on the other parts and so ultimately led to the downfall of the anime. Speaking of production issues, THE DAMN RECAPS. We had around 4-5 recaps for this 24 episode show. Let that seep in. Should a show get this many? I say no. Why did this show have so many recaps? Budgeting? We'll perhaps never know, but point is, I don't want to have a recap episode thrown at my face after waiting for a week. It's frustrating. For those who are binge watching it as well, the episodes are part of the show so it gets really irritating to see the words “Recap Episode” show up in your news feed. It cuts off from the main action badly. Oh wait, that itself is a fault in the show. 

It's transition from one scene to another is random and pretty much tiring to watch. I can't tell you how fed up I was of this. And let's not forget the fact that our Lacia-class hiEs were given absolutely NO SENSIBLE EXPLANATION. Apart from very minor dips into their backstories, the hiEs never had their purpose of creation explained apart from one line or the other, lines like “I'm created to help humanity move forward” isn't going to earn an excuse. You need proper explanation which sadly wasn't given. Now it's not all bad though. Apart from being my guilty pleasure of the year it did have good things in it. It's plot improved considerably in it's second half, which although wasn't obviously flawless, it was a nice improvement all the same, as a person who was pissed with the first half even the mediocre-decent bracket it was in felt good to me. 



Another important thing is that despite it's recaps, Beatless wasn't a rushed show. I never felt that it was rushed most of the time and the pace was pretty good in itself since I could easily watch the show without getting too much information at once. Another important point is that Beatless tried to do something different with it's main heroine, Lacia. Since this showed it's true colours in the last quarter of the show I won't delve in so deeply but it tried to paint her character in it's complete opposite way she was presented to us ever since the show started had mixed results, surprising because I thought it would fall flat on its face. It was well done since it changed my whole opinion of the past episodes of the show and Lacia herself. Kind of like that FranXX episode 13 which made you go “oh so this is why all this happened”, only that, and please bear with me on this one, it was done much better than FranXX. 

If you asked me to compare FranXX and Beatless’ first episodes, FranXX easily beat it but the answer is the complete opposite if you ask me their overall position. Yes. Beatless is better than FranXX. Despite it's crazed amount of stupidity, Beatless had a direction to follow. FranXX didn't. It took Beatless 7 episodes to find its purpose and the direction it should be following, FranXX on the other hand couldn't at all find what it wanted to do, it kept on changing every episode, therefore butchering it's consistency. If I talked to the Yasaal in January about this he'd have laughed me off the room because both shows certainly didn't show their true colours until later, FranXX with it's terrible attempts at relating to teenagers with a horrible consistency and Beatless’ lame cliches coupled with bad villains, constant recaps but a somewhat proper direction (?). They're close, but Beatless edges out FranXX. Why am I comparing the two? It's natural to compare two shows of a similar level. 

What started out as a guilty pleasure quickly turned into a show that made me impressed how a lame show can at least attempt at standing up and manage to somewhat achieve that. An E for Effort? You bet, might even give it a D+ if you like, because even though it had a lot of issues, Beatless was in itself a guilty pleasure to watch. Oh, and to satisfy all the fetishes with the hiEs, a responsible older partner (Lacia), the wild girl (Kouka), the proud girl (Methode), the Maid (Saturnus) and the Loli (Snowdrop), Diomedea, you sure have satisfied the fetishes. At this rate I might have a fetish of watching bad shows for guilty pleasure if I don't stop, but to Diomedea’s credit, Good Taste lads. Now we wait for the next few months till those last 4 episodes come out. How unclimactic...

21190,"Hello! I don't know what prompted you to click on this review, whether it was simple curiosity, you genuinely wonder what I think of this show, or you've watched this show yourself in the past so you know exactly what's coming. But whatever the case, we're going to go on an adventure today. Because this review is in fact going to be a total breakdown of this show and therefore means, this review is going to be FULL SPOILERS. I feel a special warning needs to be given right away since this is a mystery and if you find out everything, the effect of the show will be ruined. So once again, THIS REVIEW GIVES AWAY THE ENTIRETY OF THE PLOT OR WHATEVER MYSTERY WAS PRESENT IN THIS ANIME.
 
But if you wanted a non-spoilers take on this show, let me go ahead and quickly sum up the review I am about to write. This show is an amazing and wonderful journey to go on. I was in awe with almost every single scene at how masterfully crafted the dialogue was. It felt as if I was trapped within this show and could not leave until the last grains of the sand in an hourglass tumbled to the bottom. I would absolutely recommend everyone to watch this show, and give it a score of 10/100.
 
And no, that isn't a typo, and I did not forget a zero.
 
Let's just dive right into this, now.
 
youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNqPa2t4)
 
Also, this show did NOT deserve this OP.


 
This is an adaptation of the novel of the same title by [MORI Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/100190/HiroshiMori), brought to us by [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/A1Pictures). On top of this anime adaptation, it also received a visual novel, a manga adaptation, and a live TV drama. But we're here of course, to discuss the anime. Also, there'll be an entire section dedicated to the author himself, but like I said, we are forced to discuss the anime first.
 
Though, I'm not really too sure where to start. Like going in, I was aware that this was apparently of the mystery genre, but then the first episode was more or less mostly just the two main characters sitting in a room talking to each other. 

img440()

Let's get this right out of the way, this show is almost entirely dialogue. Apart from like a select series of scenes that show a certain character's past, every scene is talking and more talking. Like something happens in episode two, and basically the rest of the episodes are more less entirely the characters talking about what happened in episode two and who did it, and how it happened, and just... I feel bad for anybody who actually got suckered into actually caring about the ultimate result.
 
You have all this goddamned build up and I can  just picture someone seriously watching this show and actually going: ""Well who's the killer? What was the meaning of this? How did they do it? ...Oh, that's how it happened? That's... who did it? ...Oh. Ohhhhhhhh. Fuck.""
 
Like this may or may not be perceived as a bit harsh, but I'm talking Glasslip level type of scenes. They just talk and talk and talk and talk and  talk, but unlike Glasslip, there's a layer of incomprehensible pretentiousness to almost all of the dialogue that I just found kept bringing me back into it. That being said, there were definitely some conversations that were a bit more bland where despite trying my best to retain my focus on the show, I found myself staring at the wall in front of my computer as they continued to talk.


 
But then the mystery element I was told that was present in the show finally showed itself and then... then the characters started to talk again.
 
Did I mention that there is talking in this anime? Did I mention that they recap the original incident that this show is based entirely around several times after the viewer themselves watches it happen? Like okay, I get it. Stop going over the exact same thing again, and again, and again. Do something to try and figure it out. Do anything. Just do anything, PLEASE.
 
We had eleven episodes to get this done in, and it feels like nothing had happened at all of note like five episodes in. Like even at the very end, when the show was finally giving us answers, it still felt like the show hadn't even started.
 
I really need to stress this. There has been no other series where I have been this confounded about what the fuck the overall purpose of the series was upon finishing it. Like after finishing Glasslip, I could actually say ""well this was a slice of life/drama series that tried to tell a story but like with chicken metaphors I guess"". But with Perfect Insider like... everything about the mystery itself and the motivations of the characters investigating the mystery is just so fucking nonsensical and all over the place that I just can't. I just can't.
 
I feel like I'm dissecting some alien life form, trying to figure out what the fuck it even is.
 




 
Okay, in this series, we have three characters that matter. Obviously, there are more than three characters in the show, but only three matter. And even right now a day after finishing watching this show, I'm already blanking on the names of two out of the three characters. The only reason why I remember the third is because her name is said and brought up in all the dialogue over and over, and over again.
 
img440()
 
First, we have one of two of our protagonists. Souhei Saikawa. Let's go over the things that the show establishes about his character, shall we? He is a professor, he hates watermelon and other things, he can't properly do his eyedrops, he doesn't care much about anything really, he has a hobby of shutting the other protagonist the fuck down almost passively whenever he can, and he smokes. He smokes a lot. Almost every other scene, he's smoking. In the first couple of episodes, he asks if he can smoke in the island laboratory at least two times, maybe three. And him repeatedly asking if he can smoke is perhaps one of the most notable things I can recall about his character.

img440()
 
Oh, and apparently, he's intelligent. There's absolutely nothing about his character that is established apart from his past with the other protagonist that goes beyond ""he's some professor"", yet he is treated and acts like a ""detective"" character. Or well, he eventually starts acting like this. In the first handful of episodes, he could honestly give less than two shits about the mystery and is actually on the verge of leaving just because I guess he doesn't give a fuck anymore despite the fact two people are dead at this point. He eventually doesn't leave because he's pestered by the other protagonist or rather, his sidekick character, and then he finally starts to act a bit more proactive in trying to figure this whole thing out.
 
Then, when everything starts to get revealed, the series starts treating him and the culprit character like they're fucking Detective Akechi and Twenty Faces right out of Ranpo Edogawa's fiction. Like he's some brilliant detective that figured out this culprit's scheme and the culprit gets away to fight another day but they respect the professor's intellect and they're gonna return and fuck with him again at some point and just go fuck yourself (I thought this phrase a lot throughout watching the entirety of this show). I'm sorry, but you're not Ranpo Edogawa. Maybe you could have potentially fooled me, if your goddamned professor character had acted like he gave a shit before the series actually REQUIRED him to.
 
But hey, maybe he gets fleshed out a bit more or he does actually have to face the culprit again  in the nine other novels MORI Hiroshi wrote about this guy and his sidekick. Thankfully, I'll never find out, because even if they ever get translated, I never want to read a single thing by this guy if this is in fact a genuine and true adaptation of something he wrote. Unlike with Ranpo Kitan, I have much  more reason to believe this is the case.
 
img440()
 
Let's not get sidetracked any further though, and move onto the sidekick character, Moe Nishinosono. A... I actually don't know if she's a student of the professor, or what. Like I can still remember the backstory they eventually gave to how she and the professor met but... I can't recall if she was actually a student of the professor at the university or if she just creepily hangs around him 24/7.


 
One of my favorite parts in this series was how much the professor just shut and put Nishinosono down. I know that may or may not sound a bit sadistic, but it eventually began to approach an absurd level. Like from the very start of the show, Nishinosono is in love with the professor but the professor seems to only be interested in the third character, and of course Nishinosono (I'm honestly going to start just calling her ""Nishi"" after this point) gets super fucking upset and pouty if the professor even comes into close contact with any other female character.
 
And like her love for the professor is no fucking secret, he is basically completely aware of it and he is still shutting her down.


 
Jesus Christ. Also, I don't want to make the comparison to Kobayashi in Ranpo Kitan because Kobayashi was way more of a fun and interesting character, but Nishi almost feels... like okay.
 
First of all, she's the one who's primarily interested in solving the mystery of the show, and actually makes a struggling effort to try and get Professor Who Gives a Fuck to care. But like after a corpse missing their legs and arms is wheeled out on a cart, she's acting like it's no fucking big deal and she repeatedly mentions ""wow I can't believe I can laugh when the third character is FUCKING DEAD"" but then like in an episode or two, like some switch is flipped, and her character is just crying at numerous points of the episode. And I just... like what? Why are you having this emotion now? YOU WERE PERFECTLY FINE IN JUST THE OTHER EPISODE. THE RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS OF THIS LABORATORY WERE FREAKING THE FUCK OUT BECAUSE THERE'S APPARENTLY A MURDERER ON THE LOOSE, BUT YOU WERE FINE. NOW YOU'RE CRYING. WHY?
 
And then, and THEN, EIGHT EPISODES INTO THE SHOW AND AFTER NISHI BASICALLY HAD TO DRAG THE PROFESSOR BACK TO THE LABROATORY AFTER AN EPISODE THAT IS STRAIGHT UP JUST 100% ""well the professor and nishi will leave the lab and take a break from the mystery aka THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE SHOW""...

NISHI STRAIGHT UP SAYS... 
 

 
OF THE TWO CHARACTERS, YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS ACTING LIKE YOU CARED ABOUT THIS MYSTERY THE MOST. IF EVEN THE CHARACTERS DON'T CARE, THEN HOW IN THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO? TWO PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY DEAD, BUT I JUST CARE ABOUT GETTING CLOSE TO THIS PROFESSOR WHO DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK AND REPEATEDLY SHUTS ME THE FUCK DOWN EVEN THOUGH YEARS AGO, APPARENTLY HE CARED ENOUGH TO MORE OR LESS GET ME TO HAVE A DESIRE TO LIVE ON AFTER MY PARENTS DIED IN A HORRIFIC PLANE CRASH.
 
img440()
 
Our third and final character is Shiki Magata, and she is...
 
...Actually you know what, stop. Just stop. We'll get to her later.
 


 
So, let's talk about the dialogue. Episode one is a perfect... like episode one has everything you're going to get from the rest of the show. Because ninety percent of it is just characters sitting or standing in a room talking with each other, and the dialogue is just... like take pretentious or dumb lines someone thought was cool or smart, odd and sometimes downright baffling scene transitions, and just a general numbing boredom and throw them all into a pot and mix it up, and you get Perfect Insider.
 
From the very start, I was fully engaged in this show because almost every time I was starting to feel bored, there would be a line of dialogue that would really strike me and forcibly drag the attention of my brain back to the show. There were just so many... like see, it honestly feels like to me that this show is in fact an adaptation of an actual novel, but simultaneously, it feels like it's NOT. Because I am in utter disbelief... like a part of my brain stubbornly wants to give the original creator a sliver of the benefit of the doubt. Like no, this novel is apparently well liked, it apparently won awards, the original novel CANNOT possibly be this bad.



What's the most important information to know about a character to establish in the first episode if it's NOT what they don't like to eat?
 
And full disclosure maybe the original novel is in fact slightly better, but I am most likely never going to find out, because even if this particular novel was translated in English (it's not), that is how negative of an overall impression this anime has made on me. Like if this anime is even slightly accurate to MORI Hiroshi's novel, then holy shit that novel is literally a waste of paper.

...That's admittedly probably one of the harshest things I've ever written about a person's work of fiction without having actually read the original source material, but let me try and justify it in the rest of the 9,000 words of this review.
 
Don't get me wrong. I have nothing wrong with having a lot of dialogue. Hell, Glasslip was even worse in this department as that dialogue got way less laughs out of me, but I'd still probably not even call Glasslip the worst show I've ever watched. But if you're going to have a lot of dialogue and want it to be purposely good, then it has to be well written or interesting in any way.
 
Working out the details of a single murder or aspects of it over and over and over again in multiple episodes is... look, I haven't watched the TV drama, but I find it fucking suspect that in the TV drama version, the story that this anime is adapting is like only two episodes. It makes me wonder, were the TV drama people simply cutting a bunch of redundant shit out from the novel, or if the anime staff were desperately trying to stretch out the material to eleven episodes.
 
Those are the things I'm thinking about when I look back on this series. Not memorable characters, not memorable scenes, but trying to figure out whose fault it is.
 
I mentioned this in the section about the Characters, but it bears repeating. There are just so many weird and strange emotional or tonal shifts that happen throughout the dialogue. You think it's going to go one way, but then it completely flies off into the unknown.



God damn it, Nishi. There is a MUTILATED CORPSE ON A CART just in the other hallway. 

Why is Nishi so upbeat and jovial after witnessing a corpse who has had their legs and arms sawed off be wheeled out on an automated cart? Why does she start crying throughout an entire episode after having a dream? Was it just a delayed reaction to the corpse? The staff of the laboratory facility is shown freaking out and sound genuinely distressed around when the murders happen, but then the rest of the time they seem perfectly normal? Isn't there supposed to be a murderer still roaming around? Why the fuck does one of them feel like it's the perfect time to show Nishi the virtual reality machines where the virtual world is shown being created in the form of LEGO BLOCKS? She's hopping around on skyscrapers with her ideal and perfect dream version of the professor WASN'T THIS A FUCKING MYSTERY SERIES WITH MURDERS, WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING.


 
Then the girl that forced her to undress so she could show her the virtual reality machine tells her from the other pod over that she's having a sexual experience with a different virtual version of the professor WHICH ISN'T WEIRD AT ALL. BUT HEY IN THE END, THE VIRTUAL REALITY MACHINE ENDS UP PROGRESSING THE PLOT, WHEN THE KILLER REALIZES WHAT THE FUCK THE PERSON WHO WAS MOST INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY IS DOING WITH HER TIME AND THEN CONTACTS HER THROUGH THE VIRTUAL REALITY MACHINE.
 
""That's pretty weird. They haven't made as much progress as I would have thought. I guess I'll throw them a bone?""
 
Also, can I just say... I'm going to go further into this later, but it was really fucking transparent what they were doing when they kept mentioning specific details over and over again. The more and more you bring something up as a concrete thing, the more it's gonna cause me to question if that's really the case. Professor and Nishi already know that Magata, our third character, has been isolated in this room for fifteen years and that nobody has been in or out for the entirety of those fifteen years.
 
...Why do you keep bringing it up? Why do you keep bringing up the fact that she created this operating system the ENTIRE FACILITY runs on over and over again? Why do you keep saying this operating system that SHE designed is perfect and foolproof when something WENT WRONG? Are these important plot points? Should I jot them down in my notepad?
 
Oh, this is important. Can't finish this section off without talking about this. There is an actual scene where Professor and Magata's older sister sit down and talk, and it's been multiple episodes after Magata's sister has entered the show, but she hasn't gotten a single line of dialogue. 

img440()

Lo and behold, you could miss them mentioning this detail, but she is from America or for some reason speaks only in English? So the Professor has a conversation with her in English and it lasts from five to ten minutes, possibly even longer, but it feels like it goes on for fucking ever. I was immediately ejected from the scene, because my attention immediately flew to seeing how long it was going to go on for.
 
It feels so very much like something they took right from the novel and it just does not translate. In a novel form, you just include as a side note: ""The Professor and Magata's sister spoke in English."" But in anime form, we... have to actually hear that conversation, and nothing is correct. I can't even describe it. It is hands down one of the absolute worst scenes of the entire show as I've never been so forcibly knocked out of a show before. Additionally, my favorite detail about that scene is the fact that Magata's sister speaks in English !just does not matter in any way shape or form and is a complete fucking red herring.!
 
To conclude on the dialogue, can I just throw this out there? The professor straight up says to Nishi at one point early on that he hates expository dialogue in mysteries.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 


 
Maybe the actual title of this show should have been Everything Becomes F...
 
...ucking Stupid.
 
Because now I'm going to attempt to accurately describe the plot of this series, which is not going to be a very easy task at all.
 
The show starts with the Professor and Nishi talking in his office, the Professor leaves temporarily to go help a student with his computer problems, Nishi takes the opportunity to snoop and look at the Professor's computer and to her dismay finds that he was reading about Shiki Magata who is in fact female and thus this irritates Nishi, who then proceeds to suggest to the Professor to take his entire class to the island where Shiki Magata is being kept in isolation in the Magata Research Facility as a result of having killed her own parents as a child but was found insane rather than guilty.
 
Almost the entire rest of the show takes place on this island, that Nishi pushes the Professor into going to with his entire class. For Nishi knows that the Professor has an interest in meeting Magata as he admires her for some reason, so she wishes to meet with Magata again now that the Professor knows she's capable of meeting with her, but doesn't wish to let the Professor and Magata actually meet themselves.

img440()
 
...But then when they get to the facility, oh no, it turns out she was murdered and had her arms and legs cut off! And then, the rest of the show is about them solving (or not solving) the mystery.
 
There are multiple plot threads going on throughout the show and they're all thrown together in one gigantic jumbled mess. It'll switch from one to the other at the drop of a fucking hat.  We've got them trying to solve the mystery, Nishi's prior meeting with Magata which it'll switch to multiple times throughout the entirety of the show, scenes showing Magata's past with her INCESTUOUS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH HER UNCLE and her murdering her parents because literally why not, and the past of or how Nishi and the Professor met.
 
...But the main plot of the show is of course obviously, them trying to solve the mystery. Which coincidentally, or perhaps not coincidentally, is I think perhaps the absolute worst section of the show. Like both the scenes of Magata's past as well as how Nishi met the Professor could have been removed from this show and expanded into complete and far more interesting shows than... the actual main plot of this show.
 
That finally brings us to where this review is about to finally and at long last go completely off the rails. I hope you paid attention to the warning at the start of the review if you cared about being spoiled.
 
Because there's no way I can possibly discuss how terrible the mystery of the show is without fully giving it away entirely.

But first, here is a completely irrelevant exchange that happens several episodes before the mystery is solved.



Have you figured it out yet?
 


 
...Before we reach the peak of idiocy, something needs to be stated really quickly. As my reviews are to an extent purposely comedic in nature, it could be perceived that I'm often exaggerating when I bring up the more absurd moments in certain shows I review, such as this one. However...

In most cases, but especially this one, I must stress that this is in fact the show. I am in fact not trying to make it sound any funnier or more absurd than it is, this is actually what the show has to offer. I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who sat through the entirety of this show seriously watching it and hoping for all of the dialogue to build up to anything. Because it just fucking crashes and burns in perhaps one of the most spectacular train wrecks I have ever seen.
 
The culprit of the show, the person who was behind it all, the murderer of Shiki Magata our one out of THREE characters... drumroll please...
 
...is Shiki Magata.
 
img440()
 
Wow. The victim is ALSO the murderer? That'd be a pretty good and satisfying twist in itself, RIGHT? 

But no, there's more. See, the truth really was that nobody else but Shiki Magata entered that room fifteen years ago. However, do you remember her incestuous relationship she had with her uncle? That's right. She was pregnant with her cousin daughter when she went into isolation after knifing her parents to death after originally planning on manipulating her uncle to commit the murders. You're probably clawing at your computer monitor at this point, begging for this to stop. But it doesn't. There's even more.
 
See, the corpse that is wheeled out at the start of the show is in fact a Magata. It is in fact, Shiki Magata's daughter. Who was posing as her older sister (SHE HAS AGED FIFTEEN YEARS BUT NO NOBODY QUESTIONS THE FACT THAT THE IMPOSTOR SHIKI MAGATA LOOKS EXACTLY HOW SHE DOES WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM), whom eventually wished for her daughter to eventually kill her. But as a result of Nishi asking the false Shiki Magata a three word long question, that being, ""Who are you?"", Shiki's daughter became conflicted to the point where she killed herself. Shiki Magata being absolutely brilliant and a genius realized, okay, my plan didn't go as I planned it, so now I'll cut off my daughter's arms and legs, put the rest of her corpse on a cart, and then wheel it out into the hallway when the door will open at the very specific moment I programmed into the operating system the people who are apparently supposedly keeping me in isolation used for the entire facility of which I'm being kept isolated in.
 
I know it really seems like I'm making this shit up on the spot, but I'm not, I swear. If I were, I would be an award winning and published novelist like MORI Hiroshi, god damn it.

img440()
 
This way, I can then use my daughter's mutilated corpse which I then also took the time to dress up in a wedding dress after I removed her arms and legs as a distraction, so I can get into the elevator and get to the roof, and when my uncle who is the director of this facility in which I was being kept isolated comes back in the helicopter, I will pretend to be my older sister from America who may or may not be a complete lie I created myself. I will then later return to the roof and my uncle will allow me to personally and literally stab him in the back gruesomely with my knife, because I wanted my daughter to kill both her parents and while I'm perfectly fine with murdering my uncle aka her father, I'm later going to say I won't kill myself, I instead want someone else to kill me.
 
Oh, and then I'm going to just fuck with the Professor and Nishi and purposely try and see if they can catch me, and then I will get away, but then I'll come back to talk to the Professor specifically because I apparently respected his totally present intellect, and then pretend I am captured by his guards after meeting with him, but that was completely unneeded and just one last thing to fuck with the Professor and also further mislead the viewer.
 
Instead, I get away completely scot free, and the show ends with me talking to my alternate personalities.
 
...
 
...This is a real show that exists. There is no possible way to defend this twist. 

img440()

They made it a point to have false Magata to be shown wearing gloves in her video meeting with Nishi because the purpose of the gloves were to prevent false Magata from leaving fingerprints for her fifteen year long stay in that room with her mother? But... but, shouldn't they have had cameras in the room itself to keep track of what this person being kept isolated since she brutally murdered her parents is doing? IF THEY HAD CAMERAS, AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER IN THE SPAN OF FIFTEEN YEARS, ONE OF THOSE CAMERAS WOULD CATCH TWO MAGATAS ON THE SCREEN ONCE. But no, just have the front of outside of the door have cameras. That makes total sense.
 
But what makes this twist even more offensive is that like throughout the entire show, Magata is treated like a fucking brilliant and level headed genius by almost all of the characters. One of the hugest aspects of the Professor's character is that he admires and supposedly wants to be like Magata. But we're straight up shown that at thirteen years old, this apparent genius actively entered an incestuous relationship with her uncle, and I think the original purpose she had for this was she was going to have her uncle be the one to commit the murders.


 
Yet when time to comes to brutally murder her parents with a knife, she just straight up takes the knife away from the uncle and basically does it herself. It's established and reiterated over and over again that Magata has alternate personalities, and is actually shown at various points of the show to actually talk to these alternate personalities. But hey TGG, she can make operating systems and a Lego Block Virtual Reality system, SHE'S A GENIUS. Are you kidding me?

img440()
 
WHY WOULD YOU LET THE PERSON YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING ISOLATED DESIGN THE ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEM OF THE FACILITY? DON'T YOU THINK THAT WAS A BAD IDEA? YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GO FOR THE ACTUALLY INSANE BUT GENIUS MURDERER CHARACTER, BUT THE MOMENT THAT IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS WITH HACKING HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS AND LEGS OFF AFTER SHE KILLED HERSELF AS A RESULT OF HER MOTHER'S ACTIONS, IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS NO WAY TO STILL BE CAPABLE OF EMPATHIZING WITH THIS CHARACTER.
 
BUT YET, THE OTHER CHARACTERS STILL TREAT HER LIKE A GENIUS. THE PROFESSOR HAS A LAUGH AFTER HE MEETS WITH HER AGAIN AFTER HE REALIZES SHE PULLED ONE LAST POINTLESS TRICK ON HIM AND THEN GOT AWAY.
 
SHE GETS AWAY. AFTER FUCKING EVERYTHING, SHE GETS AWAY, AND THE SERIES JUST ENDS. IT JUST STOPS.



This is actually how the show ends. Magata talking to nobody in virtual reality/dream space, then credits. And that's it. That's literally it.
 
WHAT THE FUCK. I'M OKAY WITH THINGS WHERE THE VILLAIN WINS IN THE END OR GETS AWAY SCOT FREE, BUT THE VILLAIN HAS TO BE AN [INTERESTING OR WELL CREATED CHARACTER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HannibalLecter). NOT LITERALLY PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST ACTUALLY INSANE CHARACTERS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY MEDIUM.
 
Like oh, I sawed my daughter's arms and legs off, but I'm gonna enter this cat and mouse game with these LITERALLY RANDOM STRANGERS and have a long extended conversation in English with this Professor while I'm pretending to be my own older and American sister.
 
...WHY? I WILL PAY MONEY TO ANYONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF MAKING SENSE OF THIS CHARACTER'S ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS SERIES BEYOND ""WELL, SHE'S AN INSANE PERSON"". I KNOW SHE HERSELF STATES THAT SHE WANTS TO BE CAUGHT/KILLED, BUT UGH.
 


 
...You would think I'd be done, after that last section, but no. You see, this series is honestly almost too perfect in how absolutely terrible it is. The entire show, it's pounded into your head that the operating system that this facility runs on is foolproof and perfect as it was designed by the most brilliant genius that has ever lived within this universe, Shiki Magata.
 
...It's not like this isolated genius killer could have possibly purposely sneaked a couple of secret flaws into the operating system to facilitate her escape or rather, when her room's door finally begins to open for the first time in fifteen years. And, of course, it's not like the people running this facility would check any of the versions of the operating system Magata gives them for any funny business. It's not like she's been stuck in a room for fifteen years, it's not like she's ever going to want to escape so she can be outside ever again.
 
So, what was the flaw? What was the little thing that Magata sneaked in resulting the cameras losing that one single second where she slips out of her room right after her daughter's mutilated corpse is wheeled out?

img440()
 
...It's time to discuss hexadecimals, and the title and one of the mysteries of this show. In other words, the saying ""Everything Becomes F."" The characters discuss this saying that Magata leaves for them and what it could possibly mean. Magata has been stuck in that room for fifteen years, Magata's secret daughter is fifteen years old, the books and volumes Magata has in her room only go up to the number fifteen, and I believe the idea that a human mind basically straight up goes onto a downslide after the age of fifteen is repeatedly brought up and believed by Magata herself.
 
Everything becomes F...

 
 
See, this is where a basic general knowledge of hexadecimals comes in handy. Everybody knows about hexadecimals. Approximately .025 percent of all people on this Earth are aware of what hexadecimals are and the purpose they serve, but they are also aware that...
 
...Ugh. Let's just... let's just drop the act and open Wikipedia.

img()
 
In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.
 
Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.
 
In a non-programming context, a subscript is typically used to give the radix, for example the decimal value 10,995 would be expressed in hexadecimal as 2AF316. Several notations are used to support hexadecimal representation of constants in programming languages, usually involving a prefix or suffix. The prefix ""0x"" is used in C and related languages, where this value might be denoted as 0x2AF3.
 
Everything becomes F... in other words, everything becomes fifteen, because F or rather, FFFFFF is in fact the hexadecimal that represents the number fifteen. The operating system that Magata designed is basically designed to have time either fall back or skip forward a single minute later fifteen years after she enters the room, causing the camera recording the front of the door of her room, to basically have two files of that one particular minute, leading to the one that actually captures her escaping to the elevator being overwritten. 

img440()

And that, my friends, is the genius scheme that the brilliant Magata uses to escape her room prison so she can murder her uncle lover, and then eventually proceed to escape the island.
 
Should note that there's actually more to this, like while fifteen was I believe the key number involved, seven was also a relevant number because seven is apparently a ""lonely number"" or something. I just... this part of the show is just so fucking needlessly convoluted and dumb I just can't even be bothered to try and decipher it.

img440()
 
I mean, did I say convoluted and dumb? I meant smart, intelligent, and deeply thought out.
 
...But my question is however, why think of something that convoluted fifteen years in advance? She apparently murdered her parents in the first place to ""free herself"", but that result led to her... while she was somehow found not guilty but rather insane, it results in her being stuck in one single room for fifteen years. Of like the two scenes we saw of her parents, they didn't seem like bad people at all. But no, I have to murder my parents, and if I ever have a child of my own, I want her or him to murder their parents as well for some reason. Because you cannot be ""free"" unless you fucking brutally kill your parents.
 
...Did you know that... apparently MORI Hiroshi receives criticism over... this? These computer jargons?

img()
 
In addition, Mori's works, especially The Perfect Insider, is often criticized for the overuse of computer jargons. He responds that it is perfectly natural for people with some background knowledge to have a better understanding than others. According to Mori, computer jargons are not much different from proper nouns, like the names of celebrities or fashion brands, in the sense that they are in most cases just there as ornament that serves to create a particular mood.
 
Yeah, no. I'm willing to believe a huge amount of people, the majority really, are even aware of what hexadecimals are. Just like I'm also willing to believe everybody reviewing this review right now is capable of reading binary. Why else would I just randomly include binary in a review if that wasn't the case?
 
01001101 01001111 01010010 01001001 00100000 01001000 01101001 01110010 01101111 01110011 01101000 01101001 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100001 00100000 01100111 01100101 01101110 01101001 01110101 01110011 

...See, like even if you can't perfectly read binary or find a free binary translator online, it creates a particular mood!
 
Let's be honest here. The hexadecimals did manage to create a particular mood. I haven't laughed as hard as I did when Magata and the Professor started to talk about hexadecimals in her virtual reality Lego Block machine in a looooooong time.
 


 
We're now far past being completely off the rails. Now, we're fully into the ""Wikipedia section"" of the review. As a disclaimer, I just want to say, as a person, MORI Hiroshi is probably a kind enough person in real life and I bare him no genuine ill will.

But after completing Perfect Insider, and going through his English Wikipedia page
 
haha seriously using Wikipedia as a source
 
for at least some answers to my many, many questions... well, just to say the least, I don't think I have any reason to believe the novel is any better than what this anime presented to me. In a lot of cases, I like to give the original creators the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it's a [farcical representation of twisted versions of his stories or ideas](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace), maybe [it reads better or is just a bad adaptation](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another), etc. But the impression I got of him as a writer is just...
 
just want to reiterate, I'm not seriously judging a person via information off of their Wikipedia page BUT
 
Like if you were curious why I was putting his name like I have been, that's because he insists others do so. And let's be honest here, since I'm completely shitting on both a probably faithful representation of his debut work as a writer and also partly him himself, I should at least put his name the way he insists it be written. While he may be famous for his mystery novels, he considers his status as a craftsman and researcher to be above that of a novelist. Oh...
 
But well, why did he originally decide to become a writer? Well once, he just joked that he'd just automatically become a writer by the age of forty.  He also has stated he want an additional source of income to help fund the expansion of his miniature garden railway. Additionally, he wanted to impress his daughter who happened to be a fan of mystery novels.
 
...Look, all those reasons are valid enough to become a novelist. But, if you started writing on a whim or not because specifically you enjoy or want to write good stories, my impression of you as a writer is going to immediately slide a bit. So when ""computer jargons"" come into play in one of your stories, I'm going to be more of the mindset that you were just stringing together complete nonsense to make something completely convoluted. You can bring your knowledge about science and computers into your mystery novels. Hell, that's probably a great idea! But you have to still make it interesting or bare some relevance to the mystery and make it seem like not a gigantic asspull.
 
Like hexadecimals? That's really what you went with? It clashes so fucking horribly with what we've been shown of this character. She's murdered multiple people bluntly with a knife, has alternate personalities, is a genuinely a sociopath, and this is the clever thing she comes up with, to get away. HEXADECIMALS. OPERATING SYSTEMS. VIRTUAL REALITY LEGO BLOCKS. OVERWRITING VIDEO FILES.

I honestly think it’s almost on par with the idea of trying to tell a story entirely through chicken metaphors.
 
Then salt is just slammed into my wounds because this is apparently not originally the first novel he wrote about the Professor and Nishi. No, this was the fourth. His editor viewed this however as the most shocking of the four, so it became the first to be published.
 
...What? Okay, you wrote a series of four novels about these two characters, let's take the very last one and publish it first? So wait, is there an actual introduction in one of the later S&M novels? In the anime, these characters were never introduced. The first episode just starts up, they're in the office and talking, and then they go to the island on a class wide camping trip, and then murder just happens. What?
 
As someone who has been stuck in writer's block hell for a year or two since writing a shitty self-published thing I did in high school that I don't ever actually want other people to see, there is no other way for me to take someone saying ""oh I finished my novel by just writing every night for like three hours"" other than the way it sounds.
 
Oh, writing is so easy! In the twenty two years I've been writing, I've written somewhere over thirty mystery novels and countless short stories and all this other stuff, because writing is just so easy.
 
Also trust me, I know how this is sounding. And I know as someone who has never actually read (or will read) any of his non-adapted stories, I might be acting a little too harsh.
 
So let's turn around and get to the heart of the matter.

The original novel of Subete ga F ni Naru won an award after being published in 1996, you know. It won the acclaimed Mephisto Prize by the editors of Mephisto Magazine. The award was as well coincidentally, established in 1996. That's a weird coincidence, but whatever, the magazine just happened to start this award and just happened to pick this novel that happened to to be a debut novel of this guy both in the same year...
 
No big deal, it was just a coincidence--oh...

So... MORI Hiroshi's editor has stated that the entire purpose of and reason why the Mephisto Prize was established was so they could give it to MORI Hiroshi for Subete ga F ni Naru to make his debut more sensational. What? What? His editor just came out and admitted this? I mean I'm sure he was a great researcher before he switched to writing, but that doesn't automatically mean he's going to be a good writer. How does that not sound sketchy as fuck?
 
Okay, this is gonna be your very first published novel, here is an award to draw more attention to it.
 
To be fair, since then, the Mephisto Prize has been given to fifty other novels (also it's generally to previously unpublished novels), so it's not like it’s something that just went away right after kickstarting MORI Hiroshi's thirty novel plus career as a novelist but... like if his editor hadn't apparently said this himself, I would have thought nothing of it.
 
But to be fair, starting an entirely new award for Subete ga F ni Naru specifically makes a lot more sense with an ulterior motive. I mean typically anyways, it's not like debut novelists cause a new award to be created. The Edogawa Ranpo Prize, the Bram Stoker Award, etc... obviously, those came after the writers they're named after... and sure, the Mephisto Prize isn't named after MORI Hiroshi but the actual magazine but why would his editor ever think it's a good idea to just throw that out there???

Oh, it was just to make his initial debut more sensational. No big deal.
 
It's just yet another weird footnote on top of everything else connected to this fucking series. 

""It's an award winning novel!!! An adaptation of the award winning novel from MORI Hiroshi!!! Please watch/buy the book!!! It won an award!!!""
 


 
Let's correct our course here and get back to the series. What... exactly was the point of this series? Or rather, I guess I'm asking, what was the point of this story? This being the fourth story MORI Hiroshi about this Professor and his jealous pouty sidekick made a lot of things make more sense. Perhaps in the other stories the Professor is possibly a bit more proactive or acts interested in the mysteries...? Maybe? Maybe they actually successfully catch the fucking culprit in one of the nine other novels.
 
Because like believe me, I am by no means a mystery buff (I've read literally [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AndThenThereWereNone)). That's just not my primary genre. BUT, I've always thought that the point of reading a mystery was... like you're supposed to be able to take an interest in the characters trying to figure out who did something and then usually, bringing that person to justice. Sure, if the culprit character is a good or interesting character or if the writer intends on having her show up again then them getting away in the end is fine depending on how you do it.

img440()
 
But from the brief descriptions of the other stories they covered in the TV drama, it seemed like the other S&M stories are mostly unrelated. Everything Becomes F, or the ones involving Magata, are like in the middle of the series. So... what was with that ending, then? Magata gets away, but then the show ends with Magata talking with her daughter/her alternate personalities, and then the credits roll, and that's the end. So Magata just gets away and wanders off somewhere else??? What was that ending if not to basically just once and for all fully confirm that Magata is fucking completely insane rather than some genius like the show’s been treating her?

Was I supposed to be invested in the process of them trying to figure out the mystery and NOT react so negatively when it turned out to be a convoluted pile of garbage? Hexadecimals! Computers! How convoluted the entire thing is just undercut by the fact that this was all just planned in advance. Oh okay, so it wasn’t a virus or anything that messed up the operating system and caused the whole actual mystery of the show, it’s just that Magata knew exactly when she’d need the door to open so she just wrote it into the operating system that she was allowed to design and the facility actually used without checking any of the versions over at all FOR FIFTEEN YEARS.

...Additionally, the show never answered enormously important questions. How exactly did she hack off her dead daughter’s arms and legs? When they went into her room, firstly, it was entirely spotless, and additionally, I didn’t see any of the tools that you would probably need to remove a person’s arms and legs. The show made the point to have her daughter be shown wearing gloves so the daughter didn’t leave any fingerprints thus proving that she wasn’t Shiki Magata but… like you’re telling me right after Magata’s daughter killed herself, she was just standing there with the hacksaw at the ready, AND NOT A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD HIT THE GROUND? YOU WANT TO GO INTO FULL DETAIL ABOUT HEXADECIMALS, BUT NO, THESE DETAILS, NO, THEY DON’T MATTER. HEXADECIMALS ARE WHAT MATTER.

Let’s not even go into how she could have possibly given birth to a daughter alone with no doctor or anything, and then raised that daughter for fifteen years without somebody finding out. I mean what did she do? Uh yeah, can you go out and buy some baby food and pass it through the door slot? I don’t know, maybe that’s EXACTLY what she did. It’s actually established that she can just have the security people watching over her door buy stuff for her and then just pass it to her through the door slot without questioning why she would want these things.

img440()
 
If you were to recommend me this series as a “great” or even “good” mystery and I took your recommendation seriously and watched it, I think the result would have been I would have never wanted to even come close to the mystery genre ever again if this is an example of a GOOD mystery.

If that’s out, then… was I supposed to care or feel interested in the characters of Professor and Nishi? Or find any of their dialogue interesting or entertaining? I find that hard to believe. I’m really not exaggerating when I call him Professor Who Gives a Fuck. He just smokes, shuts down Nishi, and admires and wants to be more like Miss I Killed My Uncle, Parents, and Cut My Daughter Cousin’s Arms and Legs Off After She Killed Herself Because of My Actions. That’s his entire character.

img440()

And when they really start to go into the past between Professor and Nishi, it’s way too fucking late for it to matter. It’s so late when the reveal happens that it honestly seemed to me like Nishi herself had forgotten this and was remembering it along with the audience, but I think she’s supposed to actually remember it? But like the show itself cuts away when it’s showing the meeting between her and Magata before the show’s start where Magata asks her “well wasn’t there someone standing next to you when you saw your parents fucking die and also why do you love the professor so much that you stalk him”.

Like the mystery was well in progress, but the show’s still doling out information about the past of our actual two main characters. It felt so nonsensical to me when watching it, but like I said, Everything Becomes F not being the first S&M story makes it make way more sense. Though, now I have to wonder if the story that’s actually about the death of Nishi’s parents and her meeting with the Professor are like the fourth novel since MORI Hiroshi’s editor said “hey let’s just fuck up the order because this one is more shocking! It’s fine! Who cares!”

So the characters are awful, the dialogue is awful, the mystery is awful, and basically nothing that mattered was actually brought to any sort of satisfying resolution. Again, I must ask myself… what was the point of this show?

I still have no fucking idea. Wait… no. That's not true.

They made… a proper adaptation of this guy’s original novel for… fans of the original novel/series. Which… apparently exist somewhere out in the world because how in the hell could he still be writing novels if literally NOBODY read them?

Look, I haven’t read the novel myself, but I’m willing to wager that if A-1 Pictures had done any meddling rather than straight up adapting the novel word for word as I believe they did, I think it would have actually done more good than bad. 

Like even taking changing the actual mystery or removing hexadecimals off of the table, just… like, the Professor and Magata’s discussion in English could have happened off the screen. That is clearly something they took right from the novel that is fucking terrible in actual execution.

That’s really all I have for people looking if they’re seriously considering watching this. If you’re already a fan of this guy’s stories or find them interesting then… sure. Otherwise, definitely not, especially if you’re in search of a satisfying or well written mystery series. But if you’re someone like me who can derive entertainment from things I simultaneously view to be as fucking horrible, then I would totally (and did at the very start) recommend this series.

I mean, if you’ve read this far, the effect is somewhat ruined because of the spoilers, but I still strongly recommend it as a fan of entertainingly bad shows. Oh… did I even mention that the ultimate moment when they confront Magata/THE KILLER and explain the hexadecimals, they do it through the Lego Block virtual reality? And like Magata and the Professor are sitting together on chairs on a Lego Block virtual beach while Nishi is just in some dumpy room yelling out her incorrect conclusions through virtual reality space that the viewer themselves know to be entirely incorrect at this point?



Did I mention that at this point the police are in the real life world room and working to trace Magata’s access to VIRTUAL REALITY WORLD? There’s… there’s just so much to unpack and question (in a bad way), that frankly, I personally believe this series is amazing.

Oh yeah, when the Professor just decides he’s spent enough time in the facility after two people have already died and leaves with the intention of getting off the island, he and Nishi are just allowed to go freely. Why? I genuinely expected for any of the staff to say, I don’t know…

Hmm… oh, I got it.

YOU TWO CAN'T JUST LEAVE. YOU RANDOMLY SHOWED THE FUCK UP AND MURDERS STARTED HAPPENING OUT OF THE BLUE. HELL, THEY INITIALLY GOT INTO THE FACILITY VIA NISHI LYING ABOUT HAVING A HEADACHE OR SOMETHING. 



MAYBE ONE OF YOU IS THE CULPRIT, OR EVEN IF WE DON’T EXPECT THAT TO BE THE CASE, SHOULDN’T THE FACILITY BE ON TOTAL LOCK DOWN UNTIL THE POLICE COME OR WE FIND THE FUCKING MURDERER?

BUT THEN, ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS COMES AFTER THEM AND I THOUGHT OH SHIT, FINALLY, FINALLY SOME LOGIC IS GOING TO ENTER THE PICTURE! BUT NO, HE JUST OFFERS THE PROFESSOR A BRIBE TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT TO THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE MURDERER AND THE CORPSES BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME PROJECT THEY WERE WORKING ON AND IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH IT.



HOWEVER, THEN THE AUTHORITIES COME AND THE PROFESSOR IS ALL LIKE… “tomorrow nishi, we becomes liars.”

BUT THEN AFTER A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH HER POLICE CHIEF UNCLE WHO JUST STRAIGHT UP SAID “yeah fuck no I can’t cover up two murders for a week what the fuck are you on about” SO THEY JUST END UP TELLING THEM EVERYTHING AND THAT WAS THAT.

The Professor just apologizes to main scientist guy and he just shrugs it off.

Oh well geez, I’m glad that was resolved satisfyingly.

“This is going to be a plot occurence that might change things--oh nevermind, it’s over.”

The Professor should have just abandoned Nishi on the island and that should have been the actual end of the show.

We covered a lot of ground here today, but this was in fact an anime review, believe it or not. Perfect Insider… as said at the very start of this review, I give it a 1 out of 15. However, I can probably see why MORI Hiroshi is an acclaimed writer (wow, the mysteries are so complicated and there’s stuff about computers! AWARD WINNING NOVEL!!!) but I can also see why none of his stories have ever once won the Edogawa Ranpo award. Or apparently any other award but the Mephisto Prize, for that matter.

As I said in the previous section, I would probably only genuinely recommend this series to either fans of MORI Hiroshi or those like me who like watching gruesome and horrific train wrecks unfold before their very eyes. But if the day ever comes that we receive an animated Perfect Insider 2, I'd be fully for watching S&M to get on the case yet again!

...And fail to catch the culprit, again. Because they’re fucking terrible in absolutely every single way.

101597,"When I first began this anime, it had piqued my interest from the start just by how much potential it was given by the fascinating setting. A new continent ""Magmel"" had been discovered, which was full of all kind of varieties of beasts, to dangerous plants and who knows what else could be there. But in fact, the mystic part of it would make it exciting and make you curious about exploring the island and figure out new things as you move on. Of course, also all sorts of people wanted to explore this new continent to gain fame, discover new things that could possibly make them insanely rich. Here comes the ""Angler"" whose job is to save those who are stupid enough to get into all kinds of trouble over there. They also possess a really cool power which can pretty much materialize anything. Form simple blocks to something more sophisticated like big mechanic hands, even machinery was an option. It was kind of implied the possibilities where endless. Sadly we never explored it, and it was there from the start with no genuine explanation given. 

As you might've noticed by my subtle hints, these possible ideas that could make the anime much more appealing and engaging were just dumped in the trash can and lost all its a mystic vibe in the process. Not to mention, even the character that could offer some form of entertainment. Were used once in their own respective one episode long mini-arc, given some kind of half-assed characterization that didn't do much really. Even then they were an uninteresting and a boring bunch from the start. In the end, they didn't serve any real purpose and just became a means to an end and nothing more. On the other hand, you had Inyou and Zero, who were somewhat amusing but nothing that changed the sad predicament we already were in. The story, in a nutshell, was episodic ""monster-of-the-week"" format or you could also say it was ""which dumb person to save next."" In other words, some idiot ventured into Magmell ended up endangering himself or someone else and had to call ""Anglers"" to rescue them from there. Inyou was one of them, and along with his cute companion Zero, they were up to the task. 

However, we also gave us an absurd amount of whacky and useless filler episodes. When we finally got a random villain out of nowhere, he ended up being just plain annoying and nothing special too. It was a depthless effort to try and wrap up the anime, and make the ending give some kind of sense of closure. Most likely also an implication that time wasted up to this point was worth it. But I can assure that's not the case, it ended up being a complete waste of time. The foundation for some nice story-telling was ruined quickly in a matter of three episodes. The first few episodes were somewhat in the clear but were barely hanging on to cliff toward absolute ruin. Art and animation were also average and nothing special in general either. Though, If you want something similar than watch ""7seeds"" instead, that one was at least entertaining from start to end and had a lot of varieties of characters. Even if the execution and direction for both was undoubtedly a failure. However, stay completely clear from ""Gunjou no Magmel,"" which indeed was a waste of precious hours of my time and thus you can just skip over it altogether."
1827,"Continuing my theme of older series, I picked up Moribito mainly on the basis of its complete status (26 episodes), and its promise of a kick-butt female lead. I wasn’t disappointed.

Balsa, spear wielder and bodyguard, is a wandering warrior who has vowed to atone for eight deaths in her past by saving an equivalent number of lives. On her journey, she saves Prince Chagum, and is tasked with becoming his bodyguard. His own father, the emperor, has ordered his assassination. The two begin a perilous journey to ensure the survival of the prince while they uncover Chagum’s mysterious connection to a legendary water spirit with the power to destroy the kingdom.

I don’t usually have a lot of high hopes for older series, and I was happily surprised at virtually every point as this turned out not just to be a good action show, but full of characters with depth.

The main character, Balsa—spear wielder and bodyguard—ends up taking care of sheltered Prince Chagum, whom the royals believe harbors a spirit that will cause the destruction of their country, and thus must be killed for the greater good. Other characters are good too, but a highlight is grumpy Madame Torogai, one of those crochety old wmen who can do anything (and also carries her pet rabbit on her head).

Much of the series is a mental game where Balsa and co. try to stay one step ahead of the palace guards tasked with finding and killing them (while also working on that whole water-spirit possession thing), but there’s plenty of action.

Verdict

Is there an English dub?  Yes, and it’s great! Most characters sound pretty natural, no high-and-squeaky voices here. Chagum has a more mature voice than I would expect for a young boy, but it actually works well conveying his more formal speech patterns from being raised in a palace.

How are the visuals?  Nice, and there’s a nice variety of skin tones among the characters. TBH I am kinda in love with Balsa’s elegant design (and those lips), and Madame Torogai’s crotchety-old-lady look. The show does a good job differentiating between ethnic groups in the designs, and doesn’t imply one is better than the others.

Is it worth watching? Absolutely. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this–it’s not just a straight hero’s journey with the characters pursued by a bad guy, and all the characters are given depth. It’s stated early on that although the palace is officially trying to kill Chagum, it’s because they fear not doing so will bring drought and disaster to the land, and no one enjoys the task.

You’ve got a strong–physically and emotionally–female character who is also caring and thoughtful. You have a male potential love interest who respects her wishes and doesn’t force himself; the same guy is shown as gentle and the apprentice to a woman shaman, but isn’t shown as weak. There’s a lot of respect between characters. Moribito takes what could have been a basic hero’s journey filled with fighting and cliches, and instead produced something with depth. 

(Also also also can I just mention that Balsa is 30? It was so refreshing to watch a fun cartoon that didn’t focus on a teenage protagonist.)"
146346,"My life as Inukai-san’s dog delves into the life of Karin Inukai who just picked up an abandoned dog off the side of the road, who happens to be the reincarnation of a random classmate of hers who has a crush on her. 

Now every single human being upon hearing that is thinking “Sounds like a premise for a slice of life, right?” and you would be absolutely wrong. Instead we got one of the most fetish pandered “How is this not hentai???” TV shows I have seen in a while. Some of the scenes that have gotten me on a watchlist or landed a spot to hell are included but not limited to:
- Generic pantie shot number 18 (I lost count)
- Standard boob shenanigans
- The dog’s tail used as a penis, several times (yes, this is real)
- The dog’s snout going straight up Inukai’s panties after she gets hit by a ball (I do not understand the quantum physics behind this)

img(
High quality artist’s rendering, showing a screen capture would get me nuked off the platform.
- Inukai getting extremely turned on by her dog taking a piss and recording it (this somehow happens on the same episode as the previous one)

Sounds fun? Absolutely isn't, every scene has had me make a facial expression I don't think I have ever made and had me screaming ""what the fuck is going on"" more times than I could count. Calling this show psychological torture isn't far off. It's one of the closest things to torture I can find in the whole anime sphere, I'd go as far to say this show is breaking the Geneva convention if it for some reason appeared at a battlefield. 

Characters? They’re high school stereotypes that can be described in 1 word and they’re all women, because this is porn without intercourse. It's actually quite disturbing that the author tried to give them personalities due to the characters being really sexually attracted to a dog, which is very uncomfortable. Who would have thought?

Plot? What’s that? Enough scenes with booba can replace actual writing and storytelling right? The only continuous plot point the show tries to execute on is why the main character is a dog and him figuring out how to turn back into a human. Spoiler (if you're still genuinely interested in this show's plot): !the way to become a human again is to of course kiss Inukai, which happens several times. So why come he didn’t transform back into a human? The reason why he didn’t transform was because he didn’t straight up French kiss her.! At this point I would’ve been more respectful for the show to ditch a plotline entirely.


The people who watched this based off of the synopsis and title alone got for the lack of a better word trolled to another universe. Despite knowing what I was getting into I didn't know just how degenerate this show would've been. This show can only be enjoyed when drunk out of this world, which is heavily helped by your memory of this show being wiped out of the universe due to the alcohol. This show deserves negative points, but sadly it’s not possible so I’ll result to a solid:"
20547,"There are two kinds of students who enroll at Death Weapon Meister Academy...  The Weapons, and the Meisters.  For the weapons, these are adolescents who have the ability to shapeshift their bodies into actual, living, telepathic weapons...  They don’t get to choose which weapon they become, but the possibilities are endless.  They can become classic bladed weapons like scythes and swords, modern weapons like guns and flamethrowers, or even multiple different ninja classics.  For the Meisters, these are the students who train to wield the weapons, and each Meister is tasked with finding a partner they can not only get along with, but resonate with all the way down to their souls.  That being said, Tsugumi Harudori has been faced with a unique problem...  She has not one, but two different Meisters vying for her allegiance!  An insecure introvert with the ability to become a halberd, Tsugumi has to choose between the space cadet Meme and the rich tsundere Anya Hepburn, if she can survive long enough to make up her mind.

I’ve written a ton of these reviews, and it’s become pretty common for me to stumble across some massive surprise while I’m researching the background information on whatever anime I’m writing up(and by research, I mean a quick glance at about three different websites, including wikipedia).  For Soul Eater Not, my biggest surprise was, on it’s own, fairly unexpected...  I was shocked to find out that this spin-off from Soul Eater was animated by the same production company as Soul Eater, because good Lord do they look nothing alike.  Yeah, the character designs are more or less similar, but everything else is completely different.  Not also doesn’t look like anything ELSE that the legendary Studio Bones has ever made(that I've seen), and I think the reason for both of these divergences is the fact that it had a relatively unique director.   Masakazu Hashimoto had his hands all over this production, which tells me that Bones didn’t really care too much about it, because as far as I’ve seen, Hashimoto does not have a great track record.

It’s bad enough that he has ties to Shin-Chan, which is one of the first titles you should bring up the next time some idiot argues that there’s “An anime style.”  He directed a few of the franchise’s movies, and he’s also listed as a production director for the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood movie, which...  Woof.  This is his only main directorial project for Studio Bones, and that says a lot.  I will say that the animation isn’t terrible, I’ve seen way worse looking animation than this under far less damning circumstances...  But it’s clearly trying to replicate the animation and aesthetic of the original Soul Eater, and failing miserably to do so.  I’m also willing to bet that Bones didn't want to fork over very much money to this production, likely because of the poor critical and commercial reception to the latter half of Soul Eater, and while the cost-cutting measures aren’t ALWAYS blatantly obvious, they do stick out once in a while, with faces freezing in awkward positions, characters being raised and lowered in tandem so it looks like they’re walking together, and once in a while, you’ll get some truly awful looking mouth flaps that don’t look like they’re genuinely attached to the character’s face.

Visually speaking, the overall feel is that they were trying to produce a blushy slice of life melodrama within the world of Soul Eater, and I’m not saying that idea couldn’t have possibly worked, but I don’t think the director had any idea how to marry those two concepts.  The new characters look like generic designs that were altered slightly to fit the Soul Eater aesthetic, with the exception of the villain, but more on her later.  Character movement is stiff more often than not, any character who isn’t moving in the shot is usually off-model, and while there are a few okay action scenes, most of them are pretty poorly choreographed, especially in the later scenes where Anya and Meme are supposed to be wielding Tsugumi’s halberd form together.  The producers were at least competent enough to understand budget allocation, using the bulk of their resources on scenes requiring more active animation and taking shortcuts everywhere else to compensate, and that alone saves the production from coming off as a complete disaster, but it’s still not a great looking anime, especially for a Soul Eater spin-off.

I don’t have anything especially interesting to say about the dub, but I don’t mean that in a bad way.  What I mean is that whether you love them or hate them, Funimation is just really good at dubbing anime, as long as the writers aren’t taking too many liberties with the scripts.  Not doesn’t have this problem, so it’s just what you’d expect, another really good dub.  Several actors from the first Soul Eater anime are reprising their roles here, and with the exception of Micah Solusod(who does kind of phone it in a little, but considering how little his character Soul has to do here, you can’t really blame him) everyone sounds just as good as you remember.  Particular praise goes to Laura Bailey as Maka, Chuck Huber as Doctor Stein and Cherami Leigh and Jamie Marchi as the Thompson Twins, none of whom sound like a single day has gone by since their last outing.  There are a few black characters played by white actors...  They're all from the original show, and the dubbing scene in the mid-2000s can fairly be referred to as “a different time...”  And for the three new main characters?  Lindsay Seidel, Alexis Tipton and Brynn Appril were relative newcomers at the time, but they did the best they could with the characters they had, and they’ve all gone on to make an impact in the years since.

It’s been a long time since I reviewed the original Soul Eater...  And I mean a long time, like, back when my old blog was still active...  And while I don’t think I’ve rewatched it since then, it is a show I find myself constantly remembering, which is a testament to how memorable a series it actually was.  I think I might have been too harsh on that series at the time, because while I don’t take back any of my criticisms of it...  I had serious issues with its plot, worldbuilding and generally poor writing, all of which I still think people should pay more attention to when praising it...  But I do appreciate that it had a lot of things going for it.  Soul Eater is a fun show.  It’s easily one of the most unique and original anime ever made, and it had a sort of balls-to-the-wall creative energy that never left me feeling bored.  It had its failure, but that’s because it was bold, and it was never afraid to take risks.  I kind of want to rewrite that review and bump my 6/10 up to a 7/10...  Which is weird, because as I mentioned IN that review, I already bumped it from a 5 to a 6 after watching Soul Eater Not gave me a whole new appreciation for it.

So what is Soul Eater Not?  Is it a sequel, a prequel, or a midquel to the source material?  The answer is, I don’t know, it’s kind of unclear.  I’m pretty sure it comes before the original series on the timeline, but there are certain character development elements that would suggest otherwise, unless I’m just seeing things.  The only thing I can say for certain regarding its relationship to Soul Eater is that it’s a step down.  That feels weird, right?  From a certain point of view, Soul Eater is the perfect anime to support not just one spin-off, but dozens, as the setting offers endless possibilities and the ability to explore them...  Hell, as unclear as some of the franchise's lore details are, a bunch of spin-offs would be the perfect way to figure out what the hell a Meister gets out of their weapon becoming Death’s scythe, or why nobody ever just uses real weapons instead of transforming partners.  That’s not to say Not doesn’t make an effort to expand the lore, but moments like that are few and far between, and you can kind of figure out just how much of an underachiever this series is right from the start.

Let’s see, the best way to describe this would be...  Remember the final season of Scrubs?  Right in the first episode, they introduce you to the actress the studio chose to replace JD as the main character, but they didn’t really have an identity prepared for her, so they basically just experimented with her personality by just having her react to her new environment and a bunch of one-note gimmicky new costars?  And the returning cast members did fine, but they were still just glorified cameos to try and elevate these new characters despite the likelihood that the writers were too used to the previous cast to handle introducing that many new faces at once, and the whole thing felt like a forced and unnatural attempt to capture lightning in a bottle again?  Yeah, that’s basically how Not begins.  Tsugumi even has her own JD moment, when she sees a successful student doing something for charity, and then imagines herself in his position.

I can identify Not’s three major problems right off the bat, and just for sport, I’m not going to count its failure to live up to the original as one of them.  First problem, Tsugumi is barely a character.  She’s your typical average nice girl trope, who always does the right thing unless her emotions force her to act out of character, and her only real flaws are the fact that she’s occasionally clumsy, and the fact that she’s insecure about some things.  I could not describe her personality if you paid me to, and while I’ve never been quite fond of throwing the term Mary Sue around, as I’d say about 90% of it’s online usage is incorrect,  I do think it applies to Tsugumi pretty well.  She is not a remotely interesting character, and neither are either of her friends, who are some pretty simple archetypes overall.  Meme is your average space cadet character, and Anya is your typical rich tsundere who’s fascinated by commoner things.  They’re Yui and Mugi-san from K-On, basically.  They satisfy the bare minimum requirements for a slice of life school melodrama, but in the universe of Soul Eater, they fall well below par.

For the second problem, it’s the fact that there really isn’t anything driving the story.  Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not accusing this show of not having a plot...  Tsumugi having to choose between two potential wielders IS a plot, it’s just a really weak one.  Meme and Anya both attach themselves to Tsumugi pretty quickly, after barely even making a first impression, and while I’d be willing to believe there’s enough groundwork established for either one of them to pair up with her, there is nowhere near enough of a connection for both of them to fight over her instead of conceding and looking elsewhere.  The whole idea of weapons and meisters needing to be compatible is also kind of thrown out the window, if you’re wondering why Tsumugi doesn’t just pair up with the girl she has the strongest resonance with.  Either way, Tsumugi having to choose between them may be the plot, but it’s left by the wayside for more than half the series to make room for silly shenanigans until the writers finally decide to force a conflict over it late in the series, and the pay-off is unsatisfying to say the least.

And the third problem, this show’s writing just doesn’t have a great level of competency behind it.  So a little backstory here, with most of my reviews, I don’t usually cover everything I want to.  Maybe I forgot to mention something, or I left something out because I couldn’t think of anywhere to bring it up naturally, or hell, maybe the review is too damn long at that point.  One particular regret of mine is that in my Shimonetta review, I mention some references I should’ve found funny but didn’t, but I don’t think I specified what they were.  They were a JJBA reference, where the main character quote that rapid-fire punching sound effect while kicking someone in the nuts, and the dub at one point recites Carlin’s “7 Words You Can’t Say on Television.”  My point was that both of these jokes fit the material so perfectly, that you would have to put actual work into fucking them up, but the bad writing caused them both to fall flat anyway. 

My point is, Not does something like this too.  A few times, actually, but my favorite example is the character Misery, based on Annie Wilkes from the Stephen King novel of the same name.   She ties Tsumugi up during her first night at the school, and attempts to mutilate her with a hammer to make her look like a book character.  On paper, this is fucking genius, considering how Soul Eater likes to play with and twist around historical and fictional antagonists.  In practice, however, Tsumugi is rescued, then scolded for not getting along with Misery, who goes completely unpunished after being subdued, and the incident is never brought up again.  You se what I mean when I say that a joke that has no excuse to not be funny can be fucked up by bad writing, and baffling execution?  Far be it from me to criticize professional writers, but maybe if Misery was an actual witch and Tsumugi and her partners had to actually defeat her, the joke would have stuck the landing?  I know I’m just some internet nobody, but come on.  And the entire show is like this, running on ideas where there's a clear vision, but no sense of competant execution anywhere to be found.

For the majority of the series, if it wasn’t for the Soul Eater branding and all of the otherwise pointless cameos, Not would have gone down as nothing more than another painfully generic and cliched highschool slice of life melodrama.  The characters are generic, their conflicts are generic, it even features the same old same old generic PG level fanservice that’s meant to manipulate younger male audiences while censoring itself just enough to air on TV.  There are some nice parts...  We get an extended look at the backstory of characters Liz and Patty, and that whole episode is pretty good.  Then again they also explore side characters Jackie and Kim a little more, but their dynamic reeks of queerbaiting.  The villain is cool...  No, seriously, the big bad evil witch who shows up in the final act is awesome, legitimately well designed and threatening enough to have fit right in with the main show, although she does get nerfed in the end when the animators give her the aim of a freaking stormtrooper.  So yeah, I can’t say there’s nothing good in this show, but I can’t justify having to wade through all the tedious nothingness to get there.

Soul Eater Not is available from Funimation, and the original manga is available stateside from Yen Press.

I have no idea who this anime was made for.  I have a pretty good theory about why it was made, what with the manga probably seeing some degree of success in certain circles and Bones wanting to wring a little more cash out of a popular property, but who was this made for?  I can’t imagine most Soul Eater Fans wanting to see their cool halloweeny action anime twisted into a high school melodrama, and I can’t imagine followers of girly slice of life anime were begging to see their favorite genre injected with this degree of weirdness.  I’m sure there are some people out there who wanted to see that combination, but enough to justify this show’s existence?  I don’t know, man.  The original Soul Eater was a train wreck, but at least it was an entertaining train wreck, full of creative energy and wacky ideas.  Soul Eater Not, on the other hand, is just boring.  It’s not an interesting spin-off, it’s not entertaining on it’s own merits, it’s not well written in general...  It’s just Not.

I give Soul Eater Not! a 3/10."

Yo... Mic check...
These words came to bring a smile on my face week after consecutive week introducing each time episodes that marked the high point of the airing season. Joshikousei no Mudazukai (Joshimuda) is what I would consider to be a bonafide diamond in the rough. What at first glance appears to be yet another mediocre attempt at a playfully random slice-of-life comedy is a show that proves to stand out as uniquely its own with characters and dialogue that leave a lasting impression on the viewer. 

Attempting to summarize the plot, or lack thereof here would be a disservice to this show. Certainly there is a valid argument to be made for grounding the characters, setting, and timeline in a plot that serves to bring out the best of a show. Conversely, the slice-of-life genre rejects the necessity of a strong plot by substituting in its place elaborate dialogue and skit-like scenes that accentuate all the best a show has to offer. 

With this in mind, what makes Joshimuda stand out among its same genre competition is how it manages to so effectively maintain an interesting dynamic among its characters without its shtick getting old. Where anime such as [Dumbbell](https://anilist.co/anime/107226/Dumbbell-Nan-Kilo-Moteru/), [Working!!](https://anilist.co/anime/6956/Working/), and [Hitoribocchi](https://anilist.co/anime/101386/Hitoribocchi-no-Marumaru-Seikatsu/) gradually suffer from repetitive personality traits losing their appeal, Joshimuda is able to build interest with each episode through characters and dialogue that contribute in spite of some repetition.  

I have yet to mention a single character or event from this anime, and for good reason. Joshimuda is a 12 episode blitz of insignificant high school girls coming together to share seemingly significant moments. A glance at the official summary of Joshimuda will offer little explanation as well, only going so far as to summarize the anime as: ""...the ridiculous days of three high school friends claiming (or not) the height of their youth."" Indeed I feel as though this minimal background is adequate in summarizing all that makes it so enjoyable. I assert there is no point in having expectations from a show meant to so quickly and naturally have you experience all that it has to offer. With that, I give Joshimuda a strong recommendation to anyone looking for a show to watch.

Also the OP is straight fire."
99483,"An outstanding anime with its scene twists and the way of representation and explanation was innovative because a particular scene first happens and gives an impulsive shock but is explained later on with details about the happenings that led to the scene more like end first and then description. Immersion of a character with female outfit but being still a male breaks another stereotype that dress and outfit are personal choices and the most attractive feature was how they all got along so well even though they were so different. People can live without passing judgments on each other.

 Banba and Lin Chan were really like a couple, influencing and swaying each other’s past for the good cause. Banba’s obsession with baseball was something really unusually good both in their normal lives and in the end trying to save Lin chan. The way they both say ‘Welcome back’ and ‘ I am home’ at the end was really sadly happy part, bittersweet ending. 

Enokida had the most interesting and collaborative role in the whole anime. Maintaining connection between all of them and trying to help them. His father’s way of trying to set his behaviour right was so interesting. It made me laugh so much. The tease that he makes when Lin chan was running away from Banba was the best. 


Jiro san, Misaki and Jose were an intriguing team as well. Saitou was the one who always suffered but he was always helped though Enokida used him too much lel. Misaki’s class and their script was laughable where the script was changed to the boy playing as a playboy even though all of them are in elementary school. 

Saurcchi and Nitto made a very particularly good pairing. I did not expect Nitto to be the type to betray Sarucchi but he did changed his mind when he was selling Sarucchi off. I had the feeling that he was not the bad sheep in the whole lot. Sarucchi was always saved by one guy or the other especially by Banba."

Shadows House is back in season 2 and it is a banger of a season. Picking right up from the Debut arc (remember the final arc in the show was filler), this season hits us with a bunch of new characters and relationships that will leave you wanting more after each episode. I for one, started delaying watching on release day, just so that I could binge out more episodes and learn more of the shadowy secrets that enshroud the shadows house. So, sit back, grab a cup of coffee (non-soot preferably), and let’s get into the review!

STORY
Unlike last season which covered several arcs, this season focuses on one longer arc. I am going to avoid going into too much detail, but this arc covers the backstory of other characters. This means that there are several flashbacks, some which occasionally take most of the episode. While saying that, the flashbacks happen at good intervals in the story, giving you hints as to what is happening in the larger story. In the present, following our favorite shadow/living doll pair, we learn about new quirky characters that have extremely enjoyable interactions with the main cast. While this arc does take a couple episodes to really get going, once it starts, it starts barreling towards the cliff, sometimes leaving you shocked after several stunning reveals.

CHARACTERS
The characters are where Shadows House season 2 really shines. Characters that were briefly introduced in season 1 are finally given some light, and they really take advantage that. The main addition being the star bearers that have been shrouded in mystery. Of the star bearers, Oliver in particular was a great addition to the story, as his interactions with Emilico are just adorable.
img()
Kate/Emilico and John/Shaun also get some good character development this season. Kate gets the most out of our main characters, but upon watching this season, that should make the most sense. In addition to the main cast, we also see development in the other two pairs of shadows and living dolls that debuted along with Kate and Emilico. That episode probably had the cutest relationship developments, and I encourage you to watch it so that you can see that episode! Finally, I will just briefly mention that you see some more adults, which hopefully should pique your interest further to watch this season.

ART & MUSIC
To the best of my knowledge, this season reuses a lot of the soundtracks that played in season 1. However, this is not a complaint, as I think that the season 1 OST was very fitting for the themes of the show. There are a few new tracks that take place at pivotal moments, and when they do play, they are recognizable and leave an impact. ReoNa also returns, this time doing the opening theme of ""Shall We Dance?"" which has a happier theme and absolutely slaps.
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7QV-kwLvY)
ClariS does the ending theme of ""Masquerade"". Initially, I was not a big fan of it, as I can only see ClariS as the artist who did the opening themes for OreImo and Eromanga Sensei. However, as I continued watching the show, I started enjoying it more. I also started to see the themes represented in it and started appreciating it a lot more.

For the art and animation, I do not have much to say outside of it being good, and I did not see any flaws in it. I think Shadows House is one of those shows where the art style and animation do not need to be Kyoto Animation levels. I do think that the atmosphere needs to be correct, and in that case, CloverWorks knocked it out of the park again.

Conclusion
I think all of you who read this have probably already concluded (especially if you read my review of season 1) that I love this show, and honestly, I do. It hits extremely well in all aspects, and I hope that you agree with me and watch season 2 if you haven't already. So, grab a bread roll, dust the soot off your clothes, and watch Shadows House season 2 because it’s a good one.

I mean, or not. Soot yourself.

801,"Ghost in the Shell is a show that I hold in the utmost highest regard. It is an anime series that is and was miles ahead of its time, it is a genre-defining series that has grown to be one of my favourites. This show deserves to be part of the anime we have yet to experience again, and I don't think anything could really succeed 2nd GIG's aspirations.

The original Stand Alone Complex was good in the sense that it focused on smaller little interesting stories from the universe. While I do recommend that you watch the first season, it is not necessary considering that it is contained to a certain extent. The context of the first season is mostly just small talk in 2nd GIG, however, you should watch it if you haven't.

The reason I hold the second season in such high regard is because of the overall plot focus. Taking place about two years after the first season, Section 9 faces new threats, political tension, and of course untrustworthy allies. Complex is a good word to use here because it weaves so many important elements into the story without sacrificing one thing over the other. 2nd GIG focuses a lot on the political and social aspects of the series; revealing a much darker side to the universe. There were points in which it is difficult to really label a certain person as good or bad, and it can even throw you into a loop at times. 2nd GIG plays off the ""manipulation"" of others, not just in the fact that the team consists of hacking cyborgs, but mostly because there is a genuinely intricate story.

Ghost in the Shell has a wide cast of characters, but one you'll mostly be seeing most often is Major Kusanagi who is probably one of the most badass females in the series (or in general). However it isn't just limited to her, the whole entire team of Section 9, and to some extent, the villains have their own quirks that you may like about them. Ghost in the Shell 2nd GIG explores a lot of the smaller stories but also gets the chance to show you the team's history before they ended up working where they are now.

Ghost in the Shell is something I have watched numerous times, there is always a certain satisfaction from both watching and completing the series. By the end, you'll just want more. It is definitely worth noting that the series has plenty of fun and interesting moments that retain a high re-watch value as you get can easily get invested in the plot right away. Over the years as an anime viewer, I have seen so many mediocre shows that get high praise. I have also seen a lot of other good anime set in the cyberpunk world, but nothing comes close to the fact that Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex is a show of epic proportions. It is a must-watch for fans looking for something unique, but also those wishing for anime that goes toe-to-toe with mature television."
101381,"(This review contains some spoilers)

Before I start this review, I'd like to mention the fact that I had absolutely no positive expectations of this anime. As an avid fudanshi, when I first heard about a new BL anime, I was thrilled. Then, I decided to check out some comments about the manga online. What I read had a bad omen: words like ""rape"" being thrown around, which, unfortunately, is nothing new for BL. That being said, I'd like to divide this review into three sections: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (I know the original movie title doesn't use the Oxford comma, but just bear with me, okay?).

The Good:
I believe there is actually a lot to like about this anime. For one, the art is phenomenal. The characters look great (and really hot), much better than what little I read of the manga. Not just their faces, but the bodies of the main characters are also phenomenal. This is purely fanservice - but it's something I appreciate in BL, where both the uke and seme have more muscular figure. The more erotic moments of the show were a welcome sight, along with the many passionate kisses they shared. 
Exhibit A:
img400() Speaking of kisses, their relationship actually develops far quicker than every other BL anime I've seen, which is a very welcome change of pace, in my opinion. Many of these anime (Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, Junjou Romantica, Love Stage!!, etc) spend a lot of time beating around the bush with stuff like ""do I really like him?"", but in this, by episode 6, we already have a confession. There were signs of it in episode 2, even, when Junta starts ignoring Takato (the reason behind it is pretty stupid, but I'll talk about that in a minute), and Takato is practically begging Junta to keep touching him, saying things like ""it can only be you"", etc. This is where they do some play with honey...or something...but honestly, it was pretty hot. Their relationship is very sexual, which is definitely a double edge sword: it's good for fanservice, but in terms of character development, not so much. Aside from their relationship, the anime is actually pretty funny, I feel. Takato has this very high opinion of himself, as shown here:
img()
which I think is very funny. He puts himself over others in this asshole-ish kind of way, while at the same time respecting others' talent (such as Junta). Junta is also a very funny character - his obsession with Takato usually fuels this. Junta's sort of ""yandere"" nature contributes to this as well: his obsession leads to him literally scaring Takato's other suitors off. 
img() 
img()
Junta's expressions like this make the anime much more light hearted.The funniest example of this is with Ayagi, the guy who wants to ""make Takato his woman."" Junta gives Ayagi a toy that repeats some very incriminating words Ayagi spoke, leading to Ayagi backing off from Takato and some nice humor. However, this show is not all good.

The Bad:
There is a lot to dislike about this anime. The first episode, which I will talk more about in ""The Ugly,"" is just objectively bad writing. Junta gets into a relationship with blackmail, which, right off the bat, is messed up and not okay. But even then, I'm willing to let that go, because remember, I have low expectations for stuff like this. One example of blackmail done ""right"" (it's never ""right"", but in a more acceptable way) is the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi movie: Yokozawa is blackmailed by one of his higher-ups with photos (much like in this anime), but the difference in that movie was that his boss (Kirishima) just wanted to go out to eat dinner with him, go on dates, etc. However, in this, Junta feels the need to have sex right off the bat and, just for added shock value, sexually assault him to achieve this. This is where the anime fundamentally falls flat: it's all about the sex. Sure, it's hot, but can we get more character development? This anime was based off a manga that is a majority just them having sex. Adapting that into an anime will be difficult, mainly because you can't show porn on television. Thus, they have to water it down and resort to blueballing the audience constantly. The best example of this is the episode where Junta takes Takato to a film set to see him dressed up in a high school uniform. He's there to have sex with him, and that is literally it. You see some very passionate (and great) kisses, as shown in the first pic of this review, but you just get a few panning shots of Takato taking it in the behind, but with no actual action showing, and it's kind of...unfulfilling. Because the manga is mostly smut, however, that means that the drama is very lacking and predictable. Remember the conflict in episode 2 I talked about? The reason Junta was annoying Takato was because of a COLD. He had a cold, and didn't wanna pass it to him. I know we're just starting the anime here, but come on. First, we have the trademark ""romance anime love triangle,"" but in this case, it only lasts for two episodes, which is good I guess because that can get annoying. But the resolution was very formulaic - guy sets his sights, attempts something heinous, but nothing actually happens or Junta saves him. Even the paparazzi ""arc"" (it was like, 3 episodes) is predictable, obviously  it won't resolve to anything, but they make it seem like such a huge deal. It would be much better if that arc ended with some more dramatic consequences, rather than everything just going back to how it was before. I'd like it more if they had a situation more like Gravitation: !Yuki Eiri actually tells the media he's in a relationship with another man, rather than trying to hide it.!
The character writing is also kind of lazy, all of the ""love rivals"" (if you can even call them that, they don't show up for very long) have very basic backstories and are only there because they wanna get down with Takato. And once they are ""defeated"" by Junta, they essentially become irrelevant. Junta is also written as kind of a ""jack of all trades"" that can do anything when Takato is involved. I would have liked to see some kind of weakness from Junta, and being horny all the time doesn't count. Junta's horniness is funny, but it gets kinda old. Junta's image as this very suave guy is never broken, and I would have liked it if it were, and maybe he could rely on Takato sometimes. Takato was always the ""damsel in distress"" of this anime, which is kind of lame, because he has pretty strong resolve himself. He is the most well written character in the show, however. One thing I will give the anime credit for is the flashback episodes where Takato remembers how he met Junta in the past. My question is - why didn't they put that at the beginning?! When Junta first meets Takato, it seems like they hardly know each other, and their relationship seems very forced from the beginning. Takato's reflection on their meeting actually gives some context to Junta's feelings, as well as Takato's. The worst part about this anime, however, is the atrocity that is the first episode. This anime misses something very important when it comes to relationships: consent. 

The Ugly:
img400()
Everyone's reaction upon seeing the first episode.
The reason many people dropped this anime was because of what happened at the beginning. Junta sexually assaults Takato (no beating around the bush here - that is what happened), chases him into a  room, and forces a kiss on him. After this, Takato HIDES (yes you heard me, he hides in a room) slightly traumatized by what just happened to him. The real question is: why. Why was it written like this? I guess we're lucky it was only a kiss: in the manga, Junta actually rapes Takato. No ambiguity there either (like there is sometimes in yaoi) - Takato literally yells out ""you're raping a man?"" while yelling and crying. This is not just a problem with Dakaretai, rather, BL as a whole. Lack of consent gives rise to these ridiculous stories about some guy being raped, then falling in love. This is very fucked up, no two bones about it. Luckily, recent BL has shifted away from this, but it still lingers (as you can see in this anime, this manga is fairly recent). My opinion on this is clear: it's horrible. I know Junta's whole character is he's insanely horny, but rape right at the start is NOT the way to introduce that. It doesn't even make sense either - at the end of the first episode, Junta holds Takato's hand very romantically and says ""please let me have sex with you,"" which is actually asking for consent. This is how it should have been in the first place! It should be noted that Takato wasn't exactly in a position to refuse, because of the blackmail, but momentarily disregarding that, it would have been much better if the anime started like that. Although Takato gives consent later in the anime, it would have left a much better taste in my mouth if it started out like that. 

Conclusion:
If you want a (for the most part) fun, hot, and mindlessly entertaining BL anime, this is the way to go. One thing I've learned throughout my time watching anime is that my standards for anime are not particularly high, and especially not for BL. That means I'll take what I can get, and this is what I was given."

Oh boy, what a return this was! If you are here from reading my review of season 1, welcome back! I did not see s2 happening to be honest. Season 1 finished in 2016 and met with an underwhelming reception (for the large part). Coupled with the health issues that the mangaka faced just after, I had no hopes of a future season materialising. And then I get the news that we would be getting s2 in 2021. I was quite glad, truth be told, as I had always liked the series, despite its underwhelming animation and art. But that’s enough of me fanboying (for now). Let’s get to the review!

S2 picks off where S1 finishes. Returning fans are given a recap on what happened in the last episode of S1 to ease us into the action. Our lead cast, is trying to grow in the organisation, Border, through combat drills and squad fights. Aka, a tournament arc! Now initiates to tournament arcs would know that this serves as the arcs where characters grow, both mentally and physically, in order to be prepared for greater challenges

img()

The focus of this season, is therefore, more on the power system used and how to efficiently use it. Our trio must identify their own style of using this power (trion), in the context of a squad. Even the strongest opponent can be taken down by the weakest trion user, when the right tactics and conditions are laid. The series makes it a point to remind us of that. It is this incorporation of knowledge and data into battles, which adds a layer of depth to the fights. 

img()

It is also in this arc that the role of operators, aka individuals who handles the operations of a squad, comes to the fore. Though they have been present since S1, it is here that we really come to appreciate the influence they have over the success of a squad. Involved in aspects like logistics, strategy, supply, tactics and more, they are indispensable for the fortunes of a squad. The cast is solid as always, with character development getting richer and richer (if you are reading from my S1 review, you will understand what I mean).

But I think I would be doing a disservice if I didn’t talk about the visual upgrade that the series received. Switching to a seasonal schedule did wonders for the series. Having a lot more polish and finish, compared to S1, the series is a treat for the eyes. Lot of the colour contrast is vivid and lot of the animation is a joy to watch. It finally got the eye candy it deserved! The OST is the same from S1, which is more noticeable this time around, given the more hype nature of a ‘tournament’ arc

To summarize, a solid return to form, with a batch of new paint to reward the people who stuck with series. People who liked S1 for its positives will enjoy more of the same in S2. Onto the final review!

110547,"As a history major at university who studied the Renaissance for a year, I explored the careers of artists and the works that came from the period. This included female artists who faced many barriers, as seen in Arte, which I liked the historical accuracy. I can imagine someone who has never studied this period or even explored women's lives during the Renaissance. This anime would be mediocre and bad, but to me, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Having written many essays on artists and artwork, including the representation of women in pieces painted by famous artists from the period, including that of one of the most successful female artists Artemisia Gentileschi which makes me wonder if the main character Arte was actually named after as Artemisia was also from a noble family whose father was an artist himself. 

I found the inclusion of storylines following other women very intriguing as it held historical accuracy again; the widow who was begging her in-laws for the dowery that her father had given them was extremely important to include as it not only shows the barriers women faced during this period but opens a discussion about why women were especially widows treated so poorly by society. I also enjoyed the storyline when Arte went to Venice to tutor the little girl and was commissioned portraits. It allowed other women to encourage a young girl to follow her dreams even if the societal restrictions were telling her otherwise. Women were often married off by their fathers for political gain, especially for noble girls. 

I loved the character development of Arte throughout this anime and the way her character proved males wrong through actions and her determination to fit in and be accepted. She wasn’t afraid to challenge the males who tried to put her down and belittle her for being a woman. She would show up at workshops and demand to be given a chance which not only shows determination but allowed her to truly break a stigma that women were only suitable as wives or nuns. This anime truly discussed historically accurate discriminations that females faced in this era, and I praise the mangaka for that! 

As an individual fascinated by Renaissance artwork, this anime was delightful; I wish it followed her journey further, but I understand it is likely never going to happen. I think more people should give this a watch and look at it from a different perspective. Noblewomen were used as political objects, and lower-class women were forced to work alongside their husbands. Even the clothing a woman was allowed to wear was restricted by class. I found the hints to famous Renaissance artists interesting as well, and the portrayal of famous works was just wonderful! I also loved how in portraits of women, the pose was historically accurate for the period as well – noblewomen were painted in the three-quarter pose, which meant that their gaze was not to face the viewer – unless the portrait was for a political display, would they often gaze towards the viewer. 

Overall, I liked the anime and its historical nature, showcasing the life of an aspiring artist who faced discrimination everywhere she went just for being a girl – has much changed? It’s an argument historian still explore today. It is rather inspiring to see a woman follow a career she is passionate about; her determination should be noticed and be an inspiration to females in today’s climate. Do not give up on your dreams!"

The Gokudols, man oh man where do I start with that gem. I think this one of those animes you have to approach at a slower pace. This isn’t an anime (personally) I would recommend to watch and binge; it’s a “one or two episodes before or in bed” kind of show.

Back street girls - gokudols, despite common misconceptions, is NOT an idol show, it just takes place in the idol scene. This isn’t about music, lyrics, or even show with “normal” idol performances. It’s more about the story behind the scene of these idols, more specifically: how unlike idols they are... because they are men. Yakuza in fact.
The premise is hilarious, maybe even ridiculous: 3 yakuza men made a mistake and their boss gave them an ultimatum: Die or go to Thailand, get a sex change, and become idols to make money for their clan. 
Now hear me out, it sounds preposterous but the show is actually comedy gold.

I think one of the main hesitations I’ve heard about this show is about the “trans” themes and how it could take a very “bad” direction but frankly, this show does a great job at keeping politics out of their story and the way the entirety of this show is portrayed throughout is very neutral, and non offensive. Even better, they take these themes and elevate them to a standard of comedy that I find is very much lacking in a lot of recent comedy animes coming out. 

Now they obviously had a sex change but their “manly yakuza” personalities are still very much present. And so the show is essentially comically portraying the duality these now idols face; On one end the typical aggressive yakuza they are, the other very graceful and talented young idol girls they are forced to be.
The show does a fantastic way of depicting the inner thoughts of the now 3 ex-yakuza members, as they have to go through what idols do. On top of that, their boss has extremely unrealistic expectations of them that he demands to be met.

I think one of the greatest checkbox this show ticks is how well they portray the psychology of these 3 characters. Even though they are yakuza, they are constantly subjected to the “brain washing” of their boss to be “girly” and idol like. They are essentially abused and exploited by their boss and forced to live a life they hate. Slowly being programmed to be these textbook perfect idols. Maybe this is a stretch from me, but this could also be interpreted to be a satire of the work and expectations idols are subjected to on a daily basis, although that’s just my own subjective input.

And so as the anime progresses you see them slowly become more aware of certain things they never thought about; Things like being uncomfortable because they’re being stared at by all the men. And while this can be attributed to the fact that they, themselves are males; The themes in this show serve to almost be a satire of certain gender stereotypes in a very comical and light hearted way.

I think another reason I really enjoyed this show is because these character are much older than the normal demographics of characters you see usually in idol anime or comedy (high-school). So in a way it’s a bit of a more “mature” vibe throughout the anime which I personally thought was refreshing. 

The art style isn’t anything particularly special but I think its simplicity makes the show a lot easier to watch. There was no real animation as the show was just following their life behind the stage. In this case the animation doesn’t really add or remove anything from the anime. 
The plot itself is what really ropes you in.

Music wise, there isn’t anything special either but again this show really centres on the life of these 3 idols, so there isn’t much of the idol singing/performance you would expect. The anime for the most part portrays how unlike idols they are during their down time. Which to me is a “novel” way to tackle the idol theme; Especially when you consider all the other components the show adds. Adding a sense of freshness to the otherwise stale idol scene. (But that’s my opinion)..

I personally gave this show a 10/10 but for the sake of objective evaluation I will be giving it a 90/100.
First, the justification of a score this high simply boils down to this anime really being a new way of portraying comedy. Like I’ve already talked about, this show essentially takes two really big anime tags (idols and comedy) and approaches it from such a unique angle that no other anime has done, or done as successfully. 

Secondly, the rewatch value of this show is pretty high. Give it a few months after the first watch and I think the show is as funny and entertaining the second time. 
I think the fact that this show is on Netflix really elevates it further. I just turn on my tv in bed and watch an episode till I’m tired and.. yea; Just Netflix and chill.

Finally, the reason why this show is not a 100/100 has to do with the quality of the animation. And while I know I’ve said it’s not important to the show, it’s still a component that needs to be used for evaluation. That’s not to say that the quality of the show is poor. You just can’t really compare it to shows like demon slayer or violet evergarden in terms of the quality of animation. And that’s fine.

I don’t want to say more than that, just want to give people the right nudge towards giving this anime chance. I hope this anime gets the attention it deserves

Thanks for reading and happy watching!"

1. Spoilers ahead.
2. Watch this show, or at least give it a chance.
3. There is a spoiler in the TLDR; at the end about a character's death in ""Bleach"" so do skip that if you haven't finished it. If you do not give a fuck, by all means, go ahead.


Sports anime has always been one of my favourite genres. I love sports, practice them, and am always interested in learning more about the ones I don't play. Gymnastics isn't particularly compelling to me, but after watching The Gymnastics Samurai from the 2020 fall season, and after a really impressive trailer, I was very excited to watch ""Backflip"". It was a very pleasant experience to watch this show. I still have not recovered from the trash that was Skate-leading Stars, but ""Backflip"" made me remember once again why I love shows like this. The concept of a character finding something (hobby, sport) that finally makes them want to live, or be better, is not new by any means but I am a sucker for it. It is one of the most used tropes in pretty much all the shows in the sports category. Using an overused trope is not bad, so long as the execution is done well. This show exceeded any expectations I had in regards to the way the scenes were animated and even gave me chills on multiple occasions.

Before continuing further, I will first talk about things I actually enjoyed, and leave whichever things I disliked at the end. One of the best things about this show is the music. I like the tracks used for the performance of the main and rival teams, the opening is gorgeous, and the ending song is beautiful. Even if you do not watch this show, I believe just the music alone is worth listening to. The animation is also very serviceable so there is little to complain about. There are beautiful cuts, and the movements of the characters, in general, look very nice. There are things and characters moving in the background sometimes too, which helps the show so that it doesn't look stiff unlike [this piece of shit right here ](https://anilist.co/anime/114840/Koikimo/)(not even a sports anime but yeah I hated this crap). For all of the performances, the studio does use CGI models. They honestly don't look too bad. The camera angles and lightning helps so that you don't care much about it (if you do not like CGI, you may want to skip this show but honestly, I think you should watch it regardless). That performance in episode 6 gave me chills.

Moving on to less good things, I definitely feel that this series needed at least 24 episodes. Many times episodes were spent on what felt like ""filler"". I've not read or checked out the source, but episodes centered around characters shopping, being potentially hunted by a ghost, and characters trying to avoid thinking about how much they want to go back to practice, felt like wasted time. Don't get me wrong, I like seeing all of the main cast interact, and can feel their team spirit, however, you only have 12 episodes to advance this plot. Some of that time could have been spent showing us more about the rival team, and/or even introducing other potential rivals, besides just showing us the aftermath of their performances. While Skate-leading Stars introduced way too many rival teams whilst making me not care about any, Backflip attempted to just focus on one. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but besides the teams having the usual friendly banter, I cannot see them as actual rivals. All the rival team's performances left no impact on me whatsoever, and it was very hard to take them seriously. I only know they are good because :

1) They are the only rivals with actual names and who interact with our main cast.
2) The people in the crowd clap and cheer.

You can have a whole stadium clap or whisper about how x is good, and y is amazing, but if I don't see it, it won't matter. Most of the rival characters are just the usual standard tropes, just like the main team. Are they all likeable characters? yes. Will you remember their names in the long run? not likely. In the 12 episodes we were given, we only learned about the coach, how the seniors met him and funded the team, and about Misato's incident from Junior high. We don't need a sad backstory for everyone (Diamond no ace is very good at making you like characters while knowing nothing about their background), but I certainly want more than just walking quirks. 

Out of the characters whose backstory we get, only the Coach's one gets a good resolution and is worked fully. He used to be a great athlete, and could have even made history, but got injured and never was able to perform again. His arc begins in episode 7, and finally reaches a resolution in episode 12, as his students thank him for everything he has done for them, and then he himself  says they all made him soar again. In contrast to the Coach's arc, Misato's conflict feels rushed. We got glimpses of an accident in episode 8, then in episode 9, a problem that could have made me care about the character, just becomes what feels like pointless drama. Misato couldn't perform a lifting move, as he was scared of potentially injuring someone, just like in junior high. He was struggling at the beginning of episode 9, and then in the same day in anime time, can get it together and perform the lift? unlikely. The ending scene of that episode was directed very well, but there is no emotional value to it since the show didn't even let me properly worry about Misato having a hard time. His change in character happened way too quickly too. He went from a quiet character who doesn't like conflict, to a character that now has comebacks and can work as the straight man in a joke, in just one episode. 

In regards to our protagonist, Futaba's character arc starts at almost the ending stage of the series. It centers around him struggling with a sprain, and how said sprain can make him not able to perform. Here is the thing.  In almost every sports anime, when a character is injured, sometimes the team just gives in and lets them continue playing, no matter the risk. This show sadly does the same. You would think that having a character like the Coach, who hid his injury and then made it worse to the point that he couldn't return to performing, would be enough for him to at least oppose to putting Futaba in, but alas it didn't happen. Yes, the team could have gotten a point deduction for not performing with 6 members, but their points would have been worse if Futaba had messed up because of the injury. This scenario of knowing that someone may not be able to ever again do what they enjoyed, just for a single fleeting moment of victory, just rubbed me the wrong way. It is nice that it worked out in the end, but it could have gone terribly. I disliked this plot development, but it does make sense for Futaba's character to insist on performing, since in a way he wants to perform with his current team, aka the ones who inspired him to try out gymnastics in the first place.

TLDR;  ""Backflip"" was a good show, and it had many beautiful cuts that I am glad I witnessed. I am interested in checking the source, but I feel like whenever I do that, I'll have already forgotten every character's name. The show was able to show Futaba finding a sport that actually makes him thrive, along with his progression on it, and it never really managed to piss me off (this is always important for me). Albeit slow at times, and that terrible comedy that we got in episode 10, I still enjoyed this show a lot and would definitely check out a season 2. I am glad we only got as far as the regionals cuz I feel like for an inter-high, we need way more characters. I also would like to congratulate Backflip for having Ichimaru Gin's reincarnation:



Watch Bakuten for a good and slow sports anime with banger music. One of my favourites of the season for sure."
122808,"This is one of those shows that is tough for me to really give a fair score and review to I think. Because man does this show have some flaws. But in the end I just really loved the entire season, and I can’t find it in myself to give it a worse score.

Stuff like the lore of the story and larger Princess Connect world. Obviously plays some incredibly large parts in story, and almost seems like required knowledge to know what is happening. Cause without it I have so many questions, I don’t even know what this world is that they are in. It is a story that is dealing with time loops and overpowered characters fighting in alternative spaces, and characters using what looks like VR computer terminals and such. But I don’t know if this is some form of VR world, or if it is a world where magic has just advanced so far that it mimics something like computers at times.

But I just don’t care all that much, I just kinda gloss over the fact that the larger world has no context in the story and makes very little sense. All I want to see is these very enjoyable characters that I really like fighting together and growing together as they overcome the various challenges. And eventually come together fully along with the friends they made along the way to defeat the Big Bad Evil Guy at the end of the story. It is just very enjoyable and I love it. And honestly, I like it more than the first season by a far amount, it is a more enjoyable season I think.

Though I do feel like the final episode might have been a tad rushed compared to the rest of the show. They did an extra poor job at explaining various events that finished the episode off on. And just kinda ignore it and don’t give any real detail about what just happened at all.

Visually this season stands way above the competition this season I feel. You have some very fluid and visually popping action scenes and battles, everything looks amazing and just keeps your attention the entire time. You just want the battle to continue to continue seeing more of it. While outside of battles you do occasionally have some less great moments, moments of some bad cgi or low quality animation that stand out. For the large majority of the show it just looks great. Honestly it just helps reinforce what I’ve always wanted, to see these animation studios that do the amazing cutscenes and trailers for gacha games have the ability to go all out and make some full length anime.

So yea, I fully recommend watching this show. Probably more so if you are previously invested in the Princess Connect world. You would probably get much more enjoyment and love the story even more. But even for me, I just like it way too much not to recommend."
666,"“An oil tanker for you”
-DIO

How nice of DIO to give Jotaro an oil tanker. It really shocked me on how relatable and sympathetic DIO was as an antagonist. I was really happy DIO showed how sharing is caring. This is such a nice and family friendly series that all families need to watch this on Saturday nights, you will learn a valuable and great lesson for this.

Story
OIL TANKER/10

Jotaro and company are on a quest to go to Cairo, Egypt were DIO is located. As you can see, Jotaro cannot handle his long-distance relationship towards DIO. So in an effort to show his true love, he goes to Egypt to seek out his true love. But DIO knows about Jotaro’s plan, so he decided to test them by sending about 20 of his minions to test Jotaro towards his love towards DIO and thus the story begins.

Characters 
DIO/10

DIO is probably the greatest villain in anime history as I related to him so much, and he is not a Mary Sue, he is really on the level of Griffith and John Liebert in my honest opinion, MAYBE EVEN HIGHER. Jotaro is a very unique new brand of Tsundere, as he doesn’t accept the oil tanker and wasted all off DIO’S hardwork and pain on lifting that very heavy and expensive oil tanker; But that in my opinion, shows that Jotaro is a well-written and flawed protagonist, on the level of Guts and Miyamoto Musashi. But Jotaro just straight-up rejected it, which really almost made me cry. For the other characters being Kakyoin, Avdol, Joseph and Iggy they were very great in regards to their development, but I felt like they were interfering with the love between Jotaro and DIO.

Art
BROMANCE/10

For the art it was very good. It was really ahead of it time. You may say that the art was very bad, dark and ugly. But I disagree because it really fits well with the love-story between Jotaro and DIO. 

Sound
NONOONONONONONONONONOONONONONONONONO/10

With the sound I have zero complaints. I really felt DIOS love and compassion towards Jotaro when he gave that oil tanker out of the kindness of his pure, vampiric heart. I also feel the struggle as Jotaro said NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO as he was rejecting DIOS love and compassion towards him, but alas he’s a Tsundere remember? As for the background music I still have zero complaints, why? Because there is barely any backgroung music to begin with. To other people you may think that’s bad and ugly. But for me it really made me focus towards more on the story and beautiful art because there are no distractions.

Overall
10/10

A well-written story with laughs, sadness and something to learn in the end. There is also a dash of psychological, horror, thriller and a great coming of age story showing that love has no boundaries whatsoever. Please watch it, if you haven’t you are not an anime fan, sorry."

This movie is a bit odd, and it took a while for me to click. Most anime movies connected to a larger series either opt for a completely original story (like My Hero Academia or One Piece) or choose to adapt a canon story arc of the manga that fits a movie format (like Demon Slayer). However, Blue Lock’s movie instead is more of a retelling of the story we already know, but from the perspective of Nagi Seishirou. 

Now I might have seen this coming given that the premise of the movie is about Nagi before he meets Reo, but I want to stress that the bulk of this movie takes place in the timeframe where season 1 also happened. There is a bit of exploration of the events before that, though the most important stuff (like how Reo found Nagi) is already shown in the original series and the movie expands on that for less than 15 minutes. After that, we jump right into where Jinpachi introduces the concept of Blue Lock to all participants who heeded the call. 



img70%()

Surprisingly enough, the movie clicked for me once we got into the meat of revisiting season 1’s events. Not only is the pacing fast as the movie ends where season 1 left off (with a taste for season 2), but having everything framed from Nagi’s perspective is kinda fresh. We also see matchups that have been only hinted at in season 1 as we focus on the matches of Nagi, not Isagi. But it was when Nagi and Isagi finally met that I was reminded of why I liked the first season of Blue Lock to begin with. Blue Lock’s intensity is simply infectious despite the absurdity of the setting because it goes the extra length to commit to making that absurdity work. It’s unpredictable because every player in the game desires to become the main character, there are tons of ass-pulls everywhere, and it keeps remaining fresh because the characters evolve their playstyle even mid-battle. 

I also like the theme of Blue Lock to find success through trial and error and forging an ego through sheer determination. It cherishes failure as a stepping stone to victory, and while Isagi already experienced failure from the very beginning, Nagi started on the opposite end of the spectrum. Nagi already was extremely talented and believed that there wasn’t anything he actually desired, only to find out he’s a small fish in a big sea when he met an actual challenge and learned more about the world of football. The idea of complacency because you haven’t met failure, feeling frustration once you actually fail, and turning frustration into success and overcoming your current self - I find that inspiring. 

Now, while being able to recreate the strengths of season 1 is nice and all, I did find that the movie struggles to separate itself from the series and really become a cinematic experience. Plot-wise we know already what will happen as that is spoiled, so it feels more like revisiting season 1, even with a different perspective. I do find that the material here suits the movie format in terms of pacing and length, but watching this movie felt less like a movie and more like a TV special, an add-on to the series. I can understand how this movie can disappoint fans in that regard, especially when you consider…

The production quality of this “movie” is disappointing. And with that I don’t mean it’s awful, it’s still competently put together. The drawings stay on a consistent level with only a few bad ones, and animation-wise it’s on the level of the better part of season 1. But that’s where the issue lies, it’s not movie quality. This feels like a relatively well-produced TV episode. Not only because aesthetically it looks exactly the same, but also because it shares a lot quirks with the TV anime, which means, cutting corners everywhere possible. You can tell that this movie didn’t receive a generous schedule because instead of having the time to finish the movie as intended the team opted for making small cuts in corners which don’t heavily affect the bigger picture.

Jaws don’t move when characters talk. Instead of showing the whole movement, they often opt to snap from a small motion into a still to showcase the whole motion. It’s clear which scenes are prioritized to have more movement while others do rely more on stills or rigid posing. There is a very janky usage of 3D models of the characters in some areas. But what annoys me most is that they reuse cuts from season 1. Even if they retell events from that season, for a movie I would expect that they at least reanimate these scenes and show them maybe from a different angle. I don’t want to see the same exact cuts again, that’s just a recap. It’s just generally sad to see how a lot of anime movies simply feel like maybe a bit more polished versions of their TV counterpart, and it shows even more for a production like Blue Lock which already struggled with finishing its first two cours smoothly. 

It’s also clear that this is the same production team as season 1 and season 2, so season 2 will face even more struggles with the movie sandwiched in between. [The trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9gB5OCtIT4) for sure doesn’t look promising. 


All in all, I still enjoyed this movie. But it’s clear that this movie is in a lot of ways just a shadow of the TV series, and while Nagi’s perspective was fresh to see, there is not that much material to here that we haven’t already gotten in the main series. It also fleshes out the relationship between Reo and Nagi out more. But I will say, while I enjoyed it, I am glad to not have bought a cinema ticket for this. I would have been disappointed honestly. Thanks if you have read thus far. If you have any feedback regarding my review, feel free to leave it [here](https://anilist.co/activity/789392446) :)

6324,"Omamori Himari was overall just a generic and rather terrible and forgettable show. One of hundreds of super generic harem anime that seem to exist in every season ever. We get a large cast of female characters with some quirk, and a generic uninteresting guy who never does anything. And a story that ends up feeling utterly unsatisfactory. So, let us take a look at the disappointing story first.

Throughout the 12 episodes we get a couple mini arcs leading up to the final battle. Each doesn’t really lead to anything interesting being learned or questions to be asked or answered. The only point is to get more girls to gather around the generic main male character.  Only a single episode, number 8, managed to stand out to me in any way. Probably because the character it mainly focuses on was one of the more interesting to me, and I felt they could have done more with it. But overall, this story was completely forgettable and after 12 weeks I can’t even remember the plot of the first episode without looking it up. 

Also want to mention that the ending to this story is absolutely terrible. We get two villains who both get various sudden power ups. The one female character ends up with 3 sudden power ups, 1 is fall to evil and 2 are power of friendship style. But these villains feel completely random, like their actual story and reason for trying to do any of this is explained in some unreleased episode 7.5. 

Well if you are looking to watch a large group of female characters gather around a generic dude, you found the right anime to watch. It is too bad that you won’t remember any of these female characters names by the last episode. And by the end, I don’t even remember which episode that particular group was introduced in. Or what their particular abilities are, not that they actually matter. Overall, none of these female characters actually matter. I would say that maybe 3 of them are kinda important. But the rest never do anything in battles, barely get any screen time, have close to 0 personality, and just exist to fill some random cliché. 

The male main character is your typical forgettable and useless main character you would expect. Who exists just to let you self-insert into the story and overall doesn’t really have a role to play. He has a couple moments to do something cool or important but overall, just lets the one girl do everything that needs to be done. Who despite being surrounded by women throwing themselves at him, just ignores them like he has a mental disorder.

Imagine a generic cheap 2000’s show, and you know what this looks like. They didn’t try to do anything at all to make the show look interesting or different at all. Everything is rather flat and dull, the characters don’t stand out, and they never give you a shot that really attracts attention. 

I can’t really say much about it, given I don’t remember anything that played at all. I know some played during various fight scenes, or at slow times. But it is just so background generic soundtrack sounding, that it gets completely forgotten. Definitely is not a soundtrack you would lookup and listen to in the future."
4896,"This one here is a real tragedy. 

Umineko no Naku Koro is a sound novel and the third installment of the popular When They Cry series. It was written by Ryukishi07 and published by 07th Expansion. In 2009 Studio Deen adapted this novel (ah shit, here we go again). It is one of the worst adaptations I have seen to date. It is an example of almost everything done wrong. So let's start this review. 

Let's start by talking about the source material. Umineko is the combination of two visual novels, Umineko and Umineko Chiru. The novels combined are a tremendous read. It takes 140 to 200 hours to read, depending on one's reading speed. Spanning approximately a massive 1.5 million words. The first novel takes about 60-80 hours to read. Now the anime was tasked with compressing that 60-80 hours' worth of reading material into 26 episodes. It was very devastating for a dialogue-heavy story like Umineko. So it was impossible to fit all that content within just 26 episodes. So how do you make the impossible possible? Simple, by cutting off a lot of content. Even the parts that are absolutely vital to the story. Forget the subtle details and nuanced characterization; the anime skips over entire hour-long sequences. It even goes into the story skipping the hour-long character introduction sequence the VN had. Characters are the most vital aspect of Umineko, but the anime manages to completely butcher them at every level. Due to the shortage of screen time, characters only receive surface-level characterization to the point that they feel like different people compared to those we have seen in the VN. Characters aren't even developed because of how little screen time they receive. Even the protagonist, Battler Ushiromiya, appears only as an annoying, stubborn, and childlike individual. Beatrice seems to be just a sadistic individual that tortures and kills people for sport. Also, the Visual Novel was to be finished when the anime was adapted. Due to certain revelations later in the story, the anime now contradicts the source material because they ignored the wording used in that context and assumed something that wasn't mentioned.

Now comes the story. The novel is a character-based psychological drama with supernatural and mystery elements. It's a deconstruction of the mystery genre. Honestly, they completely destroyed the story beyond redemption. As I said, they skipped over entire segments of the novel. Even details and clues that were necessary to solve the mystery itself. ""Without love, the truth cannot be seen"" is one of the series' recurring themes. But the anime fails to make you love (or at least like) any of the characters, leaving one of the series's most significant themes absent. Umineko, initially, is an over-the-top fantasy that explains itself more as the series progresses. But the anime doesn't. And even when it tries to, it's massively condensed.

The character and background designs of the original Sound Novel could definitely have been better. They used the same sprite for every character, changed the costumes, and replaced the heads. But even with that, the sprites were more expressive than their anime counterparts. Visual detail might have been one of the aspects that the anime initially did better than the VN. But now, with the updated PS3 sprites and backgrounds, the VN completely outshines the anime visually to the point it's irrelevant. Also, for some reason, the characters were drawn in a way that made them seem older than they were.

The music in the novel was masterfully crafted and was an integral part of creating the atmosphere. The music that is used in the anime is the part I have little to no complaints about. Because the anime used original soundtracks from the visual novel. They did use some anime original soundtracks, but they were less memorable than the one from the novel. But more than just having good music is required. You have to properly use them. This is where the series failed. It has poor sound direction. The OSTs needed to be appropriately utilized. This destroys some moments. As different kinds of music induce various types of emotions. A good example is that at the end of the series, the anime uses an OST called Toitsume. But the novel uses a soundtrack called Dir. Now, these two soundtracks are nothing alike. But the soundtrack in the novel perfectly matches the emotions that are supposed to be induced by the text on the screen. The one in the anime just......... doesn't. But one of the redeeming qualities of the anime was probably the OP. The anime has an unskippable and fantastic OP.

Now Umineko is broken into two parts, like how Higurashi was. The first 4 chapters, aka question arcs, create a mystery, and the last 4 chapters, aka answer arcs, solve them. But the anime never adapted the answer arcs. The first season had poor reception from fans and the general public alike. I don't see Umineko getting a complete adaptation as things stand. It's an incomplete and unsolvable mystery. 

Look, I am a massive fan of the When they cry series. Higurashi is one of my favorite anime of all time. I consider the Umineko novels to be a masterpiece. If it was good, I would be the last person to call the anime terrible. But the anime is awful and fails on almost all levels. If you wanna properly experience the series, read the sound novel. Heck, you can even read the manga or the light novel. Both of them are a lot better adaptations than the anime. You'll miss out on the visual novel's music and voice acting. However, they'll still be a much better experience compared to watching the anime.

Verdict: It's a surface-level adaptation that needs to catch up to the source material in every aspect. An abomination of an adaptation that should never have existed."
114195,"General Overview:
If we ever watched this movie together, I would've squealed in joy. On the other hand, if you ever remembered my previous review about Tonikawa, you would probably know that this is going to be one of my topmost favorite movies of the anime movies that I watched. Remember the famous quote ""Life is like a box of chocolate you never know what you're gonna get.""? now change it 2 2 something dad can relate to this show. It will transform to something like this: ""This OVA have so many plot twists, and backstories that would make the show much more understandable.""

Aside from the opening and ending, there aren't any notable music or melodies that would pique my interest. it feels like the show could have some minor improvements. Although the plot and story are suffice for me, it would make the show much more enjoyable than what I felt.

Story:
If it wasn't already obvious from the overview and music section, if you ever watched the whole series, it will make sense. The unique thing about this movie is that you're going to get a dose of such wholesome moments. that includes the protagonist making sure that everyone would be happy in the end. Such is shown when the main character devise a plan from the very beginning in order to win the girls heart. Honestly, this is another one of those shows that I can't help but smile. 

Plot:
If I wasn't being redundant enough, I would say this OVA made me go crazy due to the plot twists that was revolving around the said protagonist. It shows that Joro is one of those guys that would sacrifice himself to the point of hiding his true personality, especially with the one that are the closest to him. This anime also had it's fair share of twisted storyline with happy and sad moments. It was quite joyful in the end when the two individuals in baseball were actually jealous of their idols to the point that they would commit a mistake. 

Overall:
With that being said, there's nothing else left for me to say. I guess I could finish this review with saying this is one of those anime's that I really love so much. A protagonist caring for his friends while risking and hiding his true personality is one that needs to be commended. Aside from that, a girl as caring yet sly when it comes to her loved one is a dream for anyone even if you realize that you won't be able to get the girl of your dreams. (Not unless if your dream girl was actually in real life. If that's the case, gomen.) It's been a fun journey with this show. I'm going to miss this satirical and too-many-cameos of an anime. I might as well venture to another series that would pique my interest."
155730,"At first glance, this show seemed very sketchy. The adult ""loli"" with huge oppai made me concerned that I was about to witness some fanservice trash. I am happy to report that this is only partially the case. My Tiny Senpai tries to go down the cute and fluffy route. There is lot's of forced blushing and bashfulness from our resident loli, and lots of catgirl moments (is the mangaka a furry). On the other hand, each episode is fresh and lively, and ideas aren't really recycled which is another fear that I had coming in. I thought that their office would be the main scene the majority of the time. The comedy might not hit all of the time, but I think that it was up my alley for the most part. 

Positives: I'll elaborate on comedy here. It writes it's jokes in a way that falls into common tropes, but actually satirizes/makes fun of those tropes. This can come in the form of misunderstandings and teasing primarily but it can go other ways as well. For me personally, I enjoyed the comedy a lot and when it was paired with the plot, it really elevated my enjoyment of the series. My next main positive is the plot. Each episode has a standalone conflict or event the characters are working on and it was always fresh and positive. From design competitions to cosplay events to working at daycares to more cliches, it was honestly a lot of fun. As I said earlier, I think that it was enjoyable, was it quality or groundbreaking, no not really. But it did a job that not every romcom can pull off.

Negatives: It gets a little creepy. Right off the bat, Shiori Katase (female MC) and her character design gross me out. An adult woman in a child body with huge tits. It's a pretty disgusting kind of fanservice that is catering to some.... audience. I also think that the way she acts is off-putting. She is always doing this ""cutesy"" stuff that feels super unnatural and it goes against the grain of the episode. She doesn't act in a normal way that makes her likeable. I don't like them putting cat ears on her and having her blush super hard and play this mommy/older sister figure. Say whatever you want, DM me, argue, but I am absolutely 100% hellbent on the fact that this character is just shameless fanservice, and the series could have been much better off making her anything that isn't a loli who acts weird.

In conclusion, My Tiny Senpai can get bland sometimes, and it gets creepy as well, in particular the character of the female lead. The character designs are disturbing as well (this is more subjective). Despite that, the plot is fresh and exciting, and the comedy is pretty funny and works well enough in tandem with one another that I can recommend this rom-com for you to at least give a shot. Final score: 7/10"
14811,"The premise for GJ-Club is pretty basic. The main character Shinomiya Kyouya is forced to become a member of the GJ Club, which is this strange club that doesn't really serve much of a puprose aside from goofing off, it seems. I personally mixed on these types of clubs (I'd rather the club actually serve a purpose) but it isn't anything I'd crucify the show for. 

Kyouya is a pretty average MC, who commonly is prone to getting bitten or hit by the other girls in the club, often gets flustered, and doesn't really stand up for himself much. 
Amatsuka Mao is the club's president, and she largely reminds me of Taiga Aisaka from Toradora, with her short temper, her ""playful"" violence towards Kyouya, and of course, her size. To me, Mao is like the Great Value version of Taiga. It doesn't top the brand name, but is still good on its own. 
Sumeragi Shion is a quieter girl, who is commonly playing chess on the computer. She vibes with Kyouya really well, and provides some calm yet fun energy to the clubroom. 
Amatsuka Megumi, the younger sister of Mao, is much more polite and mature than her sis, usually the one to provide snacks and tea for the other members. I was suprised to find out she was the younger sister. 
Bernstein Kirara is a more mysterious girl who doesn't talk as much, but is incredibly strong, being the heavy lifter of the club whenever needed. She's not the center of attention much, but she's a fun character when the spotlight briefly goes her way.

In Episode 6, we are introduced to several little sisters: Kirara's sister Geraldine, who mostly speaks English but is capable of writing Japanese, Kyouya's sister Kasumi, who is quite energetic, and the youngest of the Amatsukas, Seira, who uses ventriloquism to say intimidating things to Kyouya numerous times. These characters I feel should've had a lot more screentime. It was really fun in the few occasions that they were present, and there were opportunities to feature them more, which I'll talk about later.

In Episode 7, Kannadzuki Tamaki is ""abducted"" into the club, promised all the cake she wanted if she remained with the club. While Tamaki is a pretty nice addition to the cast, she also sort of feels out of place to me, and her entry into the club was very lackluster in backstory or detail. Unlike the rest of the main cast, she just isn't as important to the story. I feel like Tamaki could be removed from the story entirely without any major shake-ups. Allow me to clarify that I do not dislike her character by any means, quite the opposite, actually. The characters are all great (Geraldine, Kasumi, and Megumi are my favorites), but the lack of depth of some of them contribute to a lower score.

The character designs in GJ Club across the board are perhaps one of my favorites of any anime. Nearly every character in the show has a pretty unique design that stands out and isn't too bland or forgettable, and they're all cute in some way. The visuals for the show itself are nothing truly out of this world, but are still pleasing to look at. My score isn't perfect for that reason. I reserve an 8/8 to the best of the best in animation.

It's pretty ironic to rate this show based on story when there really isn't much story to discuss. It does go a bit deeper than that, though. The little story we do have, which is the GJ Club's adventures, is pretty entertaining. It's a fairly basic plot, but one that most can enjoy if they wanna relax and watch something to pass the time. The final episode keeps the comedic themes going strong, while also fitting a more emotional vibe, which makes sense for a season finale.

My biggest problem with GJ Club as a whole involves the story, and is a big reason the score isn't as good as i was hoping. There are not one, but THREE instances in which the anime hints at a certain event, only for said event to be completely skipped. Two of these happen in Episode 8, where the club invite the sisters to come to the pool. They even get dressed in swimsuits for the occasion, but any indication of a pool visit is completely skipped, and instead, now all the girls are dressed in yukatas, and Mao says ""Everyone always goes to festivals after the pool."" Ha. Hahaha. Do they show a festival scene either? Nope. Both of these were fine opportunities to break the mold of always being inside the clubroom, as nearly this entire show takes place in the clubroom, with little to no scenes outside of it, to where those scenes felt weird. These were also great chances to feature more of the sisters, whom I already said deserve a lot more screentime than they got.
In Episode 10, this issue comes up a third time, as Kasumi reveals that she has started her own GJ Club at her middle school, and the two clubs challenge each other based on who could get more Halloween candy, after the sisters arrived dressed up early. I can't recall a single Halloween themed event in any anime I've watched, so this would've been a very fun episode or segment, once again a good chance to feature more of the sisters in the spotlight. Instead, the scene fades to black and we're taken to the ending credits. Not even the post-credits in either of these episodes adds anything to these implied events. I'm aware of the light novel source for GJ-bu, but I don't know if these were events that were detailed in the original source material. If so, and Doga Kobo cut those scenes from the anime adaptation, why keep the implications in, leaving a viewer hanging? 
For these reasons, I had to deduct quite a bit off what I wanted my score to be. The story we got is good for what it is, and it's not something I'd riot over, but there could've been more to go for.

I don't usually have much to say about anime soundtracks unless they're spectacularly good or spectacularly bad. In GJ Club's case, it is neither of these. The opening and ending themes are all pretty great, and the background music suffices thru the run of the series. It wasn't anything I was truly impressed by, though. Consider this a positive review on the music side. 

This was a fairly enjoyable show, and for someone less analytical, more ""I just want to watch whatever, I don't really care about the nitty gritty"", you might enjoy it even more than I did. The bait from earlier does chip off a bit of the score, alongside the fact that sometimes it did get stale having nearly the entire series take place in the clubroom, but aside from that, this was still a funny and creative show. I liked Geraldine's language barrier, it was an interesting touch you don't usually see in anime. Despite some shortcomings, this was still a very enjoyable series, and one I'd be more than down to rewatch in the future.

>I also score anime based off of rewatch value, but I won't write a whole section for that, as there's nothing much to say. Just know that my score for this is a 5/5. I would most definitely revisit GJ Club again in the future.

Should you watch GJ Club? That's your choice, obviously. I recommend it if you want something laid back and fun to watch. If you're the type that is bothered by the oversexualization of characters, I'm glad to report that there isn't any of that in this anime. I can't perfectly recall if there's any suggestive scenes, but you should be able to watch GJ Club without your mom walking in and disowning you as soon as she hears a bunch of anime girls moaning thanks to the worst possible timing. My final score? 7.9!"
80,"A lot of people who have not seen First Gundam probably perceive it as an important show that redefined mecha anime and influenced storytelling in anime as a whole, but not a show that's too terribly entertaining to watch on its own merits.  Dated.  Well, I'm here to say that even removed from the context of the massive impact it left on the anime industry, this is a phenomenal, engaging, evocative show well worth watching.

Now it's not without its flaws.  The designs of the vehicles, ships and mechs in First Gundam lack severely in cohesiveness if you ask me, with many of them feeling out of place in their own show.  The last stretch of episodes, due to several factors, rush the plot a long just a little bit and feature less polished animation.  And of course there is the infamous Doan's Island episode that was outsourced to Korean animators.  But those just feel like nitpicks when put against the pure visual and emotional power this anime channels.

In terms of narrative and thematic strength there is not a single episode I would remove from First Gundam's runtime.  There are only a couple that do not serve to directly progress the plot, but even then they are purposeful and offer further insight into the war being fought and the people fighting in it.  It is in fact the little details, small, throwaway pieces of dialogue that make a world of difference in fleshing out the universe of Gundam.

First Gundam's reputation is firmly built on it being a realistic, harrowing depiction of the evil and inhumanity that characterize war, with many of the show's staff having grown up during and after World War II.  And that is absolutely one of the show's strongest aspects.  How behind the cold exterior of every mobile suit there is a human being with hopes, dreams, aspirations and a family, and how those lives are snuffed out so quickly and so easily in the face of advanced weaponry.  But what makes the show so special for me is the brief moments of humanity in between these despairing fights.  The foot soldiers who scheme to destroy the Gundam not for glory or fame but for a promotion that will bring them back home and away from the battlefield.  The weary and dejected faces of the White Base crew at the end of an exhausting battle.  The brief moments of understanding between soldiers on opposite sides when they're not entangled in life-or-death situations.  These are what make Gundam special, and elevate it from being just a gritty war drama.

And these brief moments take center stage at the show's climax, where the concept of Newtypes is introduced.  As a form of telepathy, the characters of the series can only see it as a new tool of war brought forth by humanity's evolution in the presence of more bitter and violent warfare.  It is only in the finale that Amuro sees it as something that can help humanity, and uses his powers to guide his comrades safely out of the warzone.  Now obviously there will be more wars not too soon later in Gundam's universe, but in this brief moment it feels as if the cycle can be broken and humanity can learn to evolve past its barbarism.  And it's that little sliver of hope in the face of such abject despair that makes Gundam special, and allows it to endure to this day."
13599,"TL;DR at the bottom if you don't feel like reading the ramblings of a deranged visual novel fan! :)

I am a big fan of the Science Adventure Series and a few years ago, I played through most of the visual novels in the series including the 3rd main title, Robotics;Notes. While I enjoyed the game, I definitely felt that it was comparably quite a bit weaker than both Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head for a multitude of reasons. For this reason and with the abundance of bad and neutral reviews I saw for this adaptation, I purposely put off watching it, throwing it on my planning list. A little over 2 years later, this was now the only main series SciAdv adaptation I haven't seen so I decided to finally watch it. To my delight, against all my expectations, Robotics;Notes surprised me with an overall very enjoyable experience, enough so that I binge watched the entire second half of this show in one afternoon. While this adaptation is far from perfect, here is why Robotics;Notes doesn't deserve the flack it gets and why you should give it a watch. 

Summary
As stated above, Robotics;Notes is the 3rd entry to Nitroplus and Mages SciAdv series, and while not required, I would highly recommend first playing Chaos;Head (don’t watch the anime, it's terrible) as well as playing or watching Steins;Gate beforehand. Chaos;Head particularly is recommended as a lot of plot points make an appearance in Robotics;Notes.
Taking place approximately 10 years after Steins;Gate in 2019, Robotics;Notes follows Yashio Kaito (Kai), a member of the Central Tanegashima High School robotics club. Led by his childhood best friend Senomiya Akiho, the group works on building a life size robot, a project started by Akiho’s now famous sister years previously who was spurred on by a popular and infamous mecha anime series called Gunvarrel. As the group works to gain more club members to complete their life sized robot, while experimenting with AR tech, Kai discovers the 1st of a series of strange reports detailing a complex conspiracy involving the end of the world. 

The Story
Overall as an adaptation, aside from a few moments, Robotics;Notes tends to be very faithful to the visual novel. While this is usually a good thing, I thought the source material of this adaptation as the most “meh” of the main SciAdv titles and its problems carries over to this adaptation. This anime suffers from a very strange issue regarding its multiple plot lines. The beginning of the show, the first 6 episodes or so, move very slowly without much purpose. Unlike the other SciAdv shows, there isn't an obvious threat or danger. Because of this, Robotics;Notes for a while feel almost like a slice of life with sci-fi elements when it follows the whole club navigating issues in their robotics club. Eventually, a second plot line focusing on Kai and the strange reports begins to run alongside the first and it's a lot more in line with what I've come to expect from a SciAdv property. Plenty of crazy sci-fi stuff takes place and sudden revelations that cause big stirs for Kai and the rest of the cast. Then, it will just cut back to the club plotline and it's almost like it forgets all of the serious happenings just shown. It creates this very bizarre disconnect that makes the show feel like it's unfocused; almost like they had two ideas for a show and just crammed them together.
	With all that being said, I like both plot lines. The overall club plotline tends to be a lot more light hearted than the other SciAdv entries which I dont think is necessarily a bad thing. The happenings of the club, while a little generic from time to time tend to be plenty fun and interesting. Towards the end, the plotlines do converge to create what I thought to be a very satisfying ending. Like Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes has a very high stakes and exciting ending that kept me firmly invested. While the first 6 episodes of the show move slowly, there definitely is payoff for the time it spent. Aside from the bizarre disconnect between its plots first halves, I think the vibe of the show, which many take issue with for Robotics;Notes, is a bit overblown. It's just a bit different from the other entries in that way and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.
The thing I disliked most about this show was that it struggles from time to time to explain how the crazy stuff in this show actually happens. One of the best parts of Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate is that they pitch these crazy sci-fi concepts to you in a way that is rooted to actual science (atleast real-sounding science). I think it allows the show to become that much more immersive and believable. Robotics;Notes does this successfully most of the time, but from time to time, there are moments where crazy stuff just starts happening seemingly out of nowhere and they just don't elaborate any further. Alongside the highly detailed explanations found in the same show, it makes these moments stick out very badly and endure in my mind as primary examples of where the plot of this show really show their weakness compared to the series previous entries. When all is said and done though, where it counts, I think it tends to do a decent enough job in preserving this aspect of the SciAdv series I enjoy so much.

Characters
The characters of Robotics;Notes tend to be very solid and enjoyable with a few being somewhat forgettable, a trend which isn't exactly new for the series. With that being said, most have a little something to offer at least. Here's a brief overview of the show’s “club members” if you care.



Yashio Kaito - I think of the first three SciAdv entries, Kai is the weakest of the three protagonists but that certainly doesn't mean he is bad. Kai begins the show as a very prickly loner. His disinterest and noninvolvement in club activities is one of the reasons why I think the first part of the show is as slow as it is. Of course, through his findings with the reports and key moments in the story, he has a slightly basic but overall satisfying character arc which is always nice to see. 

Senomiya Akiho - The club leader and the character that carries most of the slow beginning. Aki is extremely passionate about robotics and although she can be a little over the top, she is a lot of fun. Additionally, when the going gets crazy in the second half, she is definitely one of the most interesting characters that had my attention.

Hidaka Subaru - A somewhat lackluster underclassmen. Being the overly serious character, he has his moments but is overall pretty forgettable in the show's second half.

Furugoori Kona - Frau is who I would consider to be the fan favorite character of this show. Most of the time, she is basically the female version of Steins;Gate’s Daru. When her involvement in key events in the second half of the show happen though, she really shines quite a bit.

Daitoku Juuna - Like Subaru, Juuna is very forgettable. Besides a 1 or 2 episode stretch in the middle, she’s just there to be cute.

Yukifune Airi - An AI girl who exists in virtual space discovered by Kai. Without elaborating much, her involvement in key moments make her out to be a surprisingly deep and interesting character. 

Side characters tend to be pretty solid for being side characters. This visual novel and the show as a result is set up to where each of the character arcs are written into the main story, unlike the other SciAdv which have character specific endings in addition to a true ending. Because of this, this adaptation is mostly a “fully complete” adaptation of the visual novel and you get just about all the character content found in the original game. So if you're one of those people like myself who like getting the absolute full experience, rest assured that this adaptation gives each of its characters their own time to shine just like in the visual novel, a luxury which isn't really found in many one off visual novel adaptations. While some characters remain somewhat shallow and underdeveloped, I consider the more important characters to be pretty well fleshed out  and perfectly capable of leading the story in a meaningful way.

Production
For this adaptation, Robotics;Notes was entrusted to Production I.G., a studio that I feel tends to have a pretty good track record. Overall, the animation quality itself tends to be pretty sharp and crisp, being noticeably more colorful than the other SciAdv shows. The visual novel is almost entirely in 3D (which was a little weird) but this interpretation of the visual novel's art style works pretty well and left me quite satisfied.
Like the other SciAdv shows, the soundtrack originates directly from the game. I think the OSTs of these games are consistently very good. While Robotics;Notes OST isn't quite as good as Steins;Gate (which is one of my all time favorites), it still has quite a few great songs that really work with the scenes they play in. Likewise, both OPs and EDs are quite catchy and work nicely to match the vibe of the show.



TL;DR - Looking at Robotics;Notes, I think the show has its issues, but all together as a whole package, remains a consistently enjoyable entry to the Science Adventure series. While the show struggles from time to time with slow pacing in its first half and questionable explanations in its second half, the show doesn't fail to hit similar highs like the entries before it where they count. As an added bonus, it does do while remaining faithful to the visual novel source material. While some characters are simplistic and somewhat underdeveloped, the characters who carry the plot in it's important moments have quite a bit to offer in making the overall themes and crazy events that take place hit that much harder. Through these, Robotics:Notes is able to mostly overcome its shortcomings and is able to succeed in being a worthy entry to this series I enjoy so much!
While it might not rise to the highs of Steins;Gate, it certainly doesn't hit the lows of the Chaos;Head adaptation. As such, despite its occasional weak points, Robotics;Notes lands right in the middle as being perfectly solid and entertaining. While it might not “wow” you, it's a show that will certainly not leave you disappointed in the slightest."
137877,"An Overview of Ganbare Doukichan

A shorter-episode anime series is nice to have from time to time. You can absolutely cover a lot of content within 5-10 minute episodes, however this series in particular leaves a lot to be desired. I originally judged the book by it's cover when it came to this series, but I gave it a shot and after watching through it, I do feel that I'm left with my initial impressions from episode 1.

To start off on a strong note, the art and animation is really well done in every episode. If you have seen some newer anime, you'll be familiar with the clean style that this series has. On top of the art delivering strong, it's choice of sound effects and original soundtrack in general were always extremely pleasant and fitting to the scenes being shown. 

Where this series quickly falls apart is in it's lack of depth within the story and it's characters. The lack of depth starts with the characters having a lack of names. Douki-chan and Douki-kun are the characters in focus for these 12 episodes, and it genuinely feels like nothing happened that entire time. At least, nothing significant. It is a feel-good anime, one that delivers in presentation but fails to deliver strong substance or a compelling narrative. Was I expecting too much from a short ecchi ONA? Possibly, but let's continue. 

The biggest section of fan-service is delivered in the first episode, and I'm glad to say this series benefits more from the wholesome moments that come after it's introduction. The problem is that while the series is fairly wholesome and enjoyable on the surface, nothing meaningful really happens to draw you closer to the plot or the characters. For the first 7-8 episodes, we see Douki-chan having a very difficult time expressing her feelings across to our other MC, Douki-kun. He is your typical oblivious office employee who doesn't show any redeeming qualities to make us care about his character. 

The majority of this series is also held back by Douki-chan's wholesome moments being interrupted by the more aggressive female workers fighting for male MC's attention, causing Douki-chan to back off and reconsider making any moves. Because the male MC doesn't have a personality from start to finish, it makes this series tough to even review due to it's lack of depth.

It would be a slight insult to call this an ecchi anime, as there is next to nothing remotely ecchi in this series. If this is what got your attention originally, then prepare to be a bit disappointed. 

Overall, the animation quality and it's sound design made it an enjoyable watch, but for 12 episodes... It felt like nothing happened. Thankfully, this entire season can be experienced in a little over an hour and maybe you'll be able to get something more out of it!

Thanks for reading!"
2164,"You could call it a modern day ghost story, a sci-fi adventure, or a conspiratorial mystery. All of these labels apply equally to Dennou Coil, and all arise from the combination of widespread change and personal loss that takes place in the show.

Dennou Coil takes place in Daikoku City, a city covered in an experimental layer of cyberspace that can be accessed through the use of augmented reality glasses. The unforeseen risks presented by this new technology soon collide with the cultural shift it creates, and childish games become linked to dangerous conspiracies.

The cast of Dennou Coil consists of a group of children who are all familiar with the use of the glasses. As is the case with a lot of technology in real life, they've already discovered many uses for them other than what was originally intended. They've built a whole culture around manipulating the cyberspace. They've made and accumulated their own urban legends, ways to litigate and settle conflicts, and even a form of currency. 

The urban legends stem from mysterious bugs in the cyberspace called ""illegals"", artificial creatures that can corrupt and delete the data kept online. The first ten episodes of the show are centered around exploring all the different possibilities presented by their incipient culture and how it interacts with different characters' personalities. The last twelve episodes reveal the characters' backgrounds and forms a plot around what brought them together and how everything they've been through relates to the origins of Daikoku City's urban legends.  

Each character has suffered some kind of personal loss, and much of the show follows them learning to move on from that loss or helping others to do the same. The show draws a parallel between moving on from loss and the transition from one culture into a new one. While the show has several adult characters whose jobs involve the use of the cyberspace, the show for the most part depicts a generational divide. In general, the adults don't see the new technology the way the children who grew up with it do. They see it as a passing fad, another distraction from reality that kids have taken up for entertainment. 

The transition isn't easy because people of older and newer generations struggle to discuss their problems in a way that both sides can understand. They come from different worlds. The children can't fully comprehend the stakes they're dealing with, which is dangerous; the adults can't fully comprehend the ways in which the children have adapted the technology not just to entertain themselves, but to deepen their relationships and broaden their horizons. As it is with the characters who can't move on from their losses, there's some resistance in the whole culture to leaving the past behind and accepting the conditions of the present. However, until everyone can, the potential for new ways of living can't be realized.

The show has tons of visual tricks to simulate the fusion of the physical and digital worlds. Virtual objects are rendered with subtle differences from the physical objects depicted around them. The creator and director of the show is a man named Mitsuo Iso, who animated key sequences in Ghost in the Shell, End of Evangelion, and FLCL. In his other work, we see characters moving in heavy, unwieldy ways, ways that really make us think about the task of controlling one's body in physical space. While Iso didn't animate all of Dennou Coil, his emphasis on bodily struggle and control makes a good point of comparison for things we see throughout the show. The camera will often pan quickly toward something but overshoot it a little and adjust. One of my favorite pieces of character animation ever (which is not by Iso) is in the second half of the show, where one character's whole body heaves repeatedly as they try to talk through their tears. These elements introduce into the show the concept of how difficult it can be for children to control themselves when a situation demands it.

Perhaps the show's biggest weakness is that it uses a lot of its own terminology. The show's dialogue contains a lot of made-up words used to describe the virtual world, and although every term is thoroughly explained, they're used so often that it becomes vital to remember what each one means to make sense of some scenes.  

Dennou Coil starts out as one of the more creative sci-fi adventures out there, with sympathetic characters and cool visuals that never fall short of their purpose. It goes on to become the kind of mystery with so many facets that it seems impossible for them all to be tied off by the end, but they are. If either of these things sound interesting to you, you should give this one a shot."
15699,"What happens when you mix the greatness of H.P. Lovecraft and the greed of corporate execs trying to make a quick buck on Moe? Total nonsensical fun, that's what!

There's not much to say about the remarkable cultural phenomenon that is Haiyore! Nyaruko-san and its sequel, other than the fact that it's otaku pandering at its most masochistic. One way to describe the show in one word is ""references,"" and oh boy, are there plenty of them in the next installment. It's important to realize, though, that the show is a satire of otaku culture and decides to put Lovecraft's mythology into it to make it seem more like it has different lore like all other shows like it. Thankfully with all of this in mind, the show isn't as terrible or pandering as many claims it to be.

Again the comedy of Haiyore is mainly carried with satire and parodies of other anime. This time in the 2nd season, it seems to be focusing a lot more on mecha anime than anything else; there's even a reference to Cast Away with the volleyball Wilson in the background during a beach episode. If you know nothing about otaku culture, all of the jokes will fly over your head, and your only way of entertainment is watching cute girls - and boys - fall for this tsundere protagonist. The commendable effort put into the voice actors should be mentioned when talking about Haiyore because they do an excellent job putting all their talent into their characters. The one that is the most honorable is Kana Asumi voicing Nyaruko, who has this tremendous vocal range of being incredible zany and mischief that shines with the character. Miyu Matsuka, who voices Cthuko, has an attractive voice that fits nicely with Cthuko's fiery passion. The rest of the cast is good but isn't worth mentioning, although it's amusing to hear Eri Kitamura voicing a boy since we hardly listen to her in those roles.

All of the characters are eccentric and over the top to fit with the plot's primary premise, which is already dumb and silly. The sad thing is that there are actual profound moments that aren't very well done when it has sloppy pacing, from going between two different kinds of tone to a show. However, when Haiyore gets into comedy, it does its job relatively well, albeit not spectacular. It goes for the hyper-real route where the humor is very spastic and eccentric with how characters speak and how the animation is coordinated with each loose frame. If you despise fast-paced comedy with a passion, this will probably rub you the wrong way.

As mentioned earlier, art and animation are rather hard to look at in places. The character designs look average at best, the movements aren't very fluid, and they are mostly stagnant. The budget they had to live with making this shows the number of things they wanted to do, and I have to give credit where credit is due.

There's not much to talk about with regards to Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W other than it's just a continuation of the 1st season with nothing different between each other. Granted, there is some minor development with Mahiro and the rest of the leads now that he has grown with them for this long, but again if you never cared or liked the 1st season, you'll more likely find some other show to have fun with. At the very least, Haiyore is harmless fun, and that at most should be given a good score for better or for worse.

97857,"Today is Valentine's Day so I decided to watch One Room. There are three girls in the show: Yui Hanasaka, Natsuki Momohara, and Moka Aoshima. The point of the show is that these girls all slowly fall in love with and go on dates with me. In this review I will describe each girl and talk about how they made me feel.



Yui Hanasaka



The first girl is Yui Hanasaka. She's a bit shy, but she's very cute and sweet and does not let her shyness keep her from chasing her dreams. 

The first time I met her was when she introduced herself after moving next door. I was very excited when I first saw her through my door's peephole. I have been alone for a long time and have not talked to many girls before, so I thought I was going to be alone on this Valentine's Day. You can imagine the surprise on my face when she showed up!

img40000()

She brought a gift, which was very thoughtful. She was clearly shy, but still managed to introduce herself well. I learned that she was a high school student who was studying hard to get accepted into a college in Tokyo. I wished her luck, and after our meeting, thought about her for the rest of the day.

img40000()

The next day, I bumped into her while I was walking home. We talked some more and it turned out the university I was attending was her top pick. I was surprised as well, and asked her what her grades were. She turned a bit embarrassed and explained that she was never able to score an A on any of the practice tests, then asked if I would help her study. After seeing this face, how could I refuse?

img40000()

Later, she went to my apartment and we studied together. The material was a bit challenging, but I was able to help her understand a lot of things and we both had a great time. We ended up studying together for hours!

img40000()

That night, the water went out in our apartments which meant the baths stopped working. She was a bit embarrassed, but asked if she could go to the public baths with me. It was very fun!

img40000()

We studied together a bunch after that. One day she decided to show her gratitude by cooking for me in my apartment. She's a great chef and I enjoyed her food a lot. I wish I could live with her every day.

img40000()

She also discovered some secrets about me that were a bit embarrassing...

img40000()

Finally, the day of the college exams arrived. I gave her a charm for good luck. I will never forget the look on her face when she took it.

img40000()

I won't spoil the results of the tests. But it turns out she had a secret reason for wanting to attend this university, and if you're me, you're in for a treat!

img40000()



Natsuki Momohara



The second girl is Natsuki Momohara. She is very cute, but she is my sister.

img40000()



Moka Aoshima



The third girl is Moka Aoshima. She is very cute and very forward. She is also a childhood friend.  We've actually known each other for years, but lost touch for a while until One Room reunited us.

img40000()

Her dream has always been to become a musician. When we were younger, we made a promise. Once she made it big as a musician, I would write a novel about her. It must have been fate that our first reunion happened while she was playing the piano and singing on the street.

img40000()

When I saw her, we sat together on a nearby bench and caught up. It turns out she hadn't had much success lately and was a bit embarrassed about it. I told her she's great and that if she kept chasing her dreams, she'd be sure to succeed!

img40000()

She thanked me by inviting me to her room.

img40000()

She had some self esteem issues, but I would always cheer her up. For that reason, she invited me to her room multiple times afterwards.

img40000()

img40000()

img40000()

img40000()

In the end, she gave up on her dream but I felt guilty so I wrote her a novel anyway.

All in all, this is a great anime and I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in my life."
20475,"Sabagebu is a comedy/parody anime, where the focus of the story is the Survival Game Club of a certain High School. The episodes follow a non linear model, which means, the episode 2 is not necessarily, a sequel  of the episode 1. Our protagonist here is the new girl who has just transferred to this school. Her name is Momoka, and at first, she looks like a normal high school girl. Unfortunately, in her first day of school, she was riding the train to get there when a man tried to molest her, but he was stopped by a strange girl who pointed at him two air soft guns. The incident was avoided, but in the next station this strange girl was arrested by the local police. Now our protagonist will finally start her new high school life without any kind of problems, right? Well, of course not. Right after the morning incident she was forced to join the school survival club. Why? Simple, the president of the club is the strange girl who saved her. But, Momoka did not want to join the club, then they drugged her, and made her sign the club form. 

With that the anime starts, every episode Momoka and the rest of the club will make you laugh. The best positive point of this anime is in the characters and in their personalities. Each member of the club is not normal, and the way they deal with the everyday problems is what makes this anime so funny. 

The most important part of the story, because they make the story interesting and worth watching. 

Sonokawa Momoka (Protagonist): The newest member of the survival game club. She is self-centered and selfish. She only thinks about herself and in her own comfort. She will probably betray your trust too. She always choose the path where she wins, even if she has to sacrifice her own friends. Well, that's our protagonist, I mean in the first episode two girls were bullying her, she just set the girls clothes on fire XP.  
If you  want another example of her way of life, in a hypothetical situation where you and her are running away together from a bear, she will kick you to delay the bear. Here, in this gif you will be able to see Momoka being Momoka. 


Ootori Miou: The president of the Survival Game Club, she is a charismatic pretty girl loved by the students. She came from a rich family, because of that she spends a lot of money in guns and accessories and other useless things. She lacks common sense and is a little air-headed. In addition, she is 18 years old, she was held back a year. Miou took a liking to Momoka, since the train incident, and after seeing Momoka shooting she forced her to join the club. Momoka likes to toy with Miou's naivety. 

Kasugano Urara: The classical tsundere character. She is very energetic and is always ready to everything. After some incidents, Urara's true side is revealed, she is a masochist. Because of that, she falls in love with Momoka and enjoys being beaten by her, or being decive by her. They make a good comedy pair. 

Goutokuji Kayo: Maybe she is the most normal character of the club. Kayo is quiet and realistic. In addition, she is a cosplay otaku, and she is in the club only because of the outfits she can try and make to use in the battlefield. 

Kyoudou Maya: The typical big boobs character. She is a caring girl who works as a model. Because of the size of her boobs the girls from the club always tease her or bully her. I don't like her so much, the other girls are more interesting. 

If you are looking for a very different comedy anime that will make you laugh very hard, then you should give this one a try. The characters are very unique, and the way they deal with each other is very funny. This anime is completely underrated in my opinion, most people don't know it, but it one of my hidden gems."
8247,"Bleach Movie 4: Jigoku-Hen or Hell Verse is as the name implies a story that takes place in Hell.

The requirement for watching this movie is finish watching/reading the last battle against Ulquorra since it takes place afterwards. However, storytelling wise it is impossible to fit this movie to the main story but an argument can be made it fitting after Aizen's defeat in the anime continuation.

The main story involves sinners that kidnapped Ichigo's sister to lure him into hell as Ichigo possesses a power that can free them. With the aid of another sinner Kokuto, Ichigo and his friends enter hell to fight Shuren and his henchmen and free Yuzu.

The main appeal of the movie is obvious:
1. Finding out more about hell since it only appeared once in the story and nothing was done with it. The only place established that didn't get explored yet.
2. Ichigo using his Full Hollow Form that Ulquorra got defeated by. The idea that an enemy can push Ichigo to use that power and put up a fight sounded intriguing
3. Ichigo using a movie exclusive form

But there are a few things that didn't translate well into the movie. Number 2 and 3 didn't live up to the hype and while hell looked impressive, it didn't give much for the viewer to care about. Hell itself did have some affects to the powers characters used and it gave some unique visuals cues. The villains as they are death use their ""immortality"" in a unique way to their advantage.
In a certain sense hell itself give interesting ways for the enemies to combat the good guys as in certain situation they were willing to lose on purpose to revive somewhere else.

One of the issue the previous Bleach movies suffered are the immense amount of characters. There are 10 Captain remaining after Aizen's betrayal and each movie just a few of them fighting and using their powers took much of the runtime. So many movies couldn't shine by their unique features considering Hitsugaya and Byakuya would just Bankai around.
In his movie the captains are not involved in the fights. However, since the main cast consist of 5 characters of which 4 went to hell, they still felt too crowded and it felt like the directors couldn't fit in a lot of badass scenes with Ichigo's hyped up forms.

The antagonists were rather bland and most of them hardly have anything that make them memorable.
Kokuto was a pretty predictable character for the viewer if you watched Bleach at all. His motives aren't very clear and how he ended up in hell but his backstory hints fleshed him out as a believable character.

All Bleach movies are well animated and the fights have great choreography. But many lack a distinct feature that make them memorable like the main story fights. Sadly this movie despite having that unique feature lacks for not using its unique feature to its advantages. The final fight was very fun to watch and engaging, but it left the viewer starving for a better done conclusion. It wasn't a bad ending however. Non of the Bleach movies end terrible.

Regarding fan service, like stated previously, non of the captains fight meaning many fan favorites aren't invovled in this movie. Also there is a missed opportunity to have some old enemies appear like Shrieker or the Espada. From the characters fans know only Ishida, Sado, Rukia, Renji and obviously Ichigo are involved. If these aren't your favorites, you may be underwhelmed despite the well animated fights and stellar soundtrack.

This movie left a lot to be desired but by no means it is bad. It is worth recommending."
2994,"For this, I will be dividing the review into episodes since the two of them are different not only but also in quality. Major spoilers of added scenes.

Starts in the Shinigami realm with a new Shinigami character asking Ryuk about his experience with humans on Earth in exchange of an apple. Then, it covers episodes 1 – 25. It ends with the same scenario of Ryuk, but the other Shinigami has left him talking alone.

It includes a few new scenes like Light and L’s first meeting (which is completely different to how it occurs in the anime, as the whole time of L moving to Light’s university and Yagami Souichiro falling ill is erased), and L’s funeral.

Some things were changed in favor of saving time, like in the scene of L, Light and Misa’s meeting at the campus, the dialogues are slightly different, and L doesn’t steal Misa’s phone. When she gets arrested and Light volunteers to be arrested too, he does so to clear up suspicions, without all the blabber about being Kira unconsciously and stuff.

Two things I liked were:
1.	The scene of L’s funeral. After the Investigation Team leaves, Light laughs hysterically over L’s grave – I personally am not sure how well this fits his character, but it’s fun to watch and I’m always grateful for some maniac Mamoru Miyano laughs.
2.	The use of the second ending as background music during Higuchi’s persecution was dope.

I don’t think this is a good summary of the first part of the series if you haven’t watched it before nor if you watched it a long time ago. It can be difficult to follow if you don’t already know what’s supposed to be going on, and it leaves out some iconic scenes like Light vs. L tennis match and the foot scene.

It starts and stays boring. Doesn’t justify being over 2 hours long with how little new content there is.

It starts with a quite entertaining introduction from L narrating the previous episodes from his perspective, as he is assisted by Watari. Pretty much the whole first part is new, including some scenes of Near, Mello and the kids at Wammy’s House. The kids’ videocall with L is really cute. Then, it covers episodes 26 – 37 with barely any changes.

Some scenes, like Yagami Sayu’s kidnapping in exchange for the Death Note, are completely removed. Matt’s existence is also erased, which I do not appreciate because he is a cool dude.

As one can expect from a recap, some crucial scenes like Light’s defeat and death are cut short, making the ending feel anticlimactic.

This is a better summary, as it’s easier to follow and understand what’s going on. It’s also much shorter, around 1 hour and 30 minutes long."
20705,"Before I start my review of Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai, let me say one thing: I love demon girls. Demon girls are the ultimate type, and not just because they’re hot as hell. Although demons usually are cold-blooded blood-thirsting devilish creatures, they might show a softer side if you put “girl” together. Demon girls are violent, cold, lustful (and an optional amount of crazy), but they still are girls, therefore they want to go on dates, receive love and live a romantic story. Of course not all girls are girlish, many demon girls are devils that will rip your face off, but that definitely ain’t a problem ‘cause the bad girls are hot too. Plus, this unpredictability is part of the fun! Will you be able to bring out the best of your demon girlfriend? Or will you end up brutally murdered and torn into pieces? I don’t consider myself kinky, but if I were to have a kink it would probably be demon girls. Actually, I think I DO have a kink. Look, my love for demon girls is so massive I wrote a short poem:

Demon girls are the best!
The horns, the wings, the tail!
I might just be obsessed!
Demon girls never fail!

You see? These bad girls not only can have a great personality, but they also have amazing physical attributes and quirks. Their body type or apparent age are totally optional, yet they’ll always have something fun like a tail or wings you can pull, or horns you can grab. And if you are too rough they can fight back with their long nails (or even claws) and fangs! Playing with demon girls sure is dangerous, however the enjoyment is unfathomable! I might have overtalked my deep love for demon girls here, but I can’t help myself! I love ‘em so much I have 15 wallpapers of demon girls that rotate on my phone… I’m not going to heaven, am I? …I can’t even pretend I’m bothered by that. Now, let’s just JUMP into it.

Story: 4/10
The writer of this deadass looked at Lucifer—fallen archangel and lord of the underworld, corrupting the mortal realm and gathering strengths so he can go all-out against Heaven—and thought to himself “but can I put my dick in it?”
It kinda follows Christian mythology, Lucifer falling from the sky and yada yada but in a modern setting. Lucifer then has to fight against some demon girls to dethrone them and become Queen Demon or whatever. Don’t expect many actual fights though, instead there’s a (Miami) beach episode, idols, videogames… Not exactly what you’d expect from an anime called “Seven Mortal Sins”.
The story is simple yet enjoyable. It kinda has an episodic structure for the first 8 episodes, and they are very fun with lots of yummy fanservice (poor Maria, she suffers so much). Each episode is different, but they aren’t really original because they rely on ecchi tropes. But hey, that’s why we're here, right? You know, acid that only burns one’s clothing, slime, little sexual harassment here and there… Pussy torture…
The story gets more straightforward (and trashy) during the last episodes, with some “epic” fights. The ending COULD be good, but they tried too hard and made some ass pulls. If they were more over the top (let’s say, like Kill la Kill), it would be more enjoyable and memorable.

Art: 4/10
The demon girls alone are 8/10 (10 if they had wings and the other things I mentioned earlier), they’re thicc, with a very nice artstyle and designs (except for Belial) and uncensored titties. Backgrounds vary from meh to horrible. Animation is not that great, but it is not too jarring to look at as there isn’t really that much to animate other than tits ‘n’ ass, and they nailed that. The fights in the first episode were pretty good, but the rest was very stiff.
Apparently the source material is just figurines, and DAMN they look GOOD. It’s the first time I hear about such thing getting an anime, it’s quite impressive. I probably shouldn’t review them here, 1-because figurines are not anime and 2-because I don’t have any, but I just want to say I would buy them if I could. I am sinning greed right now! Sin: Nanatsu no Taizai figurines are gorgeous, the colors are bright, the poses are sexy, the details are dazzling and the shading emphasizes their thickness! Ah, one more thing added to my “list of embarrassing things I want to buy once I become an adult and don’t have to ask for money to my parents.”

Sound: 4/10
The girls’ voices are hot. Okay soundtrack I guess, I was too focused on all the moaning so I barely noticed it. There are some vocal tracks that are stupid but fun to listen to. OP and ED are okay (I didn’t skip the ED once, but that has nothing to do with the music…).

Characters: 6/10
There’s no wimpy male protagonist, ‘cause there are no males! Remember when I asked whether one could put their dick in it? Well, there are no dicks, which honestly makes it better. Instead there’s lots of girl on girl action (so much it made me wish I was a lesbian girl. Actually, I had always wished that) and they are perfectly executed. There are 11 different pussies, except for 2, each pussy represents one of the seven capital sins (no, I did not get my maths wrong), yet there’s still more to it. Some of the pussies are deeper and better developed than you’d expect for an ecchi. Lucifer and Astaroth are best grils, but the all of them are good. My only complaint is that Maria could be better developed; she used to work for the church but didn’t seem too bothered hanging out with Lucifer and other demon girls.

Enjoyment: ∞/10
I have a fetish."
3731,"Itakiss is a simple, fluffy high school romance story about Kotoko Aihara a clumsy, kind of dumb high school girl that gives a love letter to her crush Naoki Irie the popular, smart boy in school. Naoki rejects her letter but Kotoko ends up living in Naoki's house after her house falls apart so they constantly run into each other.
img220()  
The other charters of this show are pretty good and decently enjoyable. first there is Naoki's family, his mother Noriko who is a great supporting charter who encourages the two main charters to get together, his little brother Yuuki who is sort of a brat and teases Kotoko most of the time and finally his dad Shegeki who is friends with Kotoko's dad. The other charters are friends to Kotoko or Naoki. I will mention them real quick, Jinko is the classic fat friend to Kotoko who is also friends with Satomi they don't really do much to help the plot but they don't slow it down ether, then there is Kinnosuke and Keita who both have a crush on the main female at diffrent times in her life.
img220()
The visuals are honstly pretty good there is plenty of animation so yes, you can say there is moving images in front of you instead of a image without movement with dialogue over it and the story's pace is also good it's not to fast or to slow, just right, for me anyway. The ending is also good it's peaceful and how an anime like this should end. The intro is fire by the way.
img220()
The charter dynamics are good through out the series. One little problem I have with the series is that when the main charters get married there dynamic dose not one hundred percent change, I mean I know there personalites won't just do a one eighty just because they are married but Naoki just is not that lovey dovey to his wife, he can still be serious just be a little more affectionate to his wife who is pretty affectionate towards him, the two other guys that I mentioned were practically head over heels for the main female. but other then that I love that the main charters got together. The sub to this anime AKA the japanese version of this anime is also good the voice acting is really good when it comes to some of the charters it really shows some talent in the cast. so would you like this anime? maybe it really depends on personal taste, but if you are willing to look past some of the problems and just indulge the humor and semi ridiculousness of the charters and story then I think you could possibly injoy this simple fluffy story."
101344,"For starters, I must state that I really did enjoy this recap movie. However, I already miss the whimsical, slightly dark tone of the previous one. Raw optimism triumphing over grave hardships is traded in for bleak terror and gruesome horror. Not too far into the runtime, Riko and Reg are faced with decisions that could cost them their lives, and they very nearly do. What follows are some of the hardest scenes I’ve ever had to watch in anime.

This is one of the most controversial aspects of Made in Abyss: the juxtaposition of cute, chibi characters in lush watercolour environments, and the horror of the Abyss and the creatures that live therein. I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I can appreciate it from a creativity perspective; the dichotomy of cutely drawn characters experiencing horrible things makes said characters even more compelling, more than if the characters were drawn realistically. It makes what they are going through feel ten times worse, which makes you want them to succeed ten times more than normal. On the other hand, some of the scenarios we are presented with are conceptually horrific. From shots that linger on the purple skin of a broken arm, to seeing the effects of sadistic experiments done on children affect their bodies in real time, this show does not pull its punches. That other part of me thinks it’s pretty disgusting, and I don’t think that will change. But I think both of those opinions are two hands on the same clock face: they almost always point in two different directions, but they always work in harmony.

Everything that I wrote in [my review for the first recap movie](https://anilist.co/review/17458) still stands for this sequel. The visuals are spectacular and beautiful, the music is everything this show requires and more, and the story is gripping and interesting. With the introduction of new characters, Nanachi and Mitty, some of the mysteries of the Abyss finally come to light, though they only raise new questions that make me excited to hear their answers. This movie is more of a slow burn compared to the first one; it focuses more on Nanachi and their backstory, as well as Reg as he tries to figure out more of his past and protect Riko in the here and now. Even though I haven’t watched the series since it first aired (and therefore, even though I can’t recall what had to be cut out), I can still recognize a couple of places where the story suggests that they were stitched together. But it never detracts from the viewing experience.

This is the furthest I’ve watched in this series. Like Riko and Reg, I’m stepping out into the gaping maw of the Abyss as I move onto the Dawn of the Deep Soul movie for the first time. I’m super excited to see what lies deeper, and what we can learn through their experiences."
2129,"True Tears. The studio: PA Works. The director: Junji Nishimura. And there's a girl that likes chickens. Sounding familiar already doesn't it? Yes, while this bears a lot of similarities to the infamously bad 2014 anime, Glasslip, it's not. No, this anime came out 6 years prior. It wasn't a scheduling mess and an embarrassment to the studio either. The animation and directing are actually quite good, and it goes to show, depending on the circumstances, the same staff and director are capable of both good shows and bad shows. While it bears some superficial qualities with Glasslip, the anime I'm discussing, True Tears, is much more like 2013-2014 anime, Nagi no Asukara (which if you look at my favorites list, is one of my top TV anime of all time). 

The commonality that True Tears and Nagi-Asu share is the script writer and series composition leader Mari Okada. Now, Okada has a mixed reputation, and in the opinions of a vocal minority that groans every time her name comes up, she is generally bad. However, I would argue against that. Mari Okada picks up a lot of work that is out of her element. Some examples of her bad work would be [Fate/stay night (2006)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GMrOxRmJXA), Canaan, or Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans. I don't think she handles the dialogue and characterization of characters that exist in the gritty, difficult settings of action anime very well. When she is in her element in the most, it's writing teenage characters that are in puberty and in love, which is in the case of Nagi-Asu, and of course, True Tears.

That being said, the way the story is written is as unpredictable as teenagers, which is a good thing. You don't really know how things are going to play out because the characters don't know how things are going to play out, since they are struggling with their emotions, and with rejection, and with sadness. It's not like Nagi-Asu's love octagon or whatever, but a much more modest... love pentagon. Which is a good thing because we are dealing with half the length. Another anime I would compare this to that I've seen is the 2013 anime White Album 2, which is a love triangle. While I love both, and they both have that gut wrenching feeling while you're watching it, I favor True Tears somewhat more because there is an engaging subplot. With a love triangle, you get those three characters consistently, and nothing else. With five characters in this one cours anime there is some brevity between plots, it doesn't take long to get going or become engaging. True Tears doesn't really have a lull in the pacing.

Thematically, it's a high school romance. It's about dealing with rejection and teenage awkwardness. However, like with most simple, tried and true concepts that aren't necessarily anything new, they have the opportunity to be done really well and held in comparison to its contemporaries or its predecessors, and it is executed really well. The way the plot moves has a lot of misdirection and things to throw you off. It plays with your expectations in the simplest ways, and it's never cheap or shoddily done. 

Artstyle and animation are nothing really special. The quality is consistent, but it also uses the medium to its advantage well enough to justify it being an anime. The director is actually good and talented in spite of the reputation of his most infamous work. If you watched Glasslip (I didn't not watch it all in its entirety just to throw that out there), you will see elements of the directing in True Tears, but some of the technique will make you go, ""ah, that sort of thing actually works well if it's done this way"".

I know I've made a lot of comparisons, but when it comes to the opening sequence that is sung by eufonius, who is responsible for the opening songs of a lot of 2000s Key works such as Clannad, it sort of shares that kind of aesthetic as an awkward 2nd cousin twice removed. The only correlation is the singer but it has that same atmosphere of dread and heartbreak, but also that feeling that compels you to keep watching to find out how the characters deal with it so that you may find an answer for yourself. The composition is absolutely beautiful, it's the factor that really bumps the anime to another level. The way the music is created and used within the context of the scenes is never over-bearing in a ""this is really dramatic and this mundane event is the center of the universe"" kind of thing, but it basks in the atmosphere of what emotions the characters are feeling and bridges that to the experience of the audience. I rate anime on ten aspects and average them all to get my overall, and this anime's music was the only thing I had for a perfect score. 

To wrap my review up, this is an excellent high school romance, one that I heavily enjoyed and couldn't put down, and it when it was over my heart sank. I've gone this whole review without even mentioning that it was PA Work's first anime, and it's one that they are very proud of as they've paid homage to it several times in their other shows. If you are a fan of PA Works or Nagi-Asu I highly encourage you to watch this. It's a lot more grounded and simple, but it's done really well.

And with that, I give True Tears a"

 img450( 



I think it's important to start by pointing out how much I'm a fan of the RWBY series and I was very hopeful about its anime adaptation, for being from a studio, which until then, I considered extremely competent.
I cannot express how disappointed I am.

The series has several production problems, as it decided to make the anime on an extremely poor schedule, and that from the beginning shows that they barely had time to correct scenes and send purely unfinished scenes, even though there are a lot of competent people in it.

All this would be easily resolved if the production decided to postpone the anime to give us quality work, however, they chose not to do that.

I believe everyone is aware that the first three episodes came out early and at the same time. They finished the first three eps simply so they could preview, and because of that many unfinished scenes in the Pre version were fixed on the TV.

img550(
img550(

I started talking about the production initially because it was extremely necessary for me to establish from the beginning that the Japanese adaptation of RWBY had problems, but later on I will approach the production again.



 The RWBY Adaptation 

The first 3 episodes of RWBY together are about an hour long and that's basically the same amount of time the original had for an entire volume.



Volume 1 of the original has 16 episodes that are around 1 hour in total.

The first 3 episodes of the anime are approximately the same in length and 'adapt', in a type of copy and paste, totally rushed, without any depth and that still cut a Jaune plot to work on aspects of the character and inserted another original plot where nor did it have time to be properly aborted.



The first volume of RWBY, like the entire series, is low production, they didn't have the budget to do everything they wanted, especially the first volume. So during the 16 episodes that complete 1 hour, there were episodes of 3, 4 and 5 minutes.

  One of the most enjoyable aspects of RWBY's production for me is its use of time. Even due to its low production with this little time that the series has to work, it doesn't waste time, it doesn't roll around, everything on screen is important, the series knows how to enjoy its time, it really works something and explores it in the way whatever is possible.



16 episodes that complete 1 hour were much more productive and deeper in terms of narrative than 3 episodes that make up the same timing and address the same subjects and characters.
(I won't even talk about charisma and other factors)

The RWBY adaptation made a simple and stupid mistake in logic. RWBY: Hyousetsu Teikoku shouldn't be an adaptation entirely faithful to its original, an animated copy and paste, it doesn't work. The anime had time to reimagine, work on, improve and deepen everything the original couldn't due to low production. There's no way you can take 1 hour of the original, a webseries/murikanime, play in the anime and think it will be acceptable. They are different media, different ways of approaching the narrative as well.

RWBY's narrative doesn't just rely on what we see on screen, RWBY has a narrative structure together with its songs. RWBY's songs address a lot of the introspective characters, they work the plot; characters, explore and deepen their relationships, their emotions, add substance and layers. RWBY compensates for its low production with this exemplary and admirable work!



And yes, even though they forgot the RWBY songs, we still had ""Mirror Mirror"" in one of the episodes, but that was more fanservice than a narrative use, to add substance to Weiss.
By the way, I'm not saying that they put ""Mirror Mirror"" there for fanservice and not for the narrative is something necessarily bad, because although I thought it was misused, I can't deny that it increased Weiss' character a little more. , after all it's ""Mirror Mirror"", it's a song that works and explores the Character. But I will emphasize that the music is not the merit of the anime but of the original, as well as its use within the work is something basic, which they only did with ""Mirror Mirror"". After all, we didn't have ""Red Like Roses II"" among other songs.

The anime should be an ORIGINAL adaptation, a reinvention of something that already exists!
And with that they see the following point: ""The anime has already done that, the anime has created an original plot.""



 Original Plot



I was really happy with the announcement of the original plot, but unfortunately it was too late to introduce it.
I don't want to get too much into this topic, but earlier I said that due to the lack of something original, depth and character work made everything empty and this original plot reflects exactly that.

As much as they try to bring us something that should be the basics, the problem is at the beginning, the anime has not worked at all since it started, it failed to make us create emotional bonds with the characters and work on their own relationships, but instead of trying to fix their mistake, they decided to work with Weiss' relationship with Ruby, her problems and her prejudice with the Fauns, things that are empty, because the story/production decided to do it that way.



The original plot should have been established from the beginning and not later. At the very least, he should try to hide and fix the flaws of the first three episodes, but all he does is highlight them.

To be honest, the idea of ​​this dream Grimm, Nightmare, is VERY interesting, it's something I would love to see in the original, I think it would have a lot to add and it would be a great way to introduce aspects of the characters, just like with Weiss, no we can't escape that Weiss' dream reflects the same; We have the psychological pressure from the family, the extremely abusive father, the alcoholic and distant Mae, her lack of freedom, we even have her affection for her friends and how much they mean to her. To see that in the original, with all that Rooster teeth narrative, with Casey bringing the introspective to life, would be an amazing thing to watch.
But that's only because the Rooster Teeth narrative of the original allows things to be that way, there was character work already, so things would be possible.
Volume 7-8, when Weiss returns to Atlas with the RWBY team, would be an ideal time for this, because that's when she finally and truly breaks free from the family shackles created by her father.

The point in RWBY: Hyousetsu Teikoku is that it lacks substance, lacks script work, everything I've already mentioned in terms of adaptation, demonstrates why this original arc was bad and as I don't want to say it was empty, I'll just say that was shallow and superfluous.

>Seeing Blake's drama about Fauns and humans, apart from Adam and his influence on her summed up like that by the anime hurt me SO MUCH, the desire was to simply close the tab and never touch the anime again out of disrespect
img(

I doubt there will be another season, and I honestly don't even want to, but if there was, maybe, who knows, this arc gains relevance and is something that really changes the course of the work, it could maybe straighten out the characters' relationships and in the next season, they learn how to work them.


 Production

img(

RWBY: Hyousetsu Teikoku is certainly one of the most broken projects in production. Their schedule and planning is abysmal to the degree that they can't quite get it right.

The point of the anime adaptation of RWBY was to bring the work that was originally done in CGI, to 2D. But what about a third-party anime episode with a bad schedule coming from an extremely limited studio? Animate everything with bad CGI.

Perspective and continuity errors;
Scenes with almost no politeness/consistency;
Broken and clumsy movement, in addition to a dysfunctional composition.

>WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BRO, LOOK AT THIS
ALL DEFECTIVE, CROOKED TRACK.

All management proved disastrous. They don't have any time and their staff is desperately looking for ANY artist who will accept to work on the production. There are so many accumulated problems that I'm not even surprised by errors like this:

webm(https://video.twimg.com/exttwvideo/1564009719710289920/pu/vid/1280x720/g5p8dzAh8TfvOSJh.mp4?tag=12)
img(

It's almost unbelievable that in the midst of a catastrophic production schedule, we have animators like Hiroto Nagata and Kazuki Kawata who bring us satisfying scenes to watch. Although sometimes the result is not so polished, we can say that both worked a miracle in producing something as good in a production as bad as RWBY.

webm(https://video.twimg.com/exttwvideo/1568991167546642438/pu/vid/854x478/CmE4vv3cTle7dnS1.mp4?tag=12)

Anyone looking at these scenes should not expect such an unhappy production, whether in terms of animation or script.

I am immensely saddened by the news that the original voice actresses will go to the trouble of dubbing this. I, out of respect for the work that is RWBY, wouldn't do it. They who gave life to these characters, created them from their beginnings, are now dubbing something that, in my view, disrespects this work. They deserve so much more.

 Conclusion


As I said initially, I'm a big fan of RWBY, it's one of my favorite works without a doubt.

>I even have a text on Medium, in Portuguese, my native language, where I explore the narrative of RWBY, all that it is, leaving out spoilers and a little bit of the approach to character arcs, something I intend to do separately in the future. There I talk about structure, mythology, symbolism, characterization, music, substance and about the essence of a story and a good story, and why RWBY fits into that.

For those interested, the link will be there for anyone who wants to use a Google Translate to be able to read.

 And having to look at an anime so problematic, flawed and with the sole purpose of being profitable, when its creator just wanted to tell us all a story, is saddening.

At that time, while I currently wait for the release of Volume 9 of the original, this anime despite the problems and headaches it gave me, was to some extent a fun fanservice.

However, I should point out that if the anime has disappointed you too or given you a false impression of RWBY, or perhaps made you interested in the work, I highly recommend consuming the original, it can be difficult to get used to the CGI initially, but currently I think it's beautiful, and the work is one of the best things I've ever consumed and easily the most 'Soul' work I've ever seen, Monty gave his soul to the project and it's a series that deserves even more prominence than it already has.

This is my reaction to this adaptation:

160,"Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku - To Live 


 SPOILER WARNING


Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku or Now and then, Here and there is an anime from 1999 always seen as one of the acclaimed 90s isekai's who heightened in popularity out of its cult status. A story about a boy who gets transported 10 billion years into the future. Often with isekai we walk into a wall due to the overabundance of it. Predictable, tiresome, and mass-produced copy-paste isekai's fly off the charts season by season and year by year. 

Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku might be up there as one of the most visually beautiful anime as well as one of the most immersive. As the masterful sound direction by Tanaka Kazuya (mushishi sound director) pulled me into its barren yet unforgiving world with a technical edge. We also have Taku Iwasaki on the team for music whom you might know for the Muv Luv soundtrack. Rurouni Kenshin trust and betrayel soundtrack, Gurren Lagann soundtrack or the Katanagatari soundtrack I'd say this is probably one of his best soundtracks I'v heard from him. A real sense of instrumental depth and he's able to express the emotions one would connect with dystopia quickly. Some of the bleeps and bloops even are reminding of Klaus Schulze to me on his Cyborg album. This anime was also stacked with incredible storyboarders and a great art director. The compositions and the shadow play in this show are absolutely incredible and are able to represent a great deal of visual clarity and immsersion. Quite the beautifull anim,


What does it want to tell us? What is the thing that Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku wants to tell us? It shows the cursed humanity throughout its other world construct. Through this viewing and this barren world basked in the red sun it wants to show us some of the tremors of the terrible things humans are capable of, not only those it use its circumstances and setting to its advantage to portray this story but it also uses its cast of children to do this. The show's main protagonist Shuuzou is a happy-go-lucky fellow who has his heart out towards the world, from the first scenes of his introduction this becomes very clear. The fond way he talks about the things around him and the area he lives in shows how much love and appreciation he has for the world he lives in. These first scenes with him establish him quite perfectly. These scenes would characterize and be the holding bar for his actions to come throughout the series, his emotionality and his ideals already show themselves quite early. This would craft his reasoning to go after Lalah Ru as well. His golden heart and honest self couldn't let something like this go. He couldn't let the living go. And this was something that held itself strong throughout the series. That individual nature in the dreadful world is the driving force to saving Lalah Ru but also the people he meets in this new world. 

That doesn't mean Shuu is clear from critique in his journeys throughout this wasteland. Nabuca would be the first to critique him for his heroism their ideas and feelings often clash due to their different upbringings and circumstances. His meetings and clashings with Shuu do change Nabuca throughout the show very visibly. You can see this through the interactions he has with Tabool and how they shift throughout the runtime of the show itself. A big turning point in Nabuca's life would be where he lets Shuu escape from the base with Lalah ru as well as when Boo gets shot. and also where he shoots the zari bar invaders, but my favourite moment from Nabuca is when they have to invade a small town for new recruits and he realizes how evil his actions are, especially when he remembers he himself to was kidnapped one day and taken away from the village. I love his big character moments. They're great. (Beautiful moments). These big clashes and moments in Nabuca's life would change him. And the climax to his character is probably one of my favorite moments in the whole series. ""Go back from where you came from, this is not where you belong.. "" is a line that stuck to me and still makes me stare at a wall with a empty feeling in my heart. Perhaps this moment and line is not just a send off from Nabuca but a reflection of his circumstances and a full realization of the world around him. He realizes the world and sees how somebody as individualistic and different as shuu should not stay here. Nabuca understands the world, himself, Shuu, before he finally passes off in a dream that could last 10 billion years. The lingering shine in his eyes disappears. 

Perhaps when talking about bitter yet hopeful a character like Sara comes to mind. Sara is quite a tragic character. From the things we get shows about her we come to understand that Sara is a mistreated human girl who is used for the creation of even more children. She is probably one of many mistreated woman on the military base who gets used for such things due to the ending world. Her emotional state is expressed exceptionally well. Not by dialogue dropping and monologging all of the emotions she has onto the viewer but rather through strikingly well portrayed body language and facial expressions. A scene of hers I really enjoy is the base escape. Where she kills the officer trying to have intercourse with her escapes the base. (escape wasn't hard due to the low amount of soldiers this makes sense.) and then when she finally gets outside she pulls off the army clothes cuts her long hair off and cries and runs. This scene was also one of my favourites.I'v always had a thing with the hair cutting symbolism and how it here symbolizes leaving her old past behind and bringing an end to that Sara. As the old part of herself dies off she may freely live as a newborn. The haircutting action has a lot of weight and even more so in the moment she finds out she is pregnant from one of the men who used her. and breaks out in tears and it makes her want to murder the child. This makes sense given that this is still a part of her old life. A life she had tried to cut away from and tried to disconnect from. Rather then just killing the child now ""soiled"" by its existance she would rather kill herself this action is intercepted by shuu who's words stop her from comitting the action. The dialogue she has with Sis is also incredible.

""I ask you not to hold it against the baby. No child comes into this world wanting to be rejected by its mother."" 

I thought the escalations of the Zari-Bars was also very well handled. The way the pressure built up in the citizens and were out to use somebody to lash their anger at would be Sis. The leader of this group who would take up the torch to fight against hamdo would do anything to get his will and way and in the same time mirror hamdo. He got more violent and obsessed for his goals and could not see what he was reaping. Through this foolish behavior, everything escalates to the point where Lalah ru has to give herself in and is taken away. ""Because of one outsider, the whole village is in danger"" the group mistrust tumbles this village all the way down. 


Lalah Ruh is a very tragic character. Lalah has the powers to control water flow as well as holds a necklace with a huge source of water. Due to the nature this she is often seen as a product for the means of others rather then a human being. I thought this was incredibly saddening yet o so reflective of the state of humans in that world. Rather then care about the girl itself they can only care about the thing they can get out of her. Its very materialistic. Lalah ru due to the way she is treated loses all hope in humanity for a big duration of her life. I assume she sees no hope for humanity to go on. I feel though that her interactions with shuu and sis are slowly but surely restoring her faith in this. Her end and the end of the show are very bittersweet. While Lalah Ru regains hope for humanity and a sense of kinship for shuu she will never be able to finalize or see to the end. As the last of her water is now gone which we learn is also interconnected to her life force. As she returns the water to the earth she never sees the world through realization which is incredibly depressing. Perhaps that is why the line ""Can we watch another sunset together someday"" hits very hard as such a day will never come again. and sadly enough her efforts won't be resourceful at the end of it all given the state of the sun. A bittersweet end to the series. Sarah accepts her child into her life, Abelia is freed from the shackles of warcrime, Hamdo's death was probably all that was left for him and Shuu returns home. 

As shuu returns the red unbloated sun looks back at him. and the 3 broken pillars are a bitter sight. 


With its expressive character designs, beautiful background art, and stunning OST and sound design and immersive storyboarding Now and then here and there is able to pull an incredibly short, compact and hard-hitting journey with very tight writing about the lives in this dystopian world and its commentary about humanity as well as war. I hope you enjoyed reading my thoughts."
20766,"This, this is something that I'll never be able to experience again. I truly don't have the words to express what Love Live means to me because it really changed many aspects of my life and helped me improving into becoming a better person.
μ's will always be a sweet memory for me and the emotions I felt were unique and by far
 >the greatest experiment I've ever seen, truly unique.

No more introductions, I have many reviews about Love Live where I show my [love ](https://anilist.co/review/9599)for this show and School IdolProject is for sure the greatest surprise in anime terms in my life; no more to say about SIP, let's just end this beautiful story.

This movie is a long lasting farewell of  μ's, a really long one, where we are able to see sides of the girls we were never able to see, and the movie itself is lovely to watch as the story goes on and continues to tell us things we never knew about this lovely group.
The New York arc is itself incredible if you watch it with Honoka's point of view : being in a place you never visited and you are just amazed of how it is, the people, the not sleeping city, the culture and the variety of everything you can find; starting from the typical american restaurant to a random japanese one where you can feel like at home even if you are not there. Indeed New York is completely different from Akibahara, but at the same time they are the same : it's always alive and every person is connected with you somehow, it could be a quick look, a quick 'hello' or things like that.
 The girls have even more time to spend with each other as they are invited to show the School Idols all over the world with the Great Final. But it's not a Final at all. We still have something to do.
Back in Tokyo.
What's the best way to spread the love you feel for something that you actually love? Let's assume that you love racing, the first thing you could think is going to a racing festival full of cars from every era and category right? 
Then now let's make the greatest stage ever and let's sing for a bright future where we can all love what we do and feel free to do it, because yoou shouldn't feel insecure or ashamed of what you do, you'll never know how it can end and when.

The farewell
The farewell is just a song to let you believe in what you are doing, to make you love what you do and to encourage you in being what you want.
>The little bird's wings are now strong

and so start flying towards your next goal and do something that I would like to call a miracle

That's an easy spot for me because I just see the arts as the peak of School Idol Project and they are on a different new level.
img440() img440()
img440() img440()

Let's stop here for a second. 
One of the main reason why I love this franchise is because the songs are not random at all as they tell you something, it can be a story and something else. In this movie we have many songs but I'll just take my 3 favourite to avoid spoilers.

Hello, Hoshi o Kazoete : sung by the first year trio (apart from being a banger) tells us the point of view of the girls in the unknown city, as it is mysterious but fantastic at the same time, they are attracted by this new reality and start feeling like at home.

Angelic Angel : in this song the group now knows the city and they like it, a lot, as they ask you where are they but right after they answer with saying they've been dreaming for something like that for a long time. And so they ask you to enjoy this moment with them and to live it at the best you can.

Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari : the Great Ending finally comes. Hand up, I cried every single time at this song. They are singing their story now, what they discovered, what they felt, how they became a single light in the darkness of the future where you don't know what can happen and NOW  they are encouraging you to become what you always wanted and so you will be able to say ""No no noo,This moment is the greatest!""
BokuHika is way more than a song, is a hymn to life and a bright future where you can achieve what you want. Never forget your friends, who you love, your memories and do not ever forget who you really are.

Love Live School Idol Project was just, I don't know how to really say it, maybe the only thing that I'll never be able to experience again and forget.
Believe in what you do, achieve what you dream for. Love who you love.

6166,"Space.  The Feline...  I mean Final frontier.  Mankind has wondered for ages if there were other forms of life out there in the universe.  We’ve wondered about their biology, their culture, but most of all, their intentions towards us.  Never once have we imagined that extraterrestrial beings would be just as curious about us as we are about them...  Let alone that they’d have both the technology and the initiative to do something about it.

    Sixteen year old Kio Kakazu is on the way to a family function when he has a close encounter of his very own, but rather than a little green man, he meets a tall, busty catgirl named Eris who instantly turns his life upside down!  It turns out Kio’s no stranger to weird acquaintances, though, as his two closest female friends also have dark secrets he’s about to discover, and with the three of them all living under his roof, Kio’s going to have to kiss his normal life goodbye.

    Cat Planet Cuties was produced by AIC+, and while I usually like to look for common threads within the output of any given studio, the titles attributed to this company are all over the place in terms of quality.  I guess I can boil them down to having a similarly meager budget, as I can’t think of any title of theirs that I’ve seen that looked like it was rolling in cash, but the level of budget management is incredibly inconsistent.  They’ve produced shows like Kotoura-san, which looked adorable thanks to it’s simplistic aesthetic, and Strike Witches season 2, which was just as good as it’s first season at balancing different animation techniques, but Cat Planet Cuties is a different animal entirely.

    As far as I can tell, this show straight up ignored every single rule about managing a tight budget.  Cutting corners is a necessity, there’s no avoiding it, but it should be done sparingly, and in places where people won’t necessarily notice it.  In Cat Planet Cuties, I don’t think a single shot featuring actual characters in it had any more money attached than it absolutely needed to.  Movements are stiff and extremely limited, animation cycles are constant and abundantly noticeable, and there are extended shots of characters frozen like paintings while their lips flap like they’re in a two page flip book.  

    They use the old trick of bouncing an image up and down to create the illusion of someone walking, but they push it a step too far, sometimes having dozens of characters moving the same way all at once.  Facial expressions freeze awkwardly mid-conversation, characters blink so little I almost feel compelled to pass around eye drops, and this is all done to accommodate the use of expensive visual effects throughout the series.  The character designs are okay...  Generic, but with slight hints of personality and a bright and vibrant color palette...  But they’re not appealing enough to justify how badly they’re animated, forced to move all stiff and jerky just so the animators can have CGI robots, tanks, space ships, magic spells and water textures, thus putting the cart way before the horse.

    I’d normally take budget allocation like this with a grain of salt, because it’s usually a matter of necessity, but it feels so excessive and careless here.  They didn’t need as many lavish effects as they had, especially not at the cost the rest of the show had to pay.  It genuinely feels like they skimped wherever possible just to save money for later, and yeah, the CG effects look pretty cool at times, but considering how it’s Anilist page shows more drops than a Skrillex album, I highly doubt very many people stuck around that long to appreciate them.  Or hell, maybe they wasted even more money on the nearly half dozen ending themes this show had, none of which stuck with me afterwards.

    On the other hand, the English dub is pretty damn solid.  Funimation has a surprisingly good track record of putting in A+ effort on mindless booby shows, and this one is no exception.  One thing I’m going to get to later is the unexpected level of nuance in the characters, and their actors did a great job portraying it.  Monica Rial and Brittney Karbowski are of course brilliant, playing a couple of pretty cliched harem love interest roles, and adding depth where it was called for.  Aaron Dismuke plays a pretty likeable lead, and Tia Ballard should be commended on playing a loud, cheerful, very bubbly alien catgirl without getting too annoying.  All the other big names are here, playing various other catgirls and peripheral characters, cat puns are kept to a refreshing minimum, and yeah, decent dub all around.

    So you know exactly what you’re getting from this anime, right?  It’s an ecchi harem, but more to the point, it’s a magical girlfriend ecchi harem.  It should function basically the same way To Love Ru, UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie or any other show like that would function, right?  You’ve got your bland main guy, a busty babe who enters his life by accident and winds up becoming attached to him like a baby duck, several other contenders for his affection that battle it out despite him not having a recognizable interest in any of them, occasional bare breasts and a whole lot of wacky hijinks, right?  Well, yes, but also kind of no.  Cat Planet Cuties is a really weird show, and while it’s ultimately bound to the conventions of it’s genre, it still finds unexpected ways to surprise you.

    For starters, in most shows like this, you’d have one rogue alien princess crash landing on Earth, and all other arrivals that follow are either her friends, authorities trying to collect her, interstellar assholes vying for her affections despite her only being attracted to generic protagonists, and any actual diplomacy will happen long after she’s established Earth as her new home.  Cat Planet Cuties flips this premise directly on it’s head, as the title character is an ambassador, and her people are interested in making contact with us right from the start, as they just sincerely want to sample our culture and traditions.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen that concept explored in anime before, but it’s pretty intriguing.  They even lampoon the similarities between Earthlings and Catians right from the start, just so the vast unlikelihood of aliens being so obviously humanoid doesn’t become distracting later on.

    Of course, as spellbound as the Catians are by our culture, we never find out that much about theirs unless it comes up in the plot somehow.  We find out there’s been controversy over how Catian looking their service robots should be(the fact that they never call them Purr-socoms astounds me) but aside from that and a few biological details, they never really get explored.  I don’t like to throw around the term ‘missed opportunities,” as it’s usually the calling card of people who were just salty an anime didn’t give them what they wanted, but it does feel pretty lopsided, and I would have loved to see what the culture of a planet full of cat people looks like.  Maybe if Earth’s interest in the Catians had extended past “Religious catgirl worshipping cult,” this show could have explored some profound topics about our place in the universe.  

    And yeah, I know I’m a fool for expecting something profound from a ridiculous booby show with one of the cringiest names in anime history, but here’s the thing:  Cat Planet Cuties spends the majority of it’s run time adding new, thoughtful twists on old harem cliches, only to consistently falter and disappoint, effectively taking one step forward and two steps back at the bare minimum.

    Starting with Kio, he’s a likeable, mild mannered guy, and he actually has something of a spine, allowing him to stand up for himself where needed.  Having said that, he’s still your generic harem protagonist, who has no interest in sex despite multiple girls throwing themselves at him.  He has no discernable personality outside of being kind and somewhat assertive, and he actually has far less agency in the story than other characters like him would have.  Like, zero agency, period.  Eris, his catgirlfriend, the magical girl of the series, is actually pretty damn smart, has political experience, and is able to use deductive reasoning in several situations.  Having said that, she’s still deliberately portrayed on screen as a sexual object, and she’s naive to the point that she derives her understanding of Earth culture and sexuality from Kio’s porno mags multiple times.  

    It’s admittedly pretty clever that they wrote off her excessive level of horniness(another unfortunate cliche) as her just literally being a cat in heat, but the fact that it’s clever doesn’t make it not pathetic, which it is.  As for the other two harem leads, they have lives outside of Kio, with very clear aspirations and goals(far fetched though they might be), but they pretty much abandon them after episode 1.  They have a history with Kio that gives them actual, understandable reasons to have feelings for him, unlike most harems where everything with a vag falls madly in love with their main character because potato.  Having said that, they’re still your stereotypical harem cliches;  A soft spoken shy girl and a loud, boisterous girl who’s constantly beating him up over misunderstandings.

    Making Kio’s house into an embassy is an interesting way to justify having the harem live under one roof, having multiple characters and their bodyguards join the main characters homeroom class all at once is a funny way to lampoon the old cliche of characters being introduced in front of the class, showing a catgirl getting high on catnip is a scenario straight out of the land of satire, these things are pretty impressive on their own, but they’re also symptomatic of a show that’s throwing a LOT at the wall to see what sticks.  Cat Planet Cuties deals with a variety of tones and subject matters, but they do not mix well.  Don’t get me wrong, if there’s a medium where you can cross genres and mix the serious with the silly, it’s anime.  A Centaur’s Life explored subjects like critical race theory and cultural differences through a silly fantasy world, and while it’s messages weren’t always entirely clear, it was able to address the fucking holocaust without missing a step.  This, show, on the other hand, can’t resolve a love triangle in the middle of an epic space battle without feeling out of sorts, and sci-fi and romance are genres that were practically made for each other.

      Speaking of which, remember in my Smartphone review, where I made a comparison over how similarly their romance subplots were resolved?  It is so much worse here.  The situations this show presents, the conflicts the cast have to deal with, the dynamic between Earthlings and Catians, everything this show does boils down to one common denominator:  It’s creative, but it’s fucking stupid.  There is a lot going on in this show, and almost none of it is executed well.  Brazen stupidity isn’t always a bad thing, as it can lead to unique bits of content that you just couldn’t get anywhere else...  A stark naked gun fight in the middle of the gorram street comes to mind...  But the over-all product is a complete mess, and the final two episodes are more exhausting than exciting.  I can’t say there’s nothing in this show to make it worth picking up, but it does not reward you for doing so, and the tease they made at the end for a second season can go have fun over there with live action Princess Azula.

    Cat Planet Cuties is available from Funimation.  The original SAVE release has shot up dramatically in value, as most of them have, but the recent Essentials release is  still fairly cheap, so it’s pretty to easy to obtain.  It’s also available for streaming on their website.  The original light novels are not available stateside, but the manga is available from Digital Manga.  An OVA episode is available on the home release, and if you’re disappointed by the sporadic fanservice of the series, well, the OVA just straight up gets every female character naked for you, so have fun with that.

    Ultimately, it is a combination of stupidity, a lack of consistency and no real sense of identity that causes this series to fall short of certain other ecchi harem anime that also tried to add depth to the genre...  Say what you want about This Ugly Yet Beautiful World and Nakaimo, but least they knew what they wanted to be.  I can’t exactly say I’d never recommend this show to anyone, as it does have some unique elements to offer, and I wish it had been more critically and commercially successful just so a slew of better series could have salvaged them and put them to better use, but even hardcore fanservice nuts would be better off looking elsewhere.  Despite it’s best efforts, as random and sporadic as they were, this ends up being a harem anime that’s too cat-astrophic to take seriously, but too weird and quirky to ignore.

    I give Cat Planet Cuties a 2/10."
160181,"NOTE: Contains spoilers	

First off, my condolences to the production team of the anime—unfortunately, it’s abundantly clear their work was anything but labor of love. That said, judging Whisper Me a Love Song on its own merits, it sadly falls short on practically all counts: many episodes are rife with incongruent plotlines, impulsive actions, and unrealistically melodramatic realizations, among other faults. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the lackluster production; however, I’m primarily here to discuss the narrative, given that this anime has neither endearing enough characters nor compelling storylines to balance out its technical deficiencies.

My first fault (and perhaps the most central one) lies with the execution of Himari and Yori’s relationship. Truthfully, I often fail to see the value in the “love at first sight” trope, as it entails greater effort on the viewer’s part to piece together and grow invested in a relationship. In other words, if an anime lacks the necessary introspection and exposition to justify a character’s love, it often falls on the audience to make their own deductions. That’s not to say there’s no inherent value in the trope—Bloom Into You, for example, executes this concept in a palatable and authentic manner—but it risks confusing and alienating the viewer if no subsequent justification is provided. 

Such is the case with Himari’s one-sided crush on Yori: in the fourth minute of the first episode, we see Himari become enamored with Yori’s singing, followed by an apparent love confession in the eight minute. Keep in mind, at this point we know virtually nothing regarding their interests, personality, and ambitions, yet we’re suddenly thrust into their unknown world of romance.  Consequently, I was quite apathetic to Yori’s subsequent dilemma; after all, if you saw two strangers on the street—the label I’d apply to Himari and Yori at this point—suddenly fall in love, how much would you care? 

Therein lies my main issue with Himari, and to a lesser extent Yori: these characters are defined almost entirely by their romance with each other, rather than their distinct traits and aspirations. Throughout the first two thirds of the show, I feel it’s no exaggeration to claim that 95% of Himari’s dialogue and actions are related, tangentially or directly, to her affection for Yori. Himari engages in conversation with Miki? She fawns over Yori and her musical prowess. Himari seeks out an after-school activity? She ultimately settles on the cooking club to woo Yori with baked treats. Himari has free time during school? She seeks out Yori’s companionship and ponders whether she’ll enjoy the privilege to hear her sing yet again. That’s all to say, prior to the introduction of Shiho, I’d be hard pressed to tell you any distinct character interests or traits Himari has: she…enjoys fashion, I guess? Of course, a romance’s principal aim is to flesh out a relationship, but when it suffocates the plotline to the point that its characters lack much independent thought, it quickly becomes unrealistic and off-putting for the viewer. As a result, Himari’s characterization is equivalent to a hollow caricature of a romantic, easily interchangeable with another generic love-struck protagonist without so much as an impact on the plot. 

By the same token, the nature of their romance is equivalent to a paint-by-numbers scheme: saccharine and satisfying enough on the outside, but ultimately formulaic with little room for interpretation. For instance, Yori’s rationale for falling in love with Himari essentially boils down to “she’s cute” with minimal elaboration provided, while meaningful interactions where they discuss their interests (or, more frankly, why they became enamored with each other) are few in number. Likewise, Himari discusses little about Yori’s personality traits, preferring to focus almost solely on her musical talent, which culminates in her almost mind-numbingly predictable confession following Yori’s second performance. The end result is a relationship that relies almost entirely on telling, rather than showing, making for a paper-thin romance that hinges on declarative statements in a feeble attempt to convince the viewer of their chemistry.

In the same vein, much of the supporting cast lacks any semblance of personality or distinction. Miki’s role is largely confined to being “Aki’s sister” with no traits of note, Mari’s only distinctive trait is that she weirdly refers to others using their first and last name, Hajime’s only purpose is to round out Laureley, and…I can’t even recall the name of the other member of SSGIRLS. Similarly, Momoka, Aki, and Shiho, while given slightly more space to develop, ultimately fall flat as characters and romantic interests. Little explanation is provided regarding Aki’s crush on Yori beyond the fact that it exists, causing her sudden antagonization of Himari to feel unsettlingly out of place, yet this drama is largely relegated to one episode…and she somehow comes to terms with Himari and Yori’s relationship within the span of a few minutes..? On the other hand, while Momoka’s relationship with Kyou tries to pull at the heartstrings, its three minute montage lacks the attention and development needed for a greater effect.

As for our resident antagonist, Shiho, her backstory attempts to invite sympathy from the viewer but ultimately fails at portraying her as anything besides petty and egotistical. While the intended narrative seems to be “childhood prodigy explores new musical endeavors as she grapples with past relationships and her insecurities,” the five minute montage reads closer to “entitled, whiny teenager copes with main character syndrome by embarking on a petty revenge arc.” Given the complexity of such a narrative, as demonstrated by shows like Sound! Euphonium and Your Lie in April—which develop similar stories over multiple arcs—it’s only natural that this show’s rendition lacks the nuance and clarity of dialogue needed to sell Shiho’s character. Chock-full of generic, self-centered lines like “the more I talk to you, the worse I feel” and “she positively adored me, and I thought she was pretty all right,” Shiho’s backstory amounts to little more than surface level victim blaming and projection, causing Himari’s sudden fixation on and sympathy for Shiho to feel rather contrived. Of course, compelling characters don’t necessarily need to exhibit the highest moral fiber…yet Shiho’s utter lack of self awareness and empathy, shown when she unapologetically trashes Yori to Himari’s face (seriously, who does that?), does little to endear me to her.

Unfortunately, the final two episodes (which premiered six months later, by some miracle) do little to change the tide. Shallow monologues and confounding choices galore round out the festival arc: apart from the bizarre creative choice to entirely sideline Himari and Yori’s relationship, Aki and Himari nonsensically blame themselves for Shiho’s inner turmoil—culminating in Aki seemingly professing her love for Shiho…or not? As a viewer, I was honestly left with more questions than answers…how did we go from “enemies” to “lovers” within the span of five minutes? What in the world compelled Aki to give Shiho a second chance? Melodrama can only take a plotline so far, and by a certain point, I feel that introspection and dialogue are needed to convincingly sell a story. So, while I can respect the narrative intent, Aki’s 90-second monologue—an exercise in 'telling' rather than 'showing' her feelings for Shiho—and Shiho’s explicit avoidance of Aki ultimately culminated in a resolution that felt unearned, if not entirely manufactured, ringing hollow on all fronts.

All in all, Whisper Me a Love Song, while ambitious in its attempt to capture the viewer’s attention, ultimately lacks the nuance and gravitas needed to elevate its plot beyond an elementary level romantic drama, amounting to a confounding watch experience best left forgotten."
357,"Warning: Minor spoilers could be ahead. But's thats irrelevant, since you shouldn't watch this shit anyway.
Another warning: English is not my native language. There might be some grammatical mistakes or syntax errors.

So, the story deals with a highschool student named Sakura, who is permanently tortured by an angel (omg i hate her fcking so much). That's because in his future, he will develop a tool, which prevents girls at the age of 12 to age further. Apparently, he does that since he is a pedo. But that's not the worst part!
To stop him, an angel from the future named Dokuro-chan has been sent to Sakura to eliminate him. But instead of killing Sakura, she falls in ""love"" with him. But Dokuro-chan is really sadistic and gets way to excited when she tortures him. She has fun while even killing him! (She can revive him btw)
It's a pain to watch how Dokuro-chan kills Sakura everytime. I mean, I like Slapstick Comedy but that's just utter trash. I can't believe anybody would laugh at it. There's much blood too, which is just disturbing.The shit which is happening, when Sakura doesn't get tortured by Dokuro-chan is boring by the way. Sakura has a crush on some random girl, but that's irrelevant because nothing really happens between them. Then there's another angel which is there to really kill Sakura, but as you've guessed, that doesn't work out at all.
So, the plot is just boring and the comedy complete garbage. It's more cringe than fun.

I f+cking hate everyone in this show. Dokuro-chan is the worst. My god, words cannot describe how much I hate her for just killing Sakura everytime. Give him (and me) a break! She's not funny and just annoying. The best part might be her characterdesign, but it's not awesome though. If I was Sakura, i would've just wanted to die - Not just because of this shitty angel. Every classmate hates him, even the fricking teacher hates him. There's no one standing by his side. ""Luckily"" Sakura is motivated enough to go trough all of this. In addition, he even is really nice to Dokuro-chan (Things I hate happen in the last episode, but i won't spoiler here). The girl Sakura has a crush on is okay, but i couldn't sense a single character trait. She is just a run of the mill pretty good looking girl. The second assassin angel is okay too. At the beginning, she is annoying but later on, she pretty much disappears.
The best characters in this show are the ones with no personality. That's fcking sad, huh?

The art is fine, I mean it's from 2005. It's not HD and 4:3, as expected. But the animation work is fine. Some facial expressions from the MC are pretty funny to see.
 I don't remember even one song of this show, expect the really shitty OP. A good point is, that this show's not on TV and that it's just 4 episodes. 

Unenjoyable. I shall tell you, that this show is a parody of the Magical Girl Genre. Dokuro-chan is just a satire of a magical girl. Nothing's wrong with satire but the way it is executed in this show is awful. I've never watched an magical girl anime, but I know that Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan isn't a good parody of this genre. 
Yeah, I had no fun watching these episodes. They had some fanservice as well, just in case you're interested, but it's a minor feature of this show. And it might be a little weird because Dokuro-chan looks like she is 10 years old (but maybe that's fine for you). 

I don't remember why, but i know that i've laughed at one scene of the show!! Just because of this, the show get's a solid 8/100. I would have gone with a 1/100 if I hadn't laugh. I beg you, please don't watch this painful trash!"
20565,"Okay so. I don't know where to fucking start with this show. The plot is that some guy adores twin-tails, so a twin-tail-themed big booba woman comes to gift him a 'Tailgear', which allows him to transform into a tiny Magical Girl themed after twin-tails. She does this to fight against the alien empire who are coming to Earth to steal everyone's twin-tails. What

Meanwhile, his close friends who also have and like twin-tails (the TRANS GENDER only good character Aika Tsube and the yellow one who was a character and then turned into a different character and then turned into a fetish) become Twin-Tails too, while his mother tries to urge him to get some pussy because no way a dude like him is getting it otherwise, and the entire cast try to fuck him because uhhhhhhh.

This show is bizarre, and the only explanation for it was that it was written entirely by aliens and/or people insanely high on crack and other assorted hard drugs. Nobody else could write something like this. I couldn't even tell what genre it was supposed to be /at all/ until the last few episodes. Was it supposed to be a parody of normal Magical Girls stuff? There was a bit of that. Was it supposed to be a straight Magical Girl show just with comedy? There was also some implications that it wanted to take itself seriously. Was it supposed to just be fanservice? What the fuck does fanservice have to do with fucking /twin-tails/ out of literally everything? Literally what the fuck

The enemy faction each have their own fetishes. Like, every MoTW just gets his rocks off to something else and goes after humans to try and like. watch them do that thing. The first big boss loves twin-tails (duh) and idfk I forgot the rest they're all forgettable. The fetishes (cough) Affinities can also be inserted directly into the Tailgear to activate a special ability that sort of made sense with the source at first and then just became random shit. Like how the protag puts in a Braid Fetish Crystal and his friends are instantly freed from their 'unbreakable' wet dream wonderland worlds. 

There is literally no proper main villain but the only human member of the fetish faction is really into glasses so her evil plot is to 1. fuck the big booba woman 2. apparently fuck the small child magical girl (who is only small, a child, or a girl sometimes)???????? 3. get the entire world into glasses because glasses are sexy. Okay.

I literally cannot understate how weird this show was and also how absolutely garbage. It had no direction. It very clearly had no idea what it wanted to be because even I can't tell what the fuck this show is supposed to be. Who was it made for. How many people have a twin-tail fetish enough to tune into late-night ecchi anime to indulge in it. What the fuck is going on. Did someone just have a fetish and write light novels about it and then the anime production company saw it and thought it was hot. What

I don't even know what to say about this show it's truly the strangest thing I have ever encountered there are no proper words to describe it at all. If you watch this while you're absolutely fucked off your ass on weed then you might think it's a little funny but in any other state it's something to just avoid"
160389,"I must admit I am a big sucker for harem anime and I don't even know why. I often find their tropes and pseudo-romantic narratives unappealing, where either the protagonist ends up with an unsatisfactory choice or the story halts abruptly without ever being finished. Yet, here I am, delving into another harem series, hoping for a different experience this time. Regrettably, this anime turned out to be as dull and uninspiring as one might suspect, but most notably even fails to deliver as a harem show.  Frankly I made it as far as episode 9 solely to meet the 75% completion requirement necessary to write this review. So, let's delve into its shortcomings:

The narrative follows a young man and his female childhood friend and love interest, thrust into a fantasy world where he is forced into marrying multiple girls to gain power and combat a magical threat endangering the world. Both protagonists harbour feelings for each other from the outset, openly displaying disdain for the forced harem scenario imposed upon them.  I would be surprised, shocked even, if the anime ends in any other way than with the main couple returning to Japan to pursue a life together. Yet, the plot insists on enforcing this harem dynamic, devoid of any real competition, seemingly designed only to evoke anxiety and insecurity in the main girl. While the secondary characters possess some likeability, they remain one-dimensional stereotypes. Why even make an harem anime if the main couple is so strongly opposed to it?

Even the anime acknowledges the protagonist's shortcomings, openly portraying him as weak and indecisive, contrary to the expectations of those around him. While his weakness is no necessary disadvantage in in environment that so oversaturated with power-fantasy plotlines and the anime attempts to at least salvage the situation by illustrating his growth and determination, albeit overshadowed by repetitive harem tropes, he still lacks any redeeming quality fit for the role of a main character. His most annoying qualities manifest in his constant surprise, often depicted through exaggerated, high-pitched screeching. Additionally, he single-handedly sabotages any meaningful romantic progression. Unlike typical harem anime where external factors disrupt intimate moments, here the protagonist constantly obstructs his own path to romance. He becomes flustered at the mere suggestion of any kind of intimacy, exhibiting perpetual awkwardness and insecurity. Despite near permanent advances, he consistently rejects invitation to physical contact not only from the other girls, but also from his love interest, while paradoxically engaging in scenarios like mixed baths with his harem without any issues.

Considering the genre, my expectations for the fantasy aspects were not high, yet I was still disappointed. Most settings revolve solely around the latest addition to the harem, presenting challenges for the protagonist to overcome, thereby winning the girl's affection before moving on to the next location. While there are occasional fight scenes, they fail to leave a lasting impression. The plot suffers from numerous holes, exemplified by a character's sudden disappearance for half an episode, only to reappear without any explanation.

If you are solely looking for ecchi content - and for whatever reason do not have access to any hentai site - you are at least not gonna be disappointed in this regard. The harem girls exhibit little modesty, frequently wearing revealing attire or appearing entirely nude. The team's primary destination in every major setting is the mixed bath, where the harem girls relentlessly attempt to seduce the protagonist. The abundance of naked scenes is notable, with the protagonist's most remarkable feat being his unwavering commitment to maintaining his virginity throughout the series.

(Show is done now, so i can make this public again)"
2581,"Sometimes you shouldn't complicate simplicity.

Gundam 00 is a peculiar installment in its franchise. Being an introduction into the Gundam franchise for many a fan, myself included, it has arguably become the most popularly viewed entry besides Wing. One could say that the writers looked at Wing and decided to take some of the base elements of it to create their own story that touched on war-related issues of the current times. Then that same person could say that they probably should have followed Wing just a little more loosely given how convoluted and nonsensical circumstances regarding the main group became.

A group known as “Celestial Being” has appeared in the distant future with one simple objective: fight to bring peace and end all war. Many factions across the globe disagree with their objective which seems aggressively contrary to their methods. Four young adult pilots, half of whom have been affected by war, are deployed by Celestial Being to stop disputes with force, relying on what Gundam fans have referred to as the “overkill formula”, in which single machines mow down dozens of mooks at a time. Sounds relatively simple enough as long as the show manages to highlight and keep track of the multiple factions. The idea comes with the potential to explore all sorts of concepts related to war, terrorism, protests, and global violence in ways unique to the timeline, while slowly peeling the layers of each major combatant. To an extent, 00 seems to capitalize on this potential, even showing a more personal example of what happens to civilians caught in the crossfires of battle. 

Then we get the robot equivalent to Dragon Ball Z’s Kai-o-ken, an extra private faction that hijacks a poorly explained supercomputer the main protagonists’ faction was using, a council that oversees all of this, even more private investors with their own agendas that get killed off unceremoniously, special particle beams that prevent healing, a myriad of poorly-conceived world-building mechanics that get dropped after what little exploration they had such as the space colonies, a badly done newtype-esque type attribute known as quantum brain-waves, and the knowledge that the series has dropped the ball in making sure we are able to keep up with every private faction. This isn’t even going into the cloning, the innovade/innovator business, Zeta Gundam plagiarism and self-contradictions galore, the increased levels of over-complication in regards to the quantum brain wave mechanic that defines the timeline from the moment one of the main characters gets affected by it as early as episode 3 of season 1, and superpowers that allow communication with the dead, all of which occur in the second season!

I’m sorry, was that overwhelming? Good; now you know what watching the 00 series is like!

One could argue that this series is best enjoyed without attempting to stretch your mental capacity to house all the convoluted nonsense and mental-gymnastics taken by the second half of season 1 onwards. Thanks to the flashy and well-animated mech battles with loads of colorful particles and explosions, and the sexy character designs that pave the way for many moments of casual semi-nudity without the need for fanservice, I’d agree. The designs of each mech are nowhere near as iconic or memorable as those of most other installments, but they do serve their purpose in seeming like the aggressive war machines they are. The music, while certainly not up to Kenji Kawai’s standard, has some decently memorable tracks that do an acceptable job of complimenting the plethora of fights shown throughout. The opening themes also serve well at getting people excited for each episode, as mediocre and often meaningless as each episode may be. They also represent the state of the show in each half, with the first being more simple and about characters getting to know each other and how things are beginning to play out, and the second being more chaotic and more intense in nature, as the action and overall emotional baggage rack up. Sadly, the ending themes, which do follow this, are less enjoyable.

For anyone hoping the characters would provide much of the enjoyment you would likely obtain from the show, just know this won’t likely be the case. The main 4 are mostly simple enough. Allelujah Haptism and Setsuna F Seiei (get used to these kinds of names) had the potential to be the most interesting in the show, given that the former suffers from split-personality disorder and that the latter, who is the main protagonist, is a more reserved and agitated chap who became a child soldier who grew to display trust and touch issues after being betrayed. They only somewhat capitalize on these personal aspects, more so for Allelujah than Setsuna, as the latter is largely Heero Yui from Wing, but with more baggage. Lockon Stratos is the most easy-going and friendly of the bunch, so many will deem him the most likable, even when the chips are down and he gets angry at his comrades or at terrorists. Contrast this with the initially unlikable and ultimately boring Tieria Erde. The rest of the astronomically large cast was largely tolerable, with very few standouts in positive or negative regards. The few exceptions include the fun and determined Graham Acker, the gloriously evil Ali al Saachez --both of whom are Setsuna’s main rivals--, and a painfully disappointing trio that joins the main 4 in the second half. Few are badly written per se, beyond how the script becomes a joke towards the end, but most of the potential many of these characters had is lost, with the second season doing them no favors. You might enjoy the rest of the crew the main protagonists collaborate with, notably the commander, Sumeragi, but getting attached to the wrong crew member may cost you towards the end. They are likely the best characters in the show, given that they allow for some pleasant and even humorous interactions with the main cast and even each other. 

Gundam 00 was a potentially captivating series squandered by an unchecked need for complication and drama. As such, its characters feel wasted and its world feels poorly developed and half-baked. You will find fun with the action scenes as well as a few of the side characters and their interactions, but you would want to treat this series as simpler than it actually is, lest you watch it start to be torn apart by the power of expectations and critical thinking. 00 goes downhill from here, so if you wish to start this, just know you’re getting the best of what the timeline has to offer pretty early on."
4107,"I think making a review now is perfect due to the 15th anniversary of the movie coming out in theaters, which I happened to see.

Gurren Lagann: Childhood's End (or simply just Gurren-Hen), is a movie version of the first-ish half of the 27-episode original anime of the same name, covering the journey up to the battle of Teppelin, but not actually covering that battle.

Due to it being a recap, the movie is essentially as good as the anime is. And because the anime is one of the best series I can think of, it's a great movie. My only issue is that the movie is a bit too 1:1 with the anime, and a lot of scenes that have serious impact on the story, like Kamina seeing his dead dad, is cut, and some general character building to make the emotional moments match how they feel in the anime. There are some movie exclusive scenes like the intro scene giving Lord Genome a more fleshed out background, even if he's not all that important in this movie, and the movie-exclusive fight with all of the remaining generals (and Viral) in some FFXIV Ultimate-esque, what-if-scenario, mega combining mech. Those scenes look absolutely amazing due to it being, well, made for the big screen.

That being said, some scenes still look really poor. Episode 4, specifically, was guest directed by a friend of one of the Gainax founders. The animation was received so poorly, that people complained, and then found out the guy fought back, saying the comments about the episode were ""like putting [his] face next to an anus and breathing deeply."" He then left the company. You'd think perhaps they would try to clean up that scene, but no, it just looks really out of place and clearly they reused animation. I mean, it's a recap movie, but come on. I'm not expecting Pixar/Studio Ghibli quality, but it feels a bit lacking compared to other movies in the same medium.

The animation is still amazingly done, regardless. The new scenes are incredibly hype, and the old scenes still hold up as being incredibly thrilling to see in the theater. Unfortunately, I didn't see this one in 4D, but there is a lot of people saying it nearly threw them out of their seats it was so wild. Honestly, if this was any other movie, that would be a complaint, but Gurren Lagann is all about being a thrill ride, so it fits perfectly to see it as such. Just unfortunate that, unless you live in a major city, you probably aren't going to have a convenient trip to the theater. Not even for the 4D version, just the movie in general. Sucks that so few theaters even bother.

Gurren Lagann is an amazing anime, and the movies are no different. Seeing them dubbed finally is a serious treat since they weren't dubbed for the longest time. It helps the dub is actually one of the better dubs in anime. But still, if you were to ask if you should watch the movies in lieu of the anime, I would heavily disagree. The movies are great, but better as a recap of the anime. And if you asked if you should watch this series, I couldn't possibly say yes harder."

1. Graphismes : 8/10
Pour un anime datant de 2014, je trouve les graphismes des paysages assez surprenants et agréables. Je suis très sévère au niveau des graphismes lors des couchers de soleil, mais ceux-ci sont très agréables à regarder et me détendraient presque ! Les rues sont jolies, l'école aussi, c'est un des plus gros points de pourquoi j'aime cet anime.

2. Ambiance : 17/20 
L'ambiance est quelque peu liée aux graphismes mais ce sont quand bien même deux choses différentes. Dans cet anime, l'ambiance colle bien avec les actions, et les prises de vues sont assez bien choisies.

3. Scénario : 40/50
L'histoire principale est assez originale et rigolote. C'est en fait plusieurs ""extra-terrestres"" qui veulent s'emparer de l'appartement 106 (pas sûr du numéro, à vérifier) pour leurs intérêts personnels. Ces  personnes vont alors se battre pour l'obtenir mais le propriétaire n'est pas d'accord, c'est alors qu'une amitié va se créer entre tous et mener une vie quotidienne de lycéen normal.
En revanche, il y a quelque chose qui ne colle pas à l'histoire générale, c'est l'action. Pour moi, elle n'a pas grand chose à faire dans l'histoire car j'ai trouvé ça ridicule. Le personnage principal qui arrive à battre une random avec une épée qui pop du ciel c'est du n'importe quoi !
Malgré ces deux-trois exceptions, l'histoire est plutôt plaisante.

4. Personnages : 7/10 
Tous les personnages présents dans l'histoire ont une personnalité différente. Je les aime tous ! 
Tout d'abord, Satomi Kōtarō ; le personnage principal. Assez basique mais efficace pour le développement de l'histoire car c'est le seul perso banal.
Puis, Higashihongan Sanae ; très agréable et calme.
Kurano Kiriha ; assez mystérieuse mais on apprend à la connaître au fil du temps.
Tiamilis ; la tsundere du groupe, il en fallait bien une !
Ruth ; l'amie de Tiamilis, assez drôle et plutôt extravagante.
Yurika Nijino ; très marrante, la victime du groupe. Sans elle, l'anime n'aurait aucun sens !

5. Opening : 8/10 
En visuel, l'unique opening est assez bof mais très cliché et colle bien à l'histoire. Quant à la musique, je m'en souviens encore alors que j'ai fini l'anime hier, elle est plutôt cool.

youtube(https://youtu.be/zggbCjFbRzE)

6. Rythme de visionnage : 
J'ai mis environ 1 mois à le regarder. Pas hyper attractif mais assez bien quand on a rien à faire. Je reprends les anime petit à petit alors c'est normal !



Points forts : ► Anime drôle, avec une bonne ambiance et des personnages originaux. Opening assez chouette et bons graphismes.
Points faibles : ► Quelques scènes d'action qui ne devraient pas apparaître selon moi."
11179,"Yuuta Segawa is in his first year of college, but he might not be where he is today if it wasn’t for his older sister, who took it upon herself to raise him when their parents died fifteen years ago so they wouldn’t be separated.  Naturally, when she asks her now grown brother to watch her daughter and two stepdaughters while she takes a trip with her husband, it’s the least he can do to help out...  Until the news breaks that her airplane has disappeared over the ocean.  The three girls he’s just bonded with now face the same situation young Yuuta did...  They’re about to be separated among their relatives.

To the surprise of his entire extended family, Yuuta steps up and brings the girls back to his tiny apartment, so he can raise them as his own while continuing to attend college.  It’s the four of them against the world as they fight to stay together, but the question they will inevitably have to face is, did Yuuta bite off more than he can chew?  Or has the family he’s found truly be the one he’s wanted his entire life?

Listen to Me Girls, I am Your Father...  Which I’m going to call Papakiki from now on, for obvious reasons...  Does not look like a high budget show, which makes sense, because Studio Feel is not a high budget studio.  They’ve had a few projects that sound promising, I mean they collaborated with Gainax on Corpse Princess, which I haven’t seen but which probably looks all right...  But the few titles of theirs I am aware of are not promising.  I probably only have to bring up Kiss X Sis to let you know exactly what we’re working with here, but remember from my old review, the animation in Kiss X Sis was not one of it’s myriad problems.  The same goes for Yosuga no Sora and So I Can’t Play H...  Shows that had issues, to be sure, but they look passable at the very worst.

Studio Feel knows how to manage a shoe string budget, which is one of the few things I consistently respect about them.  Don’t get me wrong, Papakiki looks cheap at first glance, you can very easily tell that pennies were being pinched during production, but it never really feels like it’s being held back by that.  On the other hand, almost everything about this show production-wise looks painfully generic.  Every single character features the most basic, dime a dozen aesthetic you can possibly imagine for their respective archetypes, the only exception of which being the young toddler Hina, who barely looks like a human.  She looks like the product of an unholy union between Shadow the Hedgehog and Toad from Mario.

One problem it does carry over from Kiss X Sis is the fact that characters’ skin is covered by these weird plasticene shiny marks, little rashy marks that look like blushes, but with white in the middle, like a freshly popped pimple about to ooze puss.  And then you have the face designs, which, oh man.  There’s a phrase people used to use around the dawn of 2010 called “Moe blob,” and I got through the entire Key catalogue without using it, but it’s unavoidable here.  I’ve been an anime fan for decades, I have a very high tolerance for tumor-sized eyes on an anime character, but combined with mouths that form indescribable shapes, that is a tough combination to overcome.

The music is just as generic, just your typical plinky-plink anime harem sitcom background noise, with an opening and closing that are upbeat and happy, but also weirdly forgettable.  There’s no dub, which means I’m at a disadvantage here, but I guess everyone sounds okay?  Except for Hina, who’s clearly being voiced by an adult.  It sounds fine, but honestly, I have nothing particularly insightful to say about the audio side of this review, so let’s just move on.

I was not initially intending to review this anime.  It wasn’t even on my radar.  I picked it up dirt cheap from a recent Sentai Filmworks online sale, and it just collected dust on my shelf until last week, where I had just finished another show and I was like “Well, I’m putting another collection of anime DVDs up on Ebay, might as well burn through some random title and add it to the stack(link in my profile).""  I could tell right away, just from the aesthetic, that I wasn’t going to like it, but I kept watching.  I spent actual money on a physical copy, I was at least going to finish it.  I had some issues with the plot; The girls being split up felt forced, especially with that whole boarding school deal that felt entirely negotiable...  And Yuuta’s decision, which began with literal child abduction(they were too young to legally go willingly) was entirely terrible.  Whatever.  I had resigned myself to just pushing through, making snide comments online, and letting it go.  But then episode 6 happened.

In episode 6, Yuuta is escorting his neices back to their old home to collect their things, when it’s revealed that the littlest girl, Hina, was really popular in an outdoor shopping center.  Aww.  Cute.  She goes up to a fruit vendor, he unpeels a banana for her, and she takes a big honkin’ bite out of it, right out of his hand.  Upon seeing this, my jaw dropped, and I practically screamed “OH MY GOD!”  As I tried to comprehend what I had just seen.

Sigmund Freud once said “Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.”  George Carlin would later respond to this, saying “Well sometimes it’s a big brown dick.”  In the over twenty years that I’ve been watching anime, I’ve seen plenty of instances of various phallic food items being used as metaphorical replacements for penises.  In Majikoi, the mushroom popsicles were dicks.  In Vividred Operation, the cucumbers with a dollop of mayo on the end were dicks.  In Girls Bravo, the banana the fruit vendor was selling(what a coincidence) was a dick, and lo and behold, little Hina got a nice big bite out of a fruit vendor’s banana dick too, only it’s not played for laughs, it’s played entirely straight like we’re just not supposed to notice. 

It would be an isolated incident on it’s own, but in addition to this little indiscretion, this show is really fucking creepy.  I guess I’ll get this one right out of the way, one of Yuuta’s friends is an open, out-and-proud pedophile who makes non-stop creepy comments about little girls, and Yuuta has no issue letting this dude near his neices.  The fact that he gets smacked with a fan for saying creepy shit doesn’t make up for him saying creepy shit.  The girls are constantly nude, and while it’s TV safe nudity, they still don’t leave much to the imagination.  The oldest girl(14) has a massive crush on her legal guardian, who she often sleeps next to and winds up in his arms without fail, and just when I thought things couldn’t get any worse, episode ten features that very girl having a sex dream about her younger ten year old sister which then evolves very quickly into a marriage fantasy about Yuuta.

And look, I know what some of you are saying...  These complaints, on their own, are nothing serious.  Kids get crushes on adults, it happened to all of us when we were younger, it isn’t necessarily a problem unless it’s reciprocated.  The pedophile character isn’t that bad, he doesn’t hurt anybody, characters like him are usually slapstick goofballs at best and minor annoyances at worst.  Underage nudity isn’t something the Japanese have any real cultural stigma against, and hey, I’m a Strike Witches fan, who am I to complain?  The problem is context.  The plot creates a situation where these issues just mean more than they usually would. 

To illustrate my point, let’s look at another anime that premiered the previous year, Bunny Drop.  Bunny Drop is essentially a more wholesome take on Papakiki’s concept.  A single dude adopts a recently orphaned bastard child(technically his great aunt, don’t ask, it’s complicated) because his family doesn’t know what to do with her.  He raises her in fairly earnest and straight forward fashion, with no real fan service to speak of, being portrayed as a realistic struggling single parent while his charge is portrayed as the extremely rare realistic small child.  The series is incredibly sweet, but it ends on a cliffhanger, so of course you check out the manga to see where the story went from there...  Only to immediately start looking up discount lobotomy services for yourself.  I’m not going to spoil where that series was supposed to go before the anime adaptation cut it the fuck off, but it’s baaaaaaaaaaaad, it’s bad bad bad bad bad. 

My point being, if the wholesome version of this concept wasn’t able to avoid ending in extremely questionable fashion, what the hell makes you think the ecchi version stands a chance of it?

But fine, let’s assume for a moment that I’m over-reacting and seeing shit that isn’t there.  Let’s assume I’m just pearl clutching, being easily offended, or even ‘triggered’ if that’s the phrase you think will make me look weaker and easier to 'dunk on.'  If we take this entire series at face value, there’s another glaring issue here.  There’s something missing from Yuuta’s new family that undermines it on a fundamental level, and not only prevents them from feeling like a real family(and yes, I do believe a found family can feel like a real family) but that prevents them from feeling like real people.  That something, is conflict.

Family sucks.  I don’t think I’m saying anything too controversial here, if you have a family, they suck, and you suck by association.  No matter how much you love each other, no matter how strong your bond is, there’s a good chance you would not be friends with these people if you were not linked to them by birth.  Personally, I grew up under some pretty decent circumstances...  I had a middle class upbringing in a good neighborhood, went to a good school, had mostly supportive parents and a brother only a year and a half younger than me, and I wouldn’t trade any of it for any other circumstance, but there are still fights and arguments I had decades ago that live rent free in my head to this day, and I know it goes both ways.  I was a holy terror when I was a kid, an ungrateful, selfish little shit and I wouldn’t be offended or surprised to find out that my parents still have nightmares about the shit that I put them through. 

A good family doesn’t just not suck, they overcome the fact that they suck to be as functional as possible despite sucking.  So you would think, stuffing three underage girls into a tiny apartment with a college-aged man with limited money and one bathroom would cause a lot of problems, right?  Maybe they’d fight over clothing, who’s turn it is to do chores, who’s using the bathroom, or hell, just having to constantly live five feet away from each other and getting sick of each other's very presence, but NOPE!  There is not one single argument that happens between these people.  Even the toddler, who SHOULD be the most combative of the bunch(let’s be real we’ve all been there) but nope, she’s just happy-go-lucky and hyper.  The closest we get is...  Well, spoilers, but when her sister has to explain to her their parents aren’t coming back, she throws a fit about that, but she’s almost immediately all smiles again, putting on a brave face for her sisters, which is something ANY child of her age would have difficulty doing.

Of course, figuring out the reason they never fight is as easy as figuring out why most families DO fight...  Because they’re made up of individuals, and individuals will always have differences.  They’re going to have different tastes, different needs, different religious and political views(lord knows that’s true in my family) and wildly different personalities, and that's not even considering extreme examples involving abuse.  None of the characters in Papakiki feel like individuals.  They feel like basic archetypes.  They have nothing to fight about because they don’t have beliefs or personalities worth clashing over.  The only character who isn’t as bland as a bread sandwich is Yuuta’s love interest Raika, a delightfully eclectic oddball who I actually kind of like, and who should have probably gotten more screen time just so she could have spent less of it with the pedophile character.  It’s kind of a problem that she’s the girl Yuuta likes, but the narrative spends more time establishing his pairing with his 14 year old niece.

Every obstacle they face comes from an outside force, from eviction threats to a scuffed shoe(no, really) and it’s almost immediately resolved, at worst by the end of the episode it’s brought up in, which is infuriating for a show that is inherently built around a terrible idea.  Yuuta is not a suitable parent.  The series presents constant evidence of this fact, while never bringing up a good counter argument other than his tenacity and the girls wanting to stay with him.  The final episode acts like it’s about to take the situation seriously, but then swerves at the last moment, and just tries to TELL you everything’s gonna be okay despite all evidence to the contrary.  All of these factors together make Papakiki feel unnervingly artificial.  If your typical family drama feels over-stuffed with sugar, then this is basically that, but with Splenda. 

I don’t think you’re supposed to become invested in anyone’s struggle, anyone’s arc, or anyone’s journey.  Just like any ecchi harem anime, Yuuta is meant to be your bland self-insert character, and all the females around him are intended to be the viewer’s fantasy waifus.  This entire scenario feels like it was constructed specifically for the benefit of all the comments section weirdoes saying shit like “Oh man, I wish I was as lucky as him, oh the things I could do if those girls lived with me...”  And again, that’s how these shows normally work, but the fact that half the waifus are underaged AND the self insert character is their legal guardian, it just leaves this skin-crawling sensation that Papakiki must be really popular with the “Raising a daughter is the ultimate cuck” crowd.  That is a real thing, do not look it up.  In fact, treat it like the manga ending of Bunny Drop...  It doesn’t exist.

Listen to me Girls I Am Your Father is available from Senai Filmworks.  The original light novel series is not available stateside, nor are the six different one-shot mangas or the PSP game.  There are two OVA episodes, one of which is available on the stateside blu-ray. 

This show falls under the same umbrella as the Witchblade series as an anime that a lot of people claim is elevated by the portrayal of a strong, heartfelt family dynamic in the face of adversity, but that I ultimately found to be shallow, or in this case, also really insidious.  If you don’t see what I see, and you find this show to be an entirely innocent family dramady, like Full House with bathing scenes, if you will, I don’t want to sit here and tell you you’re wrong just because I strongly disagree with you.  If it works for you, and you find some sort of value in it, that’s fine, but for me?  When I see people online lusting after Yuuta’s nieces and wishing they had the 'opportunity' that he had, I don’t see the internet just being the internet, I see this show’s target audience.

    I Give Listen to Me Girls, I Am Your Father! a 2/10."

Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid is the third installment in the anime adaptation of Gatoh’s original series, with the first a lackluster Gonzo plot tracker, the second a raunchy but hilarious episodic comedy by Kyoani, and now the third, plot-based again but this time with the excellent art and music I’ve come to expect from Kyoto Animation. Three things need to be said before getting started: firstly, there does exist the fourth installment (FMP The Invisible Victory), released in 2018 by Xebec, but as I haven’t seen it, it won’t enter this discussion. Secondly, I’m writing this review after that of Fumoffu and before that of the first series, so expect some revision in the future. Finally, in the interest of saving space this review will actually forego my general approach to review writing (music, art, characters, and plot) for the first release – there’s a lot to say about this anime, and those additions will need to come in a later revision of this review.

If you’ve read my Fumoffu review it will be obvious that I have a love-hate relationship with this series. I’m not a big fan of many of the characters, as I find them either too irritating, too flat, or too stereotypical to be interesting. I’m hopelessly annoyed by the female MC, Chidori, for her endlessly archetypal tsundere tendencies. However, unlike some actually likeable tsunderes, Chidori has almost nothing actually redemptive about her in any of the first two series. She obviously is attracted to Sousuke (for good reason!) but values her normal life above everything else, almost to a ridiculous degree. She chooses to berate him rather than appreciate him, regardless of the number of times he saves her life, doing relatively little to accommodate his difficult shift from military to school life. Chidori refuses to accept that her unique power is accompanied with a stringent duty to protect herself and those around her, constantly accusing the very person who works tirelessly to keep her safe. I’m similarly frustrated with the villain of the series, Gauron, whose character exists solely in vague evilness and a refusal to die. Even midway through the very first series, it’s painfully obvious that Gauron lacks the depth that would really bring a level of intrigue to the story. He is your unkillable, power-hungry antagonist of so many archtypical fantasies. The other antagonists of The Second Raid are portrayed more as insane, senseless, controlled, but Gauron’s sheer two-dimensionality make him an unlikable but ultimately boring character.

On the other hand, you’ll also remember that I absolutely love the series’ MC, Sousuke. Mercenary from his childhood, Sousuke simply does not understand the concepts of failure, unloyalty, and disregard for duty. While Chidori remains amicable with Sousuke merely due to being attracted to him, Sousuke does not need such romantic connection to obsessively stand by her. His mission is enough, and he stops at nothing to uphold it. Why in the world would I appreciate such a seemingly flat, depth-less character? The answer is fairly simple – Sousuke is the opposite of the lackluster, wishy-washy, indecisive male protagonists seen in so many other KyoAni works and those from other studios. Sousuke has principles that he sticks to regardless of the cost, something that works out excellently for comedies such as Fumoffu but also surprisingly well in the seriousness of The Second Raid. Sousuke is the constant in a sea of variables, and is the face of good in a sea of mystery. He is the character you root for when all else seems hopless.

However, Sousuke alone isn’t enough to revive the series for me. The lackluster remaining characters, coupled with the excessive fanservice (this isn’t rated 18+ just for the violence) and lacking the sometimes-excellent humor of Fumoffu, would drive this show down to average or worse on my rating scale. The saving grace of The Second Raid comes in the intense and passionate character development that occurs in the MCs within the last few episodes, development that is almost completely missing in the first two installments. Let’s dive in.

As those who have watched the series recognize, the show doesn’t truly begin until episode 6, when Sousuke is ordered to cease duties as Chidori’s bodyguard. For the first time across the entire series, we see the faintest glimpse of a question in his head. Up until this point, his duty had always been his passion, but now, something within him sees a disconnect. But it’s quick and painless – stuffing those feelings aside, Sousuke recognizes that his duty has moved elsewhere. He packs up and departs immediately, just to be disparaged by his superior for his perceived, if even so slight, interest in protecting Chidori. The viewer sees the gears churn in Sousuke’s head. Why is it that his duty now seems to conflict with his morals? Why does he, someone who has killed so many others during his life as a mercenary, suddenly value the life of an individual who became his friend, how derogatory she may be? But duty is duty, and Sousuke pushes feelings to the side.

However, something similar is happening to his female counterpart. Chidori, outwardly gleeful that her one block to a normal life has vanished away, begins to feel some legitimate concern for his wellbeing. This concern first manifests in the typical tsundere romantic desire for a love now departed, but more quickly develops into something more tangible. She feels suddenly that she is being watched, surveyed from afar, and everything Sousuke stood for filters slowly back into her mind. In perhaps the first and only act of unselfishness that Chidori feels, she runs to his apartment just to find him gone, departed, vanished just how she desired. But rather than feeling relief, she feels fear, and finally arms herself as the Sousuke of the past so desired. Chidori – in the events that follow – is assaulted and left destitute, finally taking into her own hands the protection that she so disregarded in the past.

What, then, of Sousuke? The nagging feeling, of a loyalty that extends beyond duty, comes to a head in the poor teenager’s mind. The psychological horror of his failure – abandoning someone he cared about – pervades his psyche, leaving him to abandon his mission and walk, in a dazed confusion, through the streets of Hong Kong. It is only in the unlikely encounter with alcohol and a prostitute who looks oddly like his former charge, that Sousuke returns to his senses. But this time, something has changed. Sousuke realizes that while he can abandon his duty, his loyalty is absolute. He charges into Gauron’s stronghold, where the fabricated death of Chidori drives the solder into a inhuman frenzy. He returns to the battle, duty thrown to the wayside. Sousuke charges forward convicted by devotion alone, reuniting with Chidori and defeating the enemy – both physically and to his responsibility as a mercenary, demanding that his old bodyguard position be reinstated. Sousuke changes more in 7 episodes than he does in the entirety of the former series, and I can’t help but appreciate the sheer rawness through which it occurs.

So what else can I say? The Second Raid is an interesting series. The art is generally really good, the soundtrack (battle scenes included) is epic, and while the characters are generally frustrating and lackluster, the excellent character development in the MC cannot be disregarded. Yes, it is a mature series (and not exactly something I’d choose to watch for fun), and yes, it has its weak points, but I found myself appreciating Gatoh’s development much more in this installment than in the prior two. Sousuke alone is pretty much the reason why I’m (eventually) going to watch the fourth series, but I can’t help but admit that I have pretty high expectations following the end of this one."

It’s hard to deny, this was a pretty good season for anime. From my personal favorites of Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! and Dorohedoro to returning series like Haikyuu and My Hero Academia. Standing out amidst this crowd of new and returning anime was going to be difficult. With an acclaimed Manga at your back and a decent amount of fanfair though, you would think a series might have a chance. Sadly, that is not the case for Runway de Waratte. Even going so far as to say the odds were stacked against it from the start doesn’t really explain the trainwreck that is series. So what happened? Was it that this was only [Studio Ezo’la’s](https://anilist.co/studio/6218/Ezola) third production? It probably isn’t Director [Nobuyoshi Nagayama’s](https://anilist.co/staff/122942/Nobuyoshi-Nagayama) inexperience, this isn’t his first rodeo. Or does it go deeper, all the way to the source material? Let’s dive in and find out, shall we?

(Disclaimer: This review contains minor spoilers for Runway de Waratte. I am also working to make 50 the new ""average"". 70 is not an average score people. 70 is above average. You can also find individual episode write ups and comment on this review on my [Star Crossed blog](http://starcrossedanime.com/runway-de-waratte-anime-review-39-100/). Carry on.)

As always, I want to start off with the most obvious part of an anime, its Art and Animation. Sadly for Runway though, it starts to disappoint immediately. Both when viewed on its own and when compared to the manga, it’s just not that well made. To be fair, the art-style is mostly fine. Runway can be rather colorful and vibrant when it wants to be. In particular when it over-saturates a number of scenes, whether in a show or for effect, the show really pops. The issue though is that Runway is incredibly inconsistent on this front. Sometimes it appears rather pretty, while other times it just comes off as flat and dull. This wouldn’t really be an issue though if Runway didn’t rely so often on static frames. Depending on the viewer engagement on the scene to sort of hide any issues.

Comparing Runway to it’s mange doesn’t do it any favors either. I feel terrible for manga fans here, because this adaptation does not do it justice. Everything from the paneling to the faces to the detail on the clothes, especially the clothes, is forgotten. We need look no further than Kaoru’s show in the big finale of the season. As you can see above, the original paneling and detail work really sold the passion in her show. The passion in her concept, which of course augments her as a character, since its her work. But the anime just comes off as flat and lifeless. Undercutting her whole segment of the show. And while that doesn’t really affect my opinion on the anime’s production, it does leave me a tad disappointed. We will get into it more later, but it’s like Runway fails as an adaptation in every respect.

Meanwhile the animation is arguably non-existent. That’s a slight exaggeration of course, characters move and walk etc. But no one is ever going to point to Runway de Waratte as a “well animated” show. It won’t be winning any awards for reused walk cycles. Similar to the art, Runway'sanimation isn’t bad per-se. You just rarely see it, and when you do, like in the fashion shows, it’s not particularly impressive. One could argue that animation isn’t very important for a show like Runway, since it’s primarily about fashion and such. But I would argue that’s just a missed opportunity. Runway had a chance to really focus in on things like walking and character movement, but didn’t. We see this primarily with Chiyuki during her and Kokoro’s finale show. No amount of “telling” us she is walking differently will match “showing” us that is the case.

Next up we have the Direction, and it’s incredibly similar to the Animation of the series. Meaning that it’s dull at its best and indulgent at its worst. To show what I mean by that, let’s tackle each individually. As far dull goes, Runway seems to have an obsession with still and panning shots. As if its trying to use these to substitute for its utter lack of meaningful animation. Normally, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s not great, but it is a valid technique when you are on a budget. The issue though comes when Runway doesn’t know how to use them. Panning during what should be stills, stills doing what should be pans or zooms. When used intelligently, with well made still images, it can give the illusion of motion. But Runway rarely manages to achieve that.

Meanwhile, when I said indulgent, I was of course referring to the focus on women’s bodies. Now let me preface this with saying, it’s not all bad. Runway pulls this off well in a number of shots. The best one by far is early on in Ikuto’s first fashion show. Here Runway makes a point of being very blasé about it all. Showing the women full frontal, with tasteful covering based on the environment or hair. It really sells the lack of modesty required to do the job and how out of place Ikuto is. Runway did a great job here with this scene, and with almost every scene involving Chiyuki. She really is the golden child of this show, and I loved her. Though like I said, we will get to characters eventually.

Sadly though, even she is not immune to the poor treatment. You see while Runway did a great job with it before, it’s as if the series couldn’t resist the opportunity later on. Focusing in and holding long still shots of Chiyuki in various poses. Yes, they were stretches, and yes it’s a valid argument. But for me this was when Runway lost some of its footing. Because I find it difficult to reconcile how the series can take such a serious approach to it one moment and then undercut it the next. I have seen arguments of course that since it’s from Ikuto’s PoV that its fine, it’s just demonstrating his own personal desire. And those arguments are correct, Runway does manage to convey that. I am simply arguing that intended or not, I didn’t particularly enjoy it. Especially considering Chiyuki is my favorite character in the show.

With production out of the way, it’s time to talk about Runway’s story and narrative. On its surface, it’s a rather solid idea, a non-battle-battle-anime about fashion. Similar in a way to series like Shokugeki no Souma, with a greater focus on character drama and romance. Early on Runway pulls this off rather well, introducing two separate stories within the industry that follow two separate tracks. One exploring the modeling side through Chiyuki, someone discounted through no fault of her own by height. The other exploring the designer side through Ikuto, held back by circumstance rather than skill. These are both pretty solid ideas, and watching them both grow together through the story could have been great. The problem though is that Runway doesn’t seem to want to take the time to tell it. Rather Runway wants to take the fastest possible path to the highest levels of the industries.

We see this primarily in Ikuto. This is a character with no money and no time to really pursue his dream. He is held back by his circumstances. But rather than really address those on a character level and work through them, Runway just gives handouts to him. His dress goes viral on social media and he is immediately offered a job/to have it bought from him. This leads to what is basically an internship with a real designer, whom he immediately saves the show of. Which of course leads to being let in to a designer school as a highschooler. All the while Runway doesn’t really build up his skillset at all. It doesn’t take the time to introduce us to the technical side of fashion or any of the ins and outs of the industry. Instead Ikuto is just a golden boy who gets by on fiat.

Meanwhile the arcs themselves are terribly paced. The best example of this is the Fashion School “tournament” arc. I hesitate to say tournament, because there really isn’t any competition here. It started off fine enough, some good ideas, but then Runway immediately has Ikuto skip the 2nd round. Annihilating the underdog nature of the story. Then it proceeds to skip the entire 2nd round that Kokoro had to go through. Just ignoring any potential for development on her character and assuming she would make it through. All the while the prize at the end of this tournament is a trip to Paris of all places. Somehow, 1 cour in, our lead character is already knocking on the door to Paris. In what world is this good pacing? In what way is this compelling as our lead character is given one handout and stroke of luck after another?

What really makes it hurt though is that Runway has a good narrative in Chiyuki. It just ignores her. Every time we are given a Chiyuki arc, its great, and it only lasts for a single episode. Yet in that single episode we see her actively go out and search for work. Selling herself, her business cards, begging for jobs no matter how small. Paying her own money to make a portfolio and advertise her best features, glossing over her height. This is a compelling story, this is an active character, this is someone working towards their goal. It’s great stuff! And yet when she finally gets the Paris Runway just… skips over her entire week there. Relegating it to a single flashback before Ikuto comes in to offer her salvation in letting her model for his show. What Runway does to Chiyuki is criminal, and wastes all her potential.

Speaking of Chiyuki, it’s time to finally get to the characters, and oh boy. If you can’t guess what I am about to say, you haven’t been reading this review. Long story short, Chiyuki is fantastic and every time she is on screen is the best. But she is actively dragged down by the cinderblock tied around her legs named Ikuto. That really goes for everyone in Runway’s cast, but Chiyuki more than anyone else. This is an active, strong female character who could easily carry an entire show on her back. And if it wasn’t for Runway largely relegating her to support for Ikuto, she could have done it. She is assertive, understanding, driven and proud. She clearly loves the industry and has a clear personal investment in it ala her father. I want her story. But instead Runway gives me the wet noodle Mr.Perfect that is Ikuto.

I cannot stress how much I dislike Ikuto. It’s not his archetype or his story or anything like that. No, as an idea, he works. But Runway quickly drives that into the dirt by giving us a character with absolutely no moral or technical failings. This is a guy who learns on the job fast enough to save a fashion show. Who clears his way through tournaments with actual designer students and makes a trending dress. All with absolutely 0 technical training and only home-learned skills. This wouldn’t be so bad though if Runway actually managed to challenge Ikuto based on his previously mentioned circumstances. Yet the one time it manages to do that, by offering him money to help his mother in exchange for compromising his morals or his dream, Runway immediately undercuts it. In a single episode the problem is introduced and resolved. With no effort from Ikuto.

This is a character who gets almost no development and instead exists purely to have a male lead. It’s a shame to, because his interplay with Chiyuki at the beginning was great. Standing up for his dream, making her a dress, etc. It’s just the moment it came time for Runway to start progressing him he… stalled. This wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t the MC though and didn’t actively bring down other characters around him. Characters like Chiyuki, relegated to supporting waifu, or Kokoro, to supporting harem member #2. If Runway had just slowed itself down and given us more time before throwing him into the deep end we wouldn’t have this problem. Let us spend time with his family, show rather than tell us about his financial troubles, etc. All I see when I look at Ikuto, and most of Runway's cast, is wasted potential.

Next we have what is probably the most “alright” part of Runway, the OST and sound design. Now sadly, as of writing this review, Runway de Waratte’s OST is not publically available. So linking to songs or getting specific tracks names like I usually do is rather difficult, but I will try my best. That said, there never a particularly… memorable track for me from Runway. Of you have the fashion shows and such, those are probably the best examples. But at least as far as my taste goes they mostly came off as poppy set piece stuff. Things to fill space rather than because they have any actual meaning or connection to the event. Set dressing, basically. And while that’s fine, it's not very impressive, and it’s not an OST I would ever purchase or listen to outside of the series.

Music out of the way, we get to everything else, and this is actually incredibly difficult to write. Not because I don’t have words, i’m a wordy bastard and this is nearing 3,000 of them. But rather because I can’t think of any particular scene or moment that sticks itself in my mind. Maybe I could point to the sound of heels on the runway being memorable. Or [Yumiri Hanamori’s](https://anilist.co/staff/116543/Yumiri-Hanamori) performance as Chiyuki, who was once again the best character in the show. But the fact is, at the end of the day, I won’t be remembering Runway for it’s sound effects. It’s not memorably bad, making you want to plug your ears like Berserk’s CLANG. Nor is it memorable or haunting like Neon Genesis Evangelion’s Eva Units. They are simply there, existing. And you know what? Maybe that’s alright.

Finally we come to the section where I try to reason out exactly why Runway failed. And from everything I can see, the issue inherently lies in the pacing. Runway adapted about 70, give or take 2-3, or so chapters of the manga. That is enough content for 24 episodes, a 2 cour series, shoved into a single cour worth of episodes. The last 3 episodes alone adapted about 12-15 chapters worth of content just on their own. To put this in perspective, most adaptations do about 2-3 chapters per episode, sometimes more and sometimes less based on content. And while Runway tries to stick to this, often failing, it definitely isn’t adapting the 6 chapters per episode that would be required for this amount of content. So the question then becomes, where did that content go? Because it definitely wasn’t in the anime.

Now good chunks of it were without a doubt skipped, which is bad enough. A series like Runway lives and dies by its characters. So skipping over development for some of them, taking away our time with these characters, really hurts their stories. At the same time though, some issues are still present in the source material. Issues such as skipping over the entirety of Kokoro’s 2nd round in the tournament, which could have been a big moment for her. Or skipping over 95% of Chiyuki’s time in Paris, which once again could have been big for her as a character. For both we only see the after-effects through Ikuto. You could argue as the MC, that is his purpose, but I would argue that’s an excuse, not a reason. What I am trying to say is, while the manga is better by far, it’s not flawless. And it shows.

So all in all, how was Runway de Waratte? In my humble opinion, and I can already feel the downvotes, it’s a complete disappointment. Runway started strong, with a good premise and Chiyuki is a fantastic character. But as the series continued it started to fall apart in every way. The pacing was terrible, Ikuto got handed everything and was never truly challenged, and it couldn’t even run a tournament arc. There is a lot of promise here, there is no denying that. But Runway, as an anime at least, fails to live up to it. It failed to get me invested in an industry I had no prior knowledge or interest in. It failed to make the subject interesting, focusing on half-baked character drama rather than the jobs themselves. As a stand alone anime, Runway de Waratte is mediocre, and as an adaptation it fails miserably. Read the manga."
5909,"Anime is full of grand adventures, epic tales and profound stories. It has the ability to take you to a completely different world. Yet, sometimes I just can’t be bothered with that. Sometimes all I want is to turn my brain off and laugh at some goofy people goofing off and being stupid. Seitokai no Ichizon is the perfect anime to lay back, relax and chill out to—it’s cosy, silly and light-hearted, and, honestly, I just can’t get enough of it.

In the very first scene of the first episode, “Understanding the differences in media” is written on the whiteboard. The characters joke about how they can make the anime more appealing than the light novel, with some self-deprecating jokes along with it. Out of curiosity, I decided to actually investigate the differences in media by reading the first volume of the light novel. While the light novel definitely has its appeal—one that’s slightly different from the anime—I think the anime’s funnier. The ‘difference in media’ I observed was the sheer power of visual comedy, voice acting and comedic timing. The anime breathes life into the interactions by adding so much energy and liveliness that’s only really possible in an audiovisual medium. On top of that, I noticed how the plot was shifted around a bit. Rather than adapting the story one-to-one, they took bits and pieces and mixed them with others, with different contexts, to make it flow a little better. So, I have to say, the anime and light novel did help me understand the differences in media. Thanks for bringing it up, President!

One of the big reasons I decided to watch this was that it’s a 2000s anime. I realised that I hadn’t watched many older anime and wanted to broaden my horizons by branching in that direction. Now, it’s very clear from the art-style that it’s an older anime, but I don’t mean that in a bad way. Older anime have a certain appeal to them that’s hard to describe. Although I’d say animation quality has improved over the years—especially in action scenes—I might prefer the character designs and style of 2000s anime. For the record, that’s not nostalgia speaking. I was a little poopy baby boy when the anime came out so I can’t say “those were the good ol’ days”. Well, peeing all around the house probably was the good old days, but that’s not the point. Despite not having experienced anime in the 2000s, there’s a particular charm to them, similar to that of a childhood summer. With the art-style and general ‘vibes’, the anime radiates that feeling and makes it so incredibly endearing.

The anime revolves around the main character, Sugisaki, and four other girls that he wants in his harem. Every episode consists of them sitting in the student council room talking, chatting, goofing off, wasting time, erm… that’s about it…? It’s as close to a sit-com you’ll get in anime (I think? I’ve never actually watched a sit-com). Slice of Life is one of my favourite genres, so I love this kind of dynamic, but I’d imagine a lot of people would be put off by this. Moreover, there really isn’t much conflict at all. Stories normally centre around conflict, so without it you’d think it would just be boring. But, slice of life seems to be the exception, for some reason. This anime is stress-free and never takes itself seriously, which is nice every now and then.

One of the funniest things about it is how self-conscious it is. It might even be the most self-conscious anime I’ve ever watched. I mean, even in the very first scene that I mentioned before, one of the characters read a review that says ‘the story’s the same and nothing goes on’, taking a dig at itself. Not only that but it’s pretty much a parody of harems. It realises how silly the idea of a harem is, so it doesn’t take it seriously at all. It’s so goofy and ridiculous that it sometimes feels like a parody of anime itself. It knows exactly what it is and doesn’t try to be anything it isn’t. Something I noticed around half-way through was that they change the lyrics to the ending each time. And each time, it’s complete gibberish. Utterly random and super silly. In episode 11, the ending is the President mouthing off about how great she is and how you must vote for her for the whole ending. Sometimes the ending has the voice actors laughing at themselves, forgetting the lyrics or singing out of sync, and they kept all of that in. Now, I don’t know about you, but I think the voice actors had a lot of fun with this anime.

Something that stands out is the references. I know Gintama is supposed to have a bunch, but I haven’t seen it yet, so this anime probably has the most I’ve seen in an anime. It mentions Naruto, Gurren Lagann (even kind of spoils it), Haruhi, Index, Fullmetal Alchemist and even freaking Metal Gear Solid. I can’t remember if it was in the anime or light novel, but one of the lines is, “Don’t speak until Hunter x Hunter is finished!”. If Sugisaki took a vow of silence and became a monk to obey that, he still wouldn’t be able to speak (please finish HxH, Togashi, I’m begging). Also, they reference the light novel’s publishing company a bunch. They go so off the rails with the references that they often have to censor themselves to avoid copyright, which, in itself, is pretty funny.
What’s more, the anime breaks the 4th wall more than any anime I’ve seen too. The first scene I described is one example of that. But throughout they constantly say how Mafuyu’s characterization is being ruined by her BL love, or how Minatsu being good at math doesn’t fit her character, or how having a meeting about what to do with student absences is too basic and wouldn’t be fun for the viewers to watch. It takes all the rules about immersion and throws them out the window for the hell of it.

Now, in terms of the actual comedy, it is hilarious. The skits and gags are utterly absurd and it never takes itself seriously. It’s fast-paced with ridiculous situations, great one-liners and goofy slapstick. It’s not necessarily adult comedy, but definitely not pee poo childish humour either. The lack of emphasis on immersion and realism allows them to do the most nonsensical and stupid things. The bread and butter of the comedy is the straight man, funny man act, where one character will say something stupid and the other will retort, addressing how little sense it made. But the characters aren’t type casted into either role—it usually changes to fit the situation. Anime usually has a ‘comfy’ type of comedy as opposed to other media, for me at least. Though Seitokai no Ichizon made me laugh out loud time and time again.

The characters themselves are quirky and hilarious. Each with their own unique qualities and flaws, such that you can simply put them in a room together and it’ll be hilarious no matter what they do. Despite lightly fitting into certain character archetypes, they each have plenty of aspects that distinguish themselves from that and make them lovable by their own merit. The anime drops us in with them already being friends, so they’re close to each other from the beginning. This lends to the comedy involving each character teasing or making fun of the others a lot of the time, which is possible because of how quirky and goofy they inherently are. It reminds me of a bunch of teenagers messing around and mouthing off to each other, which is what they actually are. But it really does capture that youthful dynamic of being so rude and horrible to each other, in a loving way. They can only do that because of how close they are.

Despite how much they tease and poke fun at each other, the anime makes it clear how much they genuinely value their friendship. They truly cherish the time they have together and the safe space they’ve created in the student council. And whenever necessary, they stand up for each other and have each other’s backs. As cheesy as it is, that’s a true friendship being portrayed.
Comedy is such a powerful tool, especially with how it can contrast seriousness. Don’t get me wrong, it’s mostly jokes—the author even said it’s “90% jokes and less than 10% serious”—but there are a few moments where it strips back the goofiness and has some thought-provoking scenes. There’s a scene where they’re in Tokyo and watch the sunset silently together, and somehow it’s really beautiful. A few scenes like that are scattered here and there, and although they’re not what stands out in the show, they’re rather impactful because of how rare they are.

It’s hard to really criticise a show that doesn’t take itself too seriously. I would’ve said that the interaction between the girls was lacking, but then there was an episode when Sugisaki got sick and it was just them, and they held out together great without him. I suppose it could be lacking some climactic and memorable moments, but I’m not too hung up on that.
Overall, it’s so lovable, silly, hilarious and has some great moments shining through. I’m looking forward to season 2 of this, which is hopefully just as good. 9/10."
162803,"Wow is it trying to make a tradition? Just like season 1, it has an absolutely amazing intro alongside a god awful outro. Seriously, the song is great (go check it out, it's called ""Scrap Art"") and I love how we see each faction/group of characters walk towards the camera towards the start and then each group from the other side pat death god on the head at the end, that is so dope. 
Anyways. Read the title. It's season 1, but better. Seriously, it's that simple, all the things I feel season 1 did better than the manga, season 2 does better than season 1. 

Let's start by talking about pacing and tone, which I feel is what distinguishes the anime most from the manga (from what I've read of the manga). But first, we have to give a quick look at season 2's predecessors. The manga (in my opinion) constantly breaks up the pacing by talking about necessary details and continuously changing perspective and tone, which stops the story from feeling fluid and wastes SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH TIME on random unfunny jokes. The first season of the anime cuts on a lot of the random stuff that doesn't really lead anywhere, but keeps a lot of the joke scenes (which I didn't really find all that funny). Season 2 on the other hand, barely has any necessary stuff and instead of having comedy moments shoe-horned into serious scenes, gives us proper dedicated comedy scenes (and characters (who I adore and will come back to later)), meaning that the tone is now a lot more consistent, but also that the show is a lot more fluid since it doesn't have this weird stop-and-go pace from all the jokes breaking it up.

The characters are also a huge step up from season 1, which is mostly due to the characters already being mostly set and some of the more uninteresting characters being thrown to the sidelines. So while we get a lot less of Lemmings, Lisa, Takumi and Polka (and his family), a lot more time is given to characters who are either a lot more interesting or enjoyable like Sayo (I fucking love shark jokes), Gentle Criminal Phantom Solitaire (my beloved), Civil and her gang, the Fire Breathing Bug(s) and every single character from Polka's original world. We also see Corpse God get a lot more involved (emotionally) in the plot which is massively more interesting than him just repeating ""I just want a peaceful life"". The voice actors also did a great job, especially my beloved (Solitaire), Fire Bug (they use 12 different VAs and I love it), Civil, Lulu and Misaki (who I feel was a lot more lively this season). 

So characters are also better than S1, but what about the story? Well I think it's obvious enough considering the title I gave this review, it's better. Everything this season feels like it has a point, unlike last season where some parts (fake fire bug and Hosorogi) felt kind of pointless, though this could very easily be attributed an overarching story pretty much not existing until the last few episodes of the last season, I still feel this season was a huge step up. Apart from 1 character's presence (Arahabaki) feeling kind of redundant and another feeling underdeveloped so far (Majiri) (though this one can definitely be attributed to her introduction being midway through the season), this story feels really good to watch, it's unique (especially all the other side stuff), has a bunch of cool moments and even if the last few episodes feel a bit rushed, I think that isn't an issue considering the fact it allows the story as a whole to fit perfectly within the constraint of a season (honestly, if you told me the manga's story ended where season 2 ended, I would've believed you). 

The animation also feels like a step up, last season had good visuals, but not that many amazing ones with the only scene that massively stood out to me visually at the time being the Lemmings fight in the bar, where as, here, there are so many more dope unique visuals related to magic. Seriously, every time we get to see new magic, we also get to see new, dope visuals, which I'm all for, that is without taking into account Misaki and Xiaoyu's new abilities (and visuals that come alongside them)! We also get some more high speed combat scenes which look quite good, as always.

So yeah: Pacing's better; Jokes are better; Characters (old and new) all feel a lot more interesting; Story's more involving; Animation's better. What's not to love? 
Very high 7. Would've been a low or mid 8 if it had a bit more music variety.

109403,"Feeling of pure and unadulterated comfiness. One that is not achieved by many anime series.


The third season of the Non Non Biyori series, Nonstop, has yet again proved that Slice of Life as a genre is a certified kino. Our favourite cast of characters returns to bring us even more positive vibes, and does it in a perfect, colorful way.

img520()


Plot-wise, it is still the same good old Non Non Biyori. This time, the anime focuses on all the characters equally, and even adds two new members to the cast - Akane Shinoda, a very shy girl who is a member of Konomi's highschool flute club, and Shiori, a newly moved-in little girl who befriends Renge on her way home. 
Introduction of Akane's character brought out Konomi's values as the ""everyone's older sister"" and lead to some hillarious interactions with the main four and Akane herself, while Shiori's character gives us one of the best dialogues and moments in the entire series, when she meets and makes friends with Renge. 
Renge's older sister Hikage is given much more focus this time, with anime showcasing her friendship with Natsumi, their shenanigans and school problems, as well as her relationship with the rest of the group.
Obviously, the anime didn't forget about the main four goofs of the village, and the scenes with them are only enriched by the extended cast.

Comedic moments in the series, as always, land and hit you like a truck. The classic awkward silences and pauses, something NNB as a series is well-known for, voice actors' delivery and visuals, make every interaction and gag 10 times funnier. (not much of Nii-chan, sadly. Truly the GOAT of the series).

Exhibit A

Visually, the anime is stunning. All of the background arts are beautifully done, with vibrant colors pleasingly flowing through the screen. I mean look at that.

As for the music, again a bag full of comfy, soft tunes that fit the tranquil atmosphere of the show. Opening song, performed by nano.RIPE (like always), is actually my favourite out of the three, and the same can be said about the ending, which is performed by the main four's voice actors. 


Non Non Biyori is a great, great series. It has brought me much joy over the years, and I am happy that we live in a time where shows like this air. Aside from the comfiness value, the show portrays a very specific and relatable image of what childhood to most of kids was like, finding the beauty and fun in small things, being driven by imagination, and sprinkling us with the nostalgia that hits right in the heart."
155418,"The Great Cleric is a story about a salaryman in modern Japan who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. He was caught in the line of fire and died instantly. Of course, the story did not end there as he was reincarnated into another world where magic prosper. Given a second chance to live out his life as he wished, he opted for a career of a healer, but soon learned that being a healer in this new world is not a very welcoming job.

Honestly, this anime actually had a very promising storyline where the main protagonist, Luciel, attempted to challenge the corruption of healers in this world. The story showed how Luciel became a very strong healer and was able to earn the favour of many people, such as the adventurers who had a great disdain against healers, and the presiding pope of the church he was transferred to. I would not mind watching such show if only the protagonist was written in a much better light.

It was never implied what his age was when he died. However, based on the little flashbacks and small background information Luciel provided, I would have to surmise that he was probably in his mid to late twenties. Given how he was able to identify a ""business smile"" and a genuine smile also points to the many work experiences he had when dealing with clients and his own colleagues and bosses. What I am trying to say here is that there should be some level of maturity and intelligence to his character as Luciel as he was reincarnated and got to keep his memories in the new world.

However, after starting his new life as Luciel in the new world, it felt as though I am watching a kid in a teenager body trying to navigate his way around. I get it, he has no idea what this world is, what the norms are and stuff, but I feel all those are easily resolvable if he asked the healer guild whether there is a library he could go to to read up on the world. I mean, being called ""ignorant"" is kind of the hint here, isn't it? It feels as though he forgot that he was reincarnated into a 18 year old body instead of an 8 year old kid. People tend to be more forgiving if it were an 8 year old child telling you that they have no idea what is happening in the world. But for a 18 year old? It's understandable for people to scorn at him for being ignorant.

(Picture Source: Anime Feminist thru' Google Image Search)

While the show is great to watch, as in seeing Luciel slowly become stronger and deal with the corruption, it is honestly quite a pain to watch it. Luciel never showed any character development such as maturing as the years goes by. He just continued with his old ways which is honestly stupidity in general. Not really a show I would recommend, sadly."

The soundtrack was beautiful with it blending traditional Japanese music with that classic starwars sound everyone knows. Stunning visuals that are unique with every episode due to letting multiple studious making each story. You can either watch this in dub or sub they put a ton of effort into both so its amazing either way. I'm glad disney decided to do this and i hope they continue with this trend of pushing starwars to new heights.

I urge any anime fan even those that have never seen starwars to check this out and starwars fans that have never seen anime to also check this out. All of these stories take little to no prior knowledge of starwars lore to understand. There will be at least one story you will find interest in. These stories are meant for people that like anime but have never got into starwars to enjoy and vice versa, people that only like starwars and never got into anime can enjoy this too. It is a great blend of two things I enjoy and I hope this brings new anime and starwars fans alike. 


The Duel 
This is the most unique when it comes to animation. It has an old traditional samurai feel to it like Seven Samurai which was an inspiration for George Lucas when making starwars.! I really like the mysterious vibe the main character has. We don't really know what his deal is, he is a wondering samurai with a red lightsaber. Is he sith or is he more of a grey jedi? He is helping people out and being selfless which is not what a sith would do at all. I personally think he was trained by a sith that separated himself from the dark side and taught our main character the ways of the force. Now he just aimlessly wonders around looking to test his power by dueling dark side users.

Dystopian literature repeatedly falls under a common misconception deriving from the thematic statements it brings forth. They have a tendency to function as an analogy for similar issues in the modern world, gravitating towards the principles of social and political structures. Characters are the prime driving force representing a counter-culture movement. At face value, the motifs presented are capable of heedlessly altering the narrative into a convoluted disarray. Merging conflicting elements are bound to overwhelm one another without a cohesive outline. It is a conventional fault for a number of media, not apprehending the fact that more precarious concepts require even greater implementations. Casshern Sins acknowledges the aforementioned in a straightforward yet refined manner. An unorthodox approach so congruous and self-effacing with minute precision; perhaps a metaphysical exploration of the human condition[.](https://www.amazon.ca/Sto-ology-Metaphysical-Exploration-Human-Condition-ebook/dp/B00L6MFTC0/ref=sr11?dchild=1&keywords=Sto-ology%3A+A+Metaphysical+Exploration+of+the+Human+Condition&qid=1630344191&s=digital-text&sr=1-1) There is a cunning and stylistic flare inclined to its commentary that I have never experienced in the medium to date. Concise and pragmatic in regard to the notions it brings about, drawing inspiration from the adage [""Death is not the opposite of life but an innate part of it.""](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/719384-death-is-not-the-opposite-of-life-but-an-innate) The inanimate classifications expressed has been a gold standard throughout the program's brief runtime. Stemming from the previously mentioned compositions, Madhouse's Casshern Sins unveils a melancholic inquiry of self-worth and the morality of life. A transcendent depiction of the inevitable decline humankind faces coming forth. 



Suffering from financial difficulties in the late zeros, the industrial monopoly known as Madhouse continued to produce a great deal of ambitious projects. A majority of them were a gamble on their part including Casshern Sins, a reboot of the 1973 anime series Neo Human Casshan. The franchise has beforehand inspired a live-action film in 2004 and a 1993 OVA Casshan: Robot Hunter by studio Artmic, unfortunately the latest installment was unable to meet the sufficient revenue intended. Considering that the reboot turned out to be a setback for the studio at the time, it was not a commercial hit and gradually went under the radar. It is dissatisfying to see how the broadcast did not get the recognition it deserved, bearing in mind the profundity displayed.

The strategic vision of the directorial staff was a commendable undertaking, reason being the modifications and groundwork implemented were crafted to near perfection. A dismal ambience had been upheld and expressive craftsmanship encapsulated in the visual arrangements. [Wada Kaoru](https://anilist.co/staff/100112/Wada-Kaoru)'s score can be considered the most pretentious component in the production, arranging a mix of symphonic blues and acoustic guitars accompanied by melodious piano notes. Audio placement was done meticulously, providing nuance to the tropes and illustrations put forth. The animation quality doesn't exactly stand up to modern standards; the director's exposure to the industry being a key factor as to why. A smart move nonetheless, seeing that ostentatious effects and streamlined morphing could potentially contradict the overall allure at hand. There had been an appreciable amount of forethought put into the environment as well, distinguishable from the desolate landscapes. Backgrounds were formulated with an assemblage of somber and more duskier colorations, more specifically anything on the spectrum of grey. It really captures the character aesthetics in a visually arresting way. The presentation all together gave the impression that life was draining from the very depth of earth itself, correlating to the subject matter before our eyes.



 


Logically speaking, a decaying wasteland engulfed in rust and atmospheric corrosion typically dismisses any indication of life towards audiences. The seamless nonstandard method Casshern Sins conveys its concepts is ingenious on all accounts. Casshern, an invulnerable cyborg, endeavours to find moral justifications in a world he destroyed. Episodic adventures steadily unravel a tale of epitomized loss, conviction, desire and redemption. A comprehensive introspection in relation to his character through cognition. He seeks to understand the significance of life through the existence of death. The dispirited cries from passing machines enlarge on how endearing and treasured the course of life really is. There are numerous ways one can explicate the matters presented, considering that the script left many situations for viewers to interpret. Embodying several unpretentious themes, the philosophical scope exhibited is able to feel quite excessive every so often. One can argue it focuses more on the thematics than the encompassing narrative, however all things considered they both bring together a balanced conclusion. 

The leading premise undeniably takes inspiration from dualistic cosmology, putting emphasis on how contrary forces may actually be complementary and interconnected to one another. It interrelates perfectly with the phrase “Ruin is the salvation of man and machine.” Perhaps ruination exists as the sole means of escape for the immortal. To treasure one's life, there must be a limited shortage placed. The concept pertaining to appreciation cannot occur if something was infinite. A key exemplar in relation to how balance will always be attained, even in an asymmetrical universe. Casshern Sins demonstrates that only in view of death can the value of life truly be discovered."

Sing a Bit of Harmony may be chock full of cheesy songs and second-hand embarrassment, but its message is good. If you go into it with the same expectations you would for a Disney musical, you won’t be too disappointed. The characters are well written, the soundtrack and animation are good, and the plot, despite being cliche, is cute. 7/10 from me.

The characters were pretty relatable. They’re high school students whose parents work for a big tech company and they’re all pretty mortified whenever Shion breaks into song. There’s diversity among their personalities and I liked the character dynamics and chemistry between everyone. Their relationships are more than just “friends” and “lovers” and “childhood friends.” I appreciated how you came to a fuller understanding of their dynamics as the movie went on, and as the plot progressed, how those dynamics changed. They played their parts well, so I don’t have any big complaints as far as characters are concerned.

I went back and forth between liking the  music and not liking it. I watched it dubbed so that might affect my review slightly, but overall I found the songs Shion sings to be very cliche. The lyrics sound like something out of a Barbie Princess movie, perhaps, or maybe “Twist Your From Upside Down” from Teen Beach Movie 2. It felt a bit like they were hitting a nail with a thick textbook rather than a hammer; yes, this movie is about friendship, we get it, you don’t need to start singing every twenty minutes about it. The soundtrack, on the other hand, I really enjoyed. It’s not the best music I’ve ever heard, and maybe even a little disappointing for a music anime, but overall I thought it was pretty good.
!ok one spoiler but that's just because I thought it was hilarious how, despite the title, they don't ever sing harmony in this show!

The animation was better than I expected. I didn’t have particularly high expectations for the animation, but it was still pretty good. It was clean, and the CGI was good, but they did reuse a lot of shots throughout the movie.

As for the plot, I liked it well enough. I can’t say I’m a huge fan of AI stories to begin with, but for what it was, I enjoyed it. Some plot devices seemed a little clunky, some tropes were definitely cliche, and some actions by the characters didn’t entirely seem to fit with their personalities, but it was generally pretty cute. The plot is what felt the most like a Disney musical to me, with everything working out well in the end, everything tied up with a neat bow, but that isn’t inherently bad; that’s just what Disney does well, and this reminded me of it. The second-hand embarrassment, though, was pretty bad. Not quite as bad as Miraculous Ladybug, but I definitely cringed a few times throughout the movie, and that is part of why I didn’t enjoy the movie as much as I could have. However, I do recognize that it would be hard to execute this movie without any second-hand embarrassment while keeping the premise, so I don’t guess I can dock too many points for that.

So, would I watch this movie again? As someone who can hardly stand any amount of second-hand embarrassment, probably not—but, I can certainly see how others would enjoy this movie more than me. On the flip side, I can see how others might hate this movie. I guess it sort of depends on your opinion of Disney musicals and Barbie Princess movies. However, as far as “do your best, forget the rest, give it all you’ve got” goes, I don’t think this is the best JC Staff could have done. There’s not one single weak element, but none of them are particularly strong either. All in all, Sing a Bit of Harmony is a cute, feel-good movie for your inner child unless your inner child hates second-hand embarrassment.

edit: I originally scored this a 7/10, but somewhere along the line it changed to 6.1/10. do with this information what you will."
369,"Boogiepop Phantom is a Madhouse adaptation of the Boogiepop novel series by [Kouhei Kadono](https://anilist.co/staff/97933/Kouhei-Kadono). This adaptation was made in 2000 and nearly twenty years later, Boogiepop is getting yet another adaptation in 2019.
 
...This review is of course centered on the original, and most likely in the future can and will be compared to the inevitable review I end up doing on Boogiepop 2019. No matter how it turns out.
 
It should of course be noted that I went into Boogiepop Phantom with no actual knowledge of the novels and etc. So... this entire review was written without me knowing that for one, the entire events of this series is actually like a sequel to the first Boogiepop novel. In addition, Boogiepop 2019 is apparently going to be an outright adaptation of at least that novel.
 


 

 
Jumping right into it, Boogiepop Phantom 2000 is perhaps one of the bleakest anime series I've ever watched. The atmosphere and the purposeful darkness that the entire series is wrapped up in honestly almost feels suffocating at multiple points of the show. Like you look at some of the other shows tagged under horror and it's... it's almost depressing. There's just not a single iota of genuinely effective creepy or dark atmosphere in [these](https://anilist.co/anime/99531/Devils-Line/) [series](https://anilist.co/anime/100010/MAGICAL-GIRL-SITE/).
 
And that's if they even try [at](https://anilist.co/anime/99698/Kings-Game/) [all.](https://anilist.co/anime/100226/EVIL-OR-LIVE/)

So when I watched Boogiepop, all at once it felt as if somebody just suddenly kicked me in the fucking face.
 
""The reduced brightness and sepia color palette for most of the episodes, added to the anxieties and depressions of the characters, were designed to make the series play like a psychological horror. Production staff later commented that the color scheme was more effective than they had originally intended, and were surprised by how bleak the series turned out.""
 
img440()
 
I think Boogiepop 2000 is a very rare case for me in that I probably love the structure and the look of the show probably way more than the actual stories and characters it presents. Granted I like those too, but I'm not sure if I would as much if it wasn't for the presentation which I think I would go as far to call almost perfect.
 
  
 
...While I definitely want to know more and/or read the original novels, I kind of simultaneously don't? I don't know if that makes any sense but like... the point where I realized I absolutely loved this show is episode two. Like it immediately starts out with Boogiepop chasing a guy in the darkness, and the guy seemingly eventually gets away, and he finds this weird looking bug. He starts laughing, his hand starts shaking, and he compulsively starts devouring this weird gross looking insect.
 
   
 
Then, in a flashback, it's shown that he's just been going around and getting spiders from girls' chests and just compulsively eating them. That's weird, actually kind of disturbing, gross, and there's actual reasons for it. Because it turns out that there's another character that appears throughout the entire series that just spreads butterflies of light which show people their memories when they come into contact with them.
 
 
 
And yet there's also this guy who's like eating these disgusting fucking spiders, is in actuality consuming these girls' bad memories. Like there are just so many of these sorts of these things throughout this show that I just really love and probably should actively want to know like more about how they fit into this world because there are still some threads or questions I don't really know the answers to.
 
Like one of these earlier episodes, there's like this drug that more or less just makes the people who take it horribly dependent on it but also eventually drives them completely batshit insane.
 
img440()
 
And for the rest of the show in the back of my mind, I was wondering what happened to that or how did that fit into the rest of it? Because that episode where this guy who becomes rapidly more addicted to it to the point where he can't distinguish reality from his dating sim game leading him to become horribly creepy was amazing and disturbing.
 
    
 
This entire goddamned show I found myself thinking ""where is all of this going"" and actually NOT in a frustrating way. Like I was absolutely riveted throughout most of the episodes. Where is this going? Why is this seemingly exact same conversation between these two cops happening over and over again?
 
img440()
 
What about this serial killer in the news? What's with this odd smiling girl with these butterflies made of light? What the hell even IS Boogiepop??? What are they even doing or where are they taking these people that they're claiming to be saving???
 
  
 


 
img440()
 
I honestly can't think of the last series off the top of my head where I departed it with this many questions but also overwhelmingly enjoyed the experience of watching it.
 
I mean genuinely, the series does provide a conclusion to several of the threads that it mainly focuses on but I still have so many questions and partially really am interested in finding out more about the world of Boogiepop, whether it's through the new 2019 anime which I hope for the love of god is more than ""just a remake"", or through the original novels which will soon be released in English...
 
img440()
 
But the original Boogiepop Phantom 2000 is absolutely a must watch if you're looking for a horror anime. Like an actual creepy, dark and dirty, get under your skin, HORROR ANIME.
 
   
 
Obviously, I do think that the horribly bleak and dark tone and look of the show isn't for everyone, but personally, I just ate it the fuck up. I'm not gonna hate Boogiepop 2019 if it goes outright in a completely different direction as long as it manages to be good while doing so, but I do really hope it doesn't outright drop the more horror stuff that is just... EVERYWHERE in the original.
 
A 9.5 out of 10 or 95 out of 100. As I said previously, it’s almost perfect in my eyes."

""4 years later, they meet again"". 

The final chapter that quite a lot seem to ignore just because it's all words and doesn't have all those cool fights or ""GREAT ANIMATION"". This is untrue, by the way. Because the movie is definitely well-animated, especially considering the fact that it's just about a conversation between two characters.
Just like the beginning of the story (i.e., the beginning of part 2), Mikiya walks with his umbrella under snowy weather only to get a glimpse of the same person he met 4 years ago, 「Shiki」.
Shiki's true identity has been explained in three different archetypes in this film: Shiki as a body, Shiki as a psyche, and Shiki as a soul. As she argues, this 「Shiki」 we see here is the soul, an empty soul.


The entire film reminisces on many events from previous films, such as the similarities between Shiki and Fujino which Shiki stated in part 3, the concept of the Soul and its origin which is the central concept in part 5, and finally answering my personal question about the consequences of not forgiving Shiki. What also pleasantly surprised me was the subtle similarities between Mikiya and Shiki, that Mikiya fell in love with Shiki, because of how similar his normalcy is to her abnormality.

img330()

Expects nothing and receives nothing, neither looks into the future nor regrets the past, never hurting anyone nor yourself. That is the normal person he is. There's a tiny line between Mikiya's nature of life (as in to live in the present) and 「Shiki's」 origins (from the nothingness), and it's a bit lovely that these two characters, each on the other side of this boundary, were able to fall in love with each other.
This film feels more like an epilogue than a typical film because it is highly filled with dialogue, with animation and music only providing enough support to make the most of the least so as to not make it a drag to watch, although this will undoubtedly be the case for many. The peaceful and languid tempo contrasts sharply with the preceding parts' blood and gore; one could even call this an artsy entry to the franchise rather than a commercial movie. Though I do agree reading this entry in the novel works better as it is full of words, by no means this film is an abomination. Only people who think that good fights = good animation will get to that conclusion.



This is definitely a great addition (and the true conclusion I would argue) to the franchise. However,
If you're enjoyability factors are just cool animation and fights, then you will not like this film, or even hate this film for that matter.
If you are more interested in the characters, however, then this will be a beautiful movie to watch on a winter night.

Fun Fact: The voice actors for Shiki ([Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/Maaya-Sakamoto)) and Mikiya ([Kenichi Suzumura](https://anilist.co/staff/95005/Kenichi-Suzumura)) were married, 6 months after this film debuted. I don't know, I just found it cute."
9734,"This OVA is about Hōkago Tea Time planning for the overseas trip they take in the movie.  The focus on this leaves the episode a tad light on comedy, but it’s still K-On! at heart.


Released roughly a month after the K-On! Movie was announced, Keikaku! could be seen as a prequel episode for it.  It didn’t need to be an episode, but this is K-On!, so a simple story isn’t really an issue.  Not much happens, not just because it’s K-On!, but because the setup of “planning an overseas trip” is actually what this is about rather than being the backdrop for a bunch of goofy moments with the Keion-bu.  There’s still goofing around to be had of course, but with what is effectively an actual plot focus that lacks drama it leaves less than K-On’s optimal amount of room for tomfoolery.  Like a fair amount of K-On!’s 2nd season, it’s more mundane than it needs to be.

img600()
While practicing self-defense is a good idea, since when does anything bad happen in K-On! land?

That’s not to say it’s a worthless watch. K-On’s colorful cast of characters are still very much themselves, and there’s even little sprinkles of minor development for some of them through their dialogues.  Plus, the comedy that is present is of good quality, even doing a better job with some jokes than season 2’s versions of them.  While the episode’s conclusion isn’t very solid in the context of why it was made, loose endings are little more than a nitpick in slice of life stories as standard as this.

Though this OVA certainly hits KyoAni’s above-average standard for production quality, it is a step down from season 2.  Sure, there wasn’t very much to animate in this episode, but even then, the imagery was a little more static than normal.  Perhaps it was the framing; there are a few noticeably odd choices with it, and K-On! usually has excellent framing.  Still, the visuals overall are colorful and highly detailed.  This episode is rather quiet in the background, and calming background noise with a lack of K-On!’s usual pop is a tad odd.  Plus, the Keion-bu does not so much as set foot inside the club room, so there’s no real place for insert songs either.  The important thing is that the ever-talented seiyuus still found ways to be creative, this time with the Engrish portions of the OVA.


Keikaku! Is hardly a necessary watch, but fans will appreciate getting an extra episode out of what could have been just a movie preview, and that’s what matters in the end, not whether it’s the best K-On! episode ever or not.  If you ask me, it’s not the worst episode of K-On! either."
99390,"When one thinks of mummies, they likely imagine something scary/creepy and in the context of fiction, dangerous and bad. For me, the first thing that comes to mind is what you'd see in something like The Mummy. This anime brings to light something that I doubt anyone has ever even considered: keeping a mummy as a pet. Or better yet, a mummy being adorable (overwhelmingly so).

img()
While I don't hate or dislike SoL anime, they aren't usually at the top of my list when it comes to what I prioritize watching. As someone with ADHD, slower more relaxed shows tend to be a challenge to keep me engaged. But this one had my attention from start to finish. It didn't have much of a story or interesting characters. But none of that mattered. This is the type of show you watch to heal your soul and unwind. And it did just that for me.






As I mentioned before, there isn't much of a story. The mummy, Mii-kun, gets introduced within the first few minutes. Then it's basically just SoL centered around him and Sora (and the rest of the cast as they get introduced across the anime). Okay, there's a bit more to it than that.

img()

One big theme throughout this show is how each of the characters have some sort of personal/internal problem. And for whatever reason, they cross paths with a specific youkai (or in Sora's case, a mummy) that by sheer coincidence so happen to be the catalyst for the solution. I will admit, on paper and thinking back on it, this sounds pretty cheesy/cheap. Maybe it is. But the way it was executed was just perfect, at least for me. There was a good flow and pacing to all this and it also didn't eat up the entire 12 episodes (about half or so).

img()

The show does quickly explain how supernatural beings exist all over the world and how Sora is somehow able to see them. And how his father (who I guess is an adventurer/explorer of some sort) often sends him gifts that turn out to be supernatural in one way or another. But nothing else really gets explained/explored beyond that. This didn't bother me too much, but if you're one that needs to have a detailed explanation for everything, that never happens.







While I didn't find the characters all that interesting, they were still fine. A majority of the development went to Sora and his friend Tazuki. I liked their relationship and how it grew throughout the season. It's worth mentioning that there is absolutely no romance (or even fan-service) in this. So if you're one who wants any of that stuff then you'll be disappointed.

img()



The rest of the cast was alright, but just didn't receive close to as much attention. Regardless, I liked everyone. Especially Kaede. Apparently, she's actually Sora's aunt and not his sister. That blew my mind once I realized that.

img()









I thought the art looked pretty good. Everyone had a distinct design and I just liked all the colors used. The art style felt strangely familiar to something else I've seen before, but I couldn't put my finger on what exactly. If someone knows of something similar, please let me know. But yeah, I didn't find any issues with how anything looked. I think my opinion would be the same with the animation. Everything looked good to me. 8-bit gets a thumbs up from me.

img()


In this anime, there are a lot of interactions and scenes involving the various youkai (and mummy). They don't actually ever talk, but despite this, they are able to perfectly encapsulate emotion through the use of various animations (a common one being flower-like shapes that spin around their heads). I think that this in tandem with the sound used for their voices was just excellent. I also don't think I've ever seen this done before in an anime either, so it was interesting to see.






I loved the OP and ED for this. Most of the time, I wouldn't skip either. Aside from just being good songs, I just think that they fit the vibe of the show really well. Additionally, the OST was also perfect. I was surprised to see that Kenichirou Suehiro (I loved his work in Re:Zero and Goblin Slayer) was the man behind all the wonderful music. No complaints here. The rest of the audio was splendid too. There are a few scenes with rain and the ambience from that was just perfect. So this all gets full marks from me.

img()

As I mentioned earlier, the animation did a great job at conveying emotion. But it couldn't have been complete without the superb sound effects and talent of the VA who voiced the different creatures. Ai Kayano apparently voiced Mii-kun, Conny and Kaede and she was amazing for all of them. Not surprised, given how talented she is. All the other VA were great as well.

I think it's pretty clear what my thoughts on this show are. Just go check it out. It's nice and comfy. While it is a shame that it never got a second season, it does end at a good place. And the manga is apparently still ongoing and I'm sure by now it's well beyond what got adapted here. So if you liked this, I'd check that out too. I haven't yet, but I probably will at some point.

I came really close to giving this a 10/10. However, I try to reserve a perfect score for my absolute favorites. While this anime did check a lot of the right boxes for me, I just don't see it making that list. That being said, it's near perfect (in my opinion).

I give How to Keep a Mummy a 9/10."
21712,"A naked guy on a beach with amnesia wakes up with a girl laying face down on his dick. This is the first scene of Island, a show airing this summer anime 2018 season. Labeled as a drama sci fi show, Island takes place on an island that is isolated by the rest of the world. Bound by its old traditions, the island has its own social structure, which consists of their three families basically acting as major political figures on the island. Recently, the island has been under some distress and the families are under suspicion. These odd circumstances can only be solved by the daughters of the three families, named Rinne Karen, and Sara, and by a mysterious man that washes up on the beach devoid of all memories. Except the fact that he is named Setsuna.

This show is quite obviously a visual novel. It has three girls, and a protagonist that looks generic as have the watcher imprint themselves on them, and a story that clearly shows all of the girl’s story options. Now me myself haven’t played or seen any gameplay of the game, but with basic visual novel tropes I can guess some things about the anime based on that. So the anime tried to adapt all of the endings and make it flow into a cohesive story. I feel as though this backfired though, because it feels suddenly split from one girl’s storyline to the next one, which made things more confusing for me. And it doesn’t help either that Sara and Karen’s story ended before the 6 or 7 episode mark. I guess in this visual novel there is a very specific girl you were meant to follow, and they tried to make the majority of the show about that. That in and of itself isn’t bad, but it feels like the other two stories were rushed. Especially with Sara’s story, where the revelation and the twist happened literally in the span of 10 minutes. It was resolved as soon as they knew what the problem was. And after both their stories were finished, they were forced to the sidelines almost immediately, now acting as side or even filler characters to react to what they protagonist and Rinne does.

Its mentioned in the synopsis that the island is cut off from the rest of the world, which suggests a more tropical, deserted island feeling. But, this isn’t the case at all, and is pretty industrialized for what it claims to be. It seems to be receiving manufactured goods, so the only way its cut off is that the families won’t let anybody enter or leave. Another issue is with the genre tags used for this show. The first half of the show doesn’t have anything to do with sci fi at all. Even some of the middle episode after that only hint at some ancient technology before we get hit all at once during the last 4 or so episodes. Before that its a slice of life drama with a piece of mystery through and through. 

The characters in this show represent your basic girl tropes in anime. Karen is the blond hair tsundere who is the daughter of the family that currently runs things. Sara is a shrine girl loli that works really hard to compensate for her family that has gone off the map in terms of politics. And Rinne is the main girl which has the most backstory and development behind her. The protagonist I already touched on as being your typical anime protagonist. I can’t say the any of them are good characters. There are always leaps in logic and stuff that should have been obvious, but wasn’t. It doesn’t go far beyond in accordance to their personalities. They’re mostly carried by their stories.

Island’s story is confusing, rushed, and boring. The first 6 episodes were very very slow, almost completely ignoring the sci fi tag. And even when they did go into the mystery more, I just ended up not caring for anything they were showing me. Or in this case, telling me. Maybe if this show was more then one cour or season, they would have had the time to flesh out the stories of each character more. I feel like they stories they presented were genuinely interesting, but it was just presented in such a way to the point where it became a snooze fest full of characters I don’t care about.

The art in this show is below average. In terms of both character art as well as background art. On a tropical island, you were expect to get long shots of beautiful beaches or some pretty pictures of some of the scenery you would see. Island has that, but they don’t look good in the slightest. If the show takes place in a setting where it's supposed to be bright sunny and beautiful, I would assume you would spend more of the budget on its art. This show’s animation is also sub par. Its very stiff and it doesn’t do much extra when it comes to its “action” scenes. It's not on the lowest tier of animation I’ve seen, but it's enough to notice that something is wrong here.

Island, for me, felt like it had more to say. But its short run time made it feel like they didn’t get enough stuff into it as they would’ve liked. Anyway, the end result is a bad show all around. I recommend this to someone who wouldn’t mind waiting for a while to watch a only decent sci fi mystery. Maybe someone else can appreciate Island more than I could. I give this show a 3 out of 10. This has been PixEFit’s spoiler free, but not really anime review on Island."
13333,"Note: I copied, and edited my review from the other  well-known listing site which will remain unnamed now.

High school is a place which everyone experiences different. Some people hate it, while others love it. Most friendships formed during these years either last for a life time, while others only last until you finish high school. Everyone remembers something out of those few years, both the bad and good times and things that happend during it.

Here we have 5 high schoolers who got into a group with a common goal they all wanted to accomplish. Each of them had their own struggles and objectives they wanted to get over. The whole thing started of with our main girl, Konatsu who was in the choir club, but decided to quit it because she was banned from participating in the competition that is hold every year due to her embarrassing performance at last year's competition. That's where the whole adventure begins, where she decides to make her own club with her friends. As a club they overcome many hardships and do many activities as a club or group which results in them all growing as a person too. Not a really original story,some would even say it is really mediocre, but the characters change it up a little bit.

The characters have depth to them, most of them have a backstory that explains their behaviour towards each others. Because of these backstories they have obstacles in front of them which they have to pass in order to grow as people, even if they had to go against others for their own goals. Teaches you how about the importance of dreams, to always follow them and to never give up on them. Most of them also have a connection with each other one way or another.

Since it's an anime about music, it is expected to have good soundtracks. It definitely does in my opinion. The songs they were practising, learning and writing were all good to listen to. Whatever the situation was, the correct music was always playing.

There wasn't anything outstanding in the animation. Typical, clean, smooth looking school art, probably seen dozens of times already. There wasn't anything bad with it either, no lacking anywhere, always looked as it should. Just what you would expect from a show like this."
6747,"Dance in the Vampire Bund wasn’t a terrible show for most of its run. But I do feel like it kinda got a bit rushed near the end. It seemed like they knew where they wanted to end the show but had to compress things a great deal to get to that point. 

For a large majority of the show I didn’t have many issues, but it isn’t trouble free for me. The first couple episodes worked really well and made me really enjoy the show. Then the middle section just slowed way down and seemed to get stuck. Nothing much seemed to be happening. And the conflicts that were occurring were happening due to nobody talking with each other. And it came off as really forced and unnecessary in the long run. Then we get a rushed arc, that only seems to exist to clean up a character’s story they kinda just left hanging. But doesn’t seem to play a larger role at any time after that, and I don’t understand the point of it. The final arc of the show was a rather large mess unfortunately. It really felt like a rushed mess, trying to work through dozens of chapters and backstory and information in just 2 episodes. 

You end up getting introduced to new characters and antagonists. New species of creatures or monsters, and this strange assassination game. But then the one assassin just disappears, must have died and I missed it because it had no name or introduction really. The other two continue to fight and injure Akira. Then the other assassin dies leaving one left with a twist on who the assassin is and why they are all fighting really. Overall though it just ends up feeling messy and confusing. 

If you can get over the fact that Mina is a 1000-year-old loli vampire, who doesn’t have an issue with nudity. Which is honestly really strange, and slightly creepy, but for some reason you just kinda accept it pretty quickly. She is a pretty enjoyable character and I ended up really liking her and Akira’s relationship. It felt really complicated and complex, but also something you could kinda get behind. Somewhat of a love transcends age and species time deal. 

The side cast gets to shine from time to time, with most of their time being towards the beginning of the show. Though I do wish they could have gotten more screen time throughout the show. Yuki and Nanami both feel like after their arc is over, they just kinda disappear and periodically show up in the background or say 2 words. The maids get some time in chibi form in after credits, but after the beginning they don’t play much of a role. Really most of the side cast gets forgotten about during the last half of the show.

Another show where I don’t feel like any of the music would make me listen to just normally outside of the show. It wasn’t amazing or terrible, just generic enough to play in the background and kinda forget about. 

I also listened to the Dub for a little while, and I don’t think it was terrible. I could see watching the show in the Dub and not having any issues. Definitely wasn’t one of the worst I’ve ever heard. 

As a Shaft production, you recognize many shots and camera movements very quickly. You just cannot miss the typical Shaft style. With some shots being identical to those in the Monogatari series. And if you said it came from that other show, I wouldn’t doubt you at all. The biggest difference with this show, and by far the worst part of the visuals was the filter like effect on everything. I would describe it maybe like one of those old hdr filters maybe, the ones that didn’t really help the visual quality and just changed the colors. But it really did look distracting and pretty terrible, and I have to question why they ever thought it would work well. 

It wasn’t an amazing show and had plenty of issues. The pacing wasn’t amazing leading to a story that feels rushed, some characters feel forgotten about, and the visual style of the show was typical Shaft with some filter that made it look cheap and bad. I don’t think I would recommend it as a standalone watching, but if you are watching through Shafts old shows say and come across it. I don’t think you would hate it and want to skip it immediately."

please keep in mind that the final rating might be solely based on my personal enjoyment!! the review itself is just me discussing all the factors mentioned above.

important: all the spoilers are tagged, and a warning is written before those. if there's no warning, then inside the spoiler tag are just some screenshots. long story short, you can read this review even without watching the show.

╰┈➤ story

well, the premise is not anything special; an ugly dude becomes handsome. i like the system of how it works tho, because it's not like his previous body just dissapears-

spoiler ahead
!if he falls asleep in his body no.1, he wakes up in his second body!

at first it sounds like a wattpad story kind of thing, but it's not bad, really. some episodes end with cliffhangers and it's very binge-friendly (i watched the whole thing in a single day), but... undeniably, the story is really frustrating at times (especially in the 1st half of the show), for example dumb misunderstandings such as the one in ep4

spoiler ahead
!where that bosco dude thought that he was using his no.1 body as an errand boy so he decided to start a fight with the protag?? !

the plot of that episode was annoying in general, and it's not the only episode that was annoying in that way or another tbh- but somehow, it's still an interesting watch, in a way that i wouldn't be able to drop it... i was just curious what will happen next, and there were some episodes and moments that were really good, especially ep6 (that was one hell of a good episode, really moving). but, the story is undeniably not perfect, and the biggest flaw is obvious, at least for me: the fights. there was not a single episode when they weren't fighting. ik that they wanted to show how people get physically bullied just because they’re “ugly” but those fights were just boring to watch after some time-- maybe it's a culture difference (although i don't think that's the reason), but when kids in high school fight no one actually stops them?? and the other kids just start to record the fight?? really?? is there not a single decent human being out there?? and where tf are the teachers during breaks?? there was like only one time when a teacher actually stopped the fight... this isn't tokyo revengers for the love of god. with such a premise you don't need dumb, boring fights in every single episode. i'm not even going to mention that one of the fights was in a middle of a STREET and legit ADULTS just started recording it instead of trying to help the kid that was getting beaten up. like bro?? wtf--

spoiler ahead
! and the protag in his 2nd body is OP anyway, so it's not even interesting to watch bc he will most likely win...!

i get that the show wanted to like-- show how different life is depending on how you look-- and how people approach and treat you but-- some of the fights were really pointless, and they weren’t even intresting. well, maybe they would bE IF THEY DIDN'T FIGHT EVERY SINGLE EPISODE?? i'm sorry, but that's just so irritating.

╰┈➤ characters

the cast is, well... sometimes great, sometimes not that great. in the first half of the show almost all of the characters were annoying and just shit. later on it turned out that Basco is a big dum dum, Jae-Yeol Hong is adorable, Soo-Jung Choi is kinda cute, the protag's mom was sweet from the beginning, and the protag's friendship with those 2 guys in the 2nd half of the show was cute too.

but the 1st half of the show... welp, the flirty girl was unbearable, i really had enough of her. when it comes to other characters-- the worst thing about all the other guys is that most of them are really mean for no reason?? and it's not like only the secondary characters are shit!! even the background characters are assholes-- going back to what i said before,,

>maybe it's a culture difference, but when kids in high school fight no one actually stops them?? and the other kids just start to record the fight?? really?? is there not a single decent human being out there??

yeah, i don't think i have to say anything more...

now, about the main character. he's okay, really. but sometimes- sometimes he makes choices that just make me want to throw my phone to the other side of the room. but that's alr, we're all human, we all make mistakes, and i guess i could understand at least some of his bad choices. none the less, he had some cute/cool moments, such as

spoiler ahead
! the part where he realised he could ""see"" the punches due to being bullied a lot in the past, that was swaggy ngl !

so he's not a bad protagonist i think, i've seen worse.

╰┈➤ art

not much to say here. it's not bad, but i'm not a huge fan of the artstyle either. animation is okay too.

╰┈➤ music

music is... existent. it's just the kind of opening/ending you would always skip, so nothing to say here. 

╰┈➤ extra

want to watch something with cool fights?? just go watch [tokyo revengers](https://anilist.co/anime/120120/Tokyo-Revengers/). it's not similar but somehow it's in the ""recommended"" section for lookism?? either way, it's a cool show, so go watch it if you haven't yet. also, don't get me wrong, i don't think lookism is a bad show - watch it if you want, but don't expect it to be a 10/10 masterpiece. as long as you're not very picky with anime you can give it a try, it's only 8 episodes long so why not? and it gets really good after ep5,,,

╰┈➤ my rating

a flawed show that is trying to make us acknowledge an issue that is very simple yet so important and somehow suceeds, but sometimes exxagerates things a bit and tries too hard - a 7/10 for me."
2889,"Bleach Movie 2: The DiamondDust Rebellion is a film focusing on at the time Japan's most favorite Bleach character Toshiro Hitsugaya with someone important from his past, Kusaka Sojiro, appearing as the main antagonist.

In concept it is an interesting story since there is an unfinished business between the Captain of Squad 10 and Kusaka which lead to Hitsugaya abandoning his post to solve it which lead to him being labelled as a traitor.

Sadly that doesn't go too well as there is no good reason why Kusaka is as powerful as he is prior to unleashing the power of a plot device Squad 10 suppose to protect and that Kusaka has Arrancar as well as Hollows under his command.
As with almost all Bleach movies, the cast is too large to make a decent 90 minute film and get the most out of it. Meaning Inoue, Sado and Uryu get shafted like in most films in favor for Ichigo and the Shinigami. Meaning you have to prepare yourselves for a bunch of BAN-KAI releases eating runtime. Thus there is not a single memorable scene that stands out as many of the good ones are just inferior versions of the main story ones.

As where this story could fit, it has to be before Ichigo fights Grimmjow the second time with the Shinigami being brought back to Soul Society for whatever reason and Aizen drinking tea or something. It may not really fit to the main continuity, but at least that would be the place where you can be sure when to watch this.

The character arc of Hitsugaya is fine. Not something that impressive but him learning from Ichigo that he doesn't have to carry the burden alone is a good message nonetheless.
Kusaka has a good backstory which will make you hate Central 46 even more but as a villain he seems rather underwhelming. There is justification for what he does but not how easy he archives his goal.
We see a bit of Rangiku's struggle but she isn't that impactful to the film despite being second in command in Squad 10. Not to say she didn't do anything.
Kyoraku, Nanao, Ukitake, Mayuri and Byakuya were also coming in clutch during the investigation and analysis about the identity and truth about Kusaka giving them a role besides just receiving information, reacting and defeating enemies with their Shikai or Bankai.

Fights themselves are really underwhelming with the Captains just showing off like always. And some annoying cliches with Soifon being incompetent so she can be rescued.
However, Ichigo's first encounter with Kusaka had some good use of sharing thoughts through Zanpakuto clashing, a decent use of the abilities of ones weapons and the enemies using teamwork in a visually pleasing way instead of taking turns which is usual for Bleach fights.

Overall this movie was average. The fights weren't memorable. And characters that should get more focus didn't get the care they needed. It is a shame that Kusaka despite his backstory didn't leave much of an impact as a character since the plot device worked however the plot wanted it to be. Like the previous and later Bleach movies, it can't reach its full potential wasting lots of times for fan service. There are too many character and a generic slaughter of weak characters by the high tier Shinigami.
But the finale was still good for Bleach movie standards. If you are a Toshiro fan, give it a go."
156891,"Saijaku Tamer revolves around Ivy and her slime companion, Sora, who are determined to persevere despite their cruel circumstances. A large portion of the series does lean toward the more iyashikei and lighthearted side, as Ivy travels from town to town, hunting small critters and rummaging through rubbish. However, that is not to say that is the entirety of the show, as the darker elements are a crucial aspect of the series, whether it is the trauma suffered in her past or the dangers of traveling. There is also a rather interesting twist for an isekai, as Ivy's past self frequently communicates with her. Although it's not groundbreaking, Ivy's anxiety and distrust of others are vital aspects of the story, too, which helps the series stand out from other similar series.

Additionally, the anime has some great art and animation accompanied by a gorgeous score that brings many scenes to life, such as when she is standing in the middle of a field of grass or walking through a forest. Scenes are also given the proper amount of time to breathe, which, along with the beautiful musical composition, creates some truly beautiful and even emotional moments.

The darker undertones do not come across as shock value or off-putting, either. In fact, they add an interesting juxtaposition against the beautiful landscapes and whimsical score. It reinforces the idea that Ivy and Sora are weak and the world is dangerous, whether it's bounty hunters chasing them, escaping from giant ants, or nearly becoming another victim of a man-eating tree.

Although the story has darker moments, it also has plenty of cute and adorable ones, as Ivy and Sora travel together. Even with the world seemingly against them at times, Ivy continues to find joy in the little things, such as eating a fresh loaf of bread or using field mice to count how much coin she has made. She also frequently encounters caring people, but due to her past, she has difficulty trusting others. 

However, as Ivy meets more and more nice-hearted people, she slowly breaks down her walls and becomes more trusting of others. That is not to say she overcomes her anxieties and trauma overnight, as that remains a part of her. Her fear of being abandoned and being perceived as a burden continually pushes her to do random and minuscule tasks even when it is not necessary. While she may suffer from these issues, it is simply nice to see Ivy slowly realize there are caring people out there and become more confident through these encounters.

The series is not perfect, though. One area where it specifically suffers is by making Ivy almost comedically smarter than any of the adults, specifically in basic detective work. Using Ivy's past self to move the plot forward through common literary tropes, such as a secret bookcase mechanism, can be fine. After all, Ivy's past self was assumingly an adult exposed to media and a vast transmission of information, so her awareness of these things can make sense. 

However, when she comes up with every possible scenario, it hurts the intelligence of the actual adults of the series, who are veteran adventures and people who hold positions of power. It's also not just outsmarting her companions but an entire criminal organization, too. It ends up making these characters feel like plot devices rather than actual people, as they are essentially found out through literary tropes, which dumbs down the world.

On top of being a bit too contrived, the child trafficking arc simply drags on for a bit too long. The series' charm is Ivy traveling to new locations, building relationships with people, and discovering new things between the towns. Forcing her to stay in one location removes what makes the series so enjoyable, especially when it involves some grand plot. It is clear that the author wanted to reinforce the idea that someone like Ivy traveling alone is dangerous and people can be evil, but they lost touch with what made the series enjoyable.

Ultimately, even though the series stumbled a bit with the last few episodes, it did retain most of its charm. The first half captured the best of the series, but that does not mean the second half was completely void of good moments, as Ivy did grow the most as a character in the latter half. Ivy is also an extremely adorable character, and it's hard not to root for her, as despite being abandoned by her family and even hunted, she perseveres. Although the darker elements are an integral part of the series, they do not overtake the iyashikei nature of the series. Instead, it is a nice touch that reinforces the world's dangers. The art, animation, music, and sound design also remained high-quality throughout the entire season, which shows the passion the staff poured into this series to create such a high-quality production. Studio Massket honestly did a fantastic job for their first full-length anime."

Arknights: Prelude to Dawn is bleak, a series full of dead people walking. I don’t mean that only in terms of the world around them engaged in warfare, but also in regards to their bodies as living people. From our first long POV shot as the stasis-awakening Doctor, we are thrust immediately into the dreary atmosphere of unpleasant colors, sounds, and implications. The lack of warmth is aided by disorientation as though we ourselves have awoken from stasis and have entered a place that seems to leech the life out of everything around it. But there is one smiling figure to give greetings – the cheerful Amiya, expressing her gratefulness at The Doctor awakening at last. But plagued with amnesia, they do not recognize her nor recognize him/herself, effectively a stranger in a foreign land.

The problems have only just begun, however. As the grounding beneath our feet gradually reasserts itself, we learn more about this world and how longstanding its problems have been. The world has turned thanks to Originium, a precious mineral that unfortunately leads to Oripathy, a disease with a 100% mortality rate. Though there is no correlation between physical contact with a person who has contracted the disease, called “the Infected,” the Infected are nevertheless ostracized and oppressed for fear or Oripathy’s spread. It is a cultural stigma that even those who know better cannot divorce themselves from, as the governments and populace have spent so much time oppressing that changing the system or the culture is too cumbersome. From the Infected come two main groups: Reunion, which seeks to overthrow the world governments for their mistreatment of the Infected, and Rhodes Island, who seek to develop a cure for Oripathy, which The Doctor was researching. 

At both a literal and metaphorical glance, there is no reason to hope for anything in this series. Among the earliest flashes of the story proper we see are gunshots and battling in expansive, empty corridors and spaces. Rhodes Island, both here and recurringly throughout the story, constantly find themselves running or on the move from Reunion. Although the factions each fight on behalf of the oppressed Infected, they do not meet eye-to-eye on how to do so. On the immediate level, Reunion is to blame – how could global justice be attained through such apparent violence when they drew first blood? But Arknights: Prelude to Dawn spends less time trying to convince the viewer which is “more correct” and instead encourages them to appreciate the sheer tragedy of it all, that presumably decades (if not longer) of not heeding the cries of dying people has led to the dying people not be able to agree amongst themselves. When resigned to such a life, what other option is there to believe in? 

So, the split naturally arises among the people: the more militant option that might get attention more quickly, or the more peaceful option which requires patience and time? As we spend that time observing both Rhodes Island and Reunion’s methods for getting the Infected people to follow their cause, it becomes clear that Rhodes Island is horribly outmatched. Both groups know that the Infected are dying, and their support not only increases their numbers, but also the morale of their respective goals. Rhodes Island only has a gentle hand and the vague promise of a cure that may never come. In a dark time, the hand of sincerity can seem like a mockery, especially when that hand is, much like you, only given a short window of time left to live. 

Reunion’s battling prowess is not merely demonstrated in skirmishes, but also in rhetoric. Horrible as their methods might be, their message is loud and clear – we are strong, we will fight, and we will win. They’ve produced results which have gotten attention, and the Infected who debate which side to consider more worthwhile are thus posed a question: take the short returns now in the hope that they rest of your life-ticking-away days are more comfortable, or take the word and leap of faith that everything will be okay? Even if all of the promises made turn out to be lies, or if civilians die as collateral, most would, I imagine, be hard-pressed to argue that delaying any chance of a better life is the better choice. In the eyes of Arknights: Prelude to Dawn’s Infected, they’ll all be dead anyway from Oripathy eventually, so what more do they have to lose by joining the more-militant Reunion? It’s easier to rationalize away the cost of life when your own life has been treated as subhuman, and any notion of life having salvation, even a microscopic amount, has likewise been relentlessly crushed.

(And that’s not even considering Talulah, a mistress of death who seems only too eager to see any violent action through to the end).

Like the overhanging misery of the show’s dilemma, the sun bathes the world in the murkiest tones possible, filling abandoned desolate buildings in white light that only serves to draw more attention to the crumbling walls, discarded syringes on the floor, and signs of the world’s decline. It’s as though the world itself physically is gradually giving up. Why would anyone want to live here? Would it in fact not just be easier to roll over and fade away instead? Such a question is no doubt pessimistic, but given the treatment of the Infected people, the thought doesn’t sound nearly so unpleasant given the active hellscape alternative. Arknights: Prelude to Dawn imbues pessimism into nearly all of its facets to paint the most-visceral picture possible.

And from that pessimistic state of mind thus presents the main hook that makes Rhodes Island, and the ensuing drama, worth following. In the midst of all this sadness, these are the Infected who choose not to give up to despair and take up the sword of salvation instead of blood. Theirs is a mission not only against the Reunion that actively seeks to kill them, but against the world that would sooner see them out of sight and out of the way. They’re struggling, but not helpless. They know that the dream they cling to is fragile, and that it may be a fantasy they’re chasing after all. I referred before to how their extended hand of sincerity can seem like a mockery, but buried under that assumption is genuineness. Amiya believes in her conviction, and seeks to act upon it by leading her friends and fellow soldiers into the fray. Their combative style (and the animation by extension) may not be the flashiest thing ever seen, but it and the cause keep moving forward, bolstered by a good, sometimes-bass-heavy soundtrack.

I would be remiss if I did not remark that Arknights: Prelude to Dawn stems from the Arknights video game, and that this adaptation is clearly meant to be more table-setting for future installments as opposed to rounding out a fully-complete story. In that sense, it does stumble in the execution of some of its expository elements and elsewhere. The Doctor is more a setpiece instead of an active player due to his amnesia (though his involvement does improve as the show goes on), some of the introduced characters are given brief moments and then vanish for most of the season—if not the rest of it—and the intrusion of the PRTS is an obvious allusion to an in-game mechanic that the anime replicates when it’s not necessary to do so. It’s an unfortunate circumstance of source material retention that works in a game format and less-well in an anime.

Overriding all of this though was that the immersion ultimately did pan out, that the resigned, crushing tone succeeded. Most of what I described could be labeled as “necessary evils” since the season is meant to be expository, relying on the “Infected Civil War” and the complexities of the overall scenario. The show does not relent for one minute, as even the quiet moments are tinged with melancholic smiles and reminiscence. It has no time for comedy (except for Ezusiai, which never sat well with me both in the moment and in the aftermath), choosing instead to indulge in morose, soul-draining affect. Perhaps for that reason, this series is a bit of a hard sell. In regards to how it stands as an adaptation, I cannot say since I have not played the original Arknights. 

Arknights: Prelude to Dawn insists on knocking its characters and their hopes down every chance it gets. Each fumbled operation, each person who dies, and each time that Reunion and Rhodes Island either ideologically or violently clash reads like another page in a Sisyphean tragedy. No matter how many clashes occur or how many gambles take place, everyone is racing against their own personal clock. Whether it be due to Oripathy slowly killing someone over time, getting The Doctor to safety, or whatever scheme Reunion has cooked up, time is everyone’s greatest enemy. With the overarching dilemmas and quandaries, the show coils itself around its characters tighter and tighter. Yet, the promise that relief awaits still persists. And even if the promise turns out to be nothing more than a pipe dream, it’s a promise worth clinging to.

But then again, in a world like this, promises may be easily broken…

155158,"The return of Gundam Witch From Mercury was something I had some high hopes in. Season 1 ended giving me the impression this was going to get intense. Sure, it somewhat did. Still, it was mostly a let down where I felt nothing besides frustration and 0 emotions for this anime for a while until the end. Recent mecha has done very little for me overall. 86 was painful to get through, Kyoukai Senki was worse, Sakugan was a lie and embarrassment, Rumble Garanndoll imploded and then I dropped it, Macross Delta proved to be the worst Macross entry for me after watching it all, Muv-Luv and Back Arrow were ""okay,"" etc.

Despite this, it wasn't all that bad. Megaton-Kyuu Musashi emerged as a multimedia project that tried to bring the spirit of anime like Gurren Lagann back, among much of the other mecha and space operas it often referenced, such as Space Battleship Yamato. I was surprised and pretty pleased to see something get it right. The worst part? No one watched it because no one really looks for anime in an age where there are so many ""weeds"" you have to get through to find something good. Even Birdie Wing: A Golf Girls' Story, that deliberately felt like a Gundam series, proved to be a great modern anime. But it's a ""sports"" anime about golf. It's not surprising the treatment this got. We were also graced with Tomino's new movie projects on Gundam Reconguista in G, which I am more than half way into, and really enjoying so far.

To get straight into it, Prospera was the character I came to like the most. The expectations of the ""Char clone"" were how she was being measured. Every time time she talks to someone it's coming from this sarcastic, condescending place where she knows something really important that you don't. She planned things out really well at first. It's like she plays out several possible scenarios in her head so that she always has some technicality or legal reason to justify what she is doing. There was a point where it became funny to me because she is always smiling. However, the last few episodes of Witch From Mercury-and the worst ones, in my opinion-ruined her character. I felt baffled how poorly thought out her actions were towards the end after she had created such a clever image of herself.

The ""appeal"" I see about this anime is sorrowful. The ""Utena"" approach resulted in the bride and groom of Miorine and Suletta. First of all, this and they felt barely explored. A lack of exploration I think explains a lot about this anime. It pulled in those communities that are into these types of stories, so it did its job. Miorine doing nothing but mostly crying for episodes on end felt like a waste for the potential of her character. Suletta finally graduated from being the annoying crybaby she was in season 1. Now, her overpowered Gundam magic so conveniently saved the day that it felt too convenient. It made me feel they were rushing in the finale to resolve the final conflict. Slowly, I saw this train wreck unfolding right before my eyes.

So much wasted potential, really. I thought Shaddiq would do more than sit down and smile like a clown for episodes on end. I thought Chu's character would go somewhere than just being unnecessarily angry all the time. It was annoying. I appreciate that at least Guel's character went through an interesting arc, though he gets resolved early and got sort of shafted to the side almost completely after that. I found it comical how certain characters practically ""get away with it"" by the end.

One thing about Witch From Mercury that I haven't seen in modern mecha lately is what it does with violence. Though it was able to get violent at times, it was still child's play compared to the violence of anime such as Tomino's Gundam, or his Space Runaway Ideon, that will probably never be challenged for it's horrifying, yet beautiful approach. At least for me, Witch From Mercury isn't the worst Gundam I've seen, as trash such as Twilight Axis exists.

In criticizing this, I am not being ""negative."" I should be critical. I could ""turn my brain off"" and give everything 10s and only point out the ""good,"" but I wouldn't want to delude myself like that. I think it's important for me to think and distinguish what I think is good, and what I think is bad. And this has no significance to the audience in terms of what they should think. Why? because like I've said before, there will always be someone who will like something you don't, and dislike something you like. We have to come to terms with this and stop fighting over it. What I can do, is at least find people who understand where I am coming from and who can relate to me. That's more important than trying to dictate and be an authority on the quality of something. 

There is hardly anything else I can say I enjoyed about this. On the brighter side, this has introduced Gundam to many of the new generation, and I'm sure many will feel inspired to watch the original 0079, and make that pilgrimage to at least Turn A Gundam. Speaking of Turn A Gundam, the first episode alone is better than this entire anime."
5060,"According to 15 seconds of rigorous online research, “Hetalia” is a portmanteau of Japanese words for “useless” and “Italy”. Aside from the fact that this joke is fucking hilarious, the Reddit-like nature of it should clue you in as to what this anime is like.

Hetalia is a show in which countries of the Second World War (and some other periods of history) are given human form. We then witness them interacting like how regular people would. Think those countryball comics but worse because this had to be approved by actual studio executives.

It is an anime to be enjoyed by two groups of people: armchair historians who believe that 40k upvotes on r/historymemes is equivalent to a PhD in history, and fans of light hearted slice of life with quirky, cute boys. Unfortunately, I read history books for fun, and I care not for (most) laid back buddy comedies, meaning that I do not fall into either camp. I have not enjoyed Hetalia.

Hetalia is not a new phenomenon. It’s an anime which has run its course and one that people seldom talk about nowadays. Just pretend for a minute that it’s 2013 and this review is in any degree relevant. Anyway…



I don’t think it’s funny.

Obviously comedy is subjective and all that, and if you find Hetalia funny the last thing I want is to take that away from you, I have just scarcely laughed at any of the jokes in this.

Most of the humour in Hetalia is derived from national stereotypes. Germany is strict, Italy is incompetent, the USA is self-centered, France is gay and so on and so forth. There’s nothing inherently wrong with poking fun at one’s identity - I’m not such a fun-hating goblin that I can’t laugh at a funny joke about Croats or Catholics, but that’s the vast majority of what this show’s comedy is. Enter anthropomorphic country, anthropomorphic country says or does something wacky yet extremely characteristic, end scene.

There were a few jokes I liked. The narrator describing the “Seven years itch war” as “Britain wanting to punch France in the balls” was actually funny. The episode in which the Americans try to lower their enemies’ morales is my personal favourite because of how bizarre it was (even if it does attempt to humanize Nazi Germany at the end). Belarus’ incestuous attitude towards Russia was… neat?

img()

If the show had played up its extremely bizarre nature and did something with its premise that isn’t just “goofy men but they have the names of countries”, it could’ve actually been really funny. You can tell there was potential there, but most of it went to waste.

But the absolute worst offender was a “joke” that Germany cracks very briefly. If my memory serves me right, Italy walks in and says “I brought you something you won’t like” to which Germany responds with “What is it? Another Jew?”

This is FUNNY because it makes fun of the mass death event in which TWO THIRDS of European Jews PERISHED. THAT’S SO FUNNY! WHY AREN’T YOU LAUGHING? The nature of this joke coincidentally brings me onto my larger, more important point of why I dislike Hetalia.



Hetalia isn’t just a show about WW2. It also focuses on the American revolutionary war, the Thirty years war, the Seven years war, etc. However, most of it is about WW2 which is what I will talk about now.

Picture, if you will, what the anthropomorphic version of Hitler’s Germany would look like. If you ask me, it would be a large, violent creature with eyes that scream nothing but bloodlust. He would move in mechanical ways, carry terrifying weapons and would only exist to murder, pillage and destroy. What does Hetalia give us?

img()

An upright, honest, handsome individual. Not just any man, but the ideal blonde and blue-eyed “Aryan” superman. This is what Hetalia: Axis Powers will have you believe Nazi Germany should be portrayed as. While Nazi Germany is this superior being, America is accused of being “the asshole of the world”, and the only character accused of genocide is Russia. There is no condemnation of the Holocaust, instead, it is laughed about.

Italy on the other hand, is a lovable goof.

img()

He is this quirky, jumpy ball of energy who is just so gosh darn cute and can cause absolutely no harm! No. He is not cute. His bastard ass gassed Ethiopian civilians. He ran concentration camps for suspected Croatian communists and their families, the interns of which could’ve been executed without trial at any time. It happened on a smaller scale and is not as known about, but Mussolini’s Italy attempted genocide just as much as Hitler’s Germany did. This goofball, while militarily incompetent, was a monster and should never be anthropomorphized as anything other than that.


Or Conclusion and Additional Thoughts

No.

Sort of. Also yes. Again, sort of.

Hetalia is not Triumph des Willens. It is not The Birth of a Nation. It is not a show that will explicitly tell your kids “Fascism is cool! Support it now!” It is above all a comedy about national stereotypes, and I don’t think the author intended it to be propaganda (the main character, a fascist, is shown to be incompetent throughout). However, it is a show that promotes the idea that the regimes of fascism and national socialism were in any way humane, friendly and redeemable, which is incorrect and dangerous.

You could call this entire review a massive overreaction, and you would probably be right. I mean, I’m, as the kids today would say, “coping” over a decade old anime that many today simply don’t care about. A butthurt snowflake. A liberal beta cuck, if you will. And it’s true. I do think that Hetalia is horribly offensive.

It was naive of you to think that I have a clever, witty thing with which to end this raving, seething review. Goodbye."
134,"Gunslinger Girl is a reflective, melancholic piece of art that rewards the attentive and inquisitive viewer. Make no mistake; this is a psychological anime first and foremost, exploring characters, relationships and the crises and existential issues they face. The title, marketing and so on do little to communicate the series' real strengths or purpose so I could not blame anyone for expecting a series heavy on action and simple moral issues and ending up disappointed because of it, and I imagine this is part of why Gunslinger Girl does not seem to have the strongest reputation in the anime community. There is little overarching narrative to engage in, only sporadic and swift action to enjoy and no primary antagonist or overall goal to aim for. If this sounds interesting to you, this may well be something you really enjoy.

The series follows girls who were all but lost to life being taken in by an agency, given cyborg bodies and training, and being told to kill terrorists. Unsurprising then that so many people expect more action and fun from this series. But this setup serves to put the characters into an environment where relationships and issues take a deep root and grow, as they live at an agency surrounded only by other cyborgs and employees of the agency. The true content of the show is the growth of the girls, their bonds with each other and their relationships with their handlers. The setup exists to explore the realisms of each character. Every character in Gunslinger Girl serves a purpose and is bereft of superfluous characteristics or scenes. Many of the scenes are subtle. Characters are not transparent and the importance and meaning of things is not spoken to the viewer outright. Gunslinger Girl very rarely gives direct insight into a character's thoughts, This by no means that they are not there however and this is squarely an anime to pay attention to or you will miss out on it's depths. This lack of direct communication does not exist to confuse or trick the viewer; the intricacies of the emotions of each character simply cannot be conveyed on the surface or by dialogue.

Not unlike the sophisticated character writing, Gunslinger Girl effectively uses music to heighten the experience. It understands both the effectiveness of recurring musical motifs and themes and the pure ability of silence to leave a profound impact. There simply isn't enough time in a review to go through the various ways music is used, so I shall give a single detailed example.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX3fe1axk70)

This track is first used in the very first episode so I don't feel it's too spoilerfic to mention; it's used as the main character Henrietta is being trained, and the use of this track servers as a strong early signal of the true psychological nature of this anime. This scene should not be looked upon positively, it is a child being trained as a weapon. Wailing voices and harsh instruments cry out the true evil of it all. But even more interestingly, only the early parts of this track are heard. It is only in a much later episode when something much more evil and damaging happens that the track plays again and finishes. Deceptively simple yet brutally effective use of music.
 
I realise I haven't really gone into specific examples of anything from the show bar the musical example, and that's deliberate. I think it's a disservice to spell things out for any potential viewer before they watch. A show like this is rare, a piece of art inviting the viewer to engage with the world, absorb the events and reflect on the emotions packed within. It is not something that wants to hit you with an immediate wave of surface-level shock, instead garnering more understanding and empathy you levy upon the characters."
17777,"It’s a tale as old as time, at least by anime standards.  Two single parents have recently met and fallen in love, tying the knot and officially uniting their families.  For Mr. Kanzaki, this means presenting his only son, Yuuya, with a brand new younger sister to bond with.  For the newly crowned Mrs. Kanzaki, this means giving her only daughter, highschool freshman Mitsuki, two new male family members, even though she still hasn’t recovered from her history of absent and abusive father figures.  On top of all that, the newlyweds are immediately going away on honeymoon, leaving their teenage dependants home with nothing but each other for company.  Despite the writing that would be on the wall in any similar anime, Mitsuki and Yuuya really don’t have any interest in each other as anything other than temporary housemates...  Until a bizarre twist of fate takes the decision out of their hands.

Recently My Sister is Unusual, which I’m going to be calling ImoCho for short for the rest of this review, was produced by Project no.9, a studio I’ve never heard of, and which I’ve barely seen anything from.  I’ve seen Super HXEros, and I’ve seen And You Thought There Was Never A Girl Online, and I don’t recall either of those looking bad at all, so maybe they’re a really promising studio?  It’s hard to tell with such a small sample size, especially since it’s been a few years since I saw either of those other titles, but I genuinely don’t remember having any strong opinions about the visuals of either one, although I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing.  If they were anything like ImoCho, then I’m certainly noticing a positive trend, because this anime looked perfectly fine. 

I’m not sure how to explain this, because I don’t think I’ve ever made this specific observation about an anime before, but the visuals in ImoCho are perfectly acceptable and unobtrusive, in such a way that you kind of don’t notice anything about them while you’re watching it.  I didn’t realize any cost cutting techniques, at least not for the most part, but I also never felt particularly impressed by what I was seeing.  The only moments where I made any conscious mental notes about the visuals was in a couple of instances where it felt like the frame rate was slowing down and the animation...  While smooth for the most part, as far as I could tell...  Became slightly choppy, like they were skimping on in-between shots.  This happened once at the waterpark, I remember that much at least.  Other than that, I guess no notes is a good note?

The designs are a bit on the generic side, but they’re also not ugly or anything.  Every member of the main cast looks perfectly suited to their role in the story, if not a couple steps above what was required.  The only character who really stands out in a noticeable or memorable way is Hiyori, the ghost girl who started all of this, and considering her supernatural origin, that’s all to the better.  I really liked the design of Yukina, Yuuya’s childhood friend who stands in stark defiance of the usual implications of that trope.  She looks pretty cool, especially when you know what she looked/acted like as a child.  The downside to these conventions is that most of the side cast, AKA Yuuya and Mitsuki’s classmates, are forgettable to the point that you may actually forget who they are and the fact that they exist inbetween their appearances.  In any case, the backgrounds and set pieces are really well drawn and designed, especially the Heaven that Hiyori occasionally shows us.

The generally high quality of the visuals can be a double edged sword, though, because there’s some content in this series that would be better off not being so lovingly rendered and animated, or even not being portrayed on screen at all, and that is the sexual content, which is somehow both highly explicit and confusingly tame, as well as often with no explicit consent...  Look, I’m just going to jump right into the writing portion of the review, because before we go any farther, we need to discuss the kind of first impression this series gives.  We’re gonna skip right past the incredibly stupid fact that Mitsuki and Yuuya’s parents were able to carry on a relationship long enough to get married, without their kids ever meeting, which sounds not only highly unlikely, but also grossly irresponsible, since they’re dumping them together in a house and abandoning them there with no adult presence, for their first fucking meeting, as if they didn’t even attend the wedding.  We’re going to ignore the fact that you should probably make sure your kid is able to get along with their new prospective step-siblings BEFORE deciding to get married, and sail smoothly along to the introduction of Hiyori.


The overall premise to this anime is that Mitsuki becomes possessed by a ghost who, in life, was in love with Yuuya.  The ghost takes control of her, imprisons her within a kinky looking chastity belt that gauges her horny levels, and tells her that if she doesn’t fuck her new step brother, then Hiyori will go to hell, and she’ll take Mitsuki along with her.  That alone is heart-crushingly unfair, inconsiderate and downright evil, but we’re not done.  In the first two episodes alone, Mitsuki is literally raped by this ghost girl...  Yes, literally, what she does fits the legal definition of rape...  And then we get several instances of borderline torture porn as Mitsuki has to hold her pee in for long periods of time in order to follow the belt’s largely arbitrary rules.  If you don’t feel pissed the fuck off on behalf of Mitsuki by this point, well, you must have had a hand in writing this trash, because the narrative genuinely doesn’t seem to understand how fucking cruel all of this is.  If you were to drop this show after the first two episodes, I wouldn’t blame you for a second.

And yet.  In Spite of all of this.  In spite of what I knew was garbage, and what I knew I was never going to outright recommend to anybody.  There was something there below the surface that caught my attention.  There were clues, even in the worst moments of these episodes, that there was some spark of brilliance hiding in the background.  I didn’t know what it was specifically, and I felt there was a legitimate concern that I might have been going out of my mind, but I couldn’t bring myself to hate this piece of shit, and I couldn’t stop watching for the life of me.  Not in a ‘rubbernecking while passing a car crash’ way, either...  I saw all these smart elements in the story that, if combined in the right way, could maybe somehow pull off the old alchemist trick of turning lead into gold.  It didn’t seem entirely likely, in all fairness, but I just had this gut feeling that my investment would be rewarded beyond the obvious cringe.

First off, two elements that work in its favor from early on.  There’s the pacing, which fits comfortably between the settings of brisk and gentle.  Then there’s the fanservice, which is not as overwhelming as you might expect?  It definitely has a presence in the story, what with Mitsuki wearing the TST, and Hiyori constantly setting up circumstances for her and Yuuya to become closer and hook up, but as much fanservice as there is, it rarely feels gratuitous or forced.  Don’t get me wrong, the situation most of it surrounds is fucking terrible, but an absurdly positive side effect of this is that at least it all feels plot-relevant.  Well, most of it, there are always going to be hot springs episodes, that’s what we signed up for by watching anime.  Like, compare this show to something like Ikki Tousen, where the panty shots are so frequent that they very quickly begin to lose all meaning.  ImoCho keeps its debauchery in line with the narrative, no matter how heinous things get, so credit for that I guess.  This also means that when the writers are actually cooking, they're not throwing garbage at us at the same time.

Beyond that, ImoCho just has this weird habit of breaking into random spurts of good writing out of seemingly nowhere.  Sometimes it’ll do something unique or subversive with an old trope.  Maybe it’ll find an inspired and unpredictable way to get from point A to point B.  Characters react to each other in believable ways, and there is some complexity to their personalities and dynamics.  Characters in this show maybe aren’t what you’d call smart, but they do possess the ability to occasionally rub two or three brain cells together, and there are times when they have engaging, meaningful conversations with each other.  As objectionable as the chastity belt is, it does have some creative features, and the fact that Mitsuki has to constantly keep this stupid thing she hates wearing out of the public’s eye is something the writers thankfully never take for granted.  Yuuya doesn’t just write off Mitsuki’s bizarre behavior, he investigates and tries to figure out what’s wrong.

Probably my favorite thing this show does to shake things up is introduce an actual little sister character...  Not for Yuuya, but for the token “Girl crazy comic relief loser,” and if that sets some alarm bells off in your head, don't worry, this isn't Clannad.  Loser actually acts more or less normally to his biological sibling, who is not sexualized, and who...  Aside from a quick hint in the final episode...  Does not turn out to be in love with Yuuya.  It is nice, seeing these sibling bicker in a relatively realistic and familiar manner, which serves the audience as an illustration about how brothers and sisters WOULD act toward each other, unlike our step-sibling protagonists.  So with all that being said, you can see why this show became so intriguing to me.  This isn’t the first time I’ve seen a trash incest-ish anime that tried to put actual effort into being something more, but unlike Nakaimo, I legitimately could not predict where this series was going, and that alone made it far more watchable than it deserved to be. 

Unfortunately, these efforts towards redemption ultimately fell short, and I think I can pair that down to two specific reasons.  First of all, Mitsuki’s situation in this story is way, way more egregious than the narrative thinks it is.  I talked about this before, but it deserves to be repeated, her circumstances are jaw droppingly awful.  She’s being forced into this unconscionable dilemma, made to choose between a sexual act she doesn’t want to commit and death, and no matter what she does, the only reward she stands to obtain from any of it is her own survival.  That is fucked up.  Some of what she goes through is straight up torture, both physical and emotional, but the writer fails to grasp this, trying to write Hiyori as likeable and tying to justify the situation by having Mitsuki slowly become sexually attracted to Yuuya, which feels eerily like Stockholm Syndrome under these circumstance.

Now, I wouldn’t mind any of this if the story took the same route as Romantic Killer, with Mitsuki being openly defiant towards her supernatural possessor and having the self-awareness to never, ever, ever let her forget that she is not fucking okay with the shit she’s been forced into.  Seeing her constantly insult or even find ways to hurt Hiyori would have been cathartic as all hell, and would have eased a lot of the resentment I felt towards her for actively ruining Mitsuki’s life.  Granted, Romantic Killer isn’t the perfect role model here...  Anzu also doesn’t tell the people around her what’s going on with her when she should, and she also forgives her possessor way too easily and refuses to actually let her fuck off out of her life...  But at least the more enjoyable aspects of that series were consistent and received somewhat satisfying pay-offs, while ImoCho’s sporadic bursts of quality feel more like a missed opportunity than any kind of vindication.

And it ends with a giant middle finger to the audience, so fuck me I guess.

Recently My Sister is Unusual is not available stateside through any kind of physical media, but it can be streamed on Amazon prime.  The original manga is also not available stateside, but a live action film curiously did manage to release here on Bluray.  There’s also an OVA episode that I would highly recommend watching, it’s pretty damn funny.

When I started watching this series, I had no plans to review it, because I had no idea it could possibly be anything other than the same old same old incest ecchi trash.  Because of this, I felt damn near electrified when I started picking up clues that it even COULD raise the bar beyond that.  Sadly, as much as I appreciate the efforts it made, and as glad as I am that it at least fucking TRIED, it needed to push itself a LOT farther to make up for the squicky premise, the infuriatingly cruel plight of the main female protagonist, and the morally reprehensible content that played out early on, and then again every time Hiyori’s treatment of Mitsuki made me shudder.  I’d probably be a lot nicer to it if it didn’t have all that baggage holding it back, but an A for effort can only carry you so far.

I give Recently My Sister is Unusual a 4/10"
21330,"Synopsis
Prince of Stride Alternative is a sport anime focused on the relationship of three first year students -Nana Sakuri, Riku Yagami, and Takeru Fujiwara- as they reinvigorate the famed Hōnan high school stride club. Beginning with a search for new members the groups strives to compete in the End of Summer tournament. Stride is a fictional competition that blends parkour and sprinting with six person relay teams in head to head matches.

Quick Points
-Great OP and ED
-Solid art design and use of color
-Lack of tension in races, due to a predictable story.
-Unable to distance itself from otome game source material

Review
Before I began to watch Prince of Stride  I was cautious in my expectations, both positive and negative. Positive because the director of the series Atsuko Ishizuka, did such a great job with No Game No Life. Which stood out last year for its art design and color palate. However, Stride’s source material originated from an otome game (romance games targeted at women). This fact had me worried that the show would become a clone of a certain swimming show involving men from a commercial.

The art and style of this show is on point. The styling of the races and OP are reminiscent of Air Gear and Persona, using different textures to create a vibrant background involving all of the characters that filled the screen. Anticipation for each race is a result of how clean and polished the environment was. Everything from the obstacles, to the design of the large scaled font on the sides of buildings created some wonderful scenes. Making me yearn for more action in each race.

But that excitement was doused upon by Strides inability to present a race coherently. In early episodes, it was hard to understand the scale of the objects the runners were maneuvering around. Mainly due to the editing and the abundance of tight shots on the runners clearing the objects, the distortion that it created was frustrating. In later episodes this issue is less frequent, but the secondary annoyance is the decision to not provide the audience a layout or map or distance or anything really, to convey basic information about the area where the teams are running. There are quick cuts to a top down map on a screen, but the issue is unresolved because the shot follows the runners instead of pulling out to show them in relation to the map as a whole. The best that Stride can muster is the time difference between each leg of the race as members prepare to relay with their partners, but that information is slightly useless due to the fact that the audience is rarely given overall times or even the average time of each member.

All of that should make it obvious what the show is concerned with. Stride is a show that puts the relationships first and the competition second. There is nothing wrong with that focus in a sports themed show. One of the common tropes in sports anime is the childhood promise to win a big tournament, stating that you compete for your friends and not yourself, and the clash of two rookies who end up working well together. Stride hits all of those beats and more, but the balance of the show feels distorted.



It is hard to justify viewing Stride as sports show about running. While there is a framework for that is in place the  running and training is just a device used to enable the students to participate in various antics, whether the students are modeling for a sponsor or going on a trip to their rivals -Galaxy Standard- training facility and throwing a beach party. Even though Stride doesn’t seem to fully embrace its otome game origins, it does not shy away from the potential male/male romantic pairings that are occasionally implied. Making the show awkward at times to sit through.

Stride in general is plagued with an attempt of trying to please a wider audience, but wounded itself in the process. There is the generic sports show about running, along with the romance (or “bromance”) created from the winking subtext of the relationships between members of the team. In simpler terms, it’s hard to enjoy the show as a whole if one of these aspects doesn’t appeal to you. Potentially leaving certain members of the audience disheartened when the show is unable to earnestly present enough of a race, or move away from the dreamlike world of male teenage bonding.

It is just fine if you enjoyed the show, I know there will be some individuals out there who did. But the if you are considering whether or not to watch  Stride just be ready to come face to face with a lesser version of Free!."
905,"Dragon Ball Z Movie 12: Fukkatsu no Fusion!! Gokuu to Vegeta aka. Fusion Reborn is a movie where the death return to life after an accident happened in hell creating a monster known as Janemba. It is up to Goku, Vegeta and Paikuhan (or Pikkon in American) to stop Janemba from destroying the balance of the circle of life pretty much.

The movie does a good job in showing the chaos Janemba's existence has to both the afterlife and the living world as the viewers will be able to see both what is going on in these different locations.
While Goku, Paikuhan and Vegeta deal with Janemba while Gohan, Goten, Trunks and Videl do their best to deal with the revived villains amounts which is Frieza. The movie also uses two artstyles for the serious and non serious moments but not necessary for comedic scenes. There are references to famous movies or historical events that get parodied which some countries won't be able to see because of censorships like the infamous dictator scene being removed from the German dub.
Speaking of artstyle, the visuals and animations are even holding up today and are the best looking Dragon Ball visuals up to date. Animators took full advantage of the tools they had making Janemba's abilities especially the teleportation a visual spectacle. It is alongside Wrath the Dragon and Path to Power without the doubt the best looking Dragon Ball film.
There is a good reason why this alongside Wrath of the Dragon are the only Dragon Ball movies from the original run that had a worldwide theatrical release.

As the name of the movie suggests, the selling point is Goku and Vegeta fusing to Gogeta being the first time these two merge to stop a common enemy. And the build up to that moment was done beautifully.
We see more about Vegeta's inferiority complex and the hate of the idea to fuse with his rival. And it might even rival Vegeta's development throughout the Boo Saga.
While on the topic of Boo Saga, this movie can't fit to the main story timeline and can be seen as a sidestory where the good guys defeated Boo with Goku and Vegeta remaining death.

Janemba is a villain that resembles Boo a lot but is created out of pure evil. He starts off as a fatso and later becomes a muscular demonic lizard thingy after one of the creepiest transformation scenes ever. His abilities are also very unique to him but it feels like there are also too much powers of Boo added for no reason like arm extension. But the main appeal obviously is altering objects and teleportation. Not only can he teleport himself but can also create teleportation portals which he cleverly uses to attack opponents without physically appearing or sending back attacks aimed at him. Meaning he can use his abilities as offensive and defensive tools.
But personality wise he is inferior to Kid Boo after he turned evil. Since he can't speak, most of his emotions are expressed by emoting with his body. He is also the only character in the series that uses a physical weapon after the Frieza Saga and makes it being dangerous believable as something like a Sword for Future Trunks didn't enhance his fighting abilities and was just visually pleasing.

Comedy in this movie is also great as jokes some which had build up in this movie or from the show being viewed. It would be hard to explain some of them without spoiling it. But they aren't the only ones.

The environment is another thing notable for the movie as viewers of the anime have had seen hell, but now that Janemba appeared viewers can witness how Janemba's existence altered it. Combining the flying multi-colored giant jelly beans created by Janemba and the unusual color scheme of hell creates one of  the most surreal landscapes in the franchise. Simply put, changing an already explored location into a brand knew one.

Like always there are some criticism. Of all the villains from the show that returned, only one fights and gets defeated in an underwhelming way. I think you can guess who is it. Someone who just won't stop returning. Pretty much wasting the potential of old villains getting a second chance to get what they want and taking advantage of the secondary cast better like Piccolo, Yamcha, Tien, Chaotzu and Krilllin to beat someone like Bojack, Turles or Lord Slug. Instead most of the living world scenes are wasted for historical jokes and Goten and Trunks.
As with most DBZ movie villains who are similar to the current story arc villain that came out around the time, Janemba is basically similar to Boo. While he has some unique abilities and a killer design, he just feels like a watered down version of the last DBZ villain. Both start out fat and at the runtime of the Boo Saga the latest form when this movie came out was Super Boo and Janemba's final form has a similar body structure. And as a character, he is shallow after his transformation who had a childlike innocent personality. And there is the question why he is as strong as he is. Another problem is the transformation from big to small is that in regards to Boo who is made out of magic and bubble gum substance, Janemba's transformation that happens in a similar matter seems unrealistic because it doesn't have a believable excuse like Boo. It also makes it less believable that Janemba can extend his arms, an ability it didn't even need. One other issue is neglect of Paikuhan as a character. While he did appear to help out, most of the time he was just trying to free Enma or King Yama, only appearing to buy time for the fusion briefly. So he was wasted as a character for most of the film.

Overall Fusion Reborn is a good movie still well remembered and the movie that made Gogeta the character everyone loves. This movie has the debut of Super Saiyan 3 and might be the best use of the transformation in the franchise. Even the transformation scene of Super Saiyan 3 surpasses the one in the Boo Saga version from the anime version taking advantage of how the environment shifts as well as the tone from the battle from fun to serious. So if you like more development for Vegeta, love fusion especially Gogeta and wants some good Super Saiyan 3 action, you owe yourself to watch Fusion Reborn."
3167,"This is such an underrated anime! It's a beautiful short ONA, leading us to believe that humans are drive by two things - emphaty and fear.

img500()

In the futuristic Japan, people either treat adroids like their friends and human beings or like servants and a threat to humanity.
Our two main characters Rikuo and Masaki are dancing between the two groups - showing us some beautiful moments of how a person's heart fights their brain. Seeing humanity win is a sweet cherry on top.

img500()

Characters:
Usually it's easy who to tell who is the good guy, who is the bad guy. It's easy to find someone you love and someone you dislike.
In Time of Eve, all of our main or supporting characters have something special to them. Each of them have a secret, something we might or might not find out by the end of the ONA/movie. It isn't a bad thing - it leaves you hungry for more.
Learning about them was a joy, it never felt forced or half-baked. I understood all the characters, their background, thier actions... God, I wish them all happiness! Some of them broke my heart, some of them left me happy, some made me keep my fingers crossed for their happy ending.
This is a prime example of good characters.

img400()

Story:
As simple as it was, the story itself wasn't as important nor as entertaining as the little paths between.
Robot Ethics Committee was a great touch, the story made sense thanks to them. It was kind of a higher purpose of the show, really. 
But the indivitual lives, Masaki's backstory, Rikuo's sister... those kept me on my toes.
But really, watching this... the story was not so important. It was a simple Slice of Life.

img400()

Music:
I have to admit, this one kind of passed around without me noticing. Can't tell if there was an opening or ending, can't tell what the music effects were.
I was too invested to care. (Which only proves my point that this anime is a blessing from God. You forget about the outside world for a moment.)

img400()

Animation:
Do you know what a motion blur is? Well... I always turn it off in the games. Having the screen go all blurry for a moment every now and then was a pain.
It was unique, I have to admit, but when that happened, I couldn't see for a while.
Besides that, the animation was smooth. 
The art style was a little strange and there were some funny poses and funny facial expressions, but that can't be helped.
I didn't mind the bad quality, when it occured.

img500()

Entertainment value:
Eve no Jikan was definitely a unique experience. It deserves more hype and more attention. I will be recommending it to everyone I know.
The story itself is pretty interesting, adroids wanting to uderstand people and be like them is just adorable, the way humans love is incredibly portrayed...
Even if you're not a fan of robots, sci-fi or futuristic themes... go and give this a try. 
If anything is worth your time, Eve no Jikan is.

Conclusion:
It was sensational. I want more.
(This anime deserves so much more than I can give it... I wish I was better at writing reviews...)"
128643,"I am going to assume that you're here because you have finished the anime ""yahari ore no seishun love come wa machigatteiru"" or OreGairu and want to watch the follow up OVA that takes place after the ending of the series. I'll cut to the chase and tell you DO NOT WATCH THIS!!!

The OVA is a horrible adaptation of the first 4 OreGairu Shin novels, condensing 60,000 words into a mere 20 minutes of animation. A lot of content is either completely cut or rushed and the OVA ends on effectively on a cliffhanger. This is very, very bad, but if you want to know more details then read the spoiler section of this review.

!The Ramen date between Hachiman and Yukino is cut.
The Dinner scene with Yukino's mother is shortened
All the sweet phone moments between Yukino and Hachiman have been removed as well.
In Shin Story, Hachiman completely rejects Yui for being too suspicious, while the OVA original had him resisting the urge to hug her.
Basically, All the stuff that happened with Yui is well-adapted, while all the moments related to Yukino are left to dust.!

If you are looking for the canon ending/epilogue of the series after volume 14 of the light novel or the final episode of the third season of the anime then go read the ""OreGairu Shin"" novels. Although I'll provide a couple addendums to it's recommendation.

-The OreGairu Shin novels were included with the limited edition DVD/BD volumes of the Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Kan anime, only released in Japan
-It does not have a legal western physical/digital release (as of now)
-The only translation I've read were machine translated from a Chinese translation, so it's really difficult to parse and can be frustrating to read
-It does not have an anilist entry (Since it's not published as a standalone series but bundled with the Blu-ray, it is a tokuten so ineligible to be listed)

!In conclusion, if you're a fan of the Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru or OreGairu series, it's important to note that the OVA that takes place after the ending of the anime is not a faithful adaptation of the source material. The OVA condenses 60,000 words into a mere 20 minutes of animation, resulting in a rushed and incomplete adaptation. A lot of content from the source material is either completely cut or shortened, leaving fans disappointed.

If you want to know the canon ending/epilogue of the series after volume 14 of the light novel or the final episode of the third season of the anime, it's recommended that you read the OreGairu Shin novels. However, it's important to note that the novels were only included with the limited edition DVD/BD volumes of the Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Kan anime, which was only released in Japan. Additionally, as of now, the novels do not have a legal western physical/digital release, and the only translation available is a machine-translated version from a Chinese translation, which can be difficult to parse and frustrating to read.

Therefore, before watching any adaptation or continuation of a series, it's always essential to research and read reviews from other fans and critics. This way, you can avoid the disappointment of a rushed or incomplete adaptation and ensure that you experience the full story as intended by the creators.!

I hope this was helpful"
12883,"Tsuritama, what an odd quirky name for an oddly quirky show, truly fitting for an anime like this. How did I discover it? Well, that's a good question, it happened to be the off chance that I was browsing anime featuring Turbans and I came across a photo with Akira Agarkar doing the ""yoga"" pose. Yeah, it's as strange as it sounds. Don't ask.

I've never got into fishing, nor am I really fond of the concept. After watching Tsuritama it got me thinking, this is actually a genius idea for this kind of show. Mind you, a fishing anime sounds odd in concept, but it works here to build a sense of friendship and comradery. Yuki Sanada moves to a new town with his grandma and just can't seem to adjust to his school life. Yuki has no friends and finds it's difficult to open up to others without being extremely awkward. After an alien visits his house, claiming it as his own, things take a turn for the crazy. Yuki is tasked with capturing one of the rarest types of fish so that his alien friend can finally return to space. Along Yuki's fishing journey, he meets some people along the way who not only help him catch fish and friendship. Eventually, these small get-togethers soon develop into something more than a pastime, but an experience of a lifetime.

Tsuritama is one bright, happy show, full of life and colour. This is the way it should be. I wouldn't have this show any other way than it is already. It doesn't really require a lot of flashy animations in order to appeal to everyone. All the scenery is relaxing to look at, and I felt a wave of nostalgia with each passing episode. It's perfect because it's a standout art style that's not really typical of A1's portfolio. The characters make Tsuritama, and they should with good reason. I don't think there was a moment in the show where I was like ""this shouldn't be like this, cause there was no hook in the story"" or ""I didn’t find the characters to be very funny or inspiring"" ; taking a jab at thatanimesnob who critiqued these things, he's an asshat who needs to be sent to a mental institution. Before I get any more sidetracked, Tsuritama always had me smiling every moment. I let the show take me on this wonderful journey with these characters, namely Akira Agarkar who is one of my favourites.

Tsuritama is the definition of a good time. So many moments you feel warm on the inside because it's just such a joy to watch, including the opening and ending. It's the perfect summer show even though it takes place during the school year. Everything about Tsuritama just shows you that it's okay to have fun, even if it's not zany or off-the-walls. It might be silly, but it's in no way stupid. There's something peculiar about Tsuritama that will make you chuckle because the territory feels so familiar, yet you've never watched this kind of show before. It is a story about friendship, and it is a show that still lies somewhere as being the go-to show when I want to just sit back and reflect on something. Watch Tsuritama during a weekend, or when you're feeling down. Do it because I can guarantee this show will cheer you up when your not exactly feeling 100%. Maybe you might be lonely, angry, or depressed, but don't worry because Tsuritama is the kind of show to bring you back up. I can give you my word that Tsuritama will most certainly make you feel worth once you give it a watch through its sense of warm familiarity."
128034,"Spoilers ahead.

Orient is one of the three shows which marked my return to watching seasonal anime, and out of the three it might be the most disappointing. 
I wasn’t originally planning on watching this at all, however I am a big fan of Shinobu Ohtaka’s previous work, Magi, and I was thinking of reading the manga anyway, so I decided to watch this week to week instead. What a mistake this was.

My excitement was high for the first episode of the series, the show looked like it had promise and I was interested in a story taking place in a world inspired by Sengoku period Japan, albeit with a unique fantasy twist to it. However even as early as episode one it became apparent this anime was plagued by all sorts of issues.

img49%( img49%(

The main offender among these issues is just how poorly the source material is adapted. The mystical quality that Ohtaka’s art gives to the world and characters is simply absent, there’s a complete and utter failure to capture the feeling of her art.

The animation is sub-par, the direction is non-existent and the CG is atrocious, although I admit that without it, drawing and animating all those crystalline structures would be a massive pain in the ass.

img49%( img49%(

Even though the show adapts the first five volumes of the manga, it doesn’t feel like the story makes much meaningful progress, I’m not sure that this is simply a pacing issue though. I believe part of why this feeling persists is because the directorial style of the anime fails to contribute any tension or emotion to the milestones we reach within the story. Scenes such as Musashi’s backstory or Tsugumi’s struggle against the Kosameda band are completely lacking in pathos.

Characters are also devoid of the vibrant style they possessed in the manga, instead their expressions are sterilized and their emotions are muted, this is an issue which extends to the world of the show at large.

Despite all of my grievances I still want to believe that there is a good story buried under all this rubble. I refuse to believe that Magi was simply a fluke, that Shinobu Ohtaka captured lightning in a bottle with that story and is now failing to reproduce the same quality in this one. However, until I find that good story, I’m unable of recommending this anime to anyone. I’ll be trying my luck with its upcoming second season and I dearly hope something better awaits me there."
119056,"A good way to judge the quality of a show is seeing how many characters or plot points you can name off the top of your head. The fact that the only character I remember is Mira, and I don’t remember any plot points except the utter abomination of the first episode speaks volumes about how forgettable this series was to me.

The first episode of any series is an extremely important one, you hit it, the watcher will be hooked, but if you miss it, the watcher will either leave, or continue with less enthusiasm. I would be someone in that latter category. I was so put off by the back half of the first episode that the sour taste it left lingered on throughout the rest of the show, but even if I overlooked the first episode, there’s not much to praise about the show. The jokes don’t land, the characters are bland, the world is boring, and there isn’t much to be excited about.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 3.8/25

Now we’ve seen this formula before, someone gets reincarnated as an overpowered character in a game, but in this case, Danblf, which is definitely not a lazy renaming of Gandalf, one of the nine wise men, becomes a little girl named Mira, who inherits most of Danblf’s abilities and shines in the world she lives in, solving any and all problems the world throws at her. There isn’t much to the story at all, and its fundamental problem is introducing all these plot points up, like the Soul Howl, the nine wise men, the Chimera Clausen, plus a lot of other filler, and not really resolving much of it well. Otherwise, there are no details I remember from the story at all, as the finer bits and pieces are just too forgettable.

ART: 1/10

Deplorable use of CGI, and poorly executed action scenes really detracted from the immersion. Most of the action scenes took place in stills, which really isn’t all that interesting.

MUSIC: 6.3/10

Brownie points for music because I’m a sucker for any anime music to give it a bad score. Pretty generic music for a fantasy.

CHARACTERS: 3.5/25

The characters besides Mira really added nothing to the story, King Solomon was just there to spout random facts about the world. For the rest of the characters, let me spout some names for you: Luminaria, Zeph, Tact, Fricka, Leticia, Emera, Asval, Frone. Could you tell me who was who in this story without looking it up? Probably not, and that goes to show how interesting they were. Out of those characters I listed, you might remember who Fricka is, yes, that glasses girl whose only gag was being overly obsessed with Mira. Speaking of gags, the comedy was just so mind-numbingly bad that the main character’s only comedic bit was that she apparently needs to pee a lot (don’t we all?), which was just so… off to me. The only half decent character was Mariana, Danblf’s aide, because there was that emotional moment between Mira and Mariana that was probably the only good part of the show.

ENJOYMENT: 2.7/15

I checked out pretty early here, but I got through it.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 5.5/20

A typical power fantasy theme that at points were pleasant, but it was mostly boring. The world-building was dealt with using too much dialogue, a case of telling instead of showing, and that really didn’t help building the fantasy theme up.

OVERALL: 22.8/100

I’m sure most of you are just going to criticize the animation, and use that as your main complaint, but there is basically nothing good about this show besides that even. It is generic, boring, and just not funny. Just a forgettable show with not much going for it. However, except for the animation, there’s not much honestly that is inherently “wrong” with it, it’s just not an enjoyable experience overall, it was a project adapted so awkwardly I don’t really have much to say, except that there are a whole lot more better isekai out there."
97983,"My first impressions for this show after watching the first two episodes, I felt that the season would focus on motifs of Natsume growing up with unique capabilities and what life was like for him during these difficult times. It turns out that I wasn’t too far off on my hypothesis! Woot.Very much like the previous season, this new addition has been quite reflective in regards to Natsume’s past, mostly in relation to the obstacles that he faced as a child. We get to experience more concrete glimpses into the core facets via contemplative thoughts that our protagonist has about the person he used to be and the person that he’s become. This breathtakingly puts into perspective the character growth that he’s undergone over the span of the past 72-episodes.

Every single aspect about Natsume’s Book of Friends is a stunning masterpiece and a subtle ode to Japanese culture and spiritual beliefs. It’s presented in glorious animation, infused with the aesthetics of tradition and history. From the mannerisms and etiquette, to the way that everyone interacts with another-supernatural or otherwise-to the common dilemmas involving dysfunctional and complicated familial bonds, friendships steeped in misunderstanding, and the simple emotions of loneliness that’s blossomed from a deep loss–all of these come together in a marvellous, fluid way to create a story that’s highly engaging and compassionate.

Visually, the anime is just as lovely, if not more, as its predecessors. The natural surroundings of the forests, neighbourhoods, and mountainous regions are depicted with great detail while retaining an air of ordinary beauty. The characters are all natural and easy to differentiate from one to the next. Whenever it calls for it, the suspense, laced with ethereal affects, conjures just the right amount of tension without feeling heavy, forced, or insufficient.

The soundtrack continues to be wholeheartedly magical with melodies composed of piano, shamisen, and wood instruments that work together to instil warm-hearted emotions and empathetic responses. It’s tasteful, sophisticated, and so easy to listen to, making it the absolute perfect accompaniment to the classic aura of Japanese culture.

Regardless of all of these things to love and appreciate, the best parts of the season were the themes of friendship and family, the bonds that tie people together, which is inherent in every new instalment to the serial. It’s a show that really peels away all of the layers that make humans such complex creatures and reveals us for the simpletons that we are: individuals who fight our own realm of loneliness; people who just want to love and be loved and accepted, whether it’s romantic, familial, etc.

In conclusion, Natsume’s Book of Friends was one of the best shows out there for the Spring 2017 Anime line-up, and it will always be a masterpiece for me. It’s the kind of genuine feel-good series to pick up when you need it the most. I highly recommend this to all fans of anime, especially if you’re new to the medium. It can be enjoyed by anyone who loves a beautiful story.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
The story is about the ""incarnates"", a group of humans who can turn to ruthless killing beasts. They were used in the war to gain a massive advantage over the enemy with their puny all human armies.

Though after a while these mutated humans started loosing their humanity and became beasts with only killing in their head. Hank made an oath that ""after an incarnate loses their humanity, only another incarnate should kill them"" and now he goes aroung the world looking for him fallen comrades and tries to kill them. He kills Will Bancroft, which due to this his daughter, Nancy Schaal Bancroft, follows Hank to learn why he does these things.

The rest of the story is about how all of these beasts once were caring humans with passion and goals, but now turned bat shit insane due to these powers. We get to see their backstories and just how much they cared for their nation during the war. It does manage to pull on some emotional strings but only sometimes. Most of the time we see a beast killing everyone because ""My JUsTice ShAlL pREvaiL"" which really doesn't make me want to sympathise with them at all. I think the best example of me feeling sympathy for one of them was with Trice, the singer, she didn't do anything wrong as a incarnate. Yes of course she did kill in the battlefield but so did the other human soldiers. After the war she hid from everyone not even harming a soul. 

The ending showed us just how insance things can get if there is no reason  in someone. 

All in all the story was alright, it did bore me a solid 75% of the time but they did manage to sprinkle in some action, comedy, and fights that had me on interested for a while. It just that it all felt so generic and cliche at times. I could predict most of the plot. If they just worked on it a tad bit more and sprinkled in some more interesting points than just ""Kill the beasts"" that would've been a lot more better.




[CHARACTERS:]()
In Katsute we have 2 main characters. Hank and Schaal. They inseperable duo.
Of course there is also Claude and Liza which have as much screen time as Hank and Schaal.

Hank - He was the leader of the incarnate squad. He made an oath to kill all the incarnates when they were about to lose their humanity. He is very calm and composed but at times, like when he feels like he is about to lose something precious to him he can go insane.

Schaal - At first she wanted to get revenge on Hank for what he did to her father but soon enough she realized that this must be done, though she wants to learn more about the incarnates and potentionally help them. She, at first, was quite scared of all of this but over time got used to it and now moves forward with pride.

Claude - The younger brother of Cain. He wants to eliminate Cain becuase he betrayed the nation. He is very set on this.

Liza - Most of the time she is just there for comic relief or to be fan servicing (she got the tig bitties). When the situation arises she will be much more serious and in control of things.

Cain - I have to talk about the main villain, the traitor. He is the pinnacle of insanity. Imagine Tsukasa for Dr. STONE but now turn it to 11. He just wants to conquere. He believes humans are also cruel beasts, especially during the last fight.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The art style is alright, it gives off an old feeling. The animation is rough around the edges most of the time. It can be fluid and nice to look at but thats not very common for this show, even during fight scenes (there were scenes which were just either stills or 2 frames on loop).




[MUSIC:]()
The OP is actually really catchy, I found myself listening to it more than once when not watching the show. It's quite a bop.
The ED is more chill and thats allright and all but the OP just destroys it. Though thats nearly always the case.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Katsute has an interesting plot and characters but doesn't really managed to capture my interest as much, as I said before the story felt really generic and cliche, I just sat there thinking ""alright she's gonna go to him and say this which will boost his spirits"". The fights scenes were lazily done most of the time. The characters were interesting though, I can't really say anything bad about that."
901,"Next December, the highly anticipated “Dragon Ball Super Movie: Broly” (which will finally fulfill the wishes of many Dragon Ball fans of bringing the character to the canon) will hit theaters, so I decided to check once again “Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan”, the first of the 3 old DBZ non-canon movies featuring the villain and also the most popular and favorited one probably along “Fusion Reborn”, only to confirm my bewilderment on how can the former hold this distinction. 

First of all, most of the old DBZ movies tell a story that either just can’t fit in the chronology of the main story (implying a continuity break) or unnaturally interferes with it in a questionable way, failing to build much interest in the audience due to the sense of irrelevancy and/or discontinuity, and this one is no exception. Right in the midst of the confrontation against Cell, and knowing how their world is in danger thanks to his presence, Goku happily accepts Kaio’s petition to investigate and deal with a threat coming from the southern galaxy without even knowing how much time this is going to take him, and Vegeta, who only wanted to fight Cell as soon as possible to prove himself, receives an invitation of another saiyan survivor called Paragus not only to become the king of a restored saiyan empire in a new planet, but also to fight against the legendary super saiyan who, according to Paragus, is causing havoc in the aforementioned galaxy, represents a threat to the new empire and Vegeta is the only one who can defeat him. The saiyan prince, who always heard stories about him, doesn’t even ask him why he would represent that since he was supposedly one of theirs, and tempted by the possibility to restore the glory of his race, also accepts to leave the same as Goku, both completely forgetting about Cell’s imminent threat and whose name, despite this, was curiously never ever mentioned throughout the entirety of this movie, as if that threat had never existed in the first place.

How is the audience supposed to buy this? Was it really that hard to add just a tad of credibility by just dedicating a few lines of the script to this situation? Just a simple “hey guys, let’s make this quick, remember we have to go back to Earth soon to fight Cell!”? I know this lack of credibility and realism is present in many DBZ movies, but that is still no excuse. Anyway, once they arrive on the planet, they meet Broly, the son of Paragus and a very peculiar saiyan survivor characterized by a suspicious calmed and gentle personality (an uncommon trait for the saiyan race), but who in reality was hiding a monster inside that was going to cause a lot of troubles for the Z team. 

It just boggles me how Broly can be one of most beloved and popular villains among the DB fans. He is totally uninteresting, even for DBZ movies standards, or more precisely, was made uninteresting in the way. He could have been an intriguing villain. As someone who was overthrown and sentenced to death by his own people -given the threat he represented to the King for being born with an enormous power he had never asked for-, condemned to wander through the galaxies living in inhospitable conditions and who was later mind-controlled by his own father who wanted to make use of his colossal strength for his selfish purposes, he had a lot of valid reasons to be angry inside, to seek for revenge, and the potential to become more than just your average forgettable DBZ movie villain who wanted to conquer the world or something…was always there. But unfortunately, the movie failed to take advantage of this potential at all by presenting him at first as this enigmatic robotic dude who doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything besides making these wacky angry facial expressions whenever he stares at Goku (in such a way that it feels almost as if he was programmed to do so) and by then turning him into a dull over-muscled beast with just 2 brain cells: one that he uses to destroy and kill everything in his path, and the other one to yell: “Kakarott!”. And this was everything the movie did with his character, the famous Legendary Super Saiyan!   

We never get to know how he really feels or what he thinks about everything he has had to live, what his true motivations are, because he never speaks a single relevant line about himself; when he’s not the beast, his mind and behavior are under control (with a machine that the movie never even bothered to tell us how his father invented or how does it work, not even a single simple and quick explanation: it just does!) and when he becomes the beast, he doesn’t (and maybe, he just can’t) say anything about himself either, he just limits to yell: “Kakarott!”, leaving everything to speculation and allowing for some people to believe that, given the few-friends face he put to Goku and the obsession he develops towards him, the reason of all his anger was as stupid as he couldn’t bear Goku crying all the time next to him when they were babies, when the case could have perfectly been that, for some reason, he was to him just the embodiment of all the suffering he had to go through. Things are, since the information provided was so little and confusing, we could never know, losing all the opportunities to make the audience feel anything for him. At the end of the day he’s a completely shallow character, nothing else but a killing machine that likes destroying everything in his way pretty much like how Kid Buu was, except this time not even half charismatic and “lovable” like he was.

The other aspects of the movie weren’t better. First, no matter how uninteresting your villain is, you can always arrange some exciting action scenes, which also wasn’t the case here. The confrontation (that takes half the movie) was incredibly tedious and flat, failing to create any tension or genuine excitement, so much that you just wanted the Z team to finish the job quickly to get back to Earth and resume their conflict with the much more interesting Cell. 

Speaking about Cell, Goku’s complete carefree attitude like if he didn’t have to solve this situation as soon as possible because Dr. Gero’s creation was waiting for him, not giving weight to the threat, was not believable. Goku was never that dumb! (At least not in the Z era). Vegeta acting out-of-character, easily surrendering after noticing Broly’s superiority, and as the prideful warrior he always was, also didn’t make sense; that was never part of his personality. Gohan, who was supposedly as powerful as his father (or even more) by this time, didn’t do much besides being passively part of the final solution and helping the alien race from the harsh labor conditions under which they had to work for Paragus, the same as Krilin and Trunks. And Roshi and Oolong, who had absolutely nothing to do here, were also included in the quest just for the sake of adding unnecessary comedy, which was terrible, unfunny and totally forced, doing no favor.

Finally, the ending of the movie feels like…”well, let’s end this, whatever way, and let’s get out of here quickly”. After a tedious, over-stretched fight, we had a rushed conclusion with the climax literally happening in the last minute before credits start rolling and goodbye. 

Art and animation are pretty good, and in fact, better than the actual main series. But every single DBZ movie also does, so this is nothing particularly special here. Though I have to say I liked the greenish design of Broly’s hair and aura, which highlighted his status as an advanced and superior super saiyan. The music included some of the main series tunes (at least in the Japanese version, don’t know the dubbed one) but somehow I feel it was just ok, it couldn’t emphasize the intrigue and the action enough as opposed to what the main series always did so well.

To sum up, “Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan”, was just a total letdown. It promised to be one of the best but at the end became one of the most lackluster of all the old DBZ movies. To be fair, most of them are, but as one of the most relevant given its direct connection with the franchise’s most important storyline (the saiyan race), in this case the result should have been better. It missed the opportunity to leverage the legend of the Legendary Super Saiyan (forgive the redundancy) Vegeta was always talking about during the Frieza arc and was painfully boring, as opposed to the other two Broly based movies (“Broly: Second Coming” and “Bio-Broly”) which at least were funnier to watch since they featured the naughty kids Goten and Trunks going in an adventure and were considerably more enjoyable. I’ll honestly never understand what the DB fans found so good and entertaining in this movie and in Broly, who to me was never anything else than an over-muscled, 2 brain-celled beast obsessed with Goku for God knows why reasons, and I’m really hoping the upcoming movie, this time canon, could do something more interesting with the character and his backstory."

Genshiken is one of the best otaku-centered slice-of-life anime I have ever seen. Being released in 2004, it has references from that era, from the club members watching anime from a small CRT television, to Sasahara, one of the main characters, not owning a personal computer, and even references to the still then fresh Iraq War in the form of posters on the walls of the club building. Being a dated anime, Genshiken still does translate well to today. The general mood and adventures that Genshiken takes us episode by episode could happen in 2004 or in 2019—the only way we can tell it is 2004 is by the animation quality (and because the anime is in 4:3).

While the first episode gives the illusion that Sasahara, who joins Genshiken in that episode, will be the main character, he is not the sole focus of any episode after that. The club members as a whole are the main characters, and all of the episodes revolve around Genshiken and the activities revolving around it (going to Comicfest (Comiket), building a plastic model, etc.) If anything is the main character, it is the club itself.

The characters that makeup Genshiken are: Sasahara, who is a standard otaku, who is not the main character, but operates as the ‘self-insert’ character; Kousaka, who is the only handsome member of Genshiken, but is very dedicated to being an otaku. He’s also very good at fighting games and never loses his cool; Kasukabe, who only goes to meetings because she is interested in Kousaka. She does not like anything otaku-related but learns to deal with it, especially after she starts dating Kousaka; Madarame, who is the most enthusiastic about being an otaku, and the most hardcore otaku of the group. He operates as the leader of Genshiken, both unofficially, and then officially later on in the season; Ohno, the other girl in Genshiken and the cosplayer of the group. Unlike Kasukabe, Ohno is actually an otaku, although her interests vary greatly from others in the group; Tanaka, who is into cosplaying and plastic models. He makes multiple costumes for both Ohno and Kasukabe throughout the series; Kugayama, who is never really fleshed out in the anime, his notable feature is that he has trouble speaking up due to his stuttering problem. 

There are many side characters that the main cast interact with often, like the first president of the club, who has been the president for longer than anyone in the club can remember; Sasahara’s little sister, who occasionally visits Sasahara, mainly for money and to try to swoop Kousaka; and Haraguchi, who no one likes but has to tolerate, as apparently, he has connections in the manga world.

Genshiken is worth the watch. All of the characters interactions make the show great. Each episode is different than the last, which different characters taking the lead of being the ‘main character’ of that particular episode. Some of the main over-arching themes of the anime are Kasukabe’s interactions with the other members, the club’s interactions with the Student Council, and the club’s yearly visit to Comicfest. To say that Genshiken is a show ‘about nothing’ would be a lie, but there are not many things plot-related that stretch more than a singular episode. If you want to watch a slice-of-life related to a university Otaku Club, I would recommend Genshiken."
3702,"-Mild spoilers

Soichiro is a fan of folksy, upbeat swedish-style pop music, and he dreams of pursuing a career in making said music. He leaves his home in the country to move to the big city, where he somehow winds up as the frontman of a death metal band… This is never explained… wearing a costume that seems to be cough inspired by the American rock band Kiss. This band, which has achieved fame and fervor throughout the disaffected youth of Japan, is called “Detroit Metal City.”

And thus young Soichiro is torn… In his personal life, he’s the exact opposite of his stage persona, Johannes Krauzer 2, a hardcore demon who (allegedly) brutally murdered his parents and rapes pretty much whatever he wants to, whenever he wants to. Despite his talent with this music, Soichiro despises it, and wants nothing more than to escape it all and engage in a career that will make both his family and the girl of his dreams proud of him… And yet he just keeps getting pulled back.

I know I played up this plot summary as a nuanced character study, but trust me, it’s a lot less interesting than it sounds.

I’m going to have a difficult time talking about the animation, mostly because in order to do so, I have to use the word animation… Which is a word this series never really deserves to be associated with. DMC has some of the cheapest, laziest looking animation that I’ve seen in my entire life. At it’s best, it looks like someone took pictures from the manga, colored them in, and flipped back and forth between them just to create the illusion of movement. At its worst, it’s stiff, jarring, contains way too many key frames, and abuses speed lines worse than Naruto.

The character designs aren’t that bad, as everybody seems realistically proportioned in both their bodies and their faces. Yep, nothing cartoony or moe to speak of, so that’s a plus. Oh, except for a few chunky midgets… Because Japan loves its midgets. But with that aside, this show is barely animated, save for the opening.

Say, do you remember Method and Red, a single season Fox show from just over ten years ago? No, of course you don’t. Nobody does. Although you should, because that show was pretty damn funny. Anyway, it’s about rappers Methodman and Redman moving into a wealthy, upscale, predominately white neighborhood. At one point, one of the characters… An uptight yuppie mother from the Neighbors Association… calls rap music “X-rated nursery rhymes that objectify women.” Was that fair of her to say? No, not really. I’m no connoisseur of the genre, but I know enough to know that rap music is at least a bit more diverse than a lot of people who’ve never paid attention to it are willing to give it credit for.

Now, imagine if that woman was tasked to write an entire comedy series based on her perception of the genre. The very idea of this is cringeworthy, right?

Well, Detroit Metal City had a character like her. That character was called… The writer. No, I don’t mean that literally, like there was some meta character named The Writer… I mean the actual writer who created and penned this masterpiece. Because if you’re a fan of Death Metal… And a fan of this show… Then I have a really disappointing observation I’d like to share with you. Are you ready? Here it is… DMC hates Death Metal. It hates the music, it hates the musicians, and it hates you. And it is absolutely giddy about the fact that you haven’t figured that out yet.

And if you think I’m just pulling this out of my ass, just look at how that form of music is portrayed in the series. A nice, well mannered young man gets mixed up in it, whereupon he develops a split personality, and that personality happens to be angry, abusive, and violently misogynist. Yes, I know it’s explained in the manga that he has unresolved rage issues that he vents through his stage persona, but rageaholics aren’t typically known to compulsively dry-hump other men and inanimate objects. And when they are, they need professional help, not a recording contract. It’s also made very clear that this alternate personality of his has the power to absolutely destroy his personal relationships, and yet he can’t stop going back to it. Kind of like hard drugs, or Rock and Roll in a fifties-style afterschool special.

Which is saying nothing about the music, which is literally about nothing other than sexual aggression and murder. And I don’t use the word literally lightly. The opening theme… In other words, the very first song we’re exposed to out of the entire show… Is a DMC song where Soichiros very first lines are “Yesterday I raped my mother, today I’m going to kill my father.” And there isn’t a hint of irony or satire in it… Throughout the show, his fans really believe that Krauzer is a demonic criminal who raped and murdered his parents as a child and was let out of jail to make music. A lie that the band promotes with a straight face.

As for the rest of the music, it ranges from “Kill and enslave everybody” to “Women are sex pigs.” And this is meant to be funny.

Metalocalypse is another show that paints Death Metal as violent and misogynistic. You know why it was awesome? Because it was creative, funny, well produced, and knew damn well how to go to some of the worst possible places without ever becoming too offensive. It’s a show that felt genuine love and passion for it’s subject, and as such, it was able to put everything that’s awesome about Death Metal on full display while over-exaggerating and ruthlessly parodying the things that aren’t so awesome about it. DMC couldn’t do that, and throughout the entire thirteen episode run, it felt more like a cautionary tale against Death Metal… With enough knowledge and research behind it to make Reefer Madness look legit.

This wouldn’t be a problem if DMC was written well, but alas, this just isn’t the case. I know there are some people who would say “Hey, it’s a gag comedy based on a four panel manga… Of course it’s not written well! You’re expecting too much of it!” Well, dear reader, you just insulted your show far more than I ever could, because there are plenty of anime with similar adaptive roots, and this is by far the least amusing one I’ve ever seen. The only character with enough personality traits to even be considered a character would be the main one, and while there is some complexity to his situation, it’s entirely contrived, and he’s so stupid that it makes him really difficult to root for.

Out of the other characters who matter… Let’s see… I know there were a few… Oh! There’s Capitalist Pig, a middle aged midget who gets tied up, gagged, and abused on-stage. But it’s okay, because he’s a masochist. Yeah, that’s all well and good, but his only significant story arc was about Soichiro trying to set him up with the girl of his dreams, and then blatantly dicking him over at the most crucial moment, just to be thanked anyway right afterwards.

Umm… There’s his little brother, who got so turned onto Soichiro’s music that he grew his hair out, dyed it, and now refuses to go to school or help out around the farm. And the resolution for that problem was… Well, really stupid, and never ever brought up again, except for a throwaway gag in the last episode involving a cow.

There are three women who play somewhat significant roles in the show… Kind of… There’s the band’s manager, who’s only personality trait is that she doesn’t care about anything that doesn’t make her wet. There’s the lead singer of a punk band, who was stupid enough to believe a Japanese guy with a cold was the reincarnation of legendary rocker Sid Vicious. There’s also Yuri(Yay! I remembered someone’s name without looking it up!), Soichiro’s former friend from college, who’s interested in him despite not being very close to him in school. Her attraction to him is never explained, but she hates Death Metal and all it represents. There’s something wrong with both of those statements, as there are several moments in the show where Soichiro acts VERY verbally abusive towards her without ever suffering any consequences. I’m assuming she still likes him afterwards, because she doesn’t appear in any of the last few episodes.

Much like certain other shows I’ve reviewed, or plan to review, the writing in DMC has one other serious flaw… It’s so dependent on coincidence that pretty much everything that happens can be predicted at some point during it’s respective episode. This is true not only with the pop band Tetrapod Melon Tea(For the love of god don’t ask) and the American villain from the final episode. While surrendering to the police for disturbing the peace, Soichiro trips and just happens to smash one of them over the head with his guitar. Because of course he does. He then stumbles backwards into a female officer, and falls onto her in a very rapey way, then runs off while fans chant about his nefarious deeds. This is never followed up on, nor is his humping of a certain famous monument… Which them lights up and is rained upon, another complete coincidence that adds to his legacy.

On top of that, the very premise… bland main character has to keep their secret identity secret so the two sides of his life won’t ever find out about each other… Has been done to death and beyond, and as far as execution goes, this take on the concept is about as consistent and well thought out as Hannah Montana. There are several instances where his personal identity should have been blown wide open, and yes, most of them involve police. We go through the same tired plot episode after episode, with Soichiro forced into situations where he somehow protects his secret identity despite idiotically and ‘hilariously’ screwing it up every time, and for what? For characters that we’re not even expected to remember in the last few episodes.

For the longest time, I was fully intending to give this series a 2/10. I hated it to the point that I was actively looking for chores to do between each episode, but at least it was mercifully short… Only fifteen minutes per episode… and it had a pretty well acted Japanese dub. This is especially true of the gravely performance put forth by Yuji Oeda in the role of Krauzer… He only plays the Krauzer version, but he plays it very convincingly. Then something happened at the end of episode eleven that changed my mind. And since this show doesn’t really have any plot or story to spoil, I’m going to tell you exactly what it was.

After a particularly racist stage show that painted the band’s manager as just barely competent enough to host a WWE show, we see a woman and her four year old child waiting in the lobby for her father as a group of fans point her out as a Mini-Krauzer. She starts belting out a DMC song that’s called An Anthem to Female Pigs(Or something like that), which is just a constant repeat of the phrase “I only need your lower half.” Fair enough… This kind of thing could be funny. If it had stopped there.

The mother gives her daughter a bottle of milk, and the crowd proclaims excitedly that she’s drinking a white liquid. Oh, and before you start saying I’m getting too offended by a ‘child drinking something that looks like semen’ joke, just hold on, because it gets worse. Her father comes out of the bathroom, and the adorable little tot runs at him, jumping into her father’s arms, as the crowd cheers that she’s raping him. And since they’re stupid enough to think that Krauzer was REALLY released from jail after murdering his parents just so he could make music, there’s no particular reason to say that they’re joking about this. It beg the question of how they’d react if they were to stumble upon a real life crime as it were taking place. Would they cheer it on? Would they join in? Krauzer’s band is creating these people.

While there’s no dub for this series… And I really can’t blame them… The DVD has been released stateside by Sentai Filmworks, and I can only speculate that they’re releasing a lot of undubbed DVDs because they’re strapped for cash and don’t want to spend the money on voice actors for the majority of their projects. Fair enough, they’ve been through some hard times recently, and I can respect that decision. The DVD itself can be found for dirt cheap, with the average store price ranging somewhere around twenty dollars or so. There’s also a translated manga from Viz Media, and while I haven’t read it, it can’t possibly be worse than the show.

And it feels, to me at least, like my twenty dollars alone paid for their entire animation budget. I didn’t find anything about this show to be enjoyable… It’s not funny, it’s terribly written, it’s misogynistic down to it’s deepest core, and the in-show music was clearly written by somebody with no understanding of the genre they were supposed to be representing. The characters are awful, the situations are poorly thought out, the humor ranges from Baffling to Stomach-churning, and for a show that portrays itself as being realistic in design, the presence of the law is entirely inconsistent. Soichiro’s deplorable behavior is not only excused and forgiven, it’s often encouraged by infuriatingly positive outcomes. Even at fifteen minutes an episode, this show was a chore to sit through, and I feel dumber for having done so. It doesn’t feel as potentially dangerous as Popotan did, but it still stands right alongside it as one of the worst anime I’ve ever watched. I give Detroit Metal City a 1/10."
4835,"Fade to Black is a prime example of a Bleach universe expansion that simply doesn’t need to exist. There was not a single reason for this movie to be made other than milking the franchise. 

I will elaborate on that. 

Spoilers ahead but... nothing really happens in this movies so you may proceed anyway. This is not exaggeration.

Fade to Black is a filler. Now, fillers can be great assets to a show, especially to one as rich as Bleach – but they must be done right, they must have a purpose. To pull off a good filler it is essential to focus on an already established aspect of the show’s universe, be it characters or the world, and further develop them. Also, fanservice. That is necessary part of a filler too. Simply put, take something from a show and expand it in an entertaining way. 

Bleach has a history of fillers and I’d argue some of them are quite decent. Their fatal flaws tend to lie in the timing of the filler and weak characters, but there’s generally a great deal of good filler inputs. This movie is not one of them. 

As I’ve stated above, what makes a filler a good addition to the main story is the fact it can go anywhere. Is there a quirky side character who doesn’t get much screentime? Take them and have them go on an adventure! Put them in a stressful situation to show who they are. Let them make decisions of their own. Filler is such a powerful tool since it is able to do all that without affecting the main plot while expanding said plot. 

Fade to Black feels like a discount version of an actual filler arc that already aired. It is built on the premise of two characters who can alter other people’s memories. These two mysterious hooligans happen to be interested in Rukia and decide to erase her memories, kidnap her all while commencing an attack on Soul Society as they hate all Soul Reapers. So, as it turns out, everyone forgets about Rukia’s and Ichigo’s (because his powers were originally hers which makes them connected) very existence.

Thus, when Ichigo enters Soul Society to look for Rukia, everyone is after him since they don’t recognize him and suspect him of being the culprit behind the attack on Seireitei. 

This has already happened in Bleach. Not to say the whole Soul Society arc is about Ichigo battling Soul Reapers to save Rukia, there is also this weird Shuusuke Amagai filler arc in which Ichigo is drawn into a noble family dispute and the Gotei 13 are chasing him down since they suspect him of intervening in the nobles’ wedding – it’s complicated, the fact remains that the concept of Ichigo having to battle Soul Reapers of Soul Society has been done before. This adds absolutely nothing to our experience with the world of Bleach.

Plot wise there is nothing of substance but Ichigo trying to prove himself as the ally of Soul Society could theoretically be amusing, you might say. Well, there is nothing like that. His attempts are pathetic, the only way in which he demonstrates his knowledge of Soul Society is calling people by their names. To give credit where credit’s due, he does tell Byakuya the name of his late wife, which was good and also (SURPRISINGLY!) worked and second point, he reveals that he knows of Renji’s bankai. Those are the only attempts to convince the Gotei 13 that he, in fact, knows them and they simply forgot about him. 

The movie isn’t even entertaining fanservice-wise. There is a 30-second-long scene of Byakuya and Hisane back in the day and that is all. It feels more like – oh look! Komamura’s bankai! Oh, and look there – Byakuya’s bankai! Oh, and this? It’s Yoruichi carrying Soi-Fon!

This movie serves as pointless platform to show popular Bleach characters and that’s it. Literally. Some of those characters make appearance just for the sake of making appearance – we don’t even see them fight, we don’t see them interact with anyone, they are just there. Like hey! Ikkaku and Yumichika! Hitsugaya! Kenpachi! you like them, right?

That is best represented during the ending of the movie. One of the main focuses was the fact that neither Renji nor Byakuya could remember Rukia, their most important person. There is actual build-up for the moment they finally realize who Rukia is. I was genuinely interested to see both Byakuya and Renji deal with the situation and eventually react to the realization. 

That doesn’t happen.

Eventually, everybody gets their memories back, obviously, but there is absolutely no conclusion to anything except for between Rukia and Ichigo. We don’t see Renji nor Byakuya react to what has transpired. We don’t see Gotei 13 react to the fact they were hunting Ichigo down. There is no rewarding conclusion to anything that has happened.

For a movie about memories I would expect more sentimental approach yet all we are offered are quick battle sequences and literally nothing but cameos. Fade to Black feels like every famous Bleach character got a cameo and that was all there was budget for. 

If only I got at least some fanservice I would have rated this higher, however this movie doesn’t even have that. I definitely wouldn’t recommend watching Fade to Black - and not because it’s that bad, it’s just very empty. I can’t think of a single reason anyone should spend 94 minutes of their life on a movie so devoid of meaning.

That one episode about Yumichika, Rin and Hanatarou baking a cake for the first time had more substance than this.
(I mean it, that is an exceptionally well done filler I absolutely love, because it takes three side characters, places them in front of an unusual conflict, they have to work to resolve said conflict and ultimately it allows them to grow as people. The filler is structured like a regular story, there is build-up and pay-off while it also develops the characters in subtle yet meaningful ways. There is fanservice, humour and action as well. It is a filler with purpose and it's a fucking cake baking episode.)"
97643,"""TEEKYUU""



Okay, it's finally time to talk about my real favorite anime. I mean I figured it'd be a perfect time to do it with the [ninth season](https://anilist.co/anime/98566/Teekyuu9) coming up, so I just decided ""hey let's do a motherfucking Teekyuu review"".

Millepensee, how can you make such a great anime? Tennis gags? Yes. Alien Teekyuu, best Teekyuu? [Yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTfjg2LYquY) You just end up watching an episode and saying yeah sure, I'll watch another episode. Then you realize oh SHIT, you just marathonned seven seasons of Teekyuu back to back.

To conclude the first ever TGG review of a TV short that isn't [literally go fuck yourself](https://anilist.co/anime/19315/Pupa), I give it a score of 65 out of 100. And I know that seems low but god damn, for these reviews, that is comparatively high.

Anyways yeah, that's the whole thing. Upvotes please. This is literally the fourteenth anime review, I'm taking a page from Millefleshrot's book and slimming these things down to only the essentials. No more gimmicks.

The gimmicks had a good run but it's time to go back to vanilla and ranty TGG reviews of a few months ago--okay what the flying fuck is that.

img220()

That is so shoddily made. Like one look at it and right away you go ""[oh okay yeah that's totally the thing that it's supposed to be and not something that was just slapped together.](https://anilist.co/anime/21560/Berserk)"" A Microsoft paint Brand of Sacrifice? I mean didn't I just say no more gimmicks? Look, Anilist deserves a Teekyuu review and that is what this is.

Sacrifice? Get outta here, I don't give a shit about the Invocation of Doom--

BERSERK 2017 OR ""BERSERK 2"" IS JUST STRAIGHT UP THE CONTINUATION OF [BERSERK 2016](https://anilist.co/anime/21560/Berserk), WHICH ITSELF COVERS FROM AN ALTERED START OF THE MANGA, THEN SIDESTEPS TWO ENTIRE ARCS, AND SKIPS OVER THE GOLDEN AGE STUFF BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN ADAPTED [TWICE](https://anilist.co/anime/33/KenpuuDenkiBerserk) [ALREADY](https://anilist.co/anime/10218/BerserkOugonJidaihenIHaounoTamago). BERSERK 2017 AT LEAST STARTS IN AND ENDS WITH FALCON OF MILLENIUM EMPIRE STUFF. POINT IS, THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE THIS PART OF THE MANGA/SERIES.

That warning shouldn't even be needed at this point, but...



Since this is the second review, I will be attempting to not overly repeat anything I said [before](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2120). But I'll certainly be addressing the returning flaws from 2016 as well as the slight improvements since and any sudden or sharp changes in quality that just sort of happen with NO warning whatsoever. Thinking about it a bit further, an actual serious attempt to not write another four thousand word long review on this adaptation seems futile.

But yes, here we go again. Another season of [Millepensee's](http://anilist.co/studio/6073/Millepensee) Berserk. I really don't think anybody asked for a season two this time around. Which is sad because people waited NINETEEN YEARS (since the [97 anime](http://anilist.co/anime/33/Berserk)) to see an anime with Guts beyond the Golden Age. But since they announced the second season with the end of the first season, it must mean they had been planning on doing 24 episodes from the start no matter what. After all, as far as my knowledge goes, Berserk 2016 sold like absolute dogshit. But no matter how negative I may be towards MillepenshouldsticktoTeekyuu's Berserk, I can't really say I wish that it didn't exist at all because maybe if it didn't, we wouldn't have gotten Berserk Musou. Which... just yes. [God yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnoAR89rVg)

Still, where there is a Berserk adaptation... I will unfortunately eventually end up there. Hell, I'll even read [the new light novel](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2017-04-24/retailers-list-berserk-novel-by-anime-scriptwriter-makoto-fukami/.115211) if it ever gets translated even though it's WRITTEN by one of the guy who did the new anime's script which immediately raises a red flag. But Miura did the illustrations so it's possibly canon unless he outright says it's not at some point in the future???

I don't even know anymore, man. I really don't. Before we really finally get this party truly started again, I just want to say on a serious note that the Berserk 2016 review was the first review I wrote and it was the start of a downhill slope of a bunch of [horrible](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2156) [shit](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2215) [happening](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2224). And, looking back, I have a bunch of problems with my Berserk 2016 review. 

Therefore, following eesnepelliM and GEMBA's examples, I will make an effort to improve with this Berserk 2017 review. In doing so, I will start by sharing how to make a proper, well loved, and faithful adaptation of a manga the MilesforPens and GEMBA way. 

img440()

First, get the manga in question to be sacrificed to the dark lords, your trusty clanging instrument, some handily packaged Behelits from Walmart and the rest is self-explanatory really. You can't make a proper anime adaptation without breaking some manga. I mean like, everyone knows that.

No wild manga were harmed in the making of this review. I was stopped before I could go through with it.




Hey, anybody remember that first teaser they released where CG Guts' face was actually Guts' face? Also the Dragonslayer fucking bent as he swung it, but for at least one shot of the teaser, they had CG Guts actually have a 2D face. But of course they realized the main character having a 2D face throughout all of the action scenes (and most of the dialogue scenes) would be way more expensive so they jettisoned that.

youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXWDTb73AeE)

Point is, it's very slight, but in Berserk 2017, Guts and Casca's CG faces actually look... somewhat better? It's sort of telling that this is actually a positive that I'm bothering to mention. ""Oh yeah, the characters look more like the characters they're supposed to be."" Also CG Griffith is actually pretty alright, so there's that too.

The OP is... well first off, I liked Inferno of the first season, but honestly I actually really prefer Sacrifice. 9MM Parabellum Bullet calmed themselves down a little bit because for season two, the opening of the show is an actual opening rather than just the Eclipse shrinked down to a minute. Also, why is the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-1TghelNQ) now entirely 2D, and why is the 2D better than the first season's opening? 

Millemisery, do you just love laughing at an entire fanbase? The first season's opening at least had a few seconds of CG Guts clumsily swinging the Dragonslayer around at nothing in an empty field. Because you know, that's the actual show. But okay, people seem to like the 2D parts the best, let's make the entire season 2 opening 2D while keeping the rest of the show almost entirely CG. 

That'll definitely fix the problem.

Oh yeah, we're not in Conviction land anymore, so at the very least we don't have to tolerate any more of Nina. I didn't even mention her in the first review because they actually captured her character perfectly. The walking worst part of the Conviction arc, manga or otherwise, is gone. Hell yes I'm actually seriously listing this as a positive.

img440()

Most of Schierke's magic stuff and stuff with the Astral Realm was pretty good. Matter of fact, that was probably my overall favorite part of Berserk 2017, to be honest.



Um... there wasn't any outright copy and pasted mobs this time... they still do the CG and 2D on the screen at the same time but it's certainly lessened comparing to last season.

That's about all I can think of right now. Now, let's not have any more false starts and just get into it finally.




Episode one thirteen, here we GO.

youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMqpdxdKH0g)

""Why is the camera shaking? Good lord, could you just keep it stable for two seconds? The shaking does not add to the actio--OH GOD RAPID FIRE CLANGS. THEY LEARNED NOTHING.""

Guts still clangs, Zodd clangs, Grunbeld clangs. Really, the clangs must just be an indicator if it's a strong character or not. Literally no other characters clang. And yes, it's the exact same clang from season one. They still didn't have enough money for a [new sound effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IClfBHSxec). But you know, I have to state I do respect Millefoolery for sticking to their guns and keeping the clang. The [memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IngYY4iWI) this show has spawned aside, like Hai Yo, the clang is a staple of this adaptation. A small part of me would have been sad if it was gone.

Wait. What?



...Guts used his sword as an actual sword against the ogre in episode nineteen. It clearly cuts through the ogre, and it does not clang. But spirits, possessed little girls, soldiers... everything else it clangs against? And I mean the clang is present throughout the episodes after this one so... why? Seriously, why only this scene?

img440()

Actually, I was wrong. It happens against the trolls in both the episode before and after this one. Still, why only against the trolls and ogres?

img440()

""Oh my god they did Raksas PERFECTLY. And in full 2D! Wait no, the only reason why they would do that is if this is his only appearance in what they're covering of the arc.""

I was correct. Berserk 2017 is only covers a part of the Millennium Falcon arc. Unfortunate, but was to be expected. There was no way we were ever gonna get to the boat. Or the !World Transformation.!



Was kind of really surprised that we even got to see the Abyss. You know, since both times it actually appears other than this time, have always been skipped over by various Berserk adaptations. It's what he says in the manga too, but I could only stifle a laugh when Guts says ""he's seen it before"" in Berserk 2017. Yeah, we could have seen the introduction of it if they hadn't decided to just skip everything else to just get to Conviction with Berserk 2016.

It's fine, really. The entire main theme of the first review was me ranting about them leaving things out from the manga. I shouldn't be annoyed that they actually included something, even if they left out the actual introduction or explanation of the thing they included.



For the full experience, only click on the above link while wearing headphones and having volume up to full blast.

I had thought they were going a little bit crazy with this in the first season. Almost every single time Guts appears or steps out with the Dragonslayer, Hai Yo starts to play. I know it's Susumu Hirasawa and he's a [walking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-et5qY46rQ) [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwZTl5-7VYk) [god](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjPJm55cTm0), but there is such a thing as overuse. I honestly think that GEMBA and co. honestly couldn't afford a full Susumu Hirasawa OST like [some other Berserk adaptations](https://anilist.co/anime/33/KenpuuDenkiBerserk) or maybe Susumu Hirasawa was like...

""No, you can have TWO songs. Only two. Because I don't want people to associate my music with... well, with this.""

img440()

And quite honestly, I can't blame the man if that was actually true. He probably felt obligated because apart from Satoshi Kon's stuff (which are all winners by the way, [especially this](https://anilist.co/anime/1943/Paprika)) and [this](https://anilist.co/anime/1178/DetonatorOrgun), the only series he's ever done music for is Berserk.

Like if they had just tried a bit harder with the OST, they wouldn't have had to rely on Hirasawa's Hai Yo and Ash Crow. With season two, I guess they felt that they needed to experiment because on two separate occasions, both early as well as later in the season, they suddenly just bust out some jazz.

...Jazz? In Berserk? You... you did watch the previous Berserk adaptations right? You did... you did listen to[ the music Susumu Hirasawa did for Berserk before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew3--XVFioU), right? Why in the fuck would you ever think jazz would be a good idea to trips over a stack of conveniently placed frying pans

But no really, jazz aside, almost the entire OST is totally forgettable and that's just... honestly one of my least favorite parts of the entire series. Maybe I'm just biased because of how much I love the 97 series/Susumu Hirasawa. But no really... there's Hai Yo, [Ash Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mva6nc7YBpk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTfjg2LYquY), [Blood and Guts (but that's from the 2012 movies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC7H1rOU1Gg), some generic metal and/or horror sounding stuff, and that's basically the entire OST that I can even barely remember at this point.

Well actually, there was also [My Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr6BMiHMPtI). Which was quite good, but for some reason every time I hear it, I just think I've heard it from somewhere else. Oh right, it's actually a remix and [from the 2012 MOVIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrcMRq7saA). But it's fine really. Why even try to do something new when you can just rely on the music from past adaptations? Just be sure to get Susumu Hirasawa to do at least a few songs, and then use those as much as humanly possible until people literally get sick of it.

I honestly truly liked Hai Yo early on in the first season. It's literally one of the handful of reasons why I and several others stuck around. People were literally trying to construct Hai Yo each week when they played snippets of it before Hirasawa's new Berserk album with it even came out. But I can safely say despite it being a Hirasawa song, because of how much they relied on it, I wouldn't mind if I never heard it ever again.

Oh yeah. I almost want to genuinely applaud them for apparently at least having enough sense to go with Ash Crow with the Berserker Armor reveal. Because I genuinely was preparing myself for a completely out of place Hai Yo. Hai Yo does not fit the Berserker Armor or even the Grunbeld fight in general for that matter. It's supposed to be a fucking hugely dread and violent struggle against this gigantic Apostle fire dragon, and Guts has now been put in a suit that will essentially force him to continue fighting as his bones break because the armor will literally dig into his flesh and repair his body enough to where he will still be able to move.

img440()

I was going to applaud them, but then in the actual fight, Hai Yo starts on full blast the moment Schierke helps Berserker Guts get back in control of the armor. Like immediately the moment you can see Guts' eyes through the armor, Hai Yo starts. Yeah, no that's okay, Hai Yo definitely fits for a severe and desperate battle against an inhuman monster... or trolls, or ogres... and it also fits for when Guts steps out to brutally kill a bunch of just normal human soldiers. It fits for everything, so why not use it for everything. 

Oh hey, got an idea. Here's [an idea of how Guardians of Desire (from that little unimportant arc of the manga, you know, the very first one which they mangled entirely, THE BLACK SWORDSMAN ARC) would play out if it would ever be animated (it won't) and it's animated by Milleplease and GEMBA (I hope it won't)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxnWn0JmdhI). Again as always, thanks goes out to the Berserk meme community [which yes, is a thing,](https://www.reddit.com/r/berserklejerk/) who I know for a fact LOVED Berserk 2016 and Berserk 2017 because it gave them so much material.




I think in general, the CG for most of the monsters is fine. Some of the CG Apostles are iffy at best, but at least they got Grunbeld down okay. 



Which I suppose is the absolute bare minimum because when you say ""we're gonna adapt Falcon of the Millennium"" to a Berserk fan, immediately their minds are going to jump to ""Oh God, how bad is the Grunbeld fight/Berserker Armor going to look?"" and I hate to say it but... the fight itself was okay. I'd still take what [a random Berserk fan could edit together from past adaptations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THLrGbLUAw&t=229s) over it for a billion years, though. 

""The PS2 game looks better"" is not just a silly meme, holy shit. Admittedly, he also threw some of the Berserk Musou's (which came out literally thirteen years after the PS2 game) cutscenes in there for what was missing from the PS2 game.

img440()

""There he is. The best Apostle of all of Berserk, animated. My boy, Schnoz.""

Also, can I just take a moment to say that... from season one, I hated Millehack and GEMBA's tendency to put credits over scenes? I didn't even bother to mention it the first time around, but this time, they actually did it with one of my favorite parts of this arc, and probably one of my overall favorite panels of Berserk in its entirety.

One of the better scenes of the episode and Berserk 2016/2017 in general, hey let's put fucking CREDITS OVER IT.



...I really like this scene, and even how they did it. Like seeing Guts' party through Guts' eyes while in the Berserker Armor and their panicked voices being distorted... but, sure yeah, let's put the credits over this scene. No big deal. But would they have ever put credits over ""Guts fights trolls as Hai Yo gets blasted""?

Nope, not in a MILLION FUCKING YEARS.

img440()



Episode 9 or Episode 21

There's no way this wasn't gonna get a section for itself. The very slight improvement of this season puts you off guard, and then wham. There's no excuse for this, really. Are we still at ""it's better than nothing""? How far does the rabbit hole go?

youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHt3xszL9wg)

Disclaimer: That Hai Yo is for comedic effect because again, Ash Crow plays on the immediate reveal of the Berserker Armor, not Hai Yo.

I honestly did not think they could top that episode in Berserk 2016 with the cult orgy which was [really really bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUoA0xyWvc). This is the episode where the Berserker Armor is revealed and it's just absolutely awful. I know that they probably saved all their money and time for the Berserker Armor itself as well as the impending Grunbeld fight (there was a recap episode the week following this episode as if to underline that fact) but oh dear god.

Like obviously they were not prepared to actually have to animate Apostles all of a sudden. Especially not several in the same episode. Apostles just sort of suddenly transitioning into their Apostle forms is just... unforgivable. It's even worse that they actually did it with Zodd too. You know, [considering we've seen him transform before](https://youtu.be/h63YO1cInQM?t=4m18s)...

This episode is so bad that it honestly... like if this episode wasn't anywhere near as bad as it was, I would have probably put Berserk 2017 actually above Berserk 2016. But the overall incompetence of this episode alone has dragged it back down into the mud where it belongs with its sibling.




img500()




img440()

""I can't believe they decided to end with the introduction of the cartoon pirates. The Grunbeld Fight, the Boat... both of the best spots where they could have ended it, they decided to go with the Pirates instead. I just can't believe this. Oh well, I'm fine with them just ending here rather than rushing any further to get to something else...""

img440()

""Yeah, all's well that ends well... let's just get to the credits... I'm sure we'll get to see the rest of this arc animated never. Because there's literally no fucking way there'll be a season three...""

img440()

""...Excuse me? Aren't we ending here? What is going on?""

img440()

""...After twenty four episodes, you're doing this now.""



""...You're finally giving us a full 2D non-flashback scene at the very end of the adaptation. With very little chance of a season three happening and even if it did, the CG would be back in full force just like it was with this time.""

img440()

""...Not only did you wait until now to do this, but you decided to have the credits run over this scene.""



""...You cracked and you decided to give us what we wanted from the very beginning, but you simultaneously still managed to ruin it.""



""...I just don't understand. I can't even begin to try and wrap my head around it.""

img440()


[""...""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7azRQ1jDx0)
 




...I never want to talk about this adaptation ever again. And thankfully, it seems like I won't have to.

img440()

Because if they were gonna do a season three, I don't see why they would have put ""the story continues"" because that just reads like ""just go read the manga, dudes"". This adaptation was a very mixed bag until the very end, but Berserk 2017 did... feel kind of better than Berserk 2016. But part of that for me is because again, with this season, they were starting as well as ending in Falcon of the Millennium. Berserk 2016 started with a VERY LIGHT touch of Black Swordsman stuff, and just skipped full steam to straight up Conviction. Which... infuriated, and still infuriates me.

If it wasn't for that one really trainwreck of an episode, I'd give this season like a 65 out of 100. But instead, a 6 out of 10 is a fine. The exact same score I gave to Berserk 2016 which is admittedly still on an overall basis worse than this.

So yeah, to conclude, [go watch Teekyuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e23qODH79c4). I genuinely only watched Teekyuu because of Berserk 2016 because I wanted to have a look into the other anime Millepensee had done and... you'd be surprised. It was pretty enjoyable and I will in fact be watching the ninth season, and I hope there are many more because I'd rather Millepensee keep going than the [ICLA guys](https://anilist.co/studio/6078/ILCA) with [Yami Shibai](https://anilist.co/anime/98978/YamiShibai5).

Am I really beginning and ending a Berserk review with Teekyuu shilling? Yes, yes I am. Teekyuu forever."
21710,"Did I say in my season three review that the focus point is reminiscing the past? Yes, I did. Strangely enough, season four is also about the past. Do I want to change what I said about season three? Absolutely not.

If you have read all of my reviews for the past three season for Natsume Yuujinchou, then you probably know what is coming next. Yes, a synopsis because Anilist wants us to meet the minimum number of characters of 2200. So, you can go ahead and skip the synopsis because I am pretty sure that by now, you should know what the anime is all about.

Natsume Yuujinchou follows a teenage boy called Natsume Takashi on his every day life, from school to bonding with his friends. However, he has the ability to see and communicate with youkais due to his inherited high spiritual powers. Part of his daily life revolves around getting to know the youkais, learning their stories, helping them with their problems, tying up loose ends his late grandmother left behind, and returning the names his grandmother took from them. 

Right, with the synopsis done, it's time to delve into season four's review. As I mentioned in my opening, season three and four has a very similar theme. If you did read my season three review, and also watched the season, the series does focus on the youkais reminiscing about the past. It was heartbreaking to a certain point as the youkais did not really understand the fragility of human lifespan. Again, the series set to remind us in season three that humans are not the only creatures in the world who has emotions.

Alas, season three was only the beginning. In season four, the series is going to throw you into the abyss of memories. Okay, may be I am exaggerating but flashbacks are more common in this season. Apart from being drown in memories, we will also be thrown deeper into the world of exorcism. While it is not uncommon to find Natsume constantly in trouble with the youkais in general, this season is stretching the limit of how much trouble he could get into, from being kidnapped and being trapped to playing stand-in.

Trust me, you would want to watch this season intently because of all of the hilarious moments you can get. I couldn't get enough of this season, to be honest...

With that being said, season four does not have much lore progression to say, except that we get to learn more about Natsume's past, and also the Matoba clan. However, this seems to be the start of more lore drop regarding the Natsume family."
98349,"- This review is being written under a subjective lens and mainly enjoyment. 

- If you come to expect opinions from a very critical sense, wrong place. A lot of people online come to expect reviews as such, this review ain’t gonna be like that. I just like to talk about anime I enjoy. And so this review is about such things. Sorry if this ain't what you're looking for.

- I’ll try to keep spoilers to a minimum!




- I assume that you’ve already watched Love Live Sunshine Season 1 before reading this to see what the second season is like or just to gather my opinion.

- I assume that you’ve already watched the previous season of Love Live School Idol Project Season 1, Season 2, and the Movie as they’re sort of required before going into Sunshine.




An important note - apparently, the anime adaptation of Aqours and the idol unit of Aqours are different!  

This review will be focusing on the anime adaptation of Aqours only!!  I suggest not dismissing the idol unit if the anime adaptation leaves a poor taste in your mouth.  And if you liked the anime adaptation, go check out the idol unit.  Some of the songs are quite nice!




This review is going to be heavily biased as you’ll see from the eventual score.  The score is reflected based on my enjoyment.

What’s my score?  It’s a 10/10.  Before downvoting and assuming I'm a complete fanboy, hear me out. 

This score was because I cannot deny my feelings have gotten swept up off its feet.  To me, this is a very flawed masterpiece.  There are some things I can forgive because I got emotional chills, and some tears were shed.  To me, getting any feeling of emotional chills warrants a 10 because most media don’t get such a response out of me. For others, a 10 will be a different definition which is completely valid and fair.  Hence why I mentioned this is a subjective review and probably why you should search out for more opinions on the show then eventually form your own by watching it.

This show... has many many flaws that I think will trouble many people and in this review, I’ll point out everything that worked for me but also point out things I think will trouble many people or find this anime adaptation inadequate or even downright bad to some.




These following points will address aspects of either story, tone, performance, music, and/or animation.

- Positive: I particularly enjoyed the individual stories of each individual member while also seeing how it pushes the group to develop.  There wasn’t anything outstanding personally but it was entertaining and nothing offended me.  The way it was able to pivot both introducing the character conflict and the group development was quite nice.

Like in School Idol Project (SiP) with Muse, the first season is done to introduce each character and introduce conflicts for the group to overcome as they form as a group while also competing in Love Live.  In its second season, it uses its time to have character-focused episodes to learn or develop their characters while also moving the plot along.  This format is also used in Sunshine.  The second season focuses on certain characters as we learn about who they are and their struggles while pushing the plot along.

- Negative: There are certainly some bold storytelling decisions in two particular episodes.  I will not spoil what in particular.  Just that some things caught me off guard in mainly a bad way.  Some of it suffered from poor pacing in the episode and some of it suffered from poor execution, story logic, and directing in general.

- Positive: Incredibly memeable like in SiP but it gets turned up to 11 at times.  Found it entertaining and random at times.  For others, this might be a detriment to its second season and its characters.

- Negative: The balance of comedy and seriousness… it was more serious than comedy I find.  If you don’t like this new balancing act, I totally understand.  I was getting tired of the seriousness at times and hoped for some lighthearted moments.  While the show was able to sprinkle in lighthearted comedic moments, the main focus was always serious.

- Negative: In respect to the previous point about the balance.  I think it was because I was binging it but I’ll be honest, I’m sure I would’ve caught this all the same.  They repeat certain lines and points… a lot.  You can probably make a drinking game or a bingo game out of how repetitive it gets with certain points.  While I understand the repetition comes from it being important and really pushes the group further and further, it can also lose out on some viewers who aren’t invested in what they’re doing.  For me, I didn’t pay much mind but I can see how it can annoy certain individuals.  For those type of individuals, maybe have this show not as your main focus when watching anime and use it as a side-thing.  If you’re completely invested, by all means binge it all.

- Neutral: There was so many cheesy moments.  I got susceptible to the cheese and went along with it by the second half but if you cannot get invested, this will be seen as a huge detriment.  I think the cheesy moments were great by the end personally.

- Positive: Since we saw how the group formed in Season 1.  Season 2 has them develop more as a group and we see their performances get more complex/developed as a result.  The performances were great and consistent, to me - it kept on upping the performance quality as it went along which I think is a very important attribute for trying to win Love Live.  

For Love Live as a series, I value the performance because I find the performances very entertaining.  I really adore the costumes, choreography, the lighting, the stage, the song, and the characters during said performance.  I wasn’t disappointed by any of the performances here personally.  As it went along, it kept on getting better and something I could rewatch without any issue.

- Positive: The Final episode.  I was super satisfied because of a few reasons.  One - it was able to display a few story beats that I felt was missing in SiP and wanted to see animated.  Two - I related to certain story beats and it was a sort of a nice cathartic moment for me personally.  Three - the nostalgic moments really got to me haha.  Four - I got a satisfied ending versus my dissatisfaction with SiP TV endings (SiP movie was great and Sunshine S1 was fine for me).  Considering there was a lot of satisfaction with this final episode, it heavily swayed my score.  Maybe this is recency bias but I feel good vibes after finishing the series.

- Positive: Music is phenomenal.  They were so entertaining and well-done!  I really loved listening to many of the songs in this season in particular.

- Negative: the lyrics themes are really repetitive for the majority of songs.  Pay attention to the lyrics and you’ll notice the theme is all quite derivative of one main theme.  While it’s not bad, I personally found it lacking variety until much later.  Your perception of the lyrics to the song will depend on your tolerance to the show’s story and the songs in general.

- Positive: VAs performance was quite good.  I enjoyed every single line delivered.  The script was… repetitive but they did what they could at times especially with those running gags.

- Positive: Further inclusion of rivals in the story.  I really wanted to see more of this and while it was brief, considering the pacing of the show in general.  It surprised me how I saw more of the rivals so I saw it as a positive.

- Positive: Animation never faltered.  While there were some shortcuts implemented, some copy and paste, and some cuts.  When there was a scene that required good quality visuals, Sunrise studios delivered especially in its second half.  The second half is quite important I find considering the story beats it was going down.  You can expect the same quality and maybe more in this second season in comparison to the first season.




This show has ran, stumbled, got back-up, ran again, and stumbled.  It’s like a school idol essentially but this time, it’s a veteran school idol.  From the same writing team as School Idol Project, they’ve refined the formula to a tee and added new things that improved certain aspects.  I’ve noticed the differences have definitely helped in some respects but also failed in others.

Sunshine has many flaws that I believe most people will take issue with in terms of many different aspects.  If you cannot get through the show or outright hate it, I don't blame you and I believe it will not get better for you by the end of it all.  It maintains the same directing style throughout.

For those who don’t mind the flaws, can tolerate the flaws, or even see the flaws - this show will meet your expectations and beyond.  If you’re invested like I was, you’ll have no issue with the flaws and enjoy the show for what it is.

Overall, this series left a satisfying taste in my mouth.  I think it’ll change in the future, emotional chills change as you change as an individual but to commemorate my first watch-through, this show scores a 10.  

Again, if you haven’t checked out the songs from the Aqours idol unit, check it out.  I get such a different feel versus the anime.  It’s a nice change of pace.

I’ll be heading off into the movie and most likely checking out the new Love Live anime announced.  If you managed to make it to the end of the review here, thanks for reading up on it and I hope it was informative in regards to my reasoning.  From there, you might’ve gotten more value for your time, maybe, haha.  See ya!

 Yousoro!"
1571,"16 year old Mai Taniyama is a happy-go-lucky orphan who loves to hang out with her friends in creepy places and trade ghost stories with them. One evening, as they’re doing this in an empty classroom, they’re interrupted by Kazuya Shibuya, a paranormal researcher who’s been hired to investigate the old, abandoned school house next door. Well, prompted by this, Mai decides to explore the building herself, upon which she accidentily damages both Kazuya’s camera as well as his camera-man. In lieu of a proper monetary compensation, Mai agrees to work with Kazuya as his assistant, and after one case, she gets hired full time! Now, as a member of Shibuya Psychic Research, she’ll have to face off against cruel curses, petty poltergeists, and dastardly demons for the sake of her handsome… But extremely difficult… New employer.

For the most part, Ghost Hunt looks like it was animated on a bare bones budget. There are static images, key frames, and some stiff, jerky movements. This is nothing new from JC Staff, a production company who normally only “makes it rain” on a few select titles, like Index, Railgun and Toradora. Ghost Hunt is not one of these titles, but luckily, where JC Staff normally shines is using its inspired art direction to cover up the blandness of their animation. In Ghost Hunt’s case, this is achieved with clever and well-thought out camera angles, distortions wherever they’re needed, and a series of perfectly timed panning shots. The character designs are also very memorable, despite being a little on the generic side.

Remember, I said “For the most part.” In addition to the cheap looking human side of the coin, you also have the hauntings themselves, most of which will take your breath away with their flawless CG design. There are moments in this show that look like they could have been taken right out of Mushishi, and that’s one of the many comparisons I don’t make lightly. In a lot of cases, it would bother me when a series was this inconsistent with it’s animation quality, but in Ghost Hunt, it kind of works… Rather than a difference in budget sizes, it seems to represent a difference in plains of reality, and while that may or may not have been intentional, it’s exactly how the difference between the human world and the spiritual world SHOULD feel.

The characters, despite their somewhat bland design, are distinct and very likeable. Mai is a normal girl… And I mean normal by actual human standards, not normal by Nami Hito standards. There’s nothing moe or Mary-Suish about her, and that’s a pretty easy pit to sink into. She’s brave, but also naive and prone to making mistakes. She’s aware of when she’s in danger, but often needs help getting out of it, and never seems to make any head-slappingly stupid decisions. She never makes a habit of denying her feelings, either… Which is another unfortunate pit that a lot of anime heroines inhabit.

Kazuya, on the other hand, can be a bit of a problem sometimes. I won’t say he’s a poorly written character… Not completely, anyway… But his flaws seem to overshadow his more positive attributes. He’s silent, he’s cold, and while he needs help dealing with any situation that’s out of the range of his particular skill set, he’s remarkably competent. On his own, he’s not very interesting, and as such, his likeability stems almost exclusively from his interactions with other characters. His prideful and prickly demeanor are only ever palatable when he’s bouncing off of the more charming and open people he associates with, particularly in his reactions with Mai and the famous medium Masako. I mean, would he be nearly as enjoyable a character if Mai hadn’t decided to start calling him Naru the Narcissist?

Oh, and while we’re at it, I should probably address this… Yes, I took my name from this anime. I was originally calling myself Narcy as a quick nickname, but my friends/video producers said it was too girly, so I decided to adopt the infamous moniker from this anime instead. Moving on.

If you’ve seen this show in English, then you may be asking “Wait, if Kazuya isn’t that great of a character, then why did I love him so much?” The answer is simple; Todd Haberkorn. The dub was produced by Funimation, and the staff somehow made the far-left-field decision to put a grumpy, mono-toned character in the hands of one of the loudest, most over the top performers in their stable. The result is nothing short of pure gold. Todd’s rubber voice is famous for such ridiculous yet still perfectly pegged roles such as Death the Kidd, Italy, Natsu Dragnheel and Sergeant Frog, but he’s also able to go very low and serious with it, as he did with Ling Yao from FMA Brotherhood. But even in THAT performance, he never went AS low and serious as he did in this one. He sounds every bit the socially inept genius with a chip on his shoulder, and he manages to outshine the original seiyuu by adding an air of superiority and some great sarcastic wit without ever breaking character or changing pitch.

Cherami Leigh is also quite a bit better than her seiyuu, thanks to a set of acting chops that have carried her very far in her career since this show. She has complete control over Mai’s voice, and hits every single note… Whether dramatic, comedic, upbeat or downbeat… Perfectly. It’s a very sincere performance, and while it may not have been the one that made her a star, it makes it very clear why she became one. The rest of the main cast is also spot-on, with Travis Willingham as the laid back, reliable Monk, Colleen Clinkenbeard as the hoity toity yet somewhat maternal Ayako, and J Michael Tatum getting surprisingly scarce lines as Naru’s even more silent bodyguard, Lin, yet still knocking each line out of the park. Cherami’s fellow Strike Witches alumnus Jad Saxton joins her here, and once again, they’re rivals for love!

The only real sour note in the dub is Jason Leibricht’s phony sounding australian accent, but give it a few episodes, and you’ll get used to it. Several other well known names are sprinkled around the cast, including recurring roles from Caitlin Glass, Brina Palencia, and Eric Vale. The writing in the dub is very naturalistic and straightforward, which is odd when you consider the fact that the credited writer keeps changing… Sonny Straight’s episodes can sound a little off, but everybody else did a fine job, especially when Luci Christian and Monica Rial are at the helm. The subbed version is great on it’s own, and perfectly listenable, but in my opinion, the dub is still quite a bit better, and has my easy recommendation.

Unfortunately, the writing is a bit of a mixed bag. The characters do gradually develop from a group of bickering strangers into a tightly-knit family by the end of the series, but the only one who gets any good individual development is Mai. The other researchers, representing the spiritual perspectives of their respective religions, seem like they’re only present in every single arc so they can pad out the run time and occasionally become useful to the plot… Which, to be fair, every single one of them does, at least at some point or another. But for the most part, it’s really hard to justify their presence beyond their assorted talents. There are a lot of interactions between them that serve to develop their family dynamic, and while most of them are executed nicely, there are a few that do feel forced or out of place, with one example being a highly emotional discussion of Hong Kong history between Mai and Lin.

As far as the development of the two central characters goes, Mai and Naru go through an interesting parallel… Throughout the series, we slowly become exposed to the true nature of each character, as well as to the supernatural powers that each one possesses. This works very well in Mai’s case, because she’s learning everything while we’re learning it… Her new discoveries and developments are shared with us on the same level. But unlike Mai, Naru already knows what he’s capable of, and yet his abilities develop at a slower pace. Yes, there’s an excuse made for it at the end, but even with that given, it still feels like a deus ex machina whenever he pulls a spell or piece of information out of his ass at just the right time.

Yes, there are issues with the writing and character development, and while they’re not serious issues, they are very noticeable. Luckily, there are two specific things this show does so brilliantly that all other transgressions can be all but ignored. The first one, as you may notice early on, is the music. Toshio Masuda’s compositions are by far the best aspect of this series, as he matches the tone of any given situation with not only tense orchestral tunes, with stings and percussions blaring, but with an electronic track that, in it’s creepiest moments, seems to have been heavily inspired by the undisputed king of horror music, the theremin. Toshio’s the same man who composed Mushishi, and to say it shows would be an understatement. I could honestly say that Ghost Hunt wouldn’t be even half as creepy or heartpounding in it’s terror if it wasn’t for his work.

The other saving grace is the pacing of the series, and there are two sides to this. The first is with the individual story arcs, which are built up very well from beginning to end, if not a little repetitive. You’ll start off with a light hearted summary of where the cast is in their development, and it won’t take too long for a new case to be introduced. You’ll get a brief summary of what the case is, but the devil is in the details, which will be revealed piece by piece throughout. The tension builds, as do the stakes, and Masuda’s music keeps perfectly in tune with this, right up until the climactic conclusion… Which fails to be climactic only once or twice due to Naru’s exposition dumps. There’s foreshadowing throughout each arc, and it can take the form of anything… An odd piece of dialogue, a suspicious camera angle, or even a cleverly placed set piece. The astute viewer will have no problem noticing these, and while it does bring an element of predictability to the show, it never gives away more than it wants to.

The other side is with the structure of the series itself, and the order of the story arcs resting within it. Yes, there are a few arcs in the first half that feel tame compared to what comes later, but that’s the beauty of it… Every single arc, with the exception of one filler episode, just gets better and better. They progressively become more creepy, more tense, less predictable, more disturbing, and with ever-increasing stakes, leading up to what most viewers consider the crowning jewel of the series… the penultimate arc, The Bloodstained Labyrinth, which takes a lot of acknowledged inspiration from the real life legends of Vlad Tepesh, Countess Bathory and the Winchester manor. It’s easy to see why this arc is as popular as it is, considering how hardcore and well-established the enemy is, but I’d have to confess a strong preference to the final arc, The Cursed House. The consequences are similar, but the stakes are much higher, and it carries a much heavier lean towards eastern mythology than it’s predecessor.

Unfortunately, this arc has the bad luck of being the final one, so it carries a substantial amount of the blame for one of Ghost Hunt’s biggest problems, which would be it’s lack of a satisfying conclusion. Or, you know, any kind of conclusion. Several plot threads are just left dangling there, with the relationship between Mai and Naru… as well as the true nature of their respective powers… being no small part of it. It doesn’t necessarily end on a bad note, but it leaves you hungry for a sequel that hasn’t yet been confirmed after seven years of waiting. It’s a ‘read the manga’ type of ending, but since the translated manga’s out of print and I hate streaming them, that’s a problem for me.

Ghost Hunt offers a very unique experience for horror fans… It contains all the thrill and suspense of a normal paranormal investigation show, but since it actually ADMITS that it’s scripted, it’s able to offer solid scares and a solid story without ever feeling like it’s wasting your time. It has several weak points, particularly in it’s writing and character development, but the execution and art direction are strong enough to make up for it many times over. It’s positive aspects far outweigh the negative ones, and for the most part, you can watch this series with your brain on or off and still have a great time with it. I give Ghost Hunt an 8/10, and a strong recommendation to pick it up if you’re looking for an outstanding horror title to entertain you throughout the spookiest time of year."

Ok, we got the stupid out of the way, now I'm going to proceed to try to convince you that this show is more than just boobs, butts, and pointless fanservice. 

- My point being

Harukana Receive is an anime about relationships, and how to build and grow them while overcoming hardships together with your partner. To do this, the show uses it's whole beach volleyball theme perfectly as it takes advantage of the fact that the sport is played in pairs to create a pretty obvious metaphor for human conections, even going as far as treating them as importantly as romantic or familial bonds. While this might seem a little comedic at first, the fact that they abstract that meaning helps the show to convey the hardships that one might go through while trying to connect with somebody else while still maintaining a pretty calm vibe that would otherwise have to be put on hold while the whole drama is being worked through. 


- Relationship conveyed through beach volleyball

As I said, this show likes to use sport pairs as a metaphor for human bonds, that is mostly seen in Kana's whole arc with Narumi, where the two were pretty great together, but eventually separated because they were simply incompatible, as Kanna needed someone that encouraged her to see past her flaws and be more confident, thing that Narumi couldn't be as she just was a reminder for how little talent Kanna had. That person she needed ended up being her cousin Haruka, who with a combination of being upbeat as heck and overall just caring deeply about Kanna's well being managed to bring out the better of her and show her true potential. 

Notice how I explained all of that without using any term involving volleyball at all, this show uses it as a mean to tell a story with certain themes, it's not the center of attention, but it doesn't detract from the main point. 
And now that I have made that clear, let's talk about the elephant in the room.


- This is not Haikyuu goddammit 

Of course, if we're talking about volleyball themed anime, you eventually get to the comparison with the  absolute powerhouse that is Production IG's little golden goose, and not to try to deminish Haikyuu I myself really like the series and it's even one of my favorites of all time, but while all that is said, I would be really inclined to say that Harukana Receive is close, if not in the same level of quality than Haikyuu... Hey, bring down those pitchforks and let me explain myself... 

I know, I know... it isn't as hype as Haikyuu, it doesn't have the massive cast of polished characters that Haikyuu has, and the animation is abysmal if we compare it to what IG is capable of doing. But, as I said earlier, in this show volleyball is just a means to tell a story and all the fanfare and hype that comes with a sports anime is tossed aside for a more chill and relaxed vibe that is reinforced by the show's art style and sound direction (More on that later) which deviate themselves from the usual sharp characters and bombastic soundtrack for a cuter character design and more calm soundtrack, all that to ultimately separate itself from being the usual hypetrain that sports anime tend to be, and set it's tone more closely to a character drama like Hibike Euphonium, or Anohana. 

That's basically why I think that it can get away with not having as good animation as anime like Haikyuu or Hanebado, since it's scope is more centered in it's slice of life elements, I think it's allowed to lack that. Not that this show never gets hype or anything, it's just that it gets you invested through it's characters and what they're trying to accomplish and prays that you're invested enough to care about what's happening on screen, and for me, it managed to achieve that.


-  It's really freaking pretty and the soundtrack is one of my favorites

Yeah... basically that... not much else to say, the art direction is really good in my opinion, if we take into account everything that I have said so far, it delivers on what one would want with this type of shows, and it's OST has this tropical vibe that goes perfectly with it's setting. Gotta be honest, between Rasmus Faber (This show's composer) and Kevin Penkin (Made in Abyss's composer) western composers are prooving they can put up some pretty memorable pieces.


Before ending up the review I'm going to quickly adress the fact that, even after all the good things I said, this is still an Ecchi show, so if you don't like Fanservice in any way, shape or form, I get why you wouldn't like this. I personally think it's done in a way that doesn't detract from the experience, but hey that (And really everything that I have said up until now) is just my opinion.

To finally end this, I want to say I really think that this anime should get more attention, and I hope that my review pushed you to think more about it's good points than it's flaws. And if you read this without watching the show, I hope it pushed you to watch it."

Do you just want to know if you should watch the darn show?
Me too.

SPOILS PLOT POINTS FROM PREVIOUS SEASONS

As long as you do not watch the last 4:50 of the final episode (or stop watching at around 21:05), Oreimo is a show that is better than it has any right being. After that point, it is immortalized forever in the anime hall of fame as possibly the biggest troll in the “romancing your little sister” genre. 

If you’re looking at this review I assume you’ve seen at least one episode of Oreimo before. Imagine that, but change absolutely nothing. It looks exactly the same.

Again, it sounds exactly the same as the previous seasons. I was never blown away by the Oreimo EDs unless they starred my literal goddess Kuroneko, and fortunately the first ED is sung by her. The other two are not, and I didn’t find them especially good. 

A big chunk of the plot consists of almost every girl Kyousuke has ever laid eyes on confessing their love for him. Each girl has their last moment in the sun before leaving so that Kyousuke and Kirino can be together. I hope it’s not a spoiler to say that in a show that translates to My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute, the little sister wins. There's lots of other scenes that can't be talked about without actually spoiling, but just know that there is a mix of super spicy drama, super emotional romance, and super sad scenes. Season 1 was basically a glorified documentary about otaku, season 2 shifted focus to a more romance/drama oriented series, and these final 3 episodes definitely follow season 2's course. 

As mentioned previously, something happens at about the 21 minute mark of the last episode that changes the show completely. It’ll either make you laugh your head off or throw whatever you’re holding at the screen.

Before this, I wasn’t really impressed with Kyousuke as a character. But here he shows what he’s made of. He shows that spine that most harem protagonists lack. 
Kirino was 100% tsun and 0% dere at the start of the show, but over time the walls she put up were whittled down to the point where her brattiness became tolerable. I never really liked Kirino much, but she is probably at her best here. 
Kuroneko had some great scenes that broke my heart and will remain best girl until the day I die. 
I was confused for a long time about why Manami was even included in this show but I finally got my answer here. She plays one of the most important roles in the show, and her climactic scene will either make you love her or hate her.   

I don’t think you watch Oreimo for the deep messages and thought provoking themes. The show spits in your face at the very end anyway, so every theme it presented thus far is also spit on. Truly a modern masterpiece. 

If you liked the ending of Oreimo, check out Darling In The Franxx. 
Otherwise, check out other incest related shows such as Eromanga Sensei or Domestic Girlfriend or KissxSis or A Sister’s All You Need or Yosuga No Sora or Koi Kaze or the Alfheim arc of SAO or I’m In Love With My Sister or OniAi or 

I loved this show and then all of a sudden I REALLY didn’t. The ending is one of the most infamous bamboozles of all time and leaves a sour taste in my mouth but every time I think back on it I can’t help but laugh at how huge the author’s balls must have been and how naive I was to expect anything better."
1829,"Patricide.

Yeah, I said it. Just keep that word in mind while I rattle off some backstory for this thing. 

Tales From Earthsea (2006) is generally considered the worst Studio Ghibli movie, which I guess is no longer the case now that Earwig and the Witch (2020) exists. The biggest thing that these two movies have in common, apart from being disappointing, is that they are directed by Goro Miyazaki, son of Hayao Miyazaki, who really still has no business directing an animated feature. 

But let’s backtrack. How did Goro end up in his first role? How did this movie come to be? Spoilers ahead for the inner workings of Goro's mind.

Hayao Miyazaki had been writing to Ursula K Le Guin for like thirty years, begging and pleading for the opportunity to adapt her series of Earthsea books to film. Because she thought Ghibli was the Japanese Disney, she always told him to leave her alone… until, like, twenty years later, when she watched My Neighbour Totoro (1988) and realised she had to get on that Miyazaki train. He was a legitimate auteur, and his style fit Earthsea to a tee! She contacted Ghibli and even sanctioned off this period in between the first and second Earthsea books, allowing them to basically do whatever they wanted. This was perfect for a director like Miyazaki, who prefers to do his own thing with source material rather than stick to a rigid adaptation. 

Unfortunately, by this point Miyazaki was messing with Diana Jones’ Howl’s Moving Castle (1986) (traitor!) and totally 100% trust-me-on-this-one retiring soon, so he wasn’t available. Toshio Suzuki, former president of Ghibli, decided it would be a fantastic idea to contact Miyazaki’s son and smooth-talk the kid into doing Earthsea instead, thereby turning one of the most beloved and respected children’s series into a long and ambitious film. You know, putting aside the fact that he’d never drawn a frame in his life and all. 

Goro got done dirty. The fact that he ended up directing Tales From Earthsea is nothing less than an astonishing act of nepotism that was wholly undeserved and entirely irresponsible, but it wasn’t as if he demanded the job. He started as a mere consultant. Before that, he was off studying landscape design, convinced that he hated animation. 

But really, he just hated his dad. You see, Hayao Miyazaki was always busy with his movies, so Goro didn’t have the best relationship with him growing up. It was only after he was roped into designing some part of the Ghibli museum that he realised he might actually have some latent love for the medium, stating [in his blog](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/earthsea/blog/index.html) that “I had discovered within myself a love of animation which, because of my relationship with my father, I had pretended for a long time not to notice, until now.” He also had a special affinity to the Earthsea series, having grown up with the books. 

Alas, it was a rocky journey. Miyazaki senior was furious that someone with no directorial experience was occupying such an important role. He threw this big tantrum, planned an animator strike as an act of elaborate sabotage, and barely talked to his son during what had to be the most stressful period of the kid’s life. What a guy. Father of the century. Against insurmountable odds, Goro finished the movie on schedule. 

It wasn’t exactly a roaring success. His father talked a bunch of shit, Ursula K Le Guin talked a bunch more shit, and fans were pretty underwhelmed. He even received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Movie, beating out Sinking of Japan (2006), which is literally an adaptation Japan Sinks (1973) without Masaaki Yuasa's artsy shit tricking you into thinking it's good. 

You have to feel a bit sorry for Goro.

Anyway, I sit down to watch this movie, fully expecting it to suck (and, by all means, it kind of does). There are some random dragons flying around, this generic fantasy setting that doesn’t really capture the Earthsea magic… and then this kid just straight-up murders his father. That’s it. That’s the opener. 

As the movie goes on, we learn his father was a “great man” who made the kid feel intensely inadequate; however, because the dad was the king of our generic fantasy country, we can assume he didn’t have all that much to do with his attention-craving son (until said son took a sword and ran it through his stomach). 

Ohhhh my. 

AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES HOW BLATANT THIS IS? 

It turns out no, I am not, and Goro himself had to deal with some suspect accusations by people who wondered if the opening murder was a playful jab (stab) at his father. He claimed that the desire to kill one’s father simply represented the desires of the “many young people” in Japan who felt oppressed by their own parents. Okay, Goro. Sure. I toootally believe you. It was for all the kids! We stan artistic expressions of national patricide. 

So, yeah. Goro begins the movie by not-so-subtly killing his father. I'll get back to that. For now, more on the plot.  

The reason why Arren (a marvelous little projection of Goro's psyche) kills his father is never stated. There’s some vague darkness at play that occasionally takes hold of his body and turns him into a bloodthirsty monster like some angsty Shonen Jump deuteragonist. Frustrated with how lame he is, Arren takes a sword flees and his abstract fantasy castle for some other Earthsea location. It’s there that he runs into Sparrowhawk, an old wizard guy, who rescues him from slavers, turns him away from drugs, and gives him a nice place to heal on a farm. He stays on that farm for a while, until he runs away and gets abducted by Cob, this big bad dark wizard voiced by Willem Dafoe in the English dub (lol). Cob controls Arren through his ""true name,"" which is an important concept in the movie that is never properly unpackaged. I hope you're noticing a trend here.

As far as adaptations go, this one is a bit awkward. Goro’s Earthsea is not Earthsea as fans know it. Though the film is based on The Farthest Shore (1972), the third book in the series, Goro pulls names, characters and iconography from the first two books, splattering them carelessly throughout his movie. He ends up with a strange hodgepodge of Earthsea material lacking the essence of the original. “It is a good movie,” Le Guin told Goro after their initial screening in America, trying to be nice. She added, “it is not my book.”

It is the tonal shifts that startle the most. Don't let the pretty colours trick you: Goro's Earthsea is a remorseless world. Before Hawksparrow finds him, Arren traverses a wasteland teaming with rabid beasts. Forests and farmlands are fading away, consumed by a mysterious evil. If you think this invites some typical Ghibli environmentalism, not so: this is as decidedly un-Ghibli as you could possibly be. No Ghibli movie, as far as I’m aware, has presented to the audience systematic slavery, villains who attempt to literally rape a young girl, or a protagonist that would murder a family member for seemingly no reason. 

As Le Guin wrote in [her own blog](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/gedo-senki-1) (blog wars!), “[the film] was maintained by violence, to a degree that I find deeply untrue to the spirit of the books.”  

This speaks to Goro’s inexperience as a storyteller. Most of the film is heavy-handed, bumbling over its themes and failing to complete them without using quick fixes like stabs and slashes. That's where his immaturity shows the most. The actual animation direction looks fine, at least to me. I’m sure Goro had a lot of help from a Ghibli team that were committed to realising his vision, no matter how problematic it could be.  

But what did Hayao Miyazaki say on the matter? “You shouldn’t make a film based on your emotions."" Pshht. Preachy and hypocritical. He did the same thing in Porco Rosso (1992) and The Wind Rises (2013), and they didn’t suck. But he does have a point insofar that the Earthsea series, as popular and respected as it is, shouldn’t really be your artistic sandbox to act out your latent patricidal desires. Let's get back to those!

Here's another excerpt from Goro's blog:

“Once the publicity for ""Tales of Earthsea"" starts up, regardless of whether I like it or not, as the director, I can easily imagine that I will be labelled with the adjective ""Miyazaki Hayao's son"". Faced with this, the conclusion Producer Suzuki came out with was that obviously I should ""let the work itself speak for me"", but ""in order to showcase 'the work itself' you still need to let them know you not as 'Miyazaki Hayao's son', but as the individual human being Goro Miyazaki.” 

Very insightful, Goro. You see it throughout the film—this bloodlust for identity. I go as far to call this the main theme, far more pronounced than those to do with life and immortality. Goro refutes his father's central ethos, embracing an ugly, violent protagonist and depicting the world in a state of increasing ruin. This is no Hayao Miyazaki movie. For better or worse, this is a Goro Miyazaki movie. 

His neurotic urge to detach himself from his father manifests in the artwork. Le Guin was unhappy with the way the film looked, stating “the animation of this quickly made film does not have the delicate accuracy of Totoro or the powerful and splendid richness of detail of Spirited Away.” She’s right, but I'm not convinced that's because Goro was cutting corners. 

In Earwig and the Witch and its TV series predecessor Ronia, the Robber's Daughter (2013), Goro employed CG animation, deciding he wanted to experiment with new animation styles instead of rehashing the tried-and-true formula. One might speculate that this is another jab at his dad, who is known for belching at anything CG. 

Tales From Earthsea doesn't go quite that far, but the animation is decidedly un-Miyazaki. Apparently, it's more of a tribute to his favourite movie, which is Isao Takahata’s The Little Norse Prince (1968). Which means Goro was team Takahata all along! Take that, dad (along with the sword to the stomach!). The character designs and general style reflect this core influence. Of course, it’s understandable why Le Guin would be so pissed, seeing as she signed up for that vintage Miyazaki goodness. 

To make my position clear (not that it really matters), I like the idea of moving beyond the Hayao Miyazaki mould, because obviously only one person can do that. I admire the decision to take artistic risks. I should note that there are some other cool creative decisions, including the use of these interesting classic-looking paintings for the night sky. Quite nice. Of course, no one really talks about this stuff in a positive light. Goro is reduced to Miyazaki’s son whether he likes it or not, and that means people will always smirk at these awkward, flailing innovations as the boy writhes and screams, eternally bound to his father’s shadow.

Does this horsey thing look familiar to you? It’s a lot like the horsey thing from Princess Mononoke 1997). Really, Arren has a lot in common with Ashitaka, in addition to the obvious physical resemblance. He’s a young, cursed, terribly bland prince… of all the Ghibli protagonists, Goro, why did you transplant that one? 

I’m bringing this up in order to condradict my previous point (perhaps this is why I never passed a high school English essay). There is a very interesting paradox here! For all Goro tries to escape Miyazaki’s shadow, he deliberately pays “homage” to his father in certain ways. The Mononoke similarities are just the first ones I noticed; Miyazaki stans of a greater calibre than I have pointed out countless recreations of classic Miyazaki scenes dating back even before the foundation of Ghibli. I’ve also discovered that the plot of this movie in some ways draws more from Miyazaki's watercolour manga The Journey of Shuna (1983) than it does from Le Guin's books. 

Why would Goro do this? We've established he wants to forge his own identity as a filmmaker, and that's understandable. Why does he force himself into imitation? An act of spite, perhaps? Besmirching the Miyazaki name? Assassinating not only his person, but his work? Mayyybe. I’d love to make that argument, but I’m coming at it from a different angle. 

I see this as an act of sincerity. Broadly, this film maps a conflicted relationship with the past. It's actually quite metafictional, considering its role in the Ghibli canon. We see Goro's protagonist stuck, after “killing” his father, in a hellish repetition of Miyazaki scenes, characters, and iconography. It is only after he and his dragon girlfriend call each other by their ""true names"" that they escape this cycle of grief, allowing Goro to ideally transcend the Miyazaki mantle. 

Am I giving Goro too much credit? Because I do not think this rehash of classic Miyazaki content is an example of unoriginality or even reverence. It is not, as many have accused, an attempt to copy his father. Instead, it’s a legitimate attempt to reason with the man who ""raised"" him, not through physically being there, but through the films he produced. No deep dive into his familial strife would be complete without Miyazaki’s work. 

But it’s not just Miyazaki! This movie is a full-frontal assault on the past. One need only look at the world around Arren to see that this film is trying to comprehend what once were esteemed structures falling into ruin. Considering Goro is a literal landscape designer, the disrepair of Earthsea’s surroundings are more relevant. When it comes to ruined buildings, at least, he probably knows what he's talking about. 

And we can take this further! The past, in many ways, is embodied by the film’s villain. Cob (again, Willem Dafoe) really is a shallow, cheesy character, but they serve an interesting thematic purpose. Cob is in pursuit of immortality. When they are vanquished at the end of the movie, Arren tells them that there is no point living anymore; at some point, you have to go off and die, even if you are immensely powerful and acclaimed, obsessed with extending your wretched life. 

Addressing that to someone in particular, Goro? Hehe.  

Seriously, though! In lieu of those who came before and all the great things they made, the movie flails around, picks itself up, and constructs an alternate future. Arren, Therru, Sparrowhawk, and that one white girl band together and live as a family. One family destroyed, another formed. Out with the old and in with the new. 

I see this trend across Goro’s filmography. Ever noticed that not a single one of his protagonists have living, present fathers? Arren promptly disposes of his. In Up From Poppy Hill (2011), Umi's died in the war. In Earwig and the Witch, Aya’s dad is not mentioned once, and her rockstar mother abandoned her as a child. Of course, this doesn’t mean they’re alone. Found families abound! Goro trivialises the past before building a new one. He takes his role as the new guard of Ghibli literally and emotionally.

We’ve established that Tales From Earthsea, interesting as it is to talk about, isn’t that good. It fails as an Earthsea adaptation and doesn't handle its themes too well. 

But I want to end this review positively. About halfway through, Arren stumbles across the main girl—Therru—singing atop a grassy hill. This is going to sound cheesy, but bear with me.  

Therru sings this song, and it’s just her voice. No music, no soundtrack. It goes on for quite a few minutes, too. In several interviews, Miyazaki senior harps on about ""ma"" (間), that Japanese word that describes a break in the action. In these scenes, the audience is allowed to breathe, relax, and, in Goro's case, properly grieve. These scenes are, to me, a marker of maturity.

Believe me when I tell you Therru's song is legitimately gorgeous! The girl stands on that grassy hill, wishing someone might understand how sad and lonely she is. Sounds melodramatic? It doesn't come off that way. The song shines a light not only on her, but also Arren. We see him shed a tear for the first time in the movie, revealing that he's not a soulless, edgy Ashitaka skin, but a traumatised boy dealing with his own demons. 

I should note that the lyrics of this song were not penned by the film’s composer, Tamiya Terashima, who Goro selected because Joe Hisaishi was “too old” for them to get along (I find this funny). Instead, they were written by Goro himself. Straight from the heart! His emotions here are pure, undiluted, and beautiful. 

And his expressions in this scene. If there’s one thing this movie does better than damn near any Ghibli movie I’ve seen, it’s the facial expressions. There is just so much pain bottled up in Arren’s hurt little face. A blessing of the Takahata style? Or is it Goro's secret genius? I don't know, but the faces, simple as they are, communicate so much in this film. Arren's sad default expression contrasts effectively with his twisted “mask” that belongs to his doppelganger. 

After the song, Arren and Therru sit down for a heart to heart. We learn that Therru has been short-changed by her own parents (nothing says anime abuse like a burn mark), and actually seems to like Arren a lot more when he cries and confesses his patricide. From then on, the two form a strong, believable bond that gives the movie some much-needed stability. 

I really love that scene. As mean as I've been, I hope I've also proven Goro is not a lost cause. He is capable of beautiful, heartfelt moments. He is capable of tossing together a feature-length film with Hayao Goddamn Miyazaki actively lobbying against him. He is capable of a lot of things, really. 

I hope, like Arren, he finds his true name someday.

Here are some links to [Goro Miyazaki’s journals](http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/earthsea/blog/index.html) and [Ursula K Le Guin's response](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/gedo-senki-1) to the film, both of which I’ve quoted throughout. Oh, and [here’s that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfahLM3qKnw&abchannel=Caracacan) where Hayao Miyazaki walks out on his son’s movie. Yikes. At least he attempted to make up for things in future movies, working alongside Goro instead of sabotaging his first attempt at direction.  

His parenting gets about the same score as this movie. Maybe a little lower. Thanks for reading!"
10456,"Edited the entire review, apparently I was too sleepy to write coherent shit.

Moving on, Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon (or Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere) is a rather difficult series to review. It clearly has a lot of plus points, the artwork, the characters, the music, and so on. But even so, it has some massive holes that all but ruin the entire series. My opinion of this series is mixed (though the score may suggest otherwise) and I really don't know where I stand on it. 
The review will be completely spoiler free, but I would  love it if you read the description first before reading the review, I will  not go into any details about the plot.
That said, let's move on to the main review.

Artwork (17/20)
The artwork was quite stunning when it came out (Dec 2011), but as time has passed it has gained ""everyday"" looks. Way back then, I could only gawk at the scream when I saw the animation work its nifty little magic, it was something I had never seen before. Almost fell in love with horizon too.



But as it is with all good things, there is a downside -and I never thought I'd say this- breasts. They are quite the distraction, mostly because they are so stupidly big.

 

The breasts aren't the only problem though, most girls wear clothes that will put TERA to shame (I guess that's an exaggeration, but you get the point) and their hairstyle will make you want to shoot yourself, I'm not even joking here.
But overall, the artwork is quite the beauty, even three years later.



Music and Sound (16/20)
The music is just beautiful. It really is. Even if you figure you don't want to watch KSnH, listen to Stardust Melodia (ED01), its quite the masterpiece in itself.

youtube(BQnJYaFWG3I)

Then there is the OP, and you get to listen to Horizon sing pretty much every episode, both of which are quite good and addable to your playlist. The voice acting is fair enough.

Plot (11/20)
Ah, the weakest link. Don't let the rating get to you, the plot is actually quite good, just that you will be pissing in the wind until episode 9 give or take a few. The plot is quite complex, and most people are unable to grasp it on the fly. If you do want to thoroughly understand and enjoy the plot, reading the novel or the Manga is a  must. I myself was just fumbling in the dark all the way upto episode 8, and only when I watched the first episode again did some semblance of normalcy return. The story never once holds your hand, it never stops to explain itself, it just keeps going  and you keep looking at the screen wondering what the exact fuck happened. 

The one thing the plot gets worked out right is the politics. Yes, you read that right, politics. In an anime. This happens to be quite the plus point, but its just basic politics, and its not like you will understand what is happening since the powers and the system of governance is never really explained. Who controls the country? who is the executive? Who is that crazy guy with a uni hat? Is the king above the student council? Is he above the guy with the hat? These are just some of the questions that arise due to the rudimentary politics applied. I don't usually question the governance in animes, but if you are gonna do something, do it right or don't do it. 

The other failure in the plot stems from its battle system. Over six years of watching anime, I have seen every possible type of fighting possible (from using soaps to fight in Little Busters, to Elfen lied's I-blow-your-head-up) and I have never seen a more detailed attempt to copy real fights, and that's when the trouble kicks in. Since it does it better than most, it is only natural for me to assume it will actually be closer to reality, but it soon shows it true colors, the fights have no idea in hell how real fights are done. Look at these masterpieces for example - 





I don't exactly know how fights will be done in an alternate dimension that I don't fully understand, but they sure as hell won't be this way, that's for sure.

/Gonna take a break now, will write the rest of the review tomorrow, sorry for the inconvenience :P"
151380,"Tensions were high among the fanbase going into Season 5. Season 4 did fix a lot of the problems left by J.C Staff, but Geek Toys also brought along a new set of different problems that upset many DAL fans arguably more. The reception was overall positive, but even among the fans who enjoyed it there was concern for how the next season would be adapted. So how did Date a Live fare this time? The answer... mixed. 

img220()

Buckle up because you are in for a LONG one. I am very attached to Date a Live and have a lot to say. 
There will not be any hard spoilers, except in the characters section. So you don't have to worry about being spoiled reading this bar that section, which will also have a 2nd warning as a reminder. 

Now lets get this breakdown started.


Story: 


We're finally here: the height of DAL'S story. This section of the novels that the anime covers this season is regarded as the series' selling point. When you read reviews for the DAL light novel people praise TF out of the direction the series goes in the late game. And even among the negative reviews from people who completed the series, the common theme you see is ""the series is a slog until volume 16, but from that point it becomes genuinely interesting"". We're at that stages fellas, buckle up. 

The war with DEM truly begins and its pure chaos. Shido has his long awaited showdown with Isaac Westcott, Origami squares off with Artemisia Ashcroft, Ellen Mather finally engages Elliot Woodman, Reine's betrayal is realized, and the true boss of the entire series spawns: The Spirit of Origin, Mio Takamiya. Her reign of carnage begins and well... quite a few bodies are left behind in her wake. 
The story is a chaotic tragedy that hinges on the complicated backstory of Shido, which is finally revealed this season. The fate of everything depends on what he does with that information and how he will go about trying to stop Mio. 

This season covers volumes 17-19 of the novels, which is a surprising slow-down in adaptation pacing given the series' average across the first 4 season was 4 volumes a season. But I'm not complaining - this is just what the doctor ordered. It seems like they learned their lesson from their previous seasons, and especially season 4 where one of the big complaints is how rushed the Mukuro's arc was and felt. It was and still doesn't feel good even on rewatch. 
They gave this season far more breathing room to adapt everything essential to the story. Not every detail or scene made it in, but far less was trimmed and unlike the previous seasons - nothing felt overly rushed, in regards to the plot and storytelling. And just the right time too: because this arc... needs and deserves all the attention she gets. 

I don't want to go any further into details about the story, because quite frankly its extremely intriguing and the selling point of the anime. You don't spoil it for yourself looking it up, you need to experience it for yourself.

There's only a few negative things I can say about the story. The biggest one is the noticeable change in pacing and in form of storytelling this season: The majority of this season is very scattershot. It constantly cuts between different parties every episode which makes it a bit of pain to follow at times and really breaks the immersion of several key scenes. In its defense, it is loyal to the LNs which were also written in an even more disjointed manner. So they are doing their best to stay true to the source material while trying to make it not as difficult to follow (which I think they did a good job with). It also fits into the chaotic nature of a war, so I give them credit for staying true to the theme and trying something different with a (mostly) positive result. It wasn't always perfect, but they did a good job. 

There's an episode dedicated to introducing a backstory and including a worldbuilding element that some people complain about being ""unnecessary"" and just thrown in for no reason, but that isn't the case and for details I'll explain in the characters section for specifically Karen and Ellen why (although fair warning, there will spoilers). 

Also the way the season ends is not quite how the LN does. The final scene cuts out a critical moment that directly causes and leads into the final arc/final 3 light novels. Which means, as it stands, it is technically an anime original ending. Now it would not be hard for them to rectify this, as all they'd have to do is start the next season with slightly going back and starting slightly before where it ended with that particular scene. Which if they do, the loose end will be wrapped up. But there's no guarantee of this, especially after the news of the animation studio's financial troubles reaching the public. 

Update: Brief tangent to adressing the Geek Toys Bankruptcy claims/controversy:
This section has been added as in months later because this ""conspiracy"" hasn't died out despite the fact it was disproven with public record, proper translations, and a new project announcement months ago. I'm adding it to the review because I want to help put out the fires and dispel the rumor mills for people who either haven't been informed on the update information, haven't heard yet and get you informed, and ultimately stopping people from mindlessly parroting this piece of misinformation. 

As of the writing/editing of this review (September 2024): No, Geek Toys has not officially gone bankrupt like many of the claims alleged. This all stemmed from someone on Twitter who made a poor translation of the merger announcement which made it sound like they had gone under. And that piece of misinformation spread like wildfire. Geek Toys (now going by Geek Pictures post-merger) is not gone, they are still in business and are still producing/co-producing anime. But they have/are undergoing a massive restructure and merger due to financial issues and have dialed back their projects for the foreseeable future. They have only 1 co-production in the works at the moment set to come out next year, and that's it. 

Long story short: they are not gone, but they are in no position to make another season of Date a Live anytime soon... if ever, given that the rights to the show have allegedly been returned to Kadokawa in exchange for more funding admist season 5's production. Which if true, means the ball now is entirely in Kadokawa's court and out of Geek Toys hands; meaning Geek Toys may never get a say in it ever again. Only time will tell if we get another season, and by which studio (if any). 
End of update

Now If this is the last we get from DAL as a anime it's not a dealbreaker. The ending is still quite a good - honestly great in a vacuum (when not compared to its source material) properly climatic and incredibly emotional ending as is. I genuinely cried watching it, despite knowing what was coming. 
But in spite of it's best efforts to tie things up, as it stands it doesn't feel... fully resolved. The anime has several plot holes afloat, multiple big questions unanswered, subplots unresolved, and just a general feel of being unfinished. You could argue thats the point, since you could still make minor adjustments/recton and have 1 more season. But since the odds of that are looking slim as of this time, we have to assess the piece in front of us as it as: a (currently) anime original ending. 

Story section conclusion:
As far as the story goes: it is fantastic. A bit scattershot at times but it was kept almost entirely intact from the source material and remains fantastic. Unlike season 4, never was I bored while watching this season. It's a major step up over the previous entry whose middle section was just a ho-hum to get through. Asides from its pacing and storytelling being a bit unbalanced and I guess the debate over whether or not the ending should be considered anime-original, I have no major complaints on the story itself. It remains one of DALs strongest elements - if not THE strongest element this season specifically. 

I wish the rest of the qualities could've been on par with the story, especially the animation. Which... oh man, where do I start?.. 


Animation/Art:

   img220()

Alright, fun time's over. Because as good as the story is, it can't always make up for bad visuals. Now we gotta face the sad reality that it is, unfortunately, Geek Toys animating this series again. And you know what that means? CGI-a-Live is back. Last season it was unfortunate but wasn't as much of a constant problem because there was only 2 episodes where CG came into play due to season 4's lesser focus on action. Whereas this season it is an unavoidable constant. There is so much action throughout this season that it was inevitable that it was gonna be a consistent problem. 

Again I want to make the same reminder I gave in my review of season 4 two years ago - I'm not CGI-phobic, but it needs to be supporting the animation instead intruding on it and being an eyesore instead. It should be an asset, not a detriment. And Geek Toys CG is exactly the latter the majority of the time. It's 1 thing when CG is being used on background elements and/or inhuman creatures; They're rarely centerstage, have solid reasoning to be CG and thus aren't as much of or are simply an acceptable eyesore. It's another entirely when the CG models are human and main characters who are the center of attention and the main focus. The margin for error becomes much higher and Geek Toys is a studio that has proven time and time again that they do not know what they're doing with their CG elements. Not just in DAL, but their other works too. 

But I will say this: while most of the CG may be ugly, at least the majority of it is in non-critical moments or short shots that doesn't distract the viewer too much. There's a lot to nitpick across each episode, but the majority of them were not ""ruined"" by it. It did not derail the majority of episodes. 8/12 episodes ranged from passable to solid. Then there's 2 legitimate cases for being the best episode not just of the season - but the entire series. But unfortunately, there are 2 who were... controversial to say the least, with many who would genuinely call them bad. And to be quite honest... I agree with almost all the negative criticism they both get. Those 2 episodes were really fumbled hard. Though for different reasons. 

So lets dissect these 4: starting with the 2 'controversial' episodes and then the 2 really good ones. 

The details I will be divulging will not have any critical spoilers, so you can read through them without issue. 

Episode 3: Attack of the (CG) Clones
I lowkey wish it was in episode 2 to help solidify this bad Star War joke, but no matter. I'm stuck with this as unfortunately so were we all with this mess of an episode

Episode 3 opens with the very start of the war, and what do we get for the opening moments? A poor shot of static airships with simple dots around them indicating a fight, and then a flurry of mass-teleporting puppets appearing on the screen of all the spirits which then proceed to clunkily fling themselves forward into the battle. Their bodies, movements and facial expressions wooden and stiff. And that's just how the episode is for the most part. Artemesia vs Origami is not great to watch. Origami's model is fine and looks good, but Artemsia ruins the fight because she looks so plastic. Her stiff long hair and features make it look like Origami is fighting a Barbie doll. Pretty much every CG element in this episode is awful, to the point where it is not an exaggeration to call it comparable to Ex-Arm... fcking Ex-Arm. And people did, this episode sparked outrage among DAL fans and sent morale spiraling. 

While I was among one of said fans who also made that comparison, I don't think I'd 100% stand by it now, in regards to the entire episode. It has a lot of visual issues with some genuine ""Ex-Arm"" level quality moments, like all the ones I laid out. But upon rewatch (because I watched this specific episode 4, yes, 4 times just to dissect its elements) its not completely terrible. Shido's ""date"" with Nibelcole was well done and looked good. Origami looked fantastic in action (it's unfortunately just bogged down by the fact her opponent is a Barbie doll). The other spirits looked alright (besides their battlefield entrance). Ellen looked good flying into action and Elliot's grand entrance was also nice. And of course, the final moments of the episode is a shocking reveal that sets up what is to come with the rest of the season.

The 1 other thing that kinda works to the benefit of the bad CG is Kurumi and Nibelcole's commentary and banter. While it was in the novels, the situational irony is way too well placed. It feels so self-aware and on brand for Date a Live. People tend to forget that DAL is a psuedo-parody at it core, so this might've been a fun way for them making light in a rough situation the animators clearly were in here.

This episode is also salvaged by the fact the following week we got one of the most impactful, well-made, and arguably one of the best episode in the entire DAL series. It was the most perfectly timed rebound one could ask for that helped people overlook/forget how terrible the previous week was. Which is also, ironically enough, a similar saving grace the other controversial episode has. 

Episode 7: How to Fumble your Boss Fight
This episode is a really divisive, mixed bag. Half of the episode is genuinely amazing, but the other half is unbelievably awful. The parts involving Fraxinus, Origami, Tohka, and especially Kotori are amazing (except that one filler bit involving Kannazuki and middle school girls). The racing airship visuals are incredible and the final scene aboard Fraxinus genuinely almost brought me to tears. Rare Geek Toys visual W. 

But then we get to Shido vs Westcott, a fight that has been anticipated for years and was building up for 2 episodes straight. But instead we get blue balled by the writers. Who decide that between the end of episode 5, where they tease the showdown to come next episode, they insert a rushed backstory episode for half the episode and then cut away to the spirits fight against Mio. Both of which are pretty good, but... they kill the momentum of this fight. 

Then we get to the fight itself, which... was just disappointment. There was exactly 3 actions taken throughout this fight and was a stiff, lifeless and just... mundane. How do you screw up a confrontation this impactful with years of anticipation and episodes of build up this badly? 

The most notable thing about this fight is that it is the first time I've been disappointed by Geek Toys 2D elements. One of the selling points of Geek Toys taking over and the reasoning people use to offset help offset people's feeling of the bad CG they use is that the 2D elements look pretty consistently great. This... is the first time they really dropped the ball. When Shido pull out Sandalphon and reenacts Tohka's scene of slicing the throne and summoning Halvanhelev... it looks awful, cheap and just goofy instead of epic.

comparison to season 1

img220(/revision/latest?cb=20130825180409&path-prefix=es)

I get Geek Toys has really made it a point that they want to recreate scenes from previous seasons in their own art style for flashbacks and such instead of inserting clips in from previous seasons, and prior to this I hadn't had a problem with it. But man... for this scene they absolutely should've just re-used the visuals from the previous seasons for it. What they made looks so cartoonish, washed out in color, and bad. Shido swinging it also looked hilariously off. The iconic Kamehameha reference and finisher was very well done (that's not a real spoiler, you've seen Shido do it before in season 3), but it does not make up for the rest of this lackluster fight. 

Now all that being said, I want to remind you that these 2 episodes were the exceptions; the 2 truly mixed/bad episodes amongst the pack that attempt to drag down an otherwise fairly passable season animation-wise. While Geek Toys animation is not stellar, besides these 2 episodes its not used in a way that it becomes a hinderance. But after all that trashing, its time to talk about the 2 golden gooses of this season. 

Episode 8: The Moment We've Waited over a Decade to See

I almost couldn't believe it. Geek Toys made actually good looking CG for a fight scene? And it mixes well with the 2D elements? And it looks... AMAZING? WTf!? I almost can't believe Geek Toys made this. Where the heck has this quality been? 

Episode 8 was by far the episode most fans were anticipating and concerned about. This episode houses what is arguably the highest climax or most iconic moment of the entire series. We were very anxious to see how Geek Toys would deliver it. And somehow... they managed it. Geek Toys delivered a genuine W of an episode that is on the par with how impactful and amazing it is in the novels. 
img220()
Sure there is some very minor things you can nitpick with this episode, like a couple of poor shots or the track selection and placement feeling a bit off at times. But those tiny non-essential issues aside, they knocked it out of the park. Episode 8 is among the best, if not a candidate for THE best episode in the entire Date a Live series. It is a Godsend and miracle that it came out of Geek Toys. 

On the topic of Geek Toys (brief tangent)...

In regards to criticizing Geek Toys work:
I've seen and had enough with the people telling folks that you aren't allowed to criticize Geek Toys animation solely off the fact that they're a smaller studio or you're ""not a real fan"". This season has really brought these basement dwellers outta the woodwork and I've gotten pretty fed up with this crud. Yes, we all get they're a smaller studio. We never expected it to be Mappa level animation. All we wanted was just decent animation on par with the first 2 seasons - that's it. That wasn't a high bar of expectations. I also already give them leeway for being a small studio. For example, I don't like the fact the we lost the spirits hybrid armor outfit that we've had for the first 3 seasons because Geek Toys can only afford to make 1 model for each character. It negatively impacts the anime and definitely hinders my enjoyment quite a bit. But notice I haven't complained about it. Because I get it, they don't have the time or investment to make and animate all these different models. And thats a fine excuse that we can live with, so long as they do the minimum of making sure the models they do have look good. But more often than not they didn't, which is why many fans like myself are upset with the quality.

I can give them room for grace in some areas on account for being a smaller studio, but that absolutely does not give them a free card to for being immune to all of it. Trying to gatekeep criticism never ends well, just ask the RWBY community.
(tangent over)

Episode 12: A Finale Worth Remembering
img220()
The animation was getting rough at points, but clearly it was to save up for this last hurrah. And did it pay off?... YES. The final episode encapsulates the themes, structure and essence of Date a Live near perfectly. 
Self aware, dry humor? Check. Magic waifus? More than enough. Epic, visually stunning boss battle? Check. And a tearjerking ending? Yessir... 

It goes out in a bang in a way we haven't seen since season 2, if not the Mayuri Judgement movie. It was absolutely amazing to see them throw it back this well and go this hard. Although it does bring me a great deal of sad realization that... we're likely never gonna get to see it again from this series, as this has been tailored to be the intended end for this anime. But if this is how Date a Live goes out, I'm happy it was with an episode of this caliber. As much as I have (and will continue to) criticize Geek Toys, at least brought it together when it mattered most this season.

Animation/art conclusion:
Geek Toys does continue to struggle with in the visual department. The CG as a whole is not great and they do slip up with the 2D in some crucial scenes as well. But for the most part, its not bad enough to be intrusive for the majority of episodes. The 2 I mentioned are exceptions, they are truly bad in the visual department and are solely salvaged by the strength of the story. And while I still don't hold Geek Toys in high esteem, I give them credit for at least trying to learn how to make better visuals (for the most part). Bar the mentioned 2 they don't fall back into the trappings made in season 4 and they definitely are improving. Slowly and not nearly quick enough progress to be happy with it, but they are making progress. I lamented in the past how Geek Toys is ""incapable"" of making good animation. And while I still hold a strong sentiment that they are not capable of being consistent, Episode 8 and 12 proves they can do it - when they give genuine effort and passion towards it. 

I'm not thrilled with what we got in the visual department, but it wasn't unpassable. Once you get over the hump that is episode 3 the CG becomes a lot more bearable and not that hard to adjust to. It certainly could've been much better, but it also could've been worse. I think I've said more than enough about the visuals, moving on. 


Sound: 

img220()
Music continues to be one of Date a Live's strong suites. The tracks have always been amazing, and the few new ones we got this season continue to add to collection. The remastered ending music is so beautifully epic, tense and awesome - the perfect track to lead into each new episode - and as it turns out, the final climax too. 

While taste in music is subjective, in my opinion - Paradoxes was a phenomenal OP that fits the core of DAL and this season especially. Do I still miss Sweet ARMs on the OPs? Oh yes, I still think all 3 of their OPs are better than Miyu Tomita's. But again, taste in music is subjective so take my word with a grain of salt.

We at least had Sweet ARMs on the ED, and it was also a fitting song. Probably DALs best ED, but tbf most of DALs ED's are not that good imo - so the bar isn't as high or as contentious as rating the OPs.

This season does suffer a bit of ""final season syndrome"" where they get a bit carried away stuffing a bunch of old tracks into the season to try and recapture nostalgia despite whether they fit the occasion or not. It does impact and hurt few scenes. But for every 1 they did wrong they get at least 2-3 right.

Voice acting:
The JP cast was on point, as usual. Aya Endou absolutely killed it as Mio. Not really much to say about this, I have 0 problems with the voice cast.

English dub:
img220()
I did not watch any of the English this season while it was airing. Partly because I want and will use it as an excuse to rewatch the season as a binge next round to see if it affects any of my opinions, but also... the mess that was the season 4 English dub did a number on me, and I was not eager to have any feelings about what I was watching ruined by another botched job again (for anyone out of the loop or needs reminding can read through the sound section of my S4 review from 2 years ago [here](https://anilist.co/review/17282)). The delay caused by Hurricane Beryl hitting Texas (where the dubbing studio is located) is also an unfortunate circumstance.

This following section has been added in almost half a year later as I finally got around to watching this season's dub, and the result is... I'm pretty annoyed, if not pissed off.

Let's get mild nitpicks out of the way before we get to the egregious issues. I know some people get extremely bothered by basic diologue changes and fight for pure 1-to-1 loyalty. And I'm typically not one of those people. But imo, the choice of making Shido shout ""Sixth bullet"" instead of ""Vav"" in episode 8 sounded infinitely less cool. The JP absolutely takes the W for that one. 

Then there's a moment where Shido reveals something important to a Kurumi clone. And that information can't be directly told to the main Kurumi. In the original JP diologue, Kurumi says she has to form a plan to sneakily imply to her other self without tipping something else off. While in the English dub, the diologue is changed to ""yea I can tell her no problem"". 2 very different implications, going from using her cunning in one version to just a BS plot convenience in the other.

But it went further than that, and did the thing that has become more rampant as a result of western influence and self-proclaimed activists have gotten more involved in the production side: pushed a political agenda. Mild but unimportant spoiler for episode 2: there's a scene where the girls are sitting around playing a chainword game and Kaguya slips up and says ""Chupacabra"". And then conversation pivots over whether or not this word fits the bill for what their playing. You know what the English dub does?... replaces it with a joke about MF Henry Kissinger being erotic... 

Ah yes, forcing American politics down our throat. Take a poltical meme that popular at the time because notorious politician Henry Kissinger had recently died when the dub started rolling out and leave it as an unwanted stain that already dates and ages this anime with no sense or meaning whatso ever. Why does a random group of Japanese girls know so much about Henry Kissinger? Why was it so important to replace a joke that everyone understood with one about him? No good reason, and we all know who and why forced this in.

Jessie (formerly Josh) Grelle - who voices Shido in the dub - did not perform well this season. Whereas in the past I've admired their performance as Shido, but this time they sound so... uninvested. Shido's voice lacks intensity and emotion in the moments it should. I can't help but think that Grelle just doesn't care about this anime anymore. Maybe it has to do with the problems behind the scene from season 4 where they were replaced for almost half the season by 2 other VAs? Or perhaps their transition played a factor in their outlook on the male characters they once played? Who knows, but the fact remains that their performance this season was lacking compared to their previous ones. 

But there was 2 good things we got: Alexis Tipton and Michelle Rojas. Both of them absolutely KILLED it as Kurumi and Tohka respectively. Alexis Tipton's interpretation and performance of the character holds up on its own so well that a fair number of people perfer the dub just for her alone. And that speaks for itself. But in my opinion, the outstanding performance award as far as dub actors go has to go to Rojas. She genuinely made Tohka far more animated and alive than she was in the original sub. Her terrified scream were more electric, hair raising, and tension bringing than the original JP actress' performance. I'd go as far as to say that the dub has any selling point at all despite its mound of issues would be these 2 actresses performances. Whether that makes it worth it you is up to you.


Sound conclusion:
DAL remains solid in the music and the JP voice department. It's the category that this series has always been consistent in and they didn't drop the ball and should be proud of it. 
The English dub... has problems, quite a few of them. I won't doc any points from the grade of this review for it, because dubs are supplementary in nature and completely optional. But there are at least 2 things going for it, so watch at your preference.


Characters:

I have a lot to say about specific characters, both positive and negative. 

Fair warning: this will be the 1 section that has hard spoilers. If you are trying to avoid spoilers, please scroll to the Final Thoughts section to avoid them. But I want to share my full thoughts on these characters and how they impacted the season so I will not be sparing details for the sake of watch preservation here. Skip over this section if this applies to you, you've been warned. 

Now for the dissections

Westcott: 
img220()
I have mixed feelings on Westcott this season. He had such a high ceiling and potential as a villain, but I don't think he ever truly lived up to it. His final boss fight at the end is intense and awesome, but after the underwhelming and more disappointing personal showdown between him and Shido that was by far more anticipated and built up - I can't help but feel like I was scammed. 

Yes Geek Toys' lacking visuals contributed to it, as I mentioned earlier when I broke down this episode. But the other, bigger problem was the pacing. The scattershot nature of this season really hurts what was supposed to be this big, climatic fight. Having his duel get ready to start, but then to be interrupted by a half episode cutaway of his backstory - just to then cut away to the other spirits vs Mio till the end of the episode. Then the next episode we have more of Mio vs the spirits, comedic relief aboard Fraxinus with Kotori and Kannazuki, back into the action of Mio vs the spirits, only to THEN - get back to Shido vs Westcott. And of course that fight is an absolute joke that composes of only 3 actions happening before Shido ends it. It feels so robbed of momentum on top of being amplified by the fight's short length that I feel scammed. Your big bad boss encounter that was being hyped up for seasons should feel hefty and impactful; not like a boxing match where the fight is over after 3 punches.

Some people have complained about Beelzebub being a stupid power for Westcott, but I do like that he has it. It fixes one of the common problems with any story that utilizes time travel - a logical reason why the hero cannot just keep going back in time until he wins. Beelzebub gives Westcott knowledge of any changes that happens between different realities which makes him a continuously evolving threat. Every time Shido might jump back in time to reset gives Westcott more information and greater means to win. I think its great. Yes he could've utilized it more and better, but I will defend Beelzebub's existence. Its powers suite Westcott's nature and help give the story more urgency. While also providing an out to 1 of the common trappings and plot holes that crop up with so many time travel centric plot lines.

But the big thing a lot of people have complained about Westcott is his motivation being stupid, generic and boring. And I mean; it kinda is and isn't... Lemme explain:

It's revealed that he's pretty much a nihilistic and schadenfreude obsessed monster whose sole pleasure is watching people suffer. He just wants to kill and end lives because everything else is meaningless to him. The motivation he pretends to use is that he wants to create a new world soley for true wizards like him and Ellen as revenge for burning down their village. But in actuality, he revels in the death of his village. He just wants everyone to suffer before he kills everyone. He reveals that to Shido after putting on his sales pitch and then immediately 180ing, facial expresion, tone and all - and basically says ""lol nah, my grandeur is just a flimsy excuse and I can't believe everyone buys it. The truth is I just want to kill people because I like it"". 

Is it basic and simple? Yea, there's not much more to it which is certainly unexpected. After all this time I truly expected Westcott to have some complicated backstory and motivation that hinges on spirits themselves. But nah, he's a simple man of simple tastes, and the spirits powers are just a means to that end. On one hand, it's so stupid. But on the other hand, it does fit Westcotts nature perfectly. Manipulative psychopath who wants what he wants and does what he does on almost pure whim. And enjoys setting elaborate plans that will deliberately causes others (including his allies) pain just because? Such a petty lil' btch.  

I feel like I should hate this, but honestly: I love it. It would probably be terrible in other generic storylines, but for Date a Live? It fits this series so well. The batsht insane premise of extremely subverted expecations for a villain that seems setup to have very complicated and high-mind motivations given the amount of dedicated mystery, inteligence and intrigue he's brought to this series over the years. The 180 degree twist on the reveal, and overall just the general sense of self awareness is simply fantastic. Westcott is DAL taking the piss out of the generic fantasy villain tropes while still maintaining him as an intimidating, terrifying threat. 

Finally, some people think that Westcott being irredeemable was bad writing. But in my opinion: it think it was necessary. Date a Live as a series is basically comprised of a bunch ""redeemable"" antagonists that eventually get saved. Miku, Origami, Kurumi, and Mio all fall into this category. Westcott being ""saved"" would've made the series a completely straight track with no deviation and given no consquences to a character who had gleefully committed numerous crimes against humanity. Quite frankly: he needed to die. I don't what we got was the most optimal ending for him (it could've been written better) but finding a reason to save him would've been cheap and even worse writing. 

Many people may take issue with him, but I'll defend Westcott's character in regards to this: He is a well designed and plotted out villain in concept, origin, and motivation. But his overall execution is a bit off. But regardless of the problems, he is arguably the most layered and interesting character from this season - even more than Mio imo - and Westcott continues being one of the best part of this series. 

Elliot Woodman: 
img220(
I'm sorry, but Elliot is just so underdeveloped in the anime. He's given no screentime to do anything over the seasons. We barely learn or know anything about him besides his wizard past, nor does he really do anything of significance as the leader of Ratataskr. I have a hard time buying the whole romantic affection he supposedly has towards Mio. We only get to see them interact with each other once, and the only other time they're on screen together is when Mio spawns and he's just blushing lightly. There's no thoughts, words or other context clues that would strengthen or indicate why Elliot would feel such strong attachment to Mio in any way. Their brief and only interaction is kinda interesting, but that alone that doesn't provide anything. It still feels like a convenient, shallow plot device instead of a genuine build up.

Also ""world's strongest wizard"" my a$$. You know what great ""action"" he did during the battle this season? He came out, did a barrel roll, deflected a lone strike, then talked with Ellen in a static default idle pose before launching a single projectile which we see later causes her to fall to the ground defeated. And then he makes a Rengoku pose and dies on his knees... and all of these short actions take course over the span of 3... episodes... Really?! That's what we get to see from the ""World's strongest wizard""? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 

But I grant that its not Geek Toys fault that Elliot was this underdeveloped. The fault mostly lies with Keitarou Motonaga - the director of DAL seasons 1-3 (who got fired after season 3). He didn't prioritize DAL being a long-running anime who'd make it to this point so he didn't bother giving Elliot the attention he needed. And unfortunately, this far from the only thing butchered by him - so this will not be the last I'll be talking about Motonaga and his decisions that caused a lot of damage to Date a Live in the long-term...

Back to Elliot: his failure as a character is the product of a slow, trickling buildup of missed opportunities across the seasons that was cast aside in favor of the short term vision. But now that we've reached the endgame, all we've got left here is a shallow skeleton of a character that he was supposed to be. Truly unfortunate.

Ellen/Karen: 
img220()
I truly don't have much to say about either tbqh. Ellen's role continues to become more insignificant with each passing season, which is unfortunate. And Karen, like Elliot, doesn't get any true devlopment beyond the basics. She's just a close friend of his who is passionately in love with him and will follow him everywhere. She's just a far more passive version and equivalent of Ellen, much like how Elliot is to Issac.

Though the reason I want to talk about these 2 is mostly because I couldn't organically fit this into the story section without spoilers and have spent long enough talking about Westcott and Elliot. I wanna address the whole ""Wizard"" subplot that came up this season. A lot of people have criticized it for being an a$$pull and making no-sense. But even as an anime only, I get it and I like it. DEM created the magic-powered realizers using actual magic under the guise/combination of science and then gradually introduced it to the world until it become normalized and nobody suspected a thing about its origins. It think its genuinely interesting and kinda wish that they worked with this more. But tbf the season was already tight as it is. And if they went overboard it could've turned into the Irregular at Magic High School problem where they overexplain all their science/magic tech for no reason, so I'm fine with it as is. 

Artemisia Ashcroft: 
img220()
I hate her, I hate her so much. She actively makes the anime worse by existing. Her CG model is the worst of every named character in this show and she's an eyesore nearly every time she's on screen. Like I said in the animation section, she's a plastic Barbie doll who looks like child is just picking her up and bashing her around most of the time. They hardly, if ever, tried with her.

Her backstory is basically non-existent/just doesn't matter. She has no character in the anime. ""Oh, she's being mind controlled? How unfortunate, I can hardly tell since we've never seen how she is without the mind control influencing her."" >:( 

They could've given us a brief moment where we get to see her memories pour back after Mukuro unlocks her mind, but no - she's just used as a plot device and simple roadblock for 1 episode. After that she's irrelevant. They also seem to forget to free her in the other timeline too, so her plot line remains unresolved. She doesn't even appear in the credits scene, so WHAT WAS THE POINT OF HER EXISTANCE?! 

Artemsia Ashcroft (in the anime) makes me so angry. She was alluded to and built up as this important character just to do nothing with her. The DEM villainess we got for just half of season 2, [Jessica Bailey](https://date-a-live.fandom.com/wiki/JessicaBailey), was more developed and a better character than her. I've been told so much of her backstory and antics with Ellen were cut and you can feel it. They left nothing for her. If you're a fan of Artemisia Ashcroft from the novels I truly feel sorry you. The anime screwed you all over. 

Mio: 
img220()
Now for a pleasant change of pace, a character I loved! Mio is a true yandere, the last piece of the harem puzzle this show was missing. While Mukuro kinda acted like one during her arc, she definitely isn't a true yandere. Mio is. Her character motivation is completely obsessive, in true yandere fashion, but is absolutely not generic. The fact she went as far to try and give birth to her lover to reincarnate him is insane. The episode where it becomes clear what happened is one of the biggest ""oh sht"" moments I've ever felt. It's absurd, creepy, and yet feels entirely in line with her character. Everything about Mio is mysterious, intriguing, and fantastic. It kept me on the edge of my seating wanting to know about this absolutely insane spirit. 

There is 3 complaints/plot holes I have regarding Mio. 
The first is the whole Sephira crystal refinement stick. Like, nobody's gonna address the monsters that appeared in season 4 that Kurumi was tasked with killing? When did Mio realize that on top of splitting her power she needed to ""refine"" this crystals too? Did Ratataskr or DEM never notice these monsters? It just doesn't make sense. I gotta feeling a LN reader can probably answer that question for me, but the anime sure as heck can't. 
The 2nd is that I personally think the anime should've did what the novels did and start alluding earlier on that Reine was Phantom/Mio so that her betrayal and realization by the Fraxinus crew would've had more build up, impact and meaning. They cut so many key hints that the novel dropped for its reader, leaving only a few loose pieces from season 1 and Mayuri Judgement being the only time she ever gave any indication of being tied to the deeper plot. 
Lastly... the whole incest debate. It's a messy, complicated rabbit hole that I don't feel like trying to break down and instead will sum it up with this meme:
img220(
Other than that I really like Mio. She was the perfect final boss for this series that feels both fitting and planned out. 

The spirits: 
img220()
I'm just gonna lump them all in here because they don't really get much development, besides getting turned into donuts throughout the season... cough. 

Anyways, they're all the same characters. They do collective share roughly same amount of screentime this season, except for Tohka and Kurumi obviously. But this time they were actively a part of the plot and doing more than just being background characters. Nia particularly gets more time, probably as an apology for how little she got outside her arc during S4. I love her antics and her commentary gives me so much joy. Whereas Mukuro on the other hand is reduced to being plot device.exe and spends most of the season just opening portals so that the characters can get where ever the plot needs them to be. 

There really isn't much else to say here; they generally did a better job with them here than in season 4. Not great still, after all they're still a more than overgrown group fighting for limited screentime in a season that does not have much to spare. And anyone not named Kotori, Tohka, Kurumi, or Reine/Mio has to make due with what little moments they get. But it was improvement. 

Tohka: 
img220()
As expected of the main girl, Tohka continues to get special treatment. I do appreciate how they build off the idea/revelation that Nia explained from the previous season to explain why Tohka is so special compared to the other spirits - and that idea is further confirmed by Mio herself. Tohka's conversation with her other self/Tenka is interesting yet cute and her sacrifice in the same episode hits hard. She doesn't really do much after that, but given that this wasn't really intended to be her true climax as a character that shouldn't be surprising. Will we ever get to see that someday? Hopefully, but not guaranteed. But even in the case that she doesn't, Tohka serves her purpose and is still the 2nd/3rd best spirit in terms of development (since Mio is now in the mix).

But you already know who the best is...

Kurumi: 
img220(
Once again, Kurumi is the star that steals the entire show. Until the final episode she is the most captivating thing whenever she's on screen doing anything. I love how in this season we really get to see her guile at work. How she was able to make an emergency continency on the fly to save Shido from Mio. How she was able to come up with a way to warn herself with Shido's information without tipping off Mio and coming up with a plan to escape death. And I love her combined spirit armor with Raziel, it aesthetically looks amazing. It is quite telling that she is the only spirit Shido kisses, besides Tohka, of his own free will after sealing her. I truly do wish that it was her that ended up with him in the end. But unfortunately, we all know who does/will. 

She continues to be a great character that never disappoints whenever she's on screen (unless you count the CG clones from episode 3, but that's not the bad CG element most people are upset about).  

Shido: 
img220()
Finally, we get to Shido; playboy extraordinaire. I really loved Shido's development these past 3 seasons. In season 1 he's mostly a generic harem protag with generic development, but even then he has a very distinct, snarky and sarcastic personality with a self-awareness unlike any other harem character out there. And beginning with the season 2 with the Yamai sisters arc we get to see him beginning to move the plot forward by own accord. Then in season 3 with the Origami arc, Shido really come into his own. He went from being a pushover to being THE primary driver of the plot whose actions directly effect everyone else and the story. He is the catalyst of the series. He's not just being dragged around by Kotori and crew anymore, nor by ""convenient"" random events you see constantly in other harems just as an excuse to make things happen. And that continues to evolve and really comes to a peak this season. I truly do like him as a character now. 

Some people do criticize him for being a wimp or crybaby and to that I have mixed opinions on. I mean yeah, he has the usual harem-protag trope of being overly evasive of anything sexual. That's pretty generic and par for the course, not much to say or disagree on that. However for the other, if you're complaining that he's crying during the darkest part of the story where he's lost all of his friends and an absolute monster of a yandere is trying to convince him that wiping his memories of it all will be a good thing - bruh, no. I'd be upset if he wasn't crying, that's the most realistic reaction there could be. 

Really the biggest criticism with Shido is that so much of his backstory was trimmed out from the earlier seasons that when it comes up now it feels like an a$$pull or convenient lie he tells to garner sympathy in order to woo the spirits instead of feeling like a genuine character moment/connection that it's supposed to be. Like in season 4 with the Mukuro resolution, he stops her from inverting by talking about his anxiety and irrational fears about his adopted family abandoining him... which is kinda unbelieveable since Shido never once speaks or even hints at this in the anime. Its very well noted in the novels from the very beginning, but the anime completely cut it because director Keitarou Motonaga elected to focus series on the comedic, self-aware aspect and cut a lot of characterization early on of several characters. Not just Shido, Kurumi's motivation had to be explained in the first episode of season 2 because they ""oops'd"" and forgot to include it when they were supposed to in season 1. Which worked fine at the time, making DAL season 1 extremely enjoyable, unique, and good in a vacuum. But it caused a lot of damage down the road as the series progressed and those important early details that should've been introduced never were. Even the extended cut versions of seasons 1 and 2 don't fix this particular problem - because its the 1 thing they just never covered in the anime at any point. Seasons 3, and especially 4+5 suffer greatly for this problem. 

Shido is absolutely not a standout protagonist in the general comparison sense, he's in the middle of the pack all things considered which would make him incredibly forgettable in most circumstances. But amongst harem protagonists: a genre known for its protagonists being the most basic, bland, predictable, virtually indistinct and practically disposable characters in all of anime - he is exceptional. Date a Live would not even work anywhere near as well, if at all, with your average harem protagonist. Shido's self-awareness is fun and different, and the writing which gradually makes HIM drive the plot forward as opposed to being dragged along by it is the key that seperates him from the vast pool of throwaway harem MCs. 

Even with the problems I laid out earlier regarding his character development taken into account, Shido is a definite candidate for the best harem protagonist of all time. 



That's all the characters I have any strong opinions on enough to talk about. Anyone else not mentioned I could answer if you wanted to ask me, but I don't feel like going through the entire roster of DAL and extended this review into an even longer essay than it already. Some things aren't worth dying for. 

You are now past: The Spoiler Zone. The rest of this review will be spoiler free, you read below this point without worry if thats your intention.

Characters conclusion:
I have some strong opinions on many of the characters. Many positive and many negative. Westcott is a mixed bag in his execution as a villain. Elliot is poorly developed and feels like he doesn't contributes as anywhere near as much as he should towards the story. Artemisia was better off not existing. The spirit are handled better this season in terms of attention and actively being part of the plot. Mio is a fantastic final boss. Tohka and especially Kurumi are still this series golden children. And Shido has finally come into his own as his own character. While he and by extension the story does suffer from his backstory being neglected in the earlier seasons, he still manages to become a genuinely likeable character who has a distinct personality to him and drives the plot forward of his own accord, which is good writing (especially for a harem protagonist). 

Final Thoughts: What grade does it deserve and why?

I won't waste anymore time since this review is unbelievably long as is (Jesus Christ, how did I manage to write this?) so lets just cut to the chase.

No chance is this a 10 or 9. 10 is reserved for the highest of esteemed, truly magnificent works with flaws that are very insignificant. And I think I've covered more than enough flaws to not explain further. That also knocks it out from being a 9 - if it were just the animation that was the problem this season, then you could've justified it. But its not just that, you've also got several serious issues in the character department, pacing, and a few holes in the plot courtesy of the anime-only ending (as it stands right now).

I absolutely think its story really propels it up to well past a 6 at minimum. It's far from generic and takes the series in a truly interesting direction. Not entirely unique admittedly, there's definitely shared elements to found this season and especially its climax that shows like Madoka Magica and Guilty Crown have already done. Though DAL definitely does it own thing its own way and does not feel a rip-off of either. And while the characters are flawed, they feel uniquely their own and not knock-offs of other, better characters from other series. They sure as heck aren't perfect, but besides Barbie doll Ashcroft I like every character in DAL. 

Comparing it to season 4
img220(
You'd think the easiest way would be to directly compare my notes and opinions on season 5 to season 4, which I gave a 7.5 to 2 years ago. You'd then think that I'd feel more inclined to give an 8, since I did enjoy more about this season than 4. But then you have a few things that must be taken into acocunt. Season 4 had it issues in the visual department, but they weren't as consistently recurring as season 5. Season 4 did butcher its one big fight, but that fight wasn't nearly as important as the boss fight season 5 screwed up. 

But although in comparison there was also much more I disliked about this season stronger than 4, giving it much lower lows - Season 5 also had far higher highs than season 4. Both in execution of the plot and production. And to be honest, despite its problems I still prefer the experience we got this season than we did in the previous season with 4. I absolutely prefer a show that can make me feel immense feelings of any kind more than a show that makes me feel nothing at all. 

Season 4 wasn't a 'nothing' experience, but it was very flat and boring at quite a few points. Several episodes were basically filler and it has its share of production problems. I remember coming out some weeks watching 4 feeling bored, and even on rewatch I felt it too - if not a little stronger. The lows weren't quite as low as in season 5, mostly because there was not much action in 4 so we didn't have to suffer through much of Geek Toys bad CG. But that same vein, the highs never got as high as we got this season. I may have felt some strong, negative emotions watching certain episodes of season 5 - but the 1 thing I never felt was bored. To me, that's a huge difference between seasons 4 and 5. 

After writing this review I'm genuinely considering editing my review of season 4 to change my score a bit, because now I feel it's no longer a middle to high 7. It would now probably be put in the lower end of 7's, as it's a 6/10 anime for the most part that gets largely carried by Nia's eccentric personality at the beginning and especially the Kurumi Refrain arc in the final few episodes.

So the question is: 7 or 8 out of 10? 

Without bias I would probably give this season a high 7. But since I score only in either half or whole grades, and I'm extremely biased toward this series - I will be rounding up and giving it an 8. 

Make no mistake; it's production is very messy, unpolished and flawed. And I do have a real bone to pick with the writers who really dropped the ball adapting some of the characters - especially Elliot and Shido. But damnit, the story carries this season HARD. It is genuinely fun and interesting, yet dark and captivating in the direction it goes in and had so many different ways this anime could've gone. And while they've left it at a point where the anime could end here if it wanted to, with its mostly anime original ending - it's still poised to potentially be picked back up and make that last push to finish the final 3 novels. And give this series the True Route ending we'd all want to see. 
img220()

If you choose to give it a 7 I honestly wouldn't bat an eye, thats probably the more accurate score for this season tbqh given its laundry list of noteable problems. But for every problem it had another element match it scale for scale, if not a bit more imo. And by my own admission, I am very biased towards this series. As Date a Live was - and still is - my favorite guilty pleasure series of all time. I will never forget this fantastic ride of laughs, action and suspense this series has given me all these years. As well as the tears I cried from this powerhouse of an ending.
8/10

Gintama: The Movie (or Gintama: Shinyaku Benizakura-hen) is a solid adaptation of a classic arc which is often touted as being what got people hooked on Gintama. While this isn’t true for most, it does make the most sense that this arc was chosen to get adapted into a movie (twice if we are including the live-action films). Most of the important characters, outside of the main trio, are new and the plot doesn’t rely too heavily on the context given by prior episodes. This means that it can be watched without needing to have recently watched the previous episodes. 

For those who have already watched Gintama this movie will obviously re-tread familiar ground, however, it is a different enough experience to be worth a watch. The usual snarky self-referential humour and fourth-wall-breaking antics are adapted to suit the movie medium; something that the animation team working on Gintama have always excelled at. The series utilises the medium it is being presented in and makes it an advantage. There are also enough changes to make it worth a watch; most notably including the Shinsengumi, retroactively setting up Episode 62, and revising a couple of the scenes to create a more atmospheric experience. There is a nice balance between the old and new which ensures this is a fun watch, even when you know what will happen.  

For those who haven’t watched Gintama and are a little bit apprehensive about starting the series, then Gintama: The Movie might be a good testing ground for whether it will be something you might enjoy. While you won’t have a deep connection to the characters, they are set up with the series’ usual flare and so you get a strong grasp of their dynamics. Plot-wise, there will be a little bit that you might not understand, but there isn't much, The film moves seamlessly between comedy, action, and drama; showing the potential that Gintama has and that, especially the later seasons, easily eclipse. There is enough exposition to get a basic understanding of what is happening without it feeling like a lecture. This limited use of exposition works in this film’s favour as it allows the established relationships between characters to speak for themselves.

Gintama: The Movie enhances the Benizakura Arc as an experience, polishing up the plot and exploring the smaller elements that couldn’t be fully realised in the main series. It uses its time in a constructive way that leaves it feeling neither bloated nor empty. The improvement in animation is noticeable and it's nice to see the staff putting their budget to good use; especially when animating Kagura’s reactions. The only issue I had was that some scenes could be a little bit too dark to clearly see what was happening, but these moments were few and far between. 

The fight scenes have also been improved; most notably in the final fight which is even more entertaining with the shots feeling more dynamic. This plays into the strengths of Gintama as the variety of fighting styles make it feel exciting. The pacing and soundtrack work well together and, as usual, DOES provides some fantastic new songs which capture the excitement of first watching this arc. It goes to show how much of a good job the team did; picking out the elements that made this arc special and re-creating them. The end is also typical Gintama; loud, fun and a nice way of including all the characters that make Gintama what it is. It makes this film feel more like an experience for the fans, not just the shameless cash-grab that they play it off as.

Overall, Gintama: The Movie provides a unique balance that informs any newer audience members of what Gintama is without boring those who have already watched the series. While it follows the same plot beats as the main series, the subtle changes are really enjoyable to see and it shows how much attention the staff pay. It really captures the thrill that made the Benizakura Arc special to the fans of Gintama and created something new with it."
16157,"Disclaimer: This is a SPOILER-FREE review of [Hyperdimension Neptunia](https://anilist.co/anime/16157/Hyperdimension-Neptunia/)'s 2013 anime adaptation.. Rather than a review, this is meant to serve as an elongated personal impression. I bring up very subjective points, however, I hope you enjoy reading this nonetheless. 



Hyperdimension Neptunia’s anime adaptation is generally regarded as a ""for the fans"" anime. While this may be true, the anime adaptation can bring a decent amount of enjoyment for newcomers. Its story isn't complex by any means; however, that does not hinder its enjoyment factor. Hyperdimension Neptunia's anime may not fare well with the big shots of anime, but it truly is a gem for those who enjoy its niche. It may not be the best game-to-anime adaptation, but it most certainly is not the worst. 



The Neptunia games are known for having a digestible plot, and the anime adaptation is no different. Its story is easy enough to grasp without prior knowledge of the series. Albeit so, the show may still require information from its source material. In terms of being a standalone product, Neptunia's anime adaptation provides a minuscule amount of knowledge. The exposition is just enough for viewers to infer how the world of Gamindustri operates. Even with this small amount of knowledge, the show manages to stand on its own. Rather than directly adapting the source material, Hyperdimension Neptunia's anime adaptation adapts concepts. It would seem absurd to adapt three video games into one twelve-episode anime, and, to a degree, that is true. As it only adapts major elements from the trilogy, it surprisingly works. Sure, some parts of the show were weaker than others; but, it still manages to stay entertaining through and through. Though, for the sole reason of seeing their beloved characters, fans of the original series may enjoy this over newcomers. Speaking of characters, Hyperdimension Neptunia's characters are mostly pleasant.

In the same manner as the original games, Neptunia's characters are easily distinguishable and unique to each other. Personally, I find the character designs charming. In the anime adaptation, these characters do not have much of an introduction. Even so, the audience will easily be able to differentiate and understand their charms. Most of these characters fall under a certain character archetype. 

As Neptunia is a meta series, there is a plethora of popular video game and animanga references. Throughout the series, I constantly found myself finding a massive amount of references to other works. Actively watching the show and understanding the many hidden references is rewarding. Considering the primary cast are personifications of major video game consoles, it was bound to have ""easter eggs."" Some of these references are glaringly obvious, while others are subtle. 



By 2013 standards, Hyperdimension Neptunia's animation is just decent. However, I can't say the same about today's standards. For today's standards, its animation is evidently subpar. Throughout the entirety of the show, there are rarely any moments that stand out as good animation. Furthermore, the repetition of scenes for evidence gets bothersome at some moments. For instance, if something dramatic happens, the scene will repeat itself three times or so. While it may be on occasion, the fact that it happens throughout the series more than once can be seen as irritating. In some scenes, the animation can be similar to the studio [Shaft](https://anilist.co/studio/44/Shaft)'s signature style.

While the Neptunia series is known for having bits of lewd fanservice, the adaptation steps it up. It's not as lewd as ecchi series such as [High School DxD](https://anilist.co/anime/11617/High-School-DxD/) or [To LOVE-Ru](https://anilist.co/anime/3455/To-Love-Ru/), but it is lewder than the source material. By no means is this entirely bad; however, it does feel strange and out of place coming from the original games.



Hyperdimension Neptunia's anime adaptation's soundtrack is cheerful and welcoming. Some of these tracks emphasized the playfulness of the series and brought life to anime Gaminudstri. On occasion, the anime would play songs from the games. For anime-only viewers, these songs most likely will not stand out. However, the inclusion of those songs can be interpreted as fanservice for players. The opening sequence is wonderful; it was memorable and catchy. For me, it had a strange hint of nostalgia. As for the ending sequence, it is my favorite anime ending sequence of all time. Personally, it always puts me in a good mood. 

As someone who watches anime almost exclusively in Japanese audio, the English dub is spectacular. No characters lose their charm, and the voice actors' performances are massively entertaining. Personally, I'd say that the English dub is on par with the original.



To sum it up, Hyperdimension Neptunia's 2013 anime adaptation can provide a decent amount of enjoyment to newcomers. While it may only be decent for newcomers, it is a welcomed treat for fans of the source material. It has a digestible and straightforward plot, delightful characters, video game and anime references, and charming music. Although it may contain some negative aspects, the adaptation still provides entertainment. As a massive fan of the series, I give it a:

9/10, kuma!

img640()

Just a quick synopsis of what this anime is about. The main female protagonist, Charlotte Evans, escaped into a forest from her pursuers where she was rescued by Allen Crawford, the prodigy magician who lives in the mansion in the forest. Not entirely sure how true his backstory about being betrayed really is, but he relates to Charlotte, and also learned that she grew up not knowing the joys of the world which could be seen as a normal thing for many of us. Because of that, Allen was determined to let Charlotte enjoy them, but called them ""naughty things"".... Yeah... there are lots of misunderstandings in the series because of that term...

img640()

First of all, the story was surprisingly good. If you look at the plot, it is honestly quite ""meh"". But the way that the story flows in the series actually keeps you on your toes. I think what really carries the series is the blossoming romantic relationship between Allen and Charlotte. However, those two are so awkward with each other that they refused to acknowledge the emotion they feel towards each other. It can be quite funny, and also quite painful, to watch.

Next, the story started out fine. But it started to get really annoying when the side characters were meddling. While it could be fun to watch them meddle at first, it became rather irritating that the side characters were trying to meddle with the relationship between Allen and Charlotte. To clarify, those side characters weren't trying to pry them apart. On the contrary, they were trying to get them together, just as we see in the series on how their relationship turned into a romantic one. 

Their romance, so far, was doing quite well where they both just needed time to figure out their emotions and finally coming together. But the side characters seems to be so impatient to the point that it felt as though they were meddling too much. In the second part of the series, I was practically screaming at the side characters to leave them be.

img640()
(Picture Source: Crunchyroll thru' Google Image Search)

This is actually one of the major reasons why I rated the series lower than expected.

Thirdly, the lack of prominent male characters in the series. So far, the entire anime only has three key male characters: Allen, the main male protagonist, Harvey Crawford, the current Headmaster of the magician's academy, and Prince Cecil, the alleged main antagonist of the story. However, the Headmaster and the antagonist of the story only appeared in a small part of the series, which makes the show more inclined to be a harem rather than what I believe it is not. 

I mean, there were definitely male characters in the show such as the snake guy (I forgot his name), the rock golem guy (I also forgot his name), and the dragon editor (yes, I forgot his name too), and some other background characters who doesn't make much impact in the storyline. For now...

Whether or not those two other male characters, and possibly some of the ""background"" characters, would play an important role in the series later does not exactly reflect in this current season. Okay, probably Cecil but he only appeared at the beginning and at the end of the entire thing. If, let's say, the next part of the series after the last episode has got something to do with Cecil, I would rather this anime become a 24-episodes series than a 12-episodes. At least, to give some closure and to reiterate that this show, despite how it looks, is not a harem genre.

And finally, the seiyuu casting... oh my gosh... 

First, every other characters' seiyuu casting fits them perfectly. But, man! Allen's seiyuu is just cringe! 

I mean, I don't mind deep voice. I feel like deep voice do give the characters a type of mysterious vibe, especially if associated with darkness. But given how Allen's character is, and the theme of this anime?? Why? Why would you give Allen a deep voice?? I'd rather Cecil has the deep voice.

I really hope if they do a season two, PLEASE! Get another seiyuu whose voice is not that deep! I mean, yes, Allen can have the deep voice, but probably when he is angry?? Those few times he was sharing moments with Charlotte, gosh! it is just cringes!

20839,"I wanted a fun fanservice anime to help embellish my ecchi bone like I am always known to do. Is this too much to ask for? Is it hard to make a fanservice anime that is fun? Unfortunately yes. I don’t deny the tough task of trying to make a fun anime that can please many people. However, when it is obvious that the writers did not give this thing the time of day that it desperately needed from how it is presented, there is no excuse to justify laziness of this magnitude.

From the beginning, I thought Triage X started with some decent, albeit typical, layout of the characters and story as this secret organization based on a hospital staff of girls. The fanservice was quite voluptuous with decent-looking art designs on the girls and the guys, with an interesting shot of a nude guy’s butt. Then I watched episode two. It had the same thoughts by the end of it, even though the plot arc was forgettable. Finally, I got to episode three, and by the time I was halfway through it, I thought to myself, “Is this just episodes one and two over again?” Not in the sense that it was literally like the previous episodes, but the fact that all of the attacks have a similar structure: Black Label helps with this situation involving kidnappings of partially naked ladies or other terrorist antics. That’s pretty much it. Sometimes these arcs feel like they were an afterthought and that we are supposed to forget about them by the next episode.



Now, this wouldn’t be too bad based on how there are episodic anime. But unfortunately, with the case of Triage X, it is, what I would call, a soulless anime. All of the characters have absolutely nothing that makes them even the slightest bit interesting or gripping. Based on how predictable and formulaic they come across if you’ve seen most seinen-type action anime, Triage X is about as typical as you can get from the genre. Not only that, but the writers don’t even try to give me a minute to let me get to know any of them to help me differentiate between each character. Because of this, I couldn’t pinpoint a specific character trait that makes any of them unique. All they have going for them is that they are just characters to move the plot or lack thereof. This is never a good sign when trying to get to know any character in an anime.

There is even one scene where the girls have a spring bath scene together because there has to be one, and they converse about miscellaneous topics and events. The problem is that in the last episode, we barely even had time to get to know any of them to care. Of course, this problem of vapid characterization seems minor in the female cast compared to the main hero, Arashi Mikami. It’s not just the bland characterization that makes Arashi so bad, but also his poor charisma and personality. I would say that Arashi has the personality of a wooden board or brick, but I think those examples would be too generous when describing. At the very least, he dares to admit that “nothing was resolved” near the show's end to ensure that it was a mess from the start.



This poor characterization also comes down to how incredibly poor the writing is. Not just that the dialogue itself is painstakingly awful, but just how stilted and awkward the voice actors portrayed it. Any character dialogue between each other felt flat to the point where I almost felt like I was watching a hentai conversation. That might seem ironic, considering this is an ecchi anime. Still, there is much ecchi anime that make conversations, even at the level of Triage X’s caliber, decent enough to be passable. The majority of the dialogue consists of constant exposition and predictable one-liners.

With Triage X being an action/ecchi hybrid, you would think they would balance the two genres accordingly, right? That doesn’t seem to be the case since they are both executed with minimal efficiency. Action being the majority of what Triage X has going for it, it is by far the most lackluster I have seen in a while. This coincides with the criticism of the animation, which is sub-par at its best. Action sequences, at times, feel more finicky and less fluid because of this problem. Not to mention the number of corners they cut that made the action such a jarring experience. There are even action scenes where the action felt incredibly rushed, to the point where it was already over before I even started getting into it. By the time the fifth action sequence emerged, I had begun to lose interest in enjoying the action.



Fanservice is usually the selling point to anime like Triage X. However, I was surprised and disappointed with how little fanservice there was. And even when these fanservice moments happened, they were not super special to even watch the uncensored version for. If you watch the uncensored version to see some nipples and ass, I guarantee that almost all that time would amount to about five or six minutes. I don’t count the ones involved in action sequences only because they mostly serve the action than the fanservice. Whatever how many panty shots, beach scenes, skimpy outfits, and boobs Triage X has going for it. They do not leave a lasting impression of how dry the animation direction is. This is especially surprising since this is the same studio that brought us Highschool of the Dead. While not a great show by any measure, it at least had some semblance of a budget. When your ED is just a girl riding on a motorcycle from point A to point B with her boobs slightly bouncing for no reason, no amount of budget could save laziness of that magnitude.

I know this seems too big of a review for me to convince anyone that Triage X is bad, but it’s not just because it is bad. It is because it is the worst anime I’ve ever dared to sit through. I was not angry. I was not incredibly disappointed. I was bewildered by how something this bad could ever be approved to go on air. Dropping this could not be done by me as I wanted to continue watching this to see if it could get any worse than before. The truth was that it didn’t get any worse or better because it was already at the lowest point of quality anyway.

Grade: F-"
106893,"Copied from my MAL account: [link](https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=318773)


I don’t consider myself easy to impress, and harbor a considerable amount of skepticism when it comes to anime in particular. The state of the industry and Japan’s own questionable ethics more often than not lead to incomplete adaptations, overreliance on tropes, tendency to pander, and plenty other undesirable practices in the medium.

Suffice to say, anime as a medium has yet to evolve to the level of films or literature, and as such I choose to keep my expectations rather low with every coming season. Sure, you have your hard-hitters like Vinland Saga and Demon Slayer, but then there’s the expected boatload of isekai, or series with potential but fall into mediocrity--for me and plenty of others, To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts was one such show. And even then, the hard-hitters often are not something I personally find enthralling, since they tend to fall under specific tropes palatable to very young teenagers; or as we call them, shounen. Don’t get me wrong, I’m onboard with that every once in a while, but there’s only so much of it I can take before a medium of seemingly endless potential and imagination begins to feel surprisingly safe and sterile.

To be clear, I’m not trying to diss anime as a whole. Plenty other mediums have their own problems, especially in their infancy period. Anime is a medium I love and support, and as such I’m all too aware of the drawbacks I’ve come to expect while digging my way through the depths in search of anime that are true standouts. And it’s because of this that the level of enjoyment I had watching Cop Craft is truly precious. If you’re like me, you’ve certainly had reservations or mixed feelings about Cop Craft’s reveal, particularly in the context of Japan’s ever-so-uncomfortable liking for small girls. Some of those same people went on to be pleasantly surprised, just like I was, at its first episode. As for me alone, I kept watching to where it would become one of my most cherished anime in recent memory.

My love for crime-focused shows and films akin to Lethal Weapon, The Sopranos, and the like had sold me on the show within minutes. After some more time of watching, I was then engrossed by the character chemistry and splendid dialogue. And with wild supernatural elements, fantastical concepts, and bizarre sci-fi all welded cohesively into a thrilling buddy-cop drama, Cop Craft stands as another showcase of what anime as a medium, compared to live-action, is truly capable of pulling off.

Before I go any further, however, I must address the elephant in the room. Yes, this show has serious problems with its production, which many people are aware of due to the damaging effect it's had on animation and pacing. Cop Craft's overall quality undeniably suffers as a result, but I feel like people should know the whole context of why this show is the way it is. I’ll go much deeper into this later on, but the basic story is this: this show was made with the passion of a driven and talented team in a very small studio with budget constraints and scheduling issues; a project far too ambitious for what the team is capable of doing. As a result, the animation quality is a horribly mixed bag, but this should not be attributed to laziness of the staff, as tempting as that is. As pressing of a topic as this is, I want to save it for later in this review. As of now I want to make the point that poor production is a tragic reality of what is otherwise a fantastic experience.

The dynamic between Kei Matoba and Tilarna Exedilika is the essence of what makes Cop Craft such a worthwhile experience. The incessant passive-aggressive remarks between the grouchy nihilistic cop and the spoiled, ill-tempered young rookie is one of few aspects of their interplay that makes their first several hours together so immediately riveting. Not only is their interplay superbly written, varied, and sometimes comedic, they’re highly fleshed out characters whose relationship evolves from a bitter incompatibility to a dubious comradery. In general, Kei is someone who doesn’t get along with people, which is understandable since he’s one of the last people you’d ever want to hang out with. He’s a callous and largely inconsiderate man, making rude or judgemental comments towards people regularly with no signs of remorse. But he is not without a heart, as much as he tries to hide that fact from Tilarna. A man of few words, his sparse acts of kindness and courtesy are often dubious, with his true intentions left concealed in his own frigid mist of a personality. Even his most notable good deed, rescuing and adopting a stray cat after pursuing a perp, is reasoned with the idea of it being selfish instead of altruistic, saying he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if he left the cat there.

While ostensibly uncaring, Kei clearly has humanity as shown in his outrage over the death of his partner, Rick (which, by the way, happens within the first few minutes of the first episode, so no spoilers there), and the fact that he views his chief, Jack Roth, as a father figure. Likewise, it’s made obvious that in spite of his bitterness towards Tilarna, he does grow to care for her. His dialogue with her later on walks a fine line, making it uncertain which of his lines are playful, complementary, sarcastic, or tough love. In general, Kei appeals to the part of us that wants to be spared of the nonsense and get the task out of the way. His cold attitude is sometimes hard to tolerate, especially when he shows no gratitude whatsoever for when Tilarna saves his life, but that’s just part of what makes him so endearing. Kei and Tilarna’s rough interactions are what makes their sparse cases of growing closer all the more meaningful.

Tilarna is always aiming to uphold her dignity and her moral code, making sure to never stray from either goal, excluding particular circumstances. Yet she’s also prudish and naive compared to Kei, often used to great comedic effect and is crucial to her development in much later arcs. Similar to Kei, her abrasiveness towards him isn’t exactly reflective of her actual feelings. More than anything, she just wants to feel respected by Kei and not be treated like a burden, which is an understandable frustration for anyone having to work with the man for so long. With such an entertaining banter between well-realized characters whose bond develops with every few episodes, topped with brilliant dialogue, Kei and Tilarna end up being one of the most compelling duos in anime I’ve ever had the pleasure of following.

On another note, it’s strange and disappointing to see the unpleasant depiction of gay characters that plagues Japanese media appear in Cop Craft--by which I’m referring to Tony. Funnily enough, I initially approved of his character as I assumed he was a transgender woman. Because transphobia is just as much of a problem in Japan, my first impression of Tony was a pleasant surprise. And I was let down upon finding out that Tony isn’t a transgender, but a very effeminate and flamboyant gay man. Generally, his appearance and character alone isn’t all that big of a deal. But it does get a lot more off-putting with that one scene of Tony subconsciously feeling up a teenager only to be stopped by Aleks; and wiping drool off of his face as an added bonus. Although Tony is portrayed more tastefully than the likes of Puri Puri Prisoner from One Punch Man, they're both still sad reminders of how long of a way Japan as yet to go in terms of proper LGBT representation in media.

This is a real shame since Tony is generally a good character apart from this, alongside his detective buddy Aleksandr, both of which are a treat to watch thanks to Cop Craft’s sheer aptitude with dialogue and comedy. And then there’s police chief Bill Zimmer, who is just about the closest to an anime Samuel L. Jackson since Afro Samurai. Although his spitting rage and humorous lines are a joy to witness, and with how respectable he was in speaking favorably of Tilarna towards a racist subordinate, Zimmer isn’t one of the more fleshed out characters of the show, unlike the doctor and ex-girlfriend of Kei, Cecil Epps. While it’s shocking to see someone actually put up with Kei’s rudeness, and even remain friends with the man, the main draw of Cecil’s character is how easily she befriends Tilarna. The friendship between the two feels genuine, with Cecil consoling Tilarna about difficult tasks and personal woes; their playful dialogue about Kei also leads to one of the funniest moments I’ve even seen in an anime. A lesser writer would simply use Cecil as a plot device or to flesh out Kei’s history, but she’s given the humanity needed to make her truly feel like a person with a physical presence in the overall narrative. With such an engaging main duo alongside almost equally great side characters, Cop Craft boasts one of the strongest casts of characters of any anime I’ve seen in recent memory.

This setup for a buddy cop show is hardly a unique one, especially to those well-acquainted with Western TV and films, but it does stand out in the anime medium among its contemporaries at the very least. And besides, execution is everything. And Cop Craft’s execution in its story is as great as one could ever hope.

As we’re welcomed to the fictional city of San Teresa, we venture into the unknown as well as the familiar. Conflict is abundant here as any Earth-dweller would expect a city to be, but the presence of the Semaani race brings forth a plethora of surprises among the crime scenes and detective cases, imparting a fantastical and arcane flavor to the adventure rarely seen in a police drama. With roughly 15 years of interaction with humans, the Semanians and their world is still largely alien to its human neighbors, with many discoveries to be made about them and what bizarre occurrences and fields of magic, or ‘Latena’ as it’s called, could be at play. To be a policeman in San Teresa means to expect the unexpected, a mantra that would benefit the viewer just as well.

Of course, constantly throwing surprises at the viewer runs the risk of making the world feel incohesive and random, but these ideas are well-developed and properly built up to thanks to some impeccable world-building and (for the most part) remarkable pacing. The true depths of Semaani reveals itself little by little in the human world, pacing out these discoveries in such a way that provides intrigue and tension in a near-perfect manner. It also helps that Semanian arts have a logical presence as opposed to simple magic. Aside from the admittedly far-fetched “strong feelings create Latena” thing, practices and contraptions of Semanians operate on rules of their own, much like our technology. Perhaps the author, Shoji Gatou, was given a freebie by age-old concepts in Western fantasy when creating the Semanian race, but this world is so fleshed out to where it’s given an identity of its own. Semanians even have their own language, which when spoken sounds remarkably elegant and refined, unlike numerous other fictional languages such as Parseltongue of Harry Potter which sounds vague and almost like gibberish. To show just how refined this language is, aside from apparently being learnable, it’s worth considering Tilarna’s uttering of “Boliceman.” This is made to be an endearing quirk, but it also gives the implication that the Semaani language likely lacks a ‘p’ sound, with ‘b’ as a common substitute.

After some time, the role of exploring a foreign world is passed over to Tilarna. Here we have the pleasure of watching Tilarna trying to cope with and adapt to facets of our planet Earth--specifically, pornography and vehicles of transportation--all bundled into an episode’s worth of hilarity, enticing chaos, and a grace of character bonding at the very end. It’s easily one of the most enjoyable episodes of anything in recent memory, as well as the few cases of anime humor making me laugh out loud. This is an episode that lingers in my memory continually, which is a very high honor to hold.

A prominent facet of the setting is how the world of Semaani interacts with that of Earth. The many fields of Latena originating from Semaani unsurprisingly can accomplish certain tasks in a way that human technology cannot. And surprisingly, the opposite is also true. Coding, hacking, firearms, automobiles, photography, and night vision goggles are what the world of Semaani lacks, and play an equally vital role in snuffing out the perpetrator.

Obviously the aptitude of your arsenal means little if the one using it lacks competence, as evident in many shounen and seinen that get away with artificially stretching out their arcs by having characters fumble around or arbitrarily bringing forth a greater power to stall the action. Cop Craft is the exact opposite case. The policemen of San Teresa are intelligent and capable as policemen are expected to be, using any strategy or asset at their disposal to gain the upper hand. I think anyone could remember a time they watched or read a piece of media, getting aggravated at characters for not seeing the obvious solution or making moronic decisions leading to their downfall, taking you out of the experience. Cop Craft almost never stumbles upon this, and crimes are dealt with efficiently through the use of Latena magic, Earth technology, and competent storytelling.

That said, as praiseworthy as this is, it comes with a cost: conflicts in Cop Craft are dealt with relatively fast, and arcs can feel frustratingly brief and even anticlimactic as a result. Some could frame all this as a negative, but it ultimately depends on what you look for in an action show. I for one couldn’t be happier with how Cop Craft chose to execute this. The overall narrative of Cop Craft is akin to that of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, and not just with its Western influences. It spends a brief enough time on an idea so as to throw a new one on the table. Cop Craft never gives anything a chance to get boring (excluding the fan-hated episode 8). Each arc is expounded upon enough to be satisfying in its own right, with the resolution feeling authentic and plausible rather than climactic.

Apart from human tech and Latena, the interaction between Semanians and humans leaves sociological effects that are intriguing and applicable to reality. Heavy politics are in full force as would be expected in a city of mixed races, and Cop Craft is incredibly bold and proficient with this direction, especially for an anime--granted, it involves a fictional race, but the point stands. Multiple points of view regarding the presence of Semanians are touched upon and come into play during a much later arc, lending more weight and authenticity to an already fascinating world. A simple biased aversion towards Semanians or humans for what they are is obviously just racism, but one character in particular has a far more elaborate and justified viewpoint that comes from a similar place, whose quote is written below:



“Coexistence, peace...just lies idealists tell. Earthlings and aliens can’t ever get along. We must keep apart.”

“Some of them are getting by just fine!”

“And their ability to adapt is what scares me. Look at their strength, their vitality; in three generations they’ll usurp us and rule the Earth! The invasion will be over before anyone notices. Yes, not even the invaders are aware of what they’re doing. The world needs to wake up and see just how dangerous these Semanians are.”



If you’ve watched Cop Craft up to a certain point, you definitely know who these quotes are from, and where this exchange transpires. For spoiler reasons, I won’t say, but the crux of the matter is the ideology of what is said here. This is clearly in line with most conservative views regarding immigration; a fear that there is more to lose than to gain, and results can be disastrous. Obviously there are different viewpoints on immigration and I don’t wish to have this sort of discussion at the moment when it comes to real life issues, but Cop Craft is commendable in bringing this predicament to light in a setting where it fits like a glove.

For a 12-episode season, it would be wrong of me to say that these issues are explored to their fullest, but that’s all the more reason to consider the ongoing status of the source material, and to acknowledge that the anime only covers a portion of what is, or will be, in the full story. If anything, this is a positive way of looking at the studio’s size. Since their budget is so small, there’s a relatively greater chance of Cop Craft making a good profit, thus hopefully leading to a second season being made.

What’s really admirable in regards to the studio’s size is just how well the team could do in spite of such meager production. While Cop Craft’s animation is limited, the overall aesthetic is a feast for the eyes. While the show lacks in frames, it excels through well-directed framing and glorious attention to detail. The open nocturnal suburbs are coated in a softly-lit patch of neon colors, contrasting with the grim and subdued tones of the alleyways where conflict is sure to erupt. Bloom lighting is applied constantly in places to accentuate the bright urban life. Most indoor areas are rendered in modest colors where bloom lighting is sparingly used, creating a calm environment where the brutality of police work is given a rest. With such limited resources, the team has made a show that is not only pretty to look at, but with effective theming for different environments. All of this is to say, Cop Craft is one of those cases where the art is superb, but the animation is lacking--hopefully the anime community will finally know the difference between the two.

When it comes to Cop Craft’s visuals, there’s no getting by without mentioning the action scenes, which are particularly of low quality past the second episode. This is where the studio’s size is made all too clear. However, lack of animation isn’t exactly the only thing holding back the action scenes, and this is an area where people are most inclined to blame the director. So here’s the way I see it: is the director, Shin Itagaki, at fault for Cop Craft’s shoddy action scenes?

My answer is: yes and no.

Shin Itagaki is an enigma of the anime industry. You might construe that as a word of praise but that’s literally what he is. Shin Itagaki is the director of shows like Basquash!, Ben-To, Teekyuu, and of course the infamous Berserk 2016/17. On top of being a director, Itagaki is also a freelance animator, sometimes doing his own work during production, and an extreme perfectionist. When discussing the animation quality of Cop Craft, an important thing to consider is that Shin Itagaki has a rather unusual way of directing fight scenes, putting more emphasis on impact than spatial awareness. This sort of style favors very dynamic camera angles and frames of impact, constantly breaking the 180-degree rule of cinema which all results in an action scene that feels visceral yet lacks sense of place. Cop Craft is consistently animated in 3s, and most of its action scenes are animated similarly to the likes of Studio Trigger, with limited frames, heavy smearing, and very dynamic pose-to-pose action facilitating impact in a way that fluidity cannot. However, with such wild storyboarding and constant breaking of the 180-degree rule, higher frames are a must for the scene to flow properly, and Cop Craft is proof enough of how much this can backfire.

To see just how well Itagaki’s action can turn out, look no further than Ben-To. Fight scenes in Ben-To, as well as certain ones in Cop Craft, are evident of just how much increased frames make the difference with this style, creating enough flow between scenes that would otherwise end up disorienting and drain the scene of its tension. With the current state Millepensee is in, it seems most wise to ditch such strenuous methods and stick to basic, conventional fight choreography to make do with what little frames there are to work with. In the case of Cop Craft, this would have been the better approach in plenty of cases. Many scenes would have worked much better with the same amount of frames but different storyboards, but it seems that Itagaki hellbent on sticking with his vision no matter what, making demands that the studio just isn’t able to meet.

This really hurts the anime in the long run, and it’s incredibly tragic. But there’s a reason I’m not putting so much scrutiny on this front. And it’s that I fully expect the DVD releases to amend this. Itagaki is clearly a very ambitious, passionate individual, and along with his team would love to take any opportunity to make this project exactly how they wanted to. For some episodes it’s not a huge deal if not many changes are made, but as for episodes 3, 5, and 10, Millepensee would be insane to not give them a makeover when the chance comes. Those episodes are infamous for containing some of the worst action in the series, with episode 3 commonly remembered as one of the most shocking dips in quality an anime has ever suffered. But I have faith in Itagaki and all of Millepensee, and wish them nothing but the best.

Cop Craft, you deserve better. You deserved a bigger budget, you deserved better management, you deserve more attention, you deserve more support, and above all things else, you deserve a second season. This fascinating world, these splendid characters, the intriguing storytelling; Cop Craft is a project that is clearly too ambitious for what the studio is actually capable of, and it’s my earnest wish that the BDs improve upon this significantly, as it’s their one chance at polishing this product into what they truly wanted it to be. The heart is there, the team is competent, and the tremendous quality of the source material is for us to experience on a small screen. While I hardly ever excuse poor production, this is a team that deserves our sympathy and support. The story of Cop Craft feels like it’s only just begun, and I’m fully on board with what more adventures await our duo, as well as how much higher the studio will go from what is their biggest project yet."
5030,"I've watched a fair amount of absurdist comedy anime in recent years, and the better ones I've seen have been the shows that try to push the envelope as far as they can without letting the envelope fall over the edge of the table and splay its contents all over the floor. It takes a lot of skill to turn a potentially mundane, everyday story concept into something surreal and maddeningly wacky without losing sight of the end goal, but Maria†Holic achieves that tightrope balance with near perfection - although such observations are often matters of personal preference, which might explain its lower rating on this website.

The series wobbles regularly and always looks ready to collapse, but the fact that it never actually does is testament to the sharpness of its humor coupled with the breakneck speed at which it operates. It's very much like riding a bicycle - you have to ride it fast enough and well enough so you don't tip over and bruise your knees. And, as in the tale of Goldilocks, the amount of cringe that's served up always feels just about right. Never too hot that it tempts you to drop; never too cold that it starts getting old.

Premise (3/5): A school full of unflowered pure maidens is set upon by the raging lesbian Kanako Miyamae, whose unbridled lust has to be kept in check by her new roommate, Mariya Shidou. Or at least, that's what Mariya would probably have you believe. In truth, underneath Mariya's divine features lies a cold and calculating sadist whose personal dichotomy also extends to ""her"" anatomy. It doesn't help that Kanako breaks out into hives whenever she touches a boy, which is exactly what her crossdressing roommate happens to be.

The school in question, Ame no Kisaki, was where Kanako's parents met, and so most of the ""plot"" - if you can call it that - revolves around Kanako's bullheaded attempts at finding her own brand of love before her high school career comes to a close. Of course, the machinations of Mariya, who aims to become the school's chairman in order to fulfill his grandmother's wishes, inevitably get in her way. The result is a relentless barrage of jibes, jabs, and jitters between the two, buttressed by the comings and goings of their well-meaning yet somewhat naive friends, who are kept in the dark about the duo's true intentions and personalities. As a whole, Maria†Holic feels like a long stream of standalone comedy sketches rather than one coherent story, but there's really nothing inherently wrong with that.


Far more than meets the eye.

Characters (5/5): The cast is one of the most wonderfully diverse that I've seen in any anime, comedy or otherwise. Many of the characters are multi-faceted and subsequently duplicitous in the most intriguing ways, and none more so than the titular character, who hides an icy, mischievous and oftentimes cruel demeanor beneath a facade of youthful maidenhood and delicate compassion, yet also occasionally finds it in himself to care for those around him, even if he'd much rather not inconvenience himself unnecessarily. The least mysterious member of the cast is Mariya's counterpart, the tall, heavy, girl-loving, tomboyish barge-pole known as Kanako Miyamae, whose private intentions are always written all over her face - and sometimes all over the floor, when something particularly salacious triggers one of her many nosebleeds.

The minor characters also have many faces: Matsurika is the omnipresent maid whose silence serves only as a veil for a vulgar vernacular and mercilessly rude attitude; Kanako's group of friends, though universally caring, have their own disparate issues and personal insecurities to overcome; the dorm leader, known only as ""Boss"" or ""God"", is a peculiar and idiosyncratic entity whose small stature belies a creeping air of hostile danger and obscure threats; Ayari, the student council president, is a perfect specimen molded in Mariya's image - which makes it fitting that the two of them have an intertwined history and a relationship that often borders on belligerence. There is not a single boring character in the series, which is just as well, since most of them get more than adequate amounts of screen-time in order to allow them to display what truly makes them special.


What, indeed?

Audiovisuals (5/5): Maria†Holic is a quintessential showcase of the abstract, avant-garde, and seemingly arbitrary style of animation by which the Shaft animation studio makes its name. (If you've watched the Monogatari series, you'll know what I'm talking about.) Though the background art is some of the least detailed I've seen in any anime, that's just about the only real ""flaw"" you might be able to find. The animation fervently darts between different aesthetics, from meticulous, shoujo-influenced, sparkly-eyed character art in one instance to the hard outlines and chiseled cheekbones more reminiscent of series such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in the next. Every comedic device available to animators is thrown into the stew, creating a concoction that feels like art in its own right, yet somehow manages to be something much, much more.

The soundtrack is a mostly thematic repertoire of calm, orchestral tunes - as befitting an anime about a Western-style girls-only school - alongside more dramatic tracks for the more climactic (and sometimes a little scary) moments in the show. The OP and ED are exceedingly catchy, and the wealth of sound effects and excellent voice acting means that every nuance, every anvil drop, and every pained scream always appears in the right place at the right time. Overall, this is definitely one of Shaft's finer works.


Absolutely nothing suspicious happening here.

Execution (4/5): The most vital aspect of an absurd comedy is whether it knows when it's taking a joke too far - a joke that wears out its welcome immediately becomes a nuisance, and hence a reason to leave the theater in a hurry. Maria†Holic is sometimes guilty of overcommitting, which can make it an exasperating watch, but that problem is outweighed by the sheer variety of humor it has at its disposal. It doesn't have to focus on one particular gimmick simply because it doesn't need to - it goes through the motions at an unprecedented velocity, slaloming from stunt to stunt with zero time for rest. It will parody anything and everything in its pursuit of entertainment, and even those moments that make you facepalm with overwhelming force invariably draw a few hearty chuckles. The dialogue is just as snappy and incisive as the pacing, which doesn't hurt the show's chances at all.

Like most absurd comedies, Maria†Holic is an acquired taste. Many will hate it or dismiss it as an exercise in mindless, pointless theatrical experimentation brought to the big screen. But if this is the sort of series that happens to tickle your pickle, then you'll absolutely love it, even if the throbbing pain in your heart after witnessing so much cringe takes a while to subside.

Matters of personal preference are often hard to explain, and one man's poison is another man's gravy. Maria†Holic, to me, was some of the smoothest and spiciest gravy I've ever had the pleasure of savoring.


The end of Kanako's life, perhaps... or maybe just the beginning."
21360,"First off, let me make it clear that I'm a huge Ace Attorney fan. The games are all very dear to me, and the first three are, in my opinion, especially spectacular. This anime covers the events of the first two games.

So, first, let's talk presentation. I quite like the background music, it's pretty fitting and the main theme is super catchy. Some of the court themes are a little underwhelming, but overall I'd say the music does its job pretty well. Both the OPs and one of the EDs are very idoly - if you like idol music, you'll probably like them. If you don't, then you probably won't. The other ED is a (in my opinion) very nice pop ballad. Cool.

So, the character design. I actually think the characters generally look pretty visually appealing. They all look pretty similar if not identical to how they look in the games. Well, when they're not moving. Unfortunately, the animation is not so good. The characters are nearly always horribly off model. Not in a good KonoSuba way, in a ""this anime was far too rushed and lacking a decent budget"" kind of way. The animations aren't nice looking or interesting, they're just dull and bad. Also, side note, the background characters' faces in this show look hideous. I get that they're going to look as good as the foreground characters - that would be pointless - but they just look appalling in this, sometimes even to the point of being distracting. When the faces in your show look distractingly bad, that's when there's a problem.

There are also some strange changes to the story. I should note first though that there were always going to have to be some changes when adapting this series to anime. I understand this. Some changes were actually really good. Having screens in court to replace the game's UI works really well. That was a good change. On the other hand, sometimes certain characters were replaced with other ones for no reason whatsoever. It doesn't improve the show in any way, and just serves to confuse fans of the games. It's not like it ruined the show or anything, it just seemed super weird and unnecessary. Oh well.

But now I want to talk about what I believe to be the real problem with this anime is. The reason fans of the games and newcomers alike found it to be pretty ""meh"". These games just don't work very well in a non-interactive medium. The whole joy of the Ace Attorney series comes from that ""aha!"" moment when you finally find a lie in a witness's testimony, when you discover a damning piece of evidence, and when you nail a killer. The whole satisfaction of these moments is YOU working it out, and that just doesn't really work as an anime. Sure, it can still be interesting to find out who did it and how in the anime, but the real satisfaction, the thing that made the series as successful as it is, comes from the interactivity of the game medium.

So I think this anime wasn't awful. It had many enjoyable moments, and there are aspects that I really do like about it. But in somes ways, it never could have lived up the the heights of the games for me, and I think for many others too. It can be an interesting companion to the games, and I enjoyed seeing the stories I loved animated on screen, but as a stand alone series, I'm afraid that this anime was, in my opinion, a failure.

Nevertheless, I look forward to the next season. Maybe the animation will be better. I hope so."
135102,"[By the Grace of the Gods](https://anilist.co/anime/115740/By-the-Grace-of-the-Gods/) was a very lighthearted anime centered on Ryouma Takebayashi, a middle aged man reincarnated to another world in the body of a young boy. This anime used the fact that the main character is young to create a lighthearted show centered around helping people as well as an interesting taming aspect. The taming of slimes was what got me interested in the anime in the first place thanks to the particular evolutionary aspects and interesting uses for this fictional being.

[By the Grace of the Gods 2](https://anilist.co/anime/135102/By-the-Grace-of-the-Gods-2/) tries to create a sequel to a show that finished in it's previous first season. Ryouma has found a business niche and is now fairly successful, the family that helped him is now gone including the second main character.
Now, you would think that there would be a new main line that the story follows now that the original plot has ended.  Unfortunately, that is not the case. Ryouma does odd things here and there with no specific goal in mind as he encounters no adversity whatsoever. This translates into a very boring, often frustrating watch where you, the viewer don't look forward to anything, are never caught by surprise.

This isn't helped by the fact that the anime constantly reminds you of it's better first season through Eliaria Jamil. She appears very briefly in almost every episode reading the letters that Ryouma sends her and the odd episode 9 dedicated to her. I can see why the anime took this approach as the first season ends with her, the second main character leaving. That being said, having a character read out what you have experienced just before every episode gets really boring. That one episode felt really weird as well, suddenly, out of the blue, we get an episode dedicated to her that has no implication to the story. Eliaria's presence serves no purpose other than reminding the viewer that this second season was not planned and has been thrown together quickly thus not making any sense whatsoever.

The first season didn't have any character development and the second season doesn't change that but this time their presence is annoying. Instead of trying to make developped characters that are unique this season decided to make standard ones with unnecessary quirks. This completely overwhelms the calm, kindhearted feel you get from the original characters removing that small amount of enjoyment from the original show. Add this to an unremarkable art and animation style and you have yourself a complete disappointment.

This anime was never good, but it was unique. This second season has rendered an already lacking show into something that I simply can't recommend."
20884,"Eu nunca havia assistudo um OVA (aprendi o conceito hoje), mas me diverti bastante com esse arco secundário do Nekoma! A animação parece mais ""truncada"" que do anime, mas também há maior exploração dos espaços novos, como Tóquio e o colégio dos gatinhos. As paisagens do trem que Kenma e Kuroo pegam e o horizonte próximo ao colégio Nekoma são bem construídos, tão lindos que percebi que gostaria que essas paisagens também estivessem presentes no anime. Parece que não são os mesmos animadores da primeira temporada, ainda que os traços marcantes sejam mantidos. Personagens como o Kuroo e Inuoka são mostrados por novos ângulos, aprofundando no desenvolvimentos deles. 

Como é um episódio mais leve quanto a progressão da trama principal há mais espaço para o humor, como o plot B com o joguinho que Kenma e os alunos do Karasuno estão viciados. O anime normalmente já é bem engraçado, mas aqui parece que o humor foi o carro-chefe e eu não parava de dar risada. Como já assisti parte da segunda temporada eu já havia conhecido o Lev nas suas interações com o Hinata e confesso que não tinha curiosidade para saber mais sobre ele, mas esse OVA foi muito bom para apresentar e aprofundar nas relações do time do Nekoma, o que me agradou bastante.

Tive uma jornada não usual assistindo Haikyuu, porque vi o filme 5 (A Batalha do Lixão/The Dumpster Battle) com a minha melhor amiga no cinema e só depois fui assistir ao anime (e comprei a primeira edição do mangá). Portanto, eu já tinha um carinho especial pelo time do Nekoma (o Kuroo foi meu favorito quando vi o filme) e fui surpreendido que o foco das duas primeiras temporadas (que são as que já assisti) não é tão grande neles. A relação Kuroo-Kenma que tanto amei no filme está retratada aqui também, então fiquei bem feliz.

Agora vendo o OVA Vs. Falling Grades eu aprecio ainda mais esse arco do Lev, seja pelos experimentos quanto a animação, pelo cuidado na construção dos cenários e pelo apelo cômico, ainda que o movimento dos personagens seja mais ""truncado"", como se a animação seja em 12fps ao invés de 24fps ou 36fps. Essa side quest serve o propósito de introduzir e aprofundar relações dos personagens apresentados, sendo um deleite assistir. Espero que os próximos OVAs sejam mais como esse primeiro, porque percebi que não me interesso em somente ter cenas extras do mangá em formato de anime, mas sim nesse teste sobre os limites da própria animação e do próprio meio.

Enfim, não sei mais o que escrever, porque eu de fato gosto de escrever textões mas o que tanto pode ser dito sobre um OVA de 24 minutos, né? Ri demais e bem que o Anilist podia deixar eu terminar minha review bem aqui."
1313,"Digimon Adventure 2002 or 02 is a sequel to Digimon Adventure 1999 and continues with a new generation of chosen children to protect the digital world from sudden disaster. The digital world is inhabited by digital monsters called Digimon. Unlike Pokemon, they have more than 3 stages: Infant (In Training), Baby (In Training II), Child (Rookie), Adult (Champion), Perfect (Ultimate) and Ultimate (Mega) with the first being the names of the Japanese dub and the latter in English.
This series introduces a new ways of evolution and one additional new stage that in this series can be considered somewhere between Child and Perfect called Armor. Basically it can't fit to the traditional Level system like the previous forms which can lead sometimes to weird things when it comes to power scaling Digimon.

Like the previous season, the children get Digimon partners that help them develop and do the fighting.  Each having a unique personality. In the living world they stay in their In-Training II level and in the Digital World they are in their Rookie state.

Unlike in the previous show, the children can go in and out the digital world with their upgraded Digivices whenever they desire.
Another upgrade over its predecessor is the addition of more variety of soundtracks for evolution. The previous types of evolution have the old soundtrack but Armor Evolution, Jogress aka DNA Evolution and Ultimate Evolution have their own unique soundtrack.  

Digimon Adventure 99 was known for its great use of its protagonists. Sadly 02 can’t live up to the quality writing of its main cast.

Daisuke aka. Davis is basically a goofy version of Taichi aka. Tai. He starts off as a naive kid who is brave but over the course of the series he also worries about others taking their feelings in consideration as he was the first to be willing to trust someone who turned a new leaf. In short he has both Taichi’s and Yamato’s aka. Matt’s crests from the previous season and gives his take on friendship and courage. His weakness, however, is that he can be clumsy and has a crush on Hikari aka. Kari.
V-Mon encourages Daisuke often and shows a lot of personality. They are similar but often he feels embarrassed being part of Daisuke’s stupid plans to impress Kari. However, he has complete trust in Daisuke in fights even if it happens to be misplayed from the viewers perspective. He is one of the strongest members as he has the most evolutions.

Miyako aka. Yolie an energetic nerd. However, despite being experienced with computers and helping out a lot with Koushiro aka. Izzy who has the crest of knowledge, she is associated with love and purity aka sincerity. Crest that don’t seem to fit her selfish, greedy and cheeky personality.
Hawkmon is polite and has a cool design. There aren’t much notable interactions between these two.

Iori aka. Cody is the deepest character of the original new members. Despite being the youngest, he is skilled in kendo and can defend himself when the situation calls for it. His father who used to be a police officer died in an accident during the line of duty before the start of the story which shaped his black and white view on the world. Over the course of the series, his world would start showing more tones of grey which leads him to help reform an antagonist to the side of good.
Armadimon is a goofy armadillo who has some of the wildest evolution. Sadly he doesn’t contribute much to Iori’s character besides getting new evolutions out of them.

From the previous season, two other characters get upgraded Digivices and work as guides for the new members. Them being Hikari and Takeru who grew up.

Takeru aka. TK is more self confident unlike in the previous season and his knowledge sometimes end up helpful. Also some experiences from the previous season show a side not seen by TK so far and despite his on the surface cool self, there is a side of him that can’t forgive anyone who abuses the power of evil.
Patamon didn’t change much from the previous season. Sadly he can’t use his old forms for most of the season due to various cases the show used to power down the old cast. However, he did get an Armor evolution and later get a Jogress evolution.

Hikari aka. Kari was the last introduced member in the previous season and pretty much a deus ex machina. In this season she has an actual personality being a curious child and showing the most amount of emotions ironically. However, she is often the victim of being dragged into weird dark worlds with creepy images leading to situations the other members have to safe her. Luckily that doesn’t happen often.
Her partner Tailmon aka. Gatomon got powered down losing her holy ring putting her power down to child level despite being an adult level Digimon. But she does get new evolutions that help her out in fights. In the previous season she used to be an antagonist and the deepest Digimon partner. In this season not much of her personality shines except when she meets the ghost of her best friend and someone she hoped to never see again.

While 02 lacks good protagonists, it makes up for great antagonists. Some of which set the standards for many future Digimon antagonists to date.

Ken the Digimon Kaiser (or Digimon Emperor) is an evil chosen child who uses the Dark Spirals and Rings to enslave all the Digimon like Devimon did in Digimon Adventure 99. But unlike Devimon, Ken is far more effective. He builds towers, Dark Towers, that unable Digimon to evolve to the next level unless they use Armor Evolution making all the former cast members Digimon useless. He upgrades his gadgets when he sees there is an issue in them and even goes as far as building his own Digimon partner Chimeramon aka. Kimeramon. Ken has a tragic past where he used to be overshadowed by his overly skilled brother. Once that brother died, he filled that role in the family becoming a new prodigy to the point anyone else looked inferior to him including his own parents. Seeing him rise, develop and fall is one of the most interesting story arcs not  being successfully replicated by other Digimon series yet.
His real partner Wormmon is supporting him despite knowing what he is doing is wrong. He hoped some day that the kind Ken he befriended with would one day return. There is a great character arc between these two when Wormmon has to make a harsh decision in order to protect Ken.
While he lacks Armor Evolution, he still ends up getting one of the strongest evolution in the show.

Arukenimon and Mummymon are a duo of villains similar to Team Rocket. They are henchmen to a bigger villain but until that gets revealed, they work effectively creating powerful Digimon using the Black Towers that were meant to seal the power of evolution. They end up creating one of the deepest Digimon characters in the show.

BlackWarGreymon is visually just a black pallet swap of the original WarGreymon. Created by Black Towers, he is considered an evil Digimon. However, being mightier than his creators he disappears in the hopes to find the real reason he exists. This leads to him fighting the protagonists very often and his overwhelming power leads him often the win. It is very interesting to see what his search for meaning leads too.

Oikawa is an adult man who desires to go to the Digital World and is willing to do that by any means possible. He has a traumatic past losing the only person who shared his love with the Digital Creatures who was Iori’s dad. He is really clever using various means to distract the protagonists from the main goal and even making them fight his enemies, the Deamon Corps who came to the world of the living creating chaos. Despite being a mere human, he uses his knowledge and assets well to get what he wants.

However, there is a reason why 02 isn't as good as it could be. Rather pretty mediocre.
After the Armor Eggs ended their purpose, we still didn't see the old kids using their Digimon to beyond Adult, but instead the new kids got Adult forms themselves and the show introduced a new evolution mechanic. So the show introduces cope outs to prevent the old cast coming with the latest evolutions and overshadow the new cast. But they will get some back for some nostalgia trip.
And more and more restrictions were put in and adults have all forgotten about Digimon.
And like with Tamers, 02 tried to tie in the Wonderswan games to excuse why Ken got evil. Ken's backstory got more and more confusing with many plotlines being dropped. The Dark Ocean plot went nowhere because Toei found it too depressing but aired ""out of respect"" the episode that confused everybody. Deamon Corps were, while powerful, filler villains that only filled the runtime like how MetalEtemon only existed as a sacrificial villain for Jou to make the non-Ultimate owning kids relevant somehow.
And the old kids rarely did anything of value and the parents besides exceptions like Iori's were pretty much irrelevant.
Female characters are meh unless we include Arukenimon. Miyako is selfish and hyperactive like a female Daisuke. She is  more useful than Sora and Mimi but her role can be replaced by Koshiro in several situation. Hikari is less active than in Adventure despite being here since the beginning this time.

As a show where monsters fight each other, Digimon fights at the start aren’t that impressive. However, just seeing the different forms and the emotional struggles needed to archive the forms are usually worth it where the lack of good choreography can be looked past. There is a reason why many evolution, especially when they first appear, will stay with you. As the show progresses, the fights and budget improve. There will be a lot of recycled animation and the evolution to Child and Adult states seem rather lame. Like mentioned earlier, the new forms get a kick ass soundtrack unique to them.
Armor evolution is upgrading the Digimon for fast travel or other purposes.
Jogress or DNA Evolution is an evolution method where two Digimon merge into one more powerful one. However, each Digimon gets a set partner they can perform it with and nobody can chose who their partner will be. However, fusing Digimon is still cool.
There is the use of CGI for certain evolution which normally would be a turn off, but since Digimon are digital creatures, the evolution scenes are tolerable and give the show a unique identity as many later Digimon series will use that concept for their transformation scenes.

While Digimon is a kids show, it can be off putting or flat out scare the viewer as it goes on since the enemies can be deviant and scary.
Digimon can reincarnate but only in the Digital World. Digimon drying in the living world cannot. And one human will outright die in his show.

Digimon 02 is decent. It struggles to live up to the standards set by 99 and doesn’t take advantage of its old cast well to guide the new cast. However, it has amazing antagonist with lots of grey in them and are used as examples for future Digimon Villains yet to come out."
9135,"In the world of Amestris, a world that’s been torn to shreds by war and oppression, there are those who wield unimaginable power...  Alchemists.  Warriors who bend the very elements to their will.  They wield fire, ice, lightning, the ability to reshape the world around them at will...  But their power is limited by the laws of Equivalent Exchange.  There are some, however, who seek to overcome this barrier, and in order to do so, they seek the power of the Sanguine Star, a mythical stone that offers to shatter the limits of alchemic power.  Ironically, those who seek the stone do often seem to pay an equivalent price- Tragedy. 

For the Crichton siblings, seeking the Star is their only option.  Separated as children after their parents were brutally murdered for their alchemical research, Julia was raised in the valley of the Milos, a holy nation whose land and people have been exploited for generations by a militaristic force seeking to profit off of the power they believe to be hiding beneath it’s soil.  With her long lost brother Ashley finally by her side, and the infamous Elric brothers lending her their knowledge, the power of the Gods is finally within her grasp...  And none too soon, as time is running out for the Milosian people.  Will the Sanguine Star be enough to ensure her homeland returns to it’s former glory, or will the Star itself lead them to their downfall?

If we’re being honest with ourselves, the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise has never exactly looked, well, good.  At least not in terms of animation.  It’s been a while since I’ve seen either series, but I remember them both having their fair share of visual issues, the 2003 series with it’s constant budget dips and Brotherhood with it’s questionable direction and design choices.  Studio Bones has never been the most consistent in terms of quality, but most of their productions(including both FMA adaptations) had enough high points visually to make up for their shortcomings.  Compared to both of them, however, The Sacred Star of Milos looks like absolute garbage.

To be clear, it doesn’t ALL look bad.  If nothing else, the set pieces were all mind-blowing in the level of depth and immersion that went into them.  I’d love to see an artbook for this movie, just to see the concept designs that went into Milos, the underground tunnels, the military base, and even the train that the movie opened on.  And speaking of that train, it was CG, and it looked awesome.  The same thing goes for all the magical alchemy effects, and even the animation of magma in a volcano that plays a part in the third act of the movie.  The other side of the coin, however, in the character animation, which doesn’t just look bad, it looks straight up unfinished at points. 

One of the first terms I came up with to describe it is ‘Scuffed Miyazaki.’  At various points, it appears like they’re going for a Studio Ghibli level of motion in their characters, both in the many actions scenes, and occasionally even outside of them.  There are moments where a character will be running, and instead of using a close-up and bouncing the picture like most studios would do, they tried to go full body, with realistic, dynamic movements...  This is a high risk, high reward move, because while it’s incredibly ambitious and can look amazing when you pull it off, it can also wind up looking laughably cheap if you don’t have the budget to back it up.  Hell, most of the new characters even look like a cheap attempt to imitate Ghibli...  The Crichton siblings look like third rate Miyazaki protagonists, and even the Black Bats look like henchman pulled right out of something like Laputa or Nausicaa.

Thankfully, while the FMA franchise has never had great animation, it has always had consistently great music.  Granted, most people say this while pointing to a long history of awesome opening and ending themes, this movie obviously doesn’t have those...  But the soundtrack itself is perfectly up to par. Grand and cinematic in nature, with intense action themes and an over-all celtic aesthetic, some of the tunes sound like they were lifted from the show itself, and that’s not a complaint.  For the ending theme, the only real stand-out on the soundtrack, they brought back L’arc-en-ciel, a band who’s known primarily for performing some of FMA’s most popular tunes, and while the song Good Luck, My Way doesn’t hit quite as hard as Ready Steady Go, it still works nicely.

The entire main voice cast reprises their roles here, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, they mostly haven’t missed a beat.  Vic Mignogna will always be the iconic voice of Edward, and while I have some issues with the way the character is portrayed here, that’s not his fault.  Maxey Whitehead is still acting as the uncannily perfect replacement for Aaron Dismuke, and while it does kind of feel like she’s just her to pick up a paycheck at times, that’s likely because of how little Alphonse has to do plot-wise.  Same exact comment, but even worse, for poor Caitlin Glass.  Her character is so pointless in this movie they have to justify her with a plot cul-de-sac, and she sounds like she damn well knows it.  More noteworthy are the new additions to the FMA cast, Alexis Tipton playing Julia, Matthew Mercer playing Ashley and the surprise inclusion of Sentai’s Shelley Callene Black, all giving it their all and slotting well into the folds of the FMA universe.  I’ll admit I’ve never listened to any FMA entry in Japanese, but with the dubs so consistently good, I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything.

Okay, so, let’s not beat around the bush over this;  If you know who I am, then you know how I feel about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  It’s practically my signature at this point.  I don’t think it’s a bad show, I don’t even really dislike it...  It has a lot to offer that the 2003 version doesn’t...  But to me, it’s just not as good.  I like it fine, but the amount of people throwing around words like ‘flawless’ and ‘masterpiece’ just because it followed the manga and had a more satisfying happy ending do kind of get on my nerves at times.  If you prefer it, fine, but you can’t call it a masterpiece when the first 13 episodes had terrible pacing, the chibi slapstick flat out destroyed some of the more dramatic moments, and the plot just hands Ed and Al a pre-made Philosopher’s Stone to side step the moral dilemma over creating one.

Let’s put all that aside for now, however, because I already reviewed that show, it’s done and behind me, how’s the movie?  Well, I’ll get the positives out of the way first, the action scenes are really cool.  I mentioned earlier how amazing all the various set pieces looked, and they don’t let any of them go to waste.  I’m particularly impressed that they were able to build a fun action sequence around a moving train, because let’s be honest, scenes like that are not uncommon in this franchise.  They’ve done action scenes on trains over and over again across both FMA series, but this movie was still able to pull off something that feels new, and I don’t think the addition of flying terrorists is the only thing that sets it apart.  There are chases underground, battles between super-charged alchemists on steroids, a fight in an active volcano, soldiers and terrorists getting mowed down in combat faster than you can say “Men are expendable...”  From a pure action-movie standpoint, it’s pretty fun.

Unfortunately, it also has a plot, and that plot is an absolute clusterfuck.  If you couldn’t tell from my plot synopsis, this story is NOT about the Elric Brothers...  It’s mostly about the Crichton siblings, and the two pairs do not mix well story-wise.  Sure they have some smart connections, both with their thematic correlation as a pair of siblings who were tragically separated by the dark side of alchemy, and the more direct way with their connection to the Philosopher’s stone...  But by combining both pairs in one movie, they have to spend a LOT of time explaining both backstories.  If you’re watching this movie at all, you probably have some experience with FMA, so you probably know Ed and Al’s backstory like the back of your hand, which makes it kind of tedious to hear it explained to us in multiple scenes...  Yeah, we know what happened, get on with it!

To make matters worse, the backstory of the Crichton siblings is actually really interesting, but it feels like they spent so much time telling us what we already know that we didn’t get to SEE a lot of what happened them, which I frankly would have wanted to.  The Elric brothers almost feel like their presence in the film was unnecessary, outside of their use as cyphers to have exposition explained to them, their presence in the action scenes, and Ed’s knowledge of how to make a Philosopher’s Stone, roles that could have very easily been reassigned.  I don’t think the movie would be better without them, but they could have been tied into things a little better...  Unlike the rest of the FMA cast, who are entirely here for fanservice.  Roy Mustang has almost nothing to do, Riza Hawkeye has almost nothing to do, poor Winry has nothing at all to do outside of fixing a conveniently timed break in Ed’s automail arm.  I don’t think I’ve seen this many fanservice characters crowbarred into a story since Advent Children, or Trigun Badlands Rumble.

Which is to say nothing of all the damage this movie just casually does to the lore of the franchise.  It’s a pretty stupid movie in general, which, on the one hand is more or less expected in an action film, so you don’t complain when people grab onto things in midair without breaking their arms, or stand way too close to lava without getting burned.  Action movies are allowed to break those kinds of rules, but Fullmetal Alchemist has it’s own rules, and last I checked, healing people’s injuries with alchemy counted as human transmutation.  Last I checked, you didn’t need to ingest a Philosopher’s Stone in order to use it, and unless it was a fake like the one in Liore, it doesn’t vanish after being used.  Last I checked, transmutation circles were two dimensional drawings, not fucking railway systems that only form the circle when viewed from a certain angle.  Last I checked, an alchemist couldn’t just summon a pile of snow out of midair.  If I'm wrong any of this, please correct me.

There’s a scene where Ed uses alchemy on a steel structure to create a working pulley, with enough rope to lower him down the side of a cliff.  First off, how did he create rope from steel?  How was he able to create such an intricate structure, with so many working parts, and if that’s really something he can do, why does he need Winry to fix his arm for him?  Why do so many people know who the Elric brother’s are, but these same people are shocked to see Al being a suit of armor?  Why are they so quick to realize how he got that way?  How has all of this alchemy business, with the creation of a Philosopher’s stone in mind, not caught the attention of the homunculi?  Sure it’s happening outside of Amestrian jurisdiction, but you’d think Father would have caught wind of the Sanguine Star at some point.

There are so many more points I can make, but most of them are spoilers, hell, a few of the ones I’ve already given are spoilers to some extent, but my point remains the same.  This movie doesn’t make any sense.  The plot is incoherent and full of over-ambitious twists, and the moral dilemma over creating a Philosopher’s Stone is handled in extremely immature fashion, with Ed being unreasonably stubborn over his values and the Milosian leaders going out of their way to avoid presenting a very real and understandable justification for their plans.  Yes, Ed, wasting human life is bad, and the stone costs human lives, but these people are losing their own every day anyway, and they probably wouldn’t have to look hard to find volunteers willing to die for their nation.  I’m not saying I’d be on their side, but there IS an argument to be made, and they’d have made it if this movie was more willing to grow up and explore the issue than just go strawman all over it.

All in all though, I just don’t know what the point of this movie was.  I mean, okay, in a meta sense, I get it.  It’s more Fullmetal Alchemist.  It’s more of the characters we love who we’re not quite ready to let go of, being placed in a new situation, whether they fit there or not.  People will pay for that.  Hell, I’ll pay for that.  And besides, if the first anime had a movie, shouldn’t Brotherhood get one too?  Well, first off, Conqueror of Shamballah wasn’t great...  It was pretty good at best...  But at least it had a purpose.  It wrapped up several loose threads and gave the series some closure, for better or worse.  Brotherhood didn’t really have any loose threads, though.  I mean sure, Ed and Winry’s entire romance was relegated to a time skip, I wouldn’t have minded seeing that explored, but this entire movie feels so removed from the FMA franchise that any reference to it could have been written out in disturbingly simple fashion. 

It could have stood as it’s own intellectual property, and I’m not gonna lie, if they’d gone that route, it would have probably been better.

Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos was originally available from Funimation, but much like the entire FMA franchise, I’m pretty sure it’s out of print right now.  It would be easier to find this review under the mountain of inevitable downvotes than find this film at a reasonable price.  The original series and Brotherhood are available for streaming on Amazon Prime and Netflix, and the original manga by Hiromu Arakawa is still pretty easy to find stateside from Viz Media.

While it’s true that I strongly prefer the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist series to Brotherhood, they’re still both good shows, and I get the appeal of the reboot.  Honestly, Sacred Star of Milos is the only piece of FMA media that I consider to be actually bad.  It’s not a terrible movie, it’s nowhere near one of the worst I’ve ever seen, and like I said before, there are good things in it.  The music and voice acting were good.  The fight scenes were pretty cool.  There was some promise in the story of the Crichton siblings, even if everything else felt like a generic retread of previous FMA themes.  They gave Ed his hair outlines back.  The problem is, it feels like a soulless cash-grab.  The character animation is hideous, the plot doesn’t make any sense, and it just doesn’t feel like Fullmetal Alchemist.  It doesn’t add anything to the franchise, and nothing is really gained from watching it. 

    I give Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos a 3/10."
100382,"This review contains spoilers. (Not that there's much to be spoiled but just in case).



Long story short, if you want a forbidden romance anime with better plot, better characters, better visuals, better sound, better comedy, better ecchi, and better everything else… I urge you to check out [Oreimo](https://anilist.co/anime/8769/Oreimo/)! Oreimo isn’t even an ecchi and it does ecchi better than this disaster does. Now, I will go into slight depth about each of the follow things I just mentioned that Oreimo does better than this anime, and why.

Sorry in advance for lack of visual images. Maybe in the future I will edit it to include them but currently I have no desire to go back through this anime to find suitable images. (All the images used I already know the episode and timestamp of).

I’ll give you a basic rundown of each episode:
> Episode 1: Introduction
Episode 2: Forgettable (isn't every episode though?)
Episode 3: Cosplays
Episode 4: Swimsuit shopping
Episode 5: Beach episode AND summer festival episode
Episode 6: School culture festival
Episode 7: Female mc gets sick and male mc wipes her down in bed
Episode 8: Girl spends night in male mc's room
Episode 9: Group date to amusement park
Episode 10: Group date to amusement park Part 2

As you can see, literally every romance / ecchi trope imaginable in a short 10 episodes. Swimsuit shopping, cosplay, beach, summer festival, culture festival, falling ill, amusementpark and more! Seems they were too focused on utilizing every one of these tropes instead of the actual plot. The actual plot can be summed up in a single sentence:
> Male mc is basically the manager for his younger sister’s famous novel and soon-to-be anime.

Very basic creatures for a very basic anime, down below is a short description of each character and their respective ""personality:""

Chikai Towano: The pen name for Suzuka Nagami, acted out by Yuu Nagami (needed for context).

[Yuu Nagami](https://anilist.co/character/128437/Yuu-Nagami): The sole male mc of this anime with a spineless personality and an irritating voice.

[Suzuka Nagami](https://anilist.co/character/128436/Suzuka-Nagami): A tsundere bro-con. She's the best character, but also the most basic character with hardly any personality. 

[Ahegao W Peace-sensei](https://anilist.co/character/128438/Ahegao-W-Peacesensei): A person who's only character trait is being sexual. e.g., Drawing nothing but sexual images, working for a sex shop, seductively sucking on several food items, erotic cosplays, literally being called ""Ahegao"" 

[Reika Shinozaki](https://anilist.co/character/128444/Reika-Shinozaki): Chikai Towano's editor, who pops up a few times but like Ahegao W Peace-sensei her only character trait is being sexual. Talking to Chikai Towano in the bath tub, moaning into the phone, putting Towano's hand onto her breast, etc., etc. 

[Mai Himuro](https://anilist.co/character/128440/Mai-Himuro): A person who's a tsundere who only worries about finding out Chikai Towano's secret to make her manga a better success. 

[Sakura Minazuki](https://anilist.co/character/128443/Sakura-Minazuki): A voice actress who is Chikai Towano's ""biggest fan."" She takes on the persona of a clumsy / airheaded person. She gets introduced by tripping over literally nothing, and every appearance she's air-headed and just goes with the flow to be with Yuu Nagami.

[Haruna Kanzaka](https://anilist.co/character/128442/Haruna-Kanzaka): An annoying brat. That’s it, nothing else.

[Akino Kanzaka](https://anilist.co/character/128441/Akino-Kanzaka): The self-appointed “pupil” of Chikai Towano. She has even less personality than a bag of rocks.

That’s literally all the characters in a nutshell. Not a single one of them has any unique personality (and some of them have literally no personality at all). Down below I talk more about Yuu Nagami since his character annoys me with every fiber of my being.
The Most Annoying Character: Yuu Nagami
I don’t even have much to say being honest. Ima just show you the images and let them speak for themselves.
!img500()

So… Suzuku is literally inches from Yuu’s face, speaking the same volume she has spoken for the past minute of conversation. AND HE DOESN’T HEAR HER?? WHAT????!

!img500()
So in this one, Yuu wrapped his arms around Suzuka (For what? No idea, he just did it spontaneously). Anyways, it’s one thing wrapping your arm around someone, but resting your hand on their breast. C’mon that’s no accident. Suzuku is pretty flat chested, but we see her topless several times so I know Yuu should have felt something at least.!

Not trying to be rude to the animators, but I constantly cringed at the horrid facial expressions constantly displayed by this anime. I have two pretty good photos to sum it up. These aren’t even the worst of it, these are pretty good compared to some other facial expressions.
!img500()

img500()!

Another thing, the anime occasionally decided it would be a good idea to do a sideways shot. I don’t know how to explain it so I’ll just show you:
!img500()

Most of these are from episode 3, but this happens several times outside of that one episode. That series of 7 images are from 4 seperate episodes so you can see how much it happens.

Not gonna lie, somewhat decent op and ed (even if I only listened to them once). I’m a big fan of music and don’t usually skip ops / eds but I didn’t want to spend any more time in this anime than I had to.

Other than that, the voice acting was pretty bad, wasn’t even the VA’s fault, they just had to play trash characters in a terrible anime so can’t blame them.

I did have a few chuckles in this anime but most of the comedic aspects weren’t well executed. Most of the comedy is simply sexual references or innuendos; in an anime where the plot is completely based off ecchi tropes, you can imagine how well this went.

Here is a perfect example:
Warning, NSFW: (No nudity but just in case it might break the rules)
!img500()!

The little sister asked: “Can you tell me what a panchira is?” Of course, the male mc freaks out and the audience receives a panchira while the mc freaks out. (If you don’t know what that means, a “panchira” is basically a panty shot or an upskirt). The panchira used in this “comedy” isn’t even a good one. But just imagine the comedy for the whole anime exactly like this.

Now, I’m a fan of ecchi. It’s hard for me to complain about ecchi (which is why this is the highest rated category), but this anime still failed where I’m concerned. Obviously, I can’t provide photo evidence, but most of the ecchi was very badly drawn / I felt like the characters were old people anytime they were nude. There were LOTS of boob shots, so some are bound to be good, but most of them were not.

Also, lots of bathtub scenes; I should have counted. I legitimately felt there was a bathtub scene in every episode (there probably is being honest). Not that I'm complaining since the bathtub scenes were actually pretty steamy.. (ha ha)

Yeahhh personally, I wouldn’t recommend this anime to anyone. In fact, it was so bad that after watching hundreds of anime I had to write a review just to share my disgust of it. (I guess it speaks for itself since the mean score on this anime is in the 40s).

Anyways, hope my first review wasn’t too bad / drawn out / etc. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing and comments / suggestions to improve are always welcomed. :)

It is much longer than I anticipated. I doubt anyone reads all of this but here are my thoughts on this anime."
20615,"After the realease of Gen Urobuchi's Puella Magi Madoka Magica, back in 2011, there wasn't a big number of new animes that attempted to deconstruct popular anime genres targetted mainly towards kids, like Madoka did with magical girls, despite the show's success. 
One of the exceptions was Mari Okada's Selector Infected WIXOSS, that tried to do the same with card game animes. The first problem is, despite the show attempting to gave the Madoka treatment to card anime game, it seems like Okada or anybody else in the production staff haven't watch a single epiosde of a card game anime in their entire life. While Madoka uses some of the most common elements and tropes you can find an any magical girl anime, specially the Pretty Cure franchise down to the color coding of the cast. To make matters worse, we barely see any of the games in the anime, most of the events related to them happen off-screen. So if you came to this anime hoping at least for epic battles with nice animation, I'm afraid I'll have to tell you to keep movin'. You are not gonna find it here.
Okada's territory is teenage melodrama, that's the reason her most popular anime is Ano Hana. And to be fair, there's tons of it here too, but most of the characters feel underdeveloped and unsympathetic, so the watcher has a hard time trying to get invested in what's happening. Some characters will simply make you want to not root for their desires to came true, despite it was probably Okada's intention to be otherwise, like Yuzuki wanting to bang his own twin brot...sorry, i mean made a gender reversal OreImo (we'll take later about this). Others will make you feel like their problems are not as hard as they want you to present them so you don't have another solution that risk everything in a magic cards game, like in the case of Hitoe ""I don't have any friends except the ones from my old town who still wrote me letters, and i made two pretty easy in a span of a few episodes"" Uemura (seriously chica it doesn't seem that you're doing that bad on your own, why did you enter a card game?).
And don't forget our MC, who is supposed to be, like Madoka, a girl who doesn't know which wish to ask to make it become true, but she enters in the game anyway despite she learns how dangerous it is because, why not. At least when you become a magical girl you save people's lives, but here is basically a bunch of people risking their lives for wishes that in most cases are pretty selfless.
Like i wrote above, there's an incest subplot in this anime, and it makes this show pretty uncomfortable to watch. On of the main character has been in love with her twin brother since she was just a little kid, and has enter the game hoping that if she wins it her wish will be granted. And it's pretty obvious that Okada wants us to root for her, downright to incluiding a secondary female character who's the twin brother's classmate and later girlfriend, than acts all jealous of the relationship her boyfrined has with his sister, and when she calls it out she acts all bitchy, she won't gonna take her side. Well, Okada, let me tell, making a douchey character something that's true, doesn't make the thing less true, it only shows you're desperate to make us agree with the characters you want us to agree, because you can think of any other way to fo it, because there's no way some sane will do it.
Definitely a skip."
3667,"Three years ago, I watched this anime and slapped it a rotten score. After all, an anime featuring pantless, gun-bopping teenage girls couldn’t possibly ascribe anything of depth to the varied community of anime goers and entertainment seekers today, right? 

Right.

Then during my second time through, I realized something unbelievable about this series. This anime isn’t about half-naked chicks shooting down big, black cocks with guns. Right?

Right…ish.

So yes…by my THIRD time through I realized:  Strike Witches is an idiot savant of an anime. It is an attempted excuse for Japan’s WWII guilt, and combined with incidental, radical feminism investigates a unique reality of victory for all humans and absolution of the original Axis Powers. Furthermore, rather than to be undone by fellow man, the retribution for all the anger of that era is instead unleashed upon an enigmatic alien race bent on aimless worldwide destruction.

 Your 501st Fighter Wing. All the guns, less of the garments. (88/100)
Despite my rather despicable claims, this simple, misdirected story eagerly rakes in a “bare” perspective on Japanese postwar culture more than any other anime series I’ve ever watched. Yoshika Miyafuji, our protagonist from the Fuso Nation, has after a series of misadventures found herself smack dab in the middle of an international war between humans and a hostile alien invader known as the Neuroi.  Though the Neuroi’s intentions and methods are unknown, Miyafuji and the 501st Joint Fighters—the Strike Witches, or gun-wielding teenage girls utilizing magic-powered, leg-mounted rocket engines known as “Strikers” to fly—dedicate their lives (and panties) to the survival of mankind.

One of the most misunderstood things about this anime is its high degree of fanservice. Nearly every ten seconds the viewer is exposed to some sort of sexual innuendo, be it the slightest visual of pantsu or a blatant bath scene with boobs flopping about like custard. The delivery is unabashed in consistency, if not almost bewildering considering the depth of the alternate historical content. Indeed, this deceitful mask of perversion disguises a highly controversial possibility for this alternate universe as follows:

 - Despite being a relative time frame to what we live, there is no evidence for existing non-Japanese Asians, Jews, or Blacks in the entire series INCLUDING doujin and movie-based media.  In the series, the closest to being black might be the Italian girl, Francesca, but considering the brutal circumstances of World War II it freaks me out that neither a Jew or a Chinese exists among the ranks of survivors.
 - For some reason only a small group of magical women between the ages of 12-20 seem to be effective as combatants. Men, older women, and machines seem to be rather defenseless, rendering none but Highly Effeminate Teenage Vixens (HETV) as our only hope.
 - What are the Neuroi? The mysterious qualities of the enemy are vividly explored, but some answers aren’t given. I find it fascinating that the Neuroi have chosen a spot of the world between Karlsland (Germany) and eastern Russia (Orussia) as their hive.  If we consider the alignment of world powers during the war era, isn’t it interesting that the brutal enemy of humanity is stationed somewhere in Central Asia? Also, isn’t it just as interesting that the “good guys” in this series happen to hail from Japan (Fuso), Karlsland, and Orussia? Does anyone see what I’m getting at here?

My conclusion is that  Strike Witches presents as an innocent peep show, when it ruthlessly stakes on radicalism and nationalism as the true berth of survival. The weakest races have been eliminated, and a unique gift of power to women establishes a rather unanticipated form of feminism—perhaps with the intent to balance out the missing historical factors of this show.

This is particularly true with feminism. Throughout the series we CLEARLY see the reduced sexuality of women’s legs, as nearly all women in the show do not wear pants. For the otaku this is obnoxiously fanservice; to the alternate reality, this is a normal getup.  In this setting, men would have to start from this specific style of dress to find sexual arousal, and thus would be presented less opportunities to think perverse thoughts. Women, too, lose power through arousal of men, and are then more focused on careers and independence. I’m sure many a fan has tried to excuse this by saying that “in order to fit into the Strikers they can’t wear pants—blah blah—requiem stop talking—I’ll bite you” sort of argument is the most cogent.

The sad truth is that they’re only halfway there. Feminism wins simply by the lifestyle of this series, and—considering that all other types of Asians are missing—it is winning much more than races or gender stereotypes by default.

We also have evidence for radicalism through the consistent failures of men throughout both seasons. Airplanes, battleships, and maritime weapons are all rendered useless, bereaved of all duty but to serve as cannon fodder for the elite Witch squadrons. Commanders shrug helplessly while their ships are mercilessly crushed and sunk, and whatever authority they might even have over Witches is easily bypassed.

Next, if the Bechdel test were to be applied to this series, hardly a moment in it would fail. The entire series voids men of any appeal or authority, focusing the entire story on the Witches and their sisterhood. This is fascinating, especially considering that a tit or ass flies across the screen with all but sexual abandon. Even Yoshika’s awkward tit fetish remains effeminate, keeping the perversion limited only to women without delving into yuri or shoujo ai.  Also, in great relief there are absolutely no random peeping scenes involving half-naked men getting punched by tiny women into the stratosphere while shouting “I AM LIKE…SO SORRY.” Or at least not as in the exhausting case of practically EVERY ecchi harem series known to otakukind.

Altogether, though the creator himself may not have even dreamed of this, his lewd creation defines “unique” in its background, plot, and style. It may have been designed to make men horny and stupid, but it could still be insightful enough for any informed viewer. For reasons such as this, I can offer a ridiculously high score.

 Two-dimensional, but well-grown. (55/100)
While stock characters are expected for a series focused on as many pantsu shots as possible, making sure the characters actually fit together is not as such required.  Strike Witches makes several attempts to go beyond that, particularly with complicated ladies like Minna, Eila, or Gertrud. I should not be spoiling this series at all in saying that our main protagonist lives up to our expectations, as her limitations and delimiters all come and go as expected. There are a few good moments for everyone, even support characters such as Shirley, Perrine, and Francesca.

Regardless, all of the girls make up for their limited personalities with well-placed anecdotes of growth. Mio, in particular, encounters a struggle that puts the entire squadron through many hardships, yet we see with her continued passion to save humanity a constant state of perseverance. When not enthused by boobs and butts, we actually start to see a little bit of depth to everyone as they fight their own personal battles, (at least moreso than the drooling we do while they fight the actual enemy.)

My personal favorite? Definitely Perrine. Not because she’s a prissy, tsuntsun nerd that offers the best personality-to-sexual-exploitation ratio; mainly just because she is easy to figure out. In fact, each witch has some sort of spice to her that feeds the lonely wolves like me. While it is designed as an advertisement net to catch and draw my attention, it is at least nice to get a little more differential between the women than a typical 21st century harem series with the same visual appeal.

 Incidental music WIN. OP/ED fail. (86/100)
Neither the opening nor closing theme of either season was particularly fascinating. Though well composed and nicely sung, the openings are unfortunately the same, drab Ishida Yoko dancepop ditties that dominate such a small market with upbeat feel and trendy melody. Even though they are in the same court as Ishida, the I’ve Sound girls always manage to harness a stronger or more atmospheric melody. To its own justice the series should have had its own personal opening theme. Or perhaps rather than dance music, why not something on the side of a tune from the WWII era? Either way, another pop song about “Doing what I can do” and “loving some certain, undistinguished person” is justifiable for me to skip ahead one and a half minutes as soon as possible every time.

Meanwhile, the real groundwork is done by a time tested artist like Seikou Nagaoka.  His track “Witch no Tatakai,” or “A Witch’s Fight” is a driving force for perhaps the entire series’ climactic moments. Written with a very powerful bass line, we can feel the surge of excitement build up as the melody creeps in at some point seconds later. The sort of “champion melody” rises out of the trumpets (or in some cases, an electric guitar) through the oscillating strings, and builds up more and more intensity when recapitulating for a second time through. This track is perfectly aligned for underdog victories, high speeds, and pretty much most highly emotional scenes on the battlefield. For something that he probably threw together in 20 minutes, the perfectly chained elements make it quite unforgettable—I still could recall it several years after my first viewing of the show!

Nagaoka also empowers more endearing moments with his gentle strings in “Eikou no Kiroku.” He draws out mystery with “Kunou” and its Dorian harp. He demonstrates his mastery of orchestration with the grinding bass harmonies in “Neuroi no Su he.” Without a doubt, the musical programming for a show like this fit all too perfectly to serve as distraction from the fanservice, or at least more than the jumpy tunes that surround each episode.

 An animation behest to bre-hests. Ha. Ha. Ha. (72/100)
As a healthy male I would be criminalizing this series for giving the animation a score lower than 70 points. It is literally as though the animation studio took an extensive class on drawing vaginal protrusions and ample bosoms while studying butlery.
Seriously. Every few seconds, however subtle or obvious, a boob or butt is “served warm” to our eyes as a feast, delivering the most intoxicating form of perversion so much so that we are left passively molested by our screens. While many other series might put this one to shame in this regard, very few can deliver with the same degree of tastefulness.

My biggest detractor for score here is solely the key animation. Often during fight scenes the characters shapely figures would become too fluid and perhaps not-so-shapely. In fact, within the first five minutes of the series we see a rather terribly drawn view of Gertrud’s patooty, as it is quite clear that somebody was too busy completing key frames to actually bother providing detail to her shape.  This same mistake happens several times, showing that despite the “ample” details, the budget wasn’t exactly such. 

That said, the action scenes were made with good intention. The weapons are drawn badass—even to the extent that they can be as exciting as the…yep, you guessed it…perhaps the best action scene in the entire show might be the part in season one concerning Shirley and Mach 1; though not very detailed, the desired effect came through quite well.  (As for the best episode, it is without debate the infamous sukebe-mushi of Season 2, episode 7.)

 Uncomfortable for many at first, but the wounds will heal. (78/100)
And that is perhaps the best thing about  Strike Witches, considering the great deal of socially unacceptable content unleashed over 8 hours visually. If you are a Forever Alone, this series will provide great comfort. If you want to see something controversial and can choke down the hypnotizing amount of female parts, give it a shot. OR even if you are looking for unique Feminist propaganda, this would be great material for a write up.

If you are a married man who wants to pick up a good series to watch with the family…while I would personally think how awesome you are for even trying to suggest this series, you might just want to save it for when the family goes to sleep (or if you watch in sprees, when they go to see the old folks for the weekend.)"
21356,"This is a follow-up to my Pokemon XY review. To recap, I loved how XY perfected the near-two-decade-old formula that the Pokemon anime had used up until this point. The characters Satoshi, Serena, and Citron, are fantastic. The same remains true for Pokemon XYZ, the final third of Pokemon XY. XYZ takes what XY did and expands upon the aspects I thought XY didn't quite nail like the story and the character of Eureka. 

1. The Story
This is one of two aspects where XYZ heavily improves upon its predecessor. XY made its characters and world a bit more mature, and XYZ multiplies that maturity ten times over. XYZ sees the introduction of multiple new story elements, namely the inclusion of Satoshi-Gekkouga, Squishy, Alan, and Team Flare. I'm going to delve into each element on its own because nearly every other aspect of XYZ is identical to XY.

2. Satoshi-Gekkouga
This is by far my favorite part of XYZ, as I'm sure it was for many others. I've often said when recommending the Pokemon anime to people, that it's been consistently on a roll since 2013 and it hasn't looked back. And I believe that's mostly due to the new direction it's been taking where it hasn't really been limited by the narrative of the games it's based on. XY is the last Pokemon anime to (mostly) directly follow the game's story. XYZ really takes it in a different and fresh direction. Satoshi-Gekkouga is the first of a few new elements thrown in to shake things up and give the anime an identity of its own. Satoshi-Gekkouga is the mental and (partial) physical fusion of Satoshi and his Pokemon Gekkouga. I'm not going to get into the implications this has on the final story arc, but Satoshi-Gekkouga plays a huge role in practically the entire 47 episode run of XYZ. This new burden placed upon Satoshi makes him go through things he's never gone through before. Self-doubt, genuine anger, true lack of understanding. It's really interesting to see this character we've known for 20+ years go through things that are not only new to him, but new to us as well. Satoshi-Gekkouga is used quite a lot in this series, and I love every time he's used. The music kicks in. I get a huge smile on my face. Goosebumps crawl along the surface of my skin. My hair raises. Whether it's the kick-ass ""XYZ"" opening performed by Satoshi's VA Rica Matsumoto or the instrumental ""Satoshi-Gekkouga Appears!"", I always get excited when Satoshi-Gekkouga shows up on screen. It makes this character finally feel like the true badass he's supposed to be.

3. Squishy and Eureka
Squishy is introduced in the first episode as a small green snake-like Pokemon. At first, you don't know what to make of it. It crawls in Eureka's bag while she doesn't notice and she instantly becomes infatuated with it. Squishy is Eureka's entire motivation this season, finally giving this character a true purpose and goal. She even creates a song called ""Puni-chan's Song"" (Puni-chan is Squishy's japanese name, though the version I watched called it Squishy in the subtitles so I will call it Squishy. The dub also calls it Squishy.) that she sings to it a few times during the season. It's very adorable. In XY I felt that Eureka was not as fleshed out a character as she could've been. She had a few great episodes in XY (namely XY087), but I felt she was the only character whose potential had not yet been fully realized by the end of XY. Thankfully, XYZ resolves this issue by giving Eureka Squishy to take care of. Thanks to their bond, she even plays a critical role in the climax of the last story arc. I will not discuss Squishy's true purpose and role in the story so as not to spoil anyone potentially reading this, just know it is a key player in this season.

4. Alan
Alan was technically first introduced in the XY Mega Evolution specials, and not XYZ. For my rewatch of XY and XYZ I did not rewatch the Mega Evolution specials, because (1) I was lazy, and (2) I felt it was not required to fully enjoy XY and XYZ. And I was right. I do think it wouldn't hurt to watch them, as it's only 4 episodes and will give you a greater understanding of the events in XYZ, but for someone like me who had already seen them and understood the story going in, it was not necessary to watch them a second time. 
Anyways, Alan is a new character to XYZ and plays a key role in the development of Satoshi's character, Satoshi-Gekkouga, and the entire story. I cannot say much about him without spoiling the story, but he is a trainer who is motivated by his friend Manon and her Harimaron, who is in comatose. His entire motivation is to heal Harimaron and get it out of its coma. The events involving Manon and Harimaron are all shown and better-explained in the Mega Evolution Specials. In XYZ nothing is really explained until absolutely necessary. It's not hard to figure out what the situation is, so viewers aren't left too much in the dark about what Alan's goal is and how he got there. He has a Lizardon that can Mega Evolve, who becomes a rival to Gekkouga. He doesn't have much of a character arc until the very end during the last couple episodes of the last major story arc, but I enjoyed his battles with Satoshi-Gekkouga and watching him grow.

5. Team Flare
Team Flare is the evil team of this generation introduced in the first episode of XYZ. Their motives are unclear at first. All we know at first is that they want to capture Squishy. For what exactly is not immediately explained, leaving a bit of mystery. Team Flare in the games was a bit of a total pushover, with pretty poor motivation and were overall pretty bland. Luckily XYZ fixes this by changing Flare's methods and deviating from the original story. This shake-up in the story results in the best villain story arc the Pokemon anime has seen so far, raising the stakes higher than ever before. It's very well-done and provides the series a thrilling conclusion you can't look away from. 

6. Miscellaneous Thoughts
XYZ still shares the excellent Shinji Miyazaki score that accompanied XY, although this time there are a few new music pieces I'd like to mention. Actually, I've already mentioned them. It's the opening theme ""XYZ"" sung by Rica Matsumoto and a similar-sounding piece called ""Satoshi-Gekkouga Appears!"" composed by Miyazaki. Both songs are excellent and do a great job of raising your excitement levels. Yet another reason to WATCH. THE. SUB. XYZ is not perfect. It makes one misgiving towards the end that I absolutely cannot forgive the writers for. They would try to remedy this gigantic flaw in Sun & Moon, and while that moment was great, it does not make up for this absolute travesty that should not have happened. If you've seen this show before you know what I'm referring to. There's another unfortunate moment that happens in the second-to-last episode but I'm not actually upset about it. Sure, it's disappointing, but at least that makes sense from a narrative perspective. Story issues aside, the final episode and ending are great and provide a wonderful ending to a fantastic season.

7. Final Thoughts
Overall, XYZ improves heavily on XY's strengths and weaknesses and was the greatest season of Pokemon up to this point in time in my opinion. It is not perfect, and has one huge flaw that will stick out like a sore thumb anytime I think about this season, but one poor writing decision does not automatically mean the entire season is bad. I cannot recommend Pokemon XY and XYZ enough. They are the most action-packed season of Pokemon to date, and give characters like Satoshi a kind of emotional depth we've never seen from the Pokemon anime before. It's darker, it's more serious, and it's still a boatload of fun to watch. I seriously hope we see more of these characters someday in the currently-running Pokemon Journeys anime. And I have a good feeling we will."
3092,"Shounen Ai which is a literal meaning in Japenese “Boys Love” is been around in the anime industry dating back in the late ’80s. Beginning its roots on Natsu e no Tobira for being the first movie and Patalliro! Both made by Toei animation. Only a handful of them exists mostly on OVAs and Movies but not much on TV series. Shounen Ai TV series for the most part doesn’t give much of an impact in both popularity and financial gain so the studios stopped making them. They are more like the shadows in the corner that only a selected few can notice their existent.

But one anime pretty much rise from the darkness and have reached the light of day and that was Junjou Romantica. Becoming a critical success in financial sales. With a devoted fanbase to back it up, it becomes a significant title in 2008.

img()


A question start to mind, Is this anime good in tackling the intricate topic of Homosexuality? The short answer is NO! Don’t let the statistics data fooled you. To be frank Junjou Romantica is an abomination mutated from the typical shoujo clichés.

img()


For starters, I would like to say this anime has a rather sadistic approach when it comes to romantic relationships. The romance in this anime consists of an excessive amount of sexual assault, rape, harassment, and forcing the weak to love back the strong. Sounds familiar? This is literally a plot for a Hentai. I am still baffled to the fact that this show is PG-13, to begin with. It should be R-17+ or higher. I watch a bunch of anime that have lesser the amount of sexual content than this anime but are still R-17 or R-15. I am impressed this anime did a good job of camouflaging itself. This anime is straight up a Yayoi since it bluntly presents a lot of sexual red flags that are punishable by law.

There is three male love team in this show. Each having equally worst than the other. Let me summaries each love story and characters briefly.

img()


First Couple is Misaki and Usagi. They got the most episodes amongst all the couples and it a disgusting love story of a grown man that sexually harasses and rape his best friend younger brother. Even if the age gap between the two is 10 years apart. The only reason why this anime being safe from pedophilia territory is Misaki is conveniently 18 at the time. And why would Misaki even hesitate, Usagi is the perfect Husbudo. Usagi is rich, successful, and reliable. If Misaki becomes Usagi's bitch he will have a wonderful life. In return, Usagi will have his personal sex pillow.

What actually bad about their relationship is that Usagi is always going to have his way on Misaki. Usagi can force anything he wants while Misaki is a submissive pussy bitch. There is no equal decision or fair exchange between the two. This one-sided relationship where only one partner is absolute on everything is not a healthy relationship. Their love story is shit.

Second Couple is Hiroki and Nowaki. Your typical teacher and student love story but on the most unbelievable passion. Nowaki just magically falls in love with his teacher Hiroki. Hiroki on the other hand is historically homo. They get a chunk amount of episodes for their story and to be honest, is boring and tedious to watch because it always the same thing.  

Would you believe me their relationship was built upon Nowaki's continuous attempts in invading Hiroki's personal privacy? Nowaki going for the extreme on stealing Hiroki's house keys to continuously invade the Hiroki's apartment. Until the guy has given in to his aggressive moves. There certainly less rape in this series. But Harassing someone's privacy is just not the way you attract a person to love you. The same issue with Misaki, even as a grown man, Hiroki is also a submissive bitch pussy. That is all for the younger guys D. Even he shoves in the corner acting he doesn't like it. But deep inside he craves for men's affection. 

I have no idea why Nowaki aggressively falls in love with Hiroki even though they only just met. I assume the author wanted to have a teacher and student love story but forget how to write an introduction first. Nothing to talk about this couple aside there love story is forced.

Third and Final Couple is Miyagi and Shinobu. Having the smallest amount of time and episode for their story. Their story is more like fillers to complete an episode quota on clearly how short it is.

Now a grown man being forced to love his Ex-wife younger brother that is 17-years younger than him. So aside from pedophilia with got incest now? And conveniently he just got divorced recently so his Ex-wife younger brother has an absolute chance to get his man. It is totally ok because they are no longer legally siblings in law. So you got away with the homosexual incest there Junjou Romantica. I guess you're really desperate for that PG-13 tag.

Same issues with the first couple. There is a moderate amount of harassment and rape in this story but not as much as the first couple. Still, a bad relationship since the way characters fall in love in this show is utterly ridiculous. Doing the same tactic of the second couple. Purely the best way to make a man fall in love with you is always invading his home privacy and continuously bitch upon how much you love him until he has gone insane and rape you. Certainly a brilliant plan. This not how relationships are made. 

To make a point. You cannot say a person is in a relationship just because they have sex. There should be a consideration in developing a relationship first. This anime is a lazy Yayoi crap. It's more about the boy's sexuality than the deep psychological bonds of a relationship.

As you can tell all these main characters romantic relationships are utter garbage and a joke. Truly a work of fiction.

Wouldn’t you even know, the humor quite ironically composed of a lot of gay jokes which are something you desperately need to ease down your aggressively erotic romantic drama. Nice work in attempting to break the 4th Wall. The drama is a serious joke. There is no absolute consequence in this show. Nobody and no one will ever intervene with our male couple's love stories. They are free to do whatever they want. They have nothing to lose. There is no conflict here whatsoever.

Even the supporting characters don’t even matter. What do they even do? Absolutely nothing. What matters in this show is the sexual pleasure of our main characters.

How about the Art style and Animation? Quite mediocre, almost all the character looks the same where the slight difference is the color of their eyes and hair. This anime doesn’t even know how to draw women its only women's character. The only trademark this anime has to offer to remember it by is the disturbingly large chins.


Music and Soundtrack. Forgettable and not worth remembering. Why would you want to remember this anime?


In Conclusion, Junjou Romantica is straight out bad romance anime. This anime has no chill or regards in building a meaningful relationship. It cheaply uses sexual plot devices to move its romance forward without any respect for its characters. The main characters are sex bitches than people. They never feel like characters, to begin with. The narrative lacks any redeeming themes and concepts. The moral messages are shit. And even if you change the gender relationship to exclusively female to male relationship. I assure you this the anime still a terrible romance anime that promotes invasion of sexual privacy and what a toxic relationship is all about.


This is a Yayoi Hentai pretending to be a rom-com anime. Don't be fooled."
154966,"A sneak peek at, what could be, my favorite season in the fate franchise.

img()

Quick disclaimer: This is my first review ever, I'll get better as I make more i promise.

The title says it all! These past few weeks I have been watching nothing else but Fate. I was so captivated by this well-made battle royale, with interesting masters, servants, powers, everything honestly. But fate/strange fake -whispers of dawn- grabbed my attention right before I even started fate, and today was the day I watched it, and boy, do I have stuff to say.

First off, let's start with the most important part for me: Characters.

What makes battle royale anime good for me are the not-so-right-in-the-head characters, or just characters that don't feel too basic, you can recognize them right off the bat when you look at them, and I must say, strange fake absolutely DELIVERS with these interesting characters. I seriously think this might be the best cast we have gotten (Fate/zero would be second). All of them have so much charisma, it is unreal. I've got to say, out of these 55 minutes my favorite characters might be:
 Flatt Escardos

 and Enkidu!
img()
They are such interesting additions to the series! Personally very excited to see if all the characters will be showcased well, but then again, the writer for this season is Ryougo Narita, who usually writes stories with large casts and all of the characters don't get lost in the writing, so I have a lot of hopes!

Next up I'd want to talk about the art.
img(
I think that the change of artstyle is SO good. I love the thicker outlines way more and more attention to detail rather than smoothness, which was the main focus in other fate seasons by the studios. Very happy that they decided to change it up a bit, rather than keeping it like usual. Also, the studio is A-1 PICTURES. A studio that did kaguya sama, sword art online, 86:Eighty six, so when I had seen the studio, I was not scared at all for the adaptation. I just REALLY hope they do not rush the TV show, that's all I ask.

Now, let's talk about the soundtrack. HOLYYYYY.... Hiroyuki Sawano does it yet AGAIN. Seriously this man has so much talent. Every second from the music adds so much tension to the scenes, This is a professional right here!

Okay, one thing that is a bit sad is that the movie is not very good for someone who just started watching fate, it does not explain the whole world well and only gives out some context for the servants and masters. So if you are interested to watch it, please make sure to finish fate/zero, fate/stay night mainly.

Now, the highlight of the whole movie: Enkidu vs Gilgamesh.
youtube(https://youtu.be/I-ypQw7v34?si=KzbxegRZLEVNBowe)

This MIGHT be my favorite fight scene I have seen in a long long time, the place that they were fighting in was so captivating, especially the detailed sky. Enkidu's powers were so beautiful, I am just super glad I was able to see him in action in the movie and not wait 2 years for the tv show to be released. Gilgamesh ofc is always entertaining to watch, his voice actor does a splendid job, always with the laughs LMAO. 


Here, have some pretty views I had captured while watching.

In conclusion: Fate/strange fake is probably the show I'm anticipating the most next year! I'm hoping it is as good as this special episode, because it is an episode i will not forget in a WHILEEE.
Thank you so much for reading ;D!"
21034,"With the advent of the constant bashing of many anime fans being distraught by the amount of moe-blob anime taking over the majority of the seasons since 2009, it's telling that the genre has long overstayed its welcome. I'm one of those who do not pay attention to the trends going on and approach something with an open mind, no matter what tag the anime falls under. There is always this sense of surprise still lurking in every genre. Of the moe-blob anime that has been on my radar for a while was Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka.

On its debut in 2014, Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka, I thought, was an excellent first season to start introducing the cast of girls that we would follow into their ordinary and cute daily lives. What kept me from loving it was that it seemed like a very ""safe"" moe-blob anime. The antics and situations from half of the episodes did not grab me as much as how I would hold my moe-blob anime to a higher standard than most people do. Going into season 2, I hoped that the studio developing Gochuumon, White Fox, would try to add more depth to the cuteness and maybe some subtle character depth. Now it seems my wish was granted after I was finished with it.



Gochuumon is, by and large, the most sugar-coated anime you could ever feast your eyes upon. The girls are about as kawaii and cuddle-worthy that you might get asphyxiated by the amount of kawaii essence that permeates the atmosphere. This does not just include how adorable the character designs are. Right down to the voice acting talent that is on here: Ayane Sakura, Inori Minase, Maaya Uchida, Risa Taneda, Satami Sato, Kayano Ai, Sora Tokui, Rie Murakawa, and even Saori Hayami making a supporting appearance. They all perform their roles exceptionally well and at their most heart-inducing cutest. The cute catchphrases all the girls repeat and their unique quirks offer a wide variety of charm that captivates you to watch more of these girls say funny and adorable dialogue.

As a slice of life anime goes, there is no plot to critique on. All you would have to go on is to analyze how the characters grow on you on an emotional level. Some of them try to add development throughout the show, but sometimes they keep them static, which can succeed on either side. Gochuumon fits more on the latter front. However, there is some level of development. Not from the individual characters but from their relationships that start to expand on their cute and hilarious situations. The 2nd season provides more to make the relationships genuine, from how these girls treasure each other as friends. I even felt close with them as I watched their progression from all these episodes from season 1 to season 2. That kind of closeness you feel when you watch anime that centers around a group of friends, and you can feel attached towards, whether comedic or dramatic in tone, is always a great sign that you did an excellent job writing-wise.



For the individual characters themselves, they are just about as charming and adorable as before in season 1. Some new things in season 2 give our previous characters more material to increase their likability. This includes how their personalities have different edges that we never thought of before, like Rize-chan having an adorable shyness to her when she is attempted to get cuddled by someone and Chino-chan getting more mature from Cocoa and the others. There is a more significant emphasis on Chino-chan and her friends Megumi and Maya than in season 1. I appreciated seeing the writers not ignoring some of the supporting cast. I would also love to mention the newest character that won my heart this year: Cocoa's big sister, Moka-chan. Seeing her wanting to cuddle with all of the girls and often visit them was an absolute riot and adorable. My only wish is if there will be a season 3 as I'm writing this, they give her even more screen-time than before.

Moe-blob anime art is prototypical, with big eyes as big as their hands, colorful and shiny hair, and small figures despite their age. Sometimes I feel as though I can get high off of the cuteness of Gochuumon. That is how strong the moe can get from this show. Now, how can this be distinctive from all other anime like it? It all comes down to how well the animators can make a scene that involves a quick chibi quip with the right timing or hilarious facial expressions to make a cute moe anime charming. Gochuumon does this well from how expressive the characters' emotions are, which feel precious to see from most of the scenes in the show. Although I wouldn't say the art hasn't changed a lot, it certainly feels like it has more allure to it, but this could be from how long I've seen season 1. Nevertheless, because I've warmed up to these characters going into season 2, the humor and expressive art grew on me better.



I just wanted to mention one more thing that I think is a sentiment of what makes Gochuumon the ultimate ""watch to make yourself happy"" anime. While the music in the show is not super special to even remember, the OP and especially the ED are remarkable. The OP and ED both have a sugar-coated J-Pop vibe to the singing and vocals that fit well with the show's atmosphere being a sweet slice of life moe anime. The ED is probably one of my top five favorite EDs of any anime ever. With its infectious vocals, rhythm, lyrics, and adorable dancing by our three little elementary girls, Chino, Megumi, and Maya, no song on earth could suppress your depression for the entire day.

Though not all jokes guarantee a laugh, Gochuumon season 2 is good enough, along with season 1, to warrant the distinction of being one of those great anime that is best to watch when feeling down. Most slice of life is for that purpose, but Gochuumon proves to be one that can be like that but also be enjoyed at the same time. There is no way this review can sway any of the anti-moe brigades into being interested in going anywhere near Gochuumon with a ten-foot pole. Then again, nothing will.

Grade: A-"
101773,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please! Pause watching Fullmetal Alchamist, and pause watching Steins;Gate. I've found a remarkable anime that's 10 times better than both shows. It's not even a question anymore of what the greatest anime of all time is. I present to you all, the gracious work that is: Ueno-san

I bet you're thinking, ""What makes this show so special?"" And boy, I could go on for HOURS talking about what's so great about this anime. But you're not here for that. I'll just give you a brief rundown.

The characters:
This story is original. We've got the twin tailed tsundere, the dense main character, and of course, the best friend. But what makes that all so special? Easy: They're second graders. I mean, sure. You COULD just go over to Steins;Gate and watch some classic Sci-Fi, but why do that when you can watch Ueno-san make a portable charger that's energy comes from rubbing her thighs? That’s right, you won't find THAT in Steins;Gate. And trust me, watching a second grade genius tsundere school girl try to forcefully get her crush to drink her piss out of a beaker is WAY more entertaining, and not creepy or weird in the slightest.

The Plot:
By far, Ueno-San has the BEST plot in anime history. Code Geass? Amature hour is over, Sunrise! You ain't got NOTHING on Lesprit's holy creation: Ueno-san! Need an example? Here's one:
The first episode, when Ueno creates an AMAZING work of technology, that, when applied, makes the user's skirt form some sort of intergalactic portal shit to keep other SECOND GRADE boys from looking up the girl's skirts. So what's the best way to test this masterful piece of technology? By letting your good friend (and crush),  Tanaka, see up your skirt. But wait, there's no risk involved, considering the Intergalactic Portal Shit® will cover up her entire lower half. Let's make one! Hmm, let's see here. I've got it! Don't wear underwear! Brilliant! She's a SECOND GRADER, so it's definetly okay. This show keeps getting better and better with every waking second you watch it. And I know you're probably thinking something along the lines of: ""But aren't they SECOND  GRADERS? That seems a like it's going a little too far."" And you know what I have to say to that? You're a FOOL. They're just characters, that dont even exist. It is in no way shape or form, uncomfortable. At all. I promise you won't be cringing at every second of this masterpiece.

The development:
Every other anime PALES in comparison to Ueno-san's character and story development. We get to learn SO much about our characters, like when Ueno makes an invention to bring one of her socks to life, and our trusty mc, Tanaka,  doesnt want to reverse it to it's normal state. He cared too much about it to see Ueno's sock die, and because of this, we got to see a soft side to our main character. And Ueno-san? Well, we get to learn about ALL the not weird fantasies of her inventions intentions, like how she makes an invention so that Tanaka literally EATS her panties in a not weird way. Trust me, it's not weird. And what other show introduces the main characer's siblings on the final episodes? That's right, only Ueno-san does, which is only further proof that this is the greatest show of all time and all other animes are just lowly insects a part of Ueno-god's world.

Overall:
What are you still doing here!? Go! Watch Ueno-san, for it will be the createst thing your eyes will ever feast upon. And if you've already joined the cul- I mean, watched the anime, spread the word! Jesus became popular through fame, and if this show isn't on par with Jesus, then everyone should be an Atheist. So now, my friends, my comrades, my followers, you must go on your journy. For you will one day be in my shoes, spreading the word of our lord and savior. From one weeb to another, Ueno-san is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest anime to ever be."
1119,"We’re all familiar with the timeline of the Pokemon world.  It’s the modern day, and we’ve spent decades following ten year old Ash Ketchum on his journey to fill out his pokedex and become a pokemon master!  However, forty years ago, back when Ash was probably still ten, there was another young boy named Sammy, who travelled the world drawing sketches of the pokemon he encountered.  One day, as he was about to explore the forested region hidden behind a giant wooden barrier, he received an ominous warning:  If you hear the cry of the forest’s guardian, stand very still, or she’ll take you with her into a different time!  Sam initially planned to follow this rule, but when he saw the voice of the forest being assaulted by a poacher, he had to step in...  Only to get dragged into the future.  Now, with the help of his new friend Ash, can Sam solve the mystery of how to protect both the forest, as well as how to return home to his own time?

For the most part, Pokemon 4Ever looks like your standard entry in the Pokemon series, albeit with maybe a slightly higher budget.  There are moments that showcase a bunch of different cost cutting techniques, but there are also a lot of moments where the animation is fast, smooth and kinetic.  So basically, it looks like the series on a pretty good day, at almost it’s best.  There are only really a few interesting things I can say about the visuals of this specific feature.  One, the CG looks like ass, and there’s way too much of it for how bad it looks.  Guys, you didn’t need to render two tree branches breaking in 3D.  Two, in spite of this the environment looks beautiful, which is a big plus for a movie whose biggest theme is nature related.  Almost all of this film takes place in a forest, which is highly detailed and looks consistently alive.  Finally, weirdly enough, 4Kids commissioned the Japanese creators to animate three new scenes for them, all of which we’ll discuss later in the review.

Much like with the visuals, there isn’t a lot I can say about the dub, because come on, it’s the Pokemon dub.  Everyone and their grandmother is familiar with this dub, especially in the period BEFORE everybody started getting recast, which this movie definitely was, but I’ll still put in the effort to find some things to comment on.  Ash’s new friend Sam is played by Tara Jayne, another legendary 90’s and 2000’s voice actor, who had played numerous smaller characters throughout the series, most notably Richie from the Indigo Plateau and Ash’s Bulbasaur, so she already had a strong chemistry with Veronica Taylor prior to filming this movie.  There are two cast members who have sadly passed away in the over 20 years since this movie came out;  The first was Maddie Blaustein, who famously voiced the character Meowth, but was also unrecognizable as the old poacher from the beginning of this movie, because that’s just how insanely talented she was.

The second actor to pass away was Rachel Lillis, who sadly died of breast cancer earlier this year, and she’s well known for voicing Misty and Team Rocket’s Jessie, and while Jigglypuff does have a quick cameo, she doesn’t have any lines.  Misty sadly doesn’t have anything to do in this movie, like she doesn’t call out a single pokemon or anything, but Jessie has her share of stand-out moments, at least from a comic relief stand-point.  Also, while we’re on the subject of Team Rocket, I recently learned the origin of James’ foppish cadence, and it actually has a small similarity to the origin of Pikachu’s name for Ash, Pikapi.  Like Ash, James’ original Japanese name(Kojiro) had three syllables, so it was decided early on that in the traditional  Team Rocket intro, they would have Eric Stuart drag his name out in an exaggerated, seductive way to cover all three syllables.  Kojiro became “Ja-aa-ames.”  I just thought that would be a cool fact to throw in.  Anyway, it’s not a standout dub for any particular reason, but whichever version of the Pokemon anime you prefer, that’s the version I’d recommend going with.

One quick note on the music, most of the soundtrack is the same as the Japanese version, with the exception of a really cringey song they added at the end, that goes “Celebi-ration” or some other stupid shit.

So yeah, this is the fourth pokemon movie.  If anybody’s wondering, I didn’t have any specific reason to skip the third one, I just kinda wanted to cover this one now because it’s my 251’st review, and Celebi is Pokemon number 251.  The title, 4Ever, was eerily prophetic, as this movie came out at a time when the franchise wasn’t necessarily guaranteed to last until the end of time, which we now are pretty comfortable that it will.  At this point, from a modern day perspective, the curious immortality of the series has become one of it’s most fascinating, and most annoying, aspects.  Most shows that run for as long as this one has will inevitably find themselves in a pretty tricky situation.  A lot of the people who grew up with the show are no longer children, and while there’s always going to be a comfort in the nostalgia of the past, they also want to see the show that grew up alongside of them, you know, actually grow up, but it’s hard to do that without alienating the new child audiences that need the same simple entertainment their parents had, and who don’t give two shits about the evolution or continuity of the material.

Ultimately, the Pokemon franchise would seemingly follow an interesting strategy for this:  While the games would grow up, adopting more complex mechanics and exploring more mature social issues, the anime would cater more to children, sort of evolving itself into an episodic series wearing the clever disguise of a continuous series, following Ash’s journey as he goes through every new region that the games introduced, never really developing outside of catching new pokemon and visiting new locations in order to better advertise the most recently added content in a never ending cycle of purgatory.  Through it all, Ash never ages, just like how Bart and Lisa Simpson never age, despite celebrating the same holidays over and over again.  Much like The Simpsons, Pokemon is stuck in a stasis where doing the same shit on repeat without taking any risks is simply the safe and financially secure option.  I loved Orange Islands, for example, but they’re never going to try anything THAT far out of the box again.

I was a teenager in the nineties, so I got into the series when it was just hitting the states, and I can say from personal experience that it’s very easy to approach it with a sense of tunnel vision towards its failure to live up to your expectations as a grown fan.  Hell, the reason it took me so long to watch this movie(Aside from Miramax taking over distribution rights from Warner Bros and generally botching the theaterical run) was because it came out when I was entering an extremely cynical period of my life, and I just hated how the title of the movie was a really lazy pun on the number 4.  Shrek also did the fucking 4Ever joke, but with an After at the end.  Now that I’m a lot older, though, I’ve made efforts to keep a wider audience in mind while reviewing anime that might not have been for me, so I’m going to try to approach this film with more of an open mind than I did for the previous entries.  I’ve already gone back and changed my score for the second movie, my personal favorite, so I’m already on this path and there’s nothing left to lose, so how well does Pokemon 4Ever hold up?

And I mean aside from the dirty booty CG animation.

Well first off, it starts out pretty well.  I appreciate that this movie opens with a pretty generous explanation of what Pokemon actually is, for any tots whose parents bought them this movie as a piece of shovelware.  So, if this happens to be a kid’s introduction to Pokemon, it’s not a bad one.  Throughout the film, but especially in the opening narration, we’re shown a very impressive range of wild pokemon just living their lives, from the most basic first route babies to a fucking Porygon, who I can’t believe they were legally allowed to add after that whole seizure incident got it blacklisted from any future anime appearances.  I also really like the fact that the poacher is going after Celebi with a Scyther and a Houndoom, since bug/flying and dark/fire are two deadly combinations for a grass/psychic Celebi, and you don't see that kind of attention paid to type advantages in the series very often.  The girl guarding the forest is basically just an exposition mouthpiece, but seeing Sam’s interactions with Celebi as they ultimately rescue each other is fairly exciting.

From there we jump to the future, where a lot seems to be happening at once.  We switch to a new villain, as we see the now much older poacher from the opening accosted in his cabin full of surprisingly uncensored beer bottles, by a really bland and generic Team Rocket villain who has a stupid looking mask and a dumb name no matter what language you speak...  Vicious in Japanese, and “The Iron Masked Marauder” in English.  He wants to know where the poacher fought Celebi forty years ago, which means he either knows how long Celebi’s time jump was, or he’s just benefitting from an extremely lucky coincidence.  He also has a special pokeball that turns pokemon evil, which is stupid, because any pokemon you catch is automatically loyal and willing to do your bidding, meaning if you’re evil, the Pokemon will automatically be evil as well.  It also automatically raises a Pokemon’s abilities and stats to their maximum, sure, why not, it sounds like a more reliable cheat-training method than glitch-farming rare candies.

In another story thread, Ash struggles to beat a middle-stage water pokemon with his highly experienced electric Pikachu(see?), but that’s not the movie’s fault, the series is like that too.  They spot Suicune on a boat trip, and tell Professor Oak about it through a video call, which interestingly uses a handful of original animation shots, commissioned by 4Kids, to drop a few clues for what was supposed to be a really subtle plot twist later on in the film.  I’m not going to criticize them for assuming their audience would be too stupid to figure out the twist on their own, for reasons we’ll get to later, but it would have been a lot more efficient to just alter the dub a little...  But then they wouldn’t have been able to edit out the cameos of Tracey and Muk?  Also Ash has in fact seen Suicune before, he should not have had to ask Oak about it. 

Not long after this, Ash and his friends enter the forest and meet Sam, and in my opinion, this is where the film hits its stride.  The interactions between Ash, Sam and Celebi are adorable, fun and full of whimsy, and while you wouldn’t be incorrect to call it filler, the filler is easily the highlight of the movie.  There is some action going on, which is fine, I particularly liked seeing Bayleef in battle after all this time, but to see a sequence of Ash and Sam swimming with Celebi transitioning to a flying scene faster than you can say Pines of Rome is enchanting as hell.  Seeing them bond in a field of freshly evolved Butterfree is heartwarming, and the way the other wild pokemon are used throughout the story, it really goes a long way in selling the idea that Celebi is an important part of this ecosystem, and its inhabitants will do whatever it takes to save and protect her.  There’s a long portion of this movie that I could see some viewers calling boring fluff, but I’d be equally willing to believe there are a lot of people out there who vibe with that fluff, myself included.

On the other hand, you have the Team Rocket side of things, and it’s not all bad...  There’s another scene around the middle of the movie that 4Kids commissioned, and it’s nothing but a couple of minutes of Jessie, James and Meowth being clown shoes.  You could look at this sequence and call it pointless, or a blatant waste of money, and you wouldn’t be wrong, but personally, I think it actually offers a necessary tweak to the pacing, breaking up all of the whimsical fluff just enough to keep it from becoming tedious, but that’s just my take.  Also, I don’t want to give away any too specific spoilers, but there are SOME cool moments that result from Mr. Marauder encountering our heroes, even if everything about him and his plans can only be described as generic, uninspired and stupid.  As far as one-shot Team Rocket villains go, he’s no Domino.  Damn it do I miss Domino.  The movie wraps up, there’s one more commissioned scene right at the end that tries to make the twist more obvious, but come on, it was already spoiled two years prior in the second movie.

So how is the fourth pokemon movie?  Well, despite the fact that I came in with rock bottom expectations, I liked it.  Like a lot.  Not every pokemon movie has to have some huge, apocalyptic threat going on.  Out of the Pokemon movies that I’ve seen, this one is probably the smallest in scale, and the lightest in terms of stakes, but it’s also kind of adorable, and it knows how to tell a story that relies primarily on emotion without resorting to forced conflict or overblown melancholy.  It’s far from perfect, but I can’t really see any problems with it that aren’t generally common to the rest of the franchise.  Sure, Sam pulls out a wind-up steampunk pokeball that’s never explained and conflicts with a lot of what we know about Pokemon lore, but guess what?  The bad guy in the second movie owned a fucking Pokemon trading card.  Explain THAT shit.

I haven’t seen a ton of Pokemon movies, but I think it’s fair to call this my second favorite.  It’s charming, and I was both entertained and engaged enough that I had an easy time turning my brain off through the worst of its stupid bullshit, which let’s be real, every Pokemon project has SOME stupid bullshit. The twist at the end is genuinely really cool, and reframes a lot of what you've seen with the franchise up to that point, even if it's pretty obvious to anybody who's seen the second movie. I can’t guarantee you’ll have the same experience, in fact most of you would probably just find it boring and stupid, but I really like it.  It’s a seventy minute movie that moves pretty quickly, so what do you have to lose?

I give Pokemon 4Ever a 6/10"

When it comes to visual novel adaptations we have a lot of problems. From skipping the important parts of the story to shorten the anime to changing the theme and tone of the series of even changing design and voice actors. Now considering i didn't played 11 eyes visual novel(though you don't need to play that to know you can't create a good adaptation from a 60 hours long visual novel with just 12 episodes.) I don't look at it as an anime adaptation but as an anime. And even as an anime this show is the pinnacle of being trash in many ways. 
But before that keep in mind.

""i believe there is no such thing as ""Objectively"" reviewing or giving an opinion on a show/novel/book/movie/manga/game or whatever. I'm not saying it's about taste. Many may like a show that if they think about it come to the conclusion that the show is shit. I'm talking about the point of view.the way someone looks at a show and thinks about it. So being disagree with me or anyone else isn't wrong. Nor strange. That's all""

""when it comes to music everything that i would say is just taste. I just think about like it or not. The music parts are so casually in my reviews. Because i don't know any particular thing about the music""

""i'm not a native English speaker so if someparts have grammar and spelling problems i just can apologize for that""
So let's start

img500()

When it comes to the story i think 11 eyes had so much potential. Though i think you can guess from the score that it was wasted. The story about a few strange peaple who are continue being sommoned in a strange wotld with a red sky and a few black peaple want to kill them. The story had some good plot twists but the problem was the other plot twists that were shit. And bad execution. The story is too rushed and gives no time for any particular or worthy foreshadow or even a decent character development. Some story events just contradict another story event that makes you question the writers that:""what the fuck man do you know what the hell are you doing?""

Story comes with high potential but ends up giving you many nonesence and proves that bad execution and rushed pacing can easily destroy a show. But now we go to the most shitty aspect of this anime 

img500()

I believe every writer should watch 11 eyes. To fully understand what means shit character development. If the story has bad execution and bad plot twists at least it has one or two good plot twists (compared to the show itself) 
The characters were easily the worst part. Why? 
Let me begin with the main cast. Looking at the beginning we have a big cast (specially if you consider that this show is just 12 episodes). And the rushed pacing and bad execution that i talked about earlier butchered the characters maybe even more than the story. The main characters are mostly undeveloped and 12 episodes is not enough to develop these characters. That's why some scenes and character relationships comes out of nowhere like the writers even didn't know what they are doing. And it even worsens in the last episodes with just throwing many plot twists on the face of the viewer which makes it even impossible to develop characters even for the last episodes because it gives you something that just shitted on a shitty anime more. This is the bad execution that makes the characters undeveloped and even worse. complete one dimensional shits. 
The character development worsens in the villain's part more. The show doesn't give you any information in the first episodes (even doesn't foreshadow) and in the end of the show we have a badly written villain switch that not just makes both of the show's villains shit. But again hurts the main characters. Making them don't act logically or even emotionally. Which means you will have no connection to these characters you just feel you are watching shit. The first villains have no development and the remaining cast of the first villains shows you many contradictory things with many parts of the show and also makes them not just undeveloped. But shitty and without any personality or characterization. Which makes the villains the pinnacle of writing shitty antagonists. They are not even 1 dimensional they are easily 1 dimensional. At best 0 dimensional characters. It had almost the worst antagonists and villains i had ever seen in my entire life and i think it will never change. Because the villains are just bad guys. Which the writers just gave them a shitty justification for being bad making that part of the show not a bad redemption arc nor a bad plot twist for the villains. But something that is the both. The ultimate goal of villains is to be both contradictory shits for the show and also being shitty existences that you even can't feel hate for the villains you feel a general hate for everything that the show offered. I can't really say how much the villains were bad because if I'm gonna say how much the main cast was bad i can easily say :(cliché characters and undeveloped characters who lack both logic and emotions thus giving no value to the story and because the story itself is shit too it doesn't gives value to the characters too.) 
But when it comes to the villains they are even worse than the main cast. At least the main cast has 3 percent value and the other 97 percent is shit. Villains are 200 percent shit. I think i made my point.

img450()

It is a shame that such a good music was used for such a disappointment. Even after almost 5 or 6 years that passed from the first time i watched this shit I still have some of it tracks to listen to(for example the opening. I think i can consider it one of my favourites because i just think it is good. Though i shame to admit that such a music is used for such a shit.).
I think the only valuable thing the show has is the music. Other than that i think everything other than the music is shit. Oh. And although the art isn't fantastic it is at least acceptable.

img500()

Art isn't fantastic or great but it is acceptable. Which at least makes the experience a bit more bearable. Though I don't know why someone might want to watch this show. But whatever. 

img450()

The only thing that i think can be enjoyable or entertaining is the music and atmosphere. Other than that i think there is no such thing as entertainment in this show. You have just shit.

Conclusion:
In the end i think i can just say watch the opening. Listen to some tracks. Then you experienced every good aspect of this anime

>Maximum score with my taste: 3.5 
Maximum score without my taste: 3 
Minimum score: 2.5 

One of the worst shit i have watched."
100093,"Based on the real life experiences of the original manga creator’s time as a bookstore employee, the anime follows the life of the staff while explaining how a bookstore works.

The first thing you notice is that the main character is a skeleton. Just bones and clothes. The second thing you notice is that the skeleton is freaking out because a handsome foreign man is asking for help finding yaoi manga, and the skeleton’s English is very bad.


If we ignore the skeleton and the fact that their coworkers wear things like plague masks and knight’s helmets—we’ll come back to that part—the series is actually a fun, interesting and all-too-relatable look at working in a bookstore.

Lots of parts will be far too familiar to anyone with retail experience, regardless of country or store type: back room conversations, trying to explain supply issues to customers, phone calls, internally freaking out when you feel in over your head, that fantastic feeling when you can get a customer just what they want and it ends well.



Some parts seemed to be specific to Japanese bookstores: specifics of shrinkwrapping books, for example, or their relationships with publisher representatives. But it’s all easily understandable, not in the least because Honda-san takes the time to explain how everything works to the viewer.

Now, back to that obvious tidbit: s k e l e t o n . I thought at first I might be getting into a fantasy slice-of-life: running a bookstore in the demon realm or something. The answer is more mundane, but by the time you realize it you’re already hooked: the skeleton is how the original manga creator anonymized herself. Similarly, all the other coworkers, bosses and industry contacts also get masks to avoid connecting the characters with their real-life counterparts.

Anyone who has worked with the public could argue that retail is, by default, in the demon realm, but you know what I mean.



Still, the visual of a full-on skeleton wearing the store uniform and helping enthusiastic boys’ love devotees will never not be funny.



Verdict

English dub? No

Visuals: A limited animation style is used to great effect. It’s stylized and doesn’t feel lazy, and made me feel like the manga (which I read after watching the entire show) had jumped to the screen. Plus, I loved the bright colors and character designs.

Worth watching? Yes. It’s a short 12 episodes that go even quicker because every episode is broken up into two minisodes. It might be Honda helping various manga fans from other countries–apparently the bookstore is near a popular tourist area–or bemoaning backordered titles, commiserating with coworkers in the break room or explaining how inventory is done. It didn’t get old, and I was genuinely surprised (and disappointed) when I found myself sent back to the title screen after finishing the 12th episode."
101102,"VAGUE SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE AND THE SERIES (specific spoilers tagged)

I was in the mood for some good ole assclass recently but didn’t have a lot of time to read or watch it, so naturally I turned to the recap movie. I would call this a bad choice, but given the fact this stone-cold heart cried multiple times during it, I don’t think I can. Still, there were a few things lacking in the movie that made it less enjoyable than it could have been.

The movie is framed as an epilogue to the series, in which adult Nagisa and Karma visit the old Class 3-E classroom up on the mountain the day before the rest of their class comes to help clean it up for use as a classroom once again. They find the yearbook Koro-sensei made and begin reminiscing about their time in his classroom, and the movie switches between present-day and their flashbacks. While I enjoyed seeing their adult forms, the flashbacks—or rather, the flashes back to the present—were cheesy and cliche, and they weren’t my favorite.

I also wasn’t a huge fan of what the movie chose to use in its recap. Some moments were highlighted that I think didn’t need to be as prominent, while scenes I thought would have been included were left out, such as !the introduction of Irina, Ritsu and Itona, the assassination island arc, the bit with Chairman Asano, and Koro-sensei’s origins (though this is touched on a little, it wasn’t to its full extent).! Because crucial elements of the story were cut, it didn’t flow very well overall. I think part of the reason for this was because the movie focused a lot on Nagisa’s experience in Class 3-E rather than the class as a whole. While I do understand that this is probably because Nagisa is the one experiencing the flashbacks, due to his limited scope and perspective, I feel like this contributed to the flow of the movie feeling disjointed and disconnected, whereas the series does a better job conveying a full picture of the class. They also cut most of the other characters' backstories and development, which may have been necessary to fit the story into 90 minutes, but it still made the movie feel incomplete and flat in that regard.

All this having been said, I still cried during the movie. They included !most, if not all, of Koro-sensei’s death scene! which made me cry like a little kid when I watched it for the first time and again this second time. I think this scene would have been a little more impactful if they had shown a flashback to how the series opens, but even without it, the end of the story is still very heart wrenching. Still, as I mentioned previously, there are some pieces of the plot that would have made the recap more meaningful, especially if you’re watching the movie without knowing anything else about the series. Unlike Attack on Titan Chronicle or the Haikyuu recap movies, it would be very difficult to pick this movie up without having seen the main series and then understand everything about the series and characters.

There’s not much to say about some of the more technical aspects of the movie, like animation and music. They’re pretty much the same as in the show. Lerche did a decent job with the animation, nothing incredibly noteworthy but also nothing awful either. I still like Karma’s appearance more in the manga but maybe that’s just me. I also forgot about the insert song Class 3-E sings during the second to last episode. I think it’s really cool that the characters’ voice actors also sing for the show, not just the openings but the insert songs too. There’s just so many little details like that, and like !the circle ending, where Koro-sensei calls roll! that just made the show really really cool to me.

As for the anime-only epilogue scenes, while they were cheesy, I did enjoy seeing the characters grown. Seeing what they did and where they went—and the details brought up in the series were brought up again in the epilogue—were all very nice elements they certainly could have left out, but I’m glad they didn’t. It really gave a nice ending to the show, with a nice sense of completion and satisfaction. !I do like how Nagisa ended up becoming a teacher, especially of Class 3-E, but part of me would have liked to see him turn into a professional assassin. I suppose there’s more poetic value in him becoming a teacher, but I digress.!

Overall, I finished the movie feeling like it wasn’t quite a waste of time, but that it wasn’t quite a good use of it either. If you’ve got some time to spare and an urge to dip your toe back into Assassination Classroom, then this movie is worth it. But, if you’ve got better things to do (and let’s face it, you probably do), then you’re not missing out on much. This is not a movie I’m chomping at the bit to recommend, but since the original Assassination Classroom material was so good to begin with, then it’s not something I’d try to talk you out of watching either.
…
I think you get the idea.

So, despite numerous flaws, I’m giving it a 72 out of 100. For me, it was enjoyable, and the material is from an above-average story. However, due to the choppy nature of it and the lack of a fuller picture, I can’t give it anything much higher. Did I need to watch it? Absolutely not. Did I still enjoy myself? Yes. And in the end, that’s all I’m looking for in an anime."
16668,"Introduction  
Where do I even begin with this show? I had never heard of this show until I found the opening on YouTube, which is an absolute banger, I highly recommend you listen to it. But after watching both seasons it makes sense why this is never talked about. This has to be one of the craziest anime ever conceived.
Let's start with some background, Valvrave the Liberator is a 2013 space mecha anime animated by Sunrise and written by the writer of Code Geass and Gundam the Witch from Mercury. And has designs by Koshino Hatsura known for drawing the excellent D Gray Man. An original Mecha anime by Sunrise the People behind Gundam, what could be wrong with this show? A lot unfortunately but, that's what I love about it. 
Reasons why this show is an insane must-watch. 
1. Vampire Mechas
1. A Kid nation being declared and having serious war and political implications.
1. An Important character becoming a J pop Idol overnight because the plot demands it
1. A vampire Cult 
1. An AI who wants to fuck the MC
1. And I don't think I can even list the last two things because I may get banned but let's just say this show thought it was being smarter by adding the edgiest shit imaginable. 

     img220(v)



Now I will hint at my thoughts on this show is very similar to Code Geass (I bring this up because it's the same studio and writer).  And that it's such a poorly written incoherently catastrophic failure of a storyline and characters that it's entertaining. But the nice production value and nice mecha fights (even with the CGI it looks good) keep it bearable to watch.  The fact the show looks nice and has good fights is something I can appreciate about most Sunrise shows so I must commend it for that. It's not Sunrise's best but, it's still pretty good.  But that's where my actual positives of the show end. Let's begin with the plot.

Plot
The plot is very similar to Gundam or hell even Galactic Heroes.  Where most of the human population lives in space now. There are Two huge nations Dorissa (Russia/Monarchy) and the Atlantic Rim United States (USA/Democracy) and there is a tiny nation of Jior or Japan. Now why the big nations never invaded Jior/Japan but invaded much bigger nations and just let them be free I have no fucking idea it makes no sense. But our Protagonists reside in a school in Jior that in the first episode gets invaded by Dorissa. But our Main character just by chance stumbles upon the attack and stumbles into Jior's secret weapon that was being built under the school. He lets the robot bite him and now he can fly it. He defends Jior causing the Dorissa army to invade but he captures Leif a Dorissa spy (who's pivotal to the story). And let's just say the girl he has a crush on is the Prime Minster of Jior's Daughter and the adults are captured I guess causing her to declare a new nation run by the kids of Jior. And the rest of the series is just pretty much him and his friends fighting a war between Dorissa and unraveling a secret organization that runs the world. Now I would give away more on why it's bad, but I would be spoiling the fun of the wacky turns this story takes. Half the events make no logical sense and are just so laughable for such a serious story it's trying to tell. There will be entire episodes about the protagonist's school friends fucking around in the city or a girl becoming an idol. And the next a school shooting where everyone dies. It's like code geass where there will be a giant pizza party in one episode and then Lelouch invades the entire world. The tone is all over the place with this show and nonsense is everywhere. It truly has to be seen to be believed. It's just Terrible for the type of story it's telling, and the characters are just as bad.

img220()

Characters:
The characters in this show are TERRIBLE, they are all one note and make the dumbest decisions possible at every moment. If you have seen Kira from Gundam seed, you have seen Haruto just even worse. He's as bland in a personality as you can get and even more idiotic than Patrick from Spongebob. He's so bad and has zero development throughout the entire series. The rest of the side characters are pretty much the same Saki is just an idol girl who wants to be famous and fuck the mc and that's it, Shoko just wants to be a leader and that's it. Red head guy um he's just kuwabara with no heart.  Leif has a little bit to him with his backstory so he's decent but, his friends suck.  The Ai girl just gets excited over everything, and the Antagonist lmfao he's just dio but not good literally he's a vampire and has the same voice actor. He's evil just because of the cult. Also, there is a girl who's just futaba from persona since the writers needed an e-girl for the male viewers to like, I guess. Just watching this you would be hard-pressed to find any of these characters likable or even interesting that's where I will leave it at.

img220()

Conclusion 

This show is a poorly written disaster but, man is it an entertaining watch that I don't regret watching. If you understand what you are getting into and want a dumb show to laugh at and see cool fights/OST then you will probably enjoy it. I thought it was funnier than most comedy anime, but if you are expecting actual quality writing and character-wise. Stay away from this and watch Gundam The Origin if you want a good solid all-around mecha.

It is a daunting task indeed to try to set up a proper lead-in for any kind of writeup about Penguin Highway. Marking Studio Colorido’s first foray into the world beyond the domestic market in Japan. The film is, consequently, immensely important for the anime industry. It’s a little weird to be saying that about a studio who are mostly known in the west not for their bevy of short films, but for [a McDonald’s recruitment commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTrC86mmPaw), but it’s the truth. Yet at the same time, talking about it in those terms undersells the film itself. Said film being the kind of top-notch magical realist youth drama that is just plain good enough to bolster one’s faith in the entire genre, up there with Summer Wars and the seminal Your Name.

So what then is Penguin Highway? Well, as much as it’s about any central thematic point or plotline, it’s a backdrop for a 2-hour downpour of juxtaposed, surreal images that evoke the highs and lows of the summers of youth. Cola bottles that transmogrify into the titular penguins, a silver moon lurking in the forest that strikes all who see it ill, that same cursed wood being demarcated with a “no entry” sign. There’s the all-important Sea Orb (more on that in a bit), chess pieces turning into bats, playing cards floating down a river, Lewis Carroll’s Jabberwock, towering thunderheads and typhoons. Penguin Highway is great at twisting and rolling up scores of these splintered memories and crushing them down into a pure liquid of summer surreality. In this way, it has something faintly in common with Fennesz’ seminal folktronica album Endless Summer.

img880()

This is not to imply that Penguin Highway lacks a plot, though. Our central character is Aoyama, a precocious boy genius. He’s a wise-beyond-his-years type, the kind that almost every nerdy child imagines they are. He keeps notebooks full of experiments and ‘research’, is stoic in the face of adversity, and is happily counting down the days until he becomes an adult.

Joining Aoyama as the secondary lead is a woman who works at the dental clinic he visits, who also happens to be his chess tutor. The woman is identified as simply “Onee-san” in the original, and as “The Dentist Office Lady” in the English subtitles. She is quite the enigma, and proves to be the film’s real central character. She’s also Aoyama’s crush, and the film thankfully does a pretty good job of keeping this on the “cute” side instead of dipping into anything unpleasant.

Also along for the ride are the nervy Uchida, Aoyama’s friend, Hanamoto, a similarly-smart girl and Aoyama’s primary chess rival, and Suzuki, the class bully. 

img880()
(Aoyama (left) and Hanamoto (right). Suzuki is on the far left, just cut off by the scene boundary.)

There are of course, also, penguins. 

img880()

To say that there are penguins in a film called Penguin Highway seems obvious, but these are no ordinary penguins. We learn pretty quickly into the film that Aoyama’s crush Onee-San is actually the one making them. Out of random, everyday objects though most notably, as briefly aforementioned, soda cans. Solving the mystery of how she's able to do this--as even she doesn't know--is what drives the first half of the film's plot, but it's not until the second half that the thematics really kick into high gear.

The film’s central theme is a broad, simple one. The kind of thing that this sort of movie works best with. “All good things must come to an end” is a maxim so ingrained in the human cultural experience that it’s more of a cliche than anything. Yet, it is precisely this idea that Penguin Highway wrings for emotional impact.

img880()

Aoyama, Uchida, and Hamamoto discover something strange in a vast clearing in the middle of the forest. It’s an orb, floating in the air, and made of pure water. Hanamoto dubs it Umi--The Sea--and the trio spend their summer alternately playing near and studying the Sea Orb. 

img880()

The montage of the three playing together is probably the emotionally brightest moment in the entire film, and to bring back that mention of Endless Summer from earlier, this is where it most expertly weaves together fractious summer memories into a refined whole. Almost everyone has experienced something like the trio’s summer near the Sea Orb. I must imagine, involving far fewer spherical anomalies, but the sentiment remains.

img880()

It’s every mystery of childhood rolled into one, and scaled up a thousandfold. The three are having the time of their lives, and Aoyama even imagines that he’ll be awarded a Nobel Prize for their work studying the Sea Orb, fantasizing about “Onee-San” visiting his acceptance ceremony in a white dress.

It, of course, does not last.

Suzuki and his lackeys eventually trail the trio, and discover the Sea Orb too. They menace the kids, but are broken up by Onee-San, whose army of penguins prove to react strangely to the orb. Aoyama, fascinated by the reaction, wants Onee-San to join the three of them in researching it. Hamamoto, flustered by Aoyama’s obvious crush on Onee-San, and unable to reconcile it with her own obvious crush on Aoyama, refuses. The two fight, and the youthful summer comes to a sudden, crashing halt.

Here again is a stab at universality. We’ve all fought with our friends as kids--often over immensely silly things in hindsight--and that feeling of endless days coming to a sudden, blindsiding halt, is all too familiar.

img880()

Things get worse.

During subsequent meetups with Onee-San, it becomes obvious that the same “penguin energy” that keeps her penguins around is also sustaining her. She stops eating, and if she moves too far from the Sea Orb she becomes ill, tying back to an early scene where a penguin that gets too far from town reverts into the soda can it was made from. Worse, the jabberwocks that have been troubling her nightmares start appearing in reality, putting the entire town on edge as scientists from the nearby university (where Momotama’s father works) search for the creatures.

img880()

The Sea Orb starts expanding, threatening to engulf the whole town, and sparking an evacuation. It eventually becomes clear that the only way to stop the thing is to destroy it. Something that will kill the penguins. And Onee-San.

The generality of loss is a hard theme to tackle. No two people grieve the same way. No two losses are exactly equivalent. People enter our lives and leave them in a plurality of ways. The reason that Penguin Highway’s scaling-down of all loss into Aoyama’s loss of his first love, Onee-San, is that no matter who you’ve lost, or how, the sudden-ness is what is universal. One day someone is there, the next they are not. No matter the actual timeframes, there is a distinct before and after, a time when, like the endless summer, it seemed like the relationship--whatever it was--would go on forever, and a time after, when it becomes devastatingly clear that it won’t. Yet, it goes without saying that, well, nothing lasts forever.

img880()

They do destroy the Sea Orb, in what has to be among the most beautifully-animated runs of the decade. The entire final 30 minutes of the film is simply gorgeous, and if anything blunts the heartache of Onee-San’s death, it’s this. Colorido have a reputation as being a premier studio who do innovative, expertly-executed work. If anything needed to further cement that reputation, let it be this. The inside of the Sea Orb, which turns out to be a sort-of black hole, is wonderfully imaginative. It resembles a sort of long-after-the-apocalypse flooded earth, with random bits of manmade scenery floating both in the air and under the water, in the infinite sea.

img880()

img880()

This is more or less the end of Penguin Highway. After they leave the Sea Orb, and the penguins finish hunting down the miniature water globes that constitute its remains, Aoyama and we, the audience, say goodbye to Onee-San. The last time the two spend together is them rushing to the cafe` that they'd meet at for chess lessons, along a literal yellow brick road.

img880()

Aoyama drinks bitter tea as the penguins outside fade one by one. Onee-San leaves, and vanishes. The film’s credits are scored to a song built around the word “goodbye” as a central lyric.

Is Penguin Highway a perfect film? No, but it’s a good argument that more anime films need to make their way west. It’s an expertly-done take on an age-old theme. Making something so broad and so simple seem fresh and newly timeless is no mean feat. At the very least, it will hopefully raise the profiles of all involved, from Studio Colorido itself (who have been building a quietly impressive portfolio for the past decade, despite escaping notice of most American otaku), Director Hiroyasu Ishida, script-writer Makoto Ueda, to the many specific animators involved. 

If Penguin Highway is a sign of what’s to come in the 2020s, either from Colorido specifically or from the medium in general, it’s a portent we should all be happy to heed. A lighthouse on the coast."
154692,"Unapologetic insanity announced its return in autumn of last year and finally aired in the same season in 2023, resuming its unique brand of romantic comedy with the initial charm that made me fall in love with season one. The author, simply known as Hiroyuki, has long come a long way from the utter tripe he wrote from 2012 to 2017 in Aho-Girl; a series you could directly compare with modern Spongebob featuring low-brow humour driven by an overly obnoxious womanchild being babysat by a bitchy male tsundere.

Girlfriend, Girlfriend feels much more nuanced in comparison even with its absurdity cranked up to a eleven. It helps that  it isn't just one massive dumpster fire, it's parodying the stupidity of harem anime in general. That's why characters roar hyper-dramatically, truly meaning and believing what they say, and it's that juxtaposition between the absurd situations characters find themselves in and earnestly tackle that make Girlfriend, Girlfriend absolutely hilarious. 

Naoya is the perfect protagonist for a satire harem anime like this. With his ""Kirito-face and hair,"" he just screams ""generic"" at first glance, and it's that very misrepresentation that lures you into a false sense of security. Naoya's token design misdirects you into believing he'll just be another oblivious harem protagonist, but no, he's completely honest about his feelings, even when he begins falling for Mirika's dedication he doesn't hide from them. That leads me neatly into my next positive talking point. 

The girls all have valid reasons for falling in love with Naoya and Naoya, in return, has justified reasons for reciprocating their feelings. He's a dedicated, hard-worker that goes all in on everything, be it confessing his love to his childhood friend Saki or studying to improve his grades, he never fails giving 110%. Nagisa reached his heart not just because she's a beautiful housewife but because she dedicated countless hours into becoming the ideal housewife for the one she loved. Naoya even admitted such, given how honest he is, that he had to unsubscribe from Mirika's ""MeTube"" channel because he just couldn't fall in love with her and risk upsetting the two girlfriends he already had in Saki and Nagisa.
 
The addition of Saki's best friend, Shino, (as last heavily hinted in the finale of season one) into the  ever-evolving chaos adds to the character dynamics. Paralleling Mirika, she wants to bury her feelings for Naoya by making him give up on Nagisa and focus only on Saki. If he's two-timing, why should she give up and not attempt to pursue him? This is the dilemma she has to battle with throughout season two, desperately struggling to hold onto her resolve as Naoya's honest words and kindness weaknesses it episode by episode. It's incredibly tantalizing and heart wrenching, providing a heart to the series.          

Soundtrack and Sound Design:
The soundtrack of Girlfriend, Girlfriend complements the series' tone effectively. The music is playful and fits well with the comedic elements, enhancing the overall viewing experience. Particularly, during moments of high tension or emotional revelation, the soundtrack elevates the impact of these scenes.

Sound effects are used strategically to punctuate comedic beats, adding an extra layer to the humour. Whether it's a dramatic door slam or a comedic sound effect accompanying a character's exaggerated expression, the attention to sound design contributes to the overall comedic timing and atmosphere of the series.

Art and Animation Quality:
Girlfriend, Girlfriend distinguishes itself not only through its unique plot and characters but also through its visual presentation. The art style is vibrant and eye-catching, with character designs that manage to be both familiar and distinctive. The animation quality, while not groundbreaking, is consistent and well-executed, effectively conveying the energy and absurdity of the situations the characters find themselves in.

One noteworthy element is the use of exaggerated expressions and body language to enhance comedic moments. Whether it's the girls' deadpan reactions to the chaos around them or Naoya's over-the-top emotional responses, the animation contributes significantly to the humour. The creators leverage visual gags and comedic timing effectively, creating a visual experience that complements the series' comedic tone.

Trimming the cast 

I appreciate that Girlfriend, Girlfriend doesn't fall into the pitfalls of other popular romcoms series like Ranma 1/2 of bloating out a cast of under-developed side characters. It doesn't have many side characters, in fact season two introduces only one (followed by a brief cameo from Saki's school friend to add tension) but the one it does bring into fold contributes to the wackiness exquisitely. Mirika's adorable little sister is the side character in question, playing the straight-woman to her sister's wild antics and railing her sister in. Overall, I'm delighted the series chose to narrow the cast down to the main four, giving each girl moments to shine and develop their relationship with Naoya.

Final score: 10/10, naturally."

Bang Dream is one of those anime that, unless you're familiar with its gaccha game, you'll probably have to dig through the bottom of the anilist charts to find and for good reason. This show is at such a massive disconnect with the word ""creativity"", and it feels like it has no idea what that even means. 


img800()
No it isn't.

Watching this show felt as if every aspect of this anime had to be approved by some business man so they can get away with the most risk free, inoffensive product possible at the expense of anything innovative  (that will also promote their mobile game because that’s all anyone ever cares for from this franchise right?).  What they got away with making was an anime that wasn’t going to offend anyone and could technically be for everyone but not for anyone that powerfully. 


Let’s start with the main thrust of this anime:  the characters
All of them are about as lifeless as the CG performances they partake in. Let me break down the bulk of them:
img800()
>Kasumi is the horribly obnoxious genki leader.

img800()
>Rimi is the Dandere.

img800()
>Arisa is the generic tsundere. 

img800()
>And Saya and Tae are so loosely defined personality wise that they may as well just be the same character anyway.

The interactions between every character, main or supporting, are soulless. Not a single moment of this anime can be watched without the feeling that it’s been copying and pasting ideas and tropes that have already become far too copied and pasted enough to enjoy for the 56th time. 

img800()
Ironically one of the only decent shots in the anime.

Even the structure of the series is typical to any show that follows the same formula:
1) Some character wants to perform in a band.
2) More members need to be recruited.
3) A few will have some issue that needs to be sorted out before they can join.
4) Once the group is assembled, there will be some last challenge they have to overcome before the big performance at the end. 

But even if there are other shows like Love Live that essentially follow the same generic nature, at least watching that felt like the people behind it actually tried. 

img800()

The character designs are hard to not be endeared to, the music & animation (when it's not showing any CG dance sequences) are actually good. 

Bang Dream can hardly be said to have any similar appeal or any appeal that would distinguish it apart from the very minimum this sub-genre of anime had to offer. Even the music, which is supposed to be one of the main draws of these shows, is so uninspired; it's like it might as well have just been an afterthought to make sure an episode would properly fill its alloted 22 episode time frame. 

And aside from the obvious CG fumbles during some of those music performances, the animation throughout is just as unappealing. The backgrounds are stale and for whatever stupid reason, it isn't even aesthetically pleasing yet there’s this annoying glare effect that persists on basically everything in this anime, which makes everything look 20 times brighter and so much worse than it would be without it.

img800()
Shiny.


img800()

What’s even more messed up is that no matter how hard you look, somewhere underneath all the fluff, you will only find more of it. Once you read the premise, there is absolutely nothing this show will offer that you can’t already draw out in your mind before you watch it. The entire anime focuses on replicating story beats that have been done to death, with little to add when there's so much that could’ve been done. It would have been possible to just watch the first and last episode and nothing worthwhile would’ve been missed out on unless the staff had actually cared enough to come up with something interesting, but as it is, Bang Dream is an utter embarrassment and ended in a whimper."
177552,"Overview 
Medaka Kuroiwa Is Impervious To My Charms is a high-school romance series that revolves around the main character, Mona Kawai, who is a beautiful, sexy, and cute, charming girl that attracts people. However, as soon as she shifted and stepped in the high-school world, she charmed everybody except one. 

STORY
Mona is a beauty in their school, whereas many people adore her for that. I guess Mona is Kawai. Of course, she had already often heard people compliment her before, so she thought that charming people would be easier as is. As such, she succeeds in charming people except one guy. 

The guy in the question, Medaka Kuroiwa, is a fellow student who also shifted schools to take up a challenge, that is having serious commitment to strengthen himself when it comes to his belief as a monk, one of which is to clear his spirits when Mona Kawai is tempting him. 

Mona finds it strange that every time she tries to charm Medaka, he always looks negatively to her, which gets them to misunderstandings. However, despite this resistance, Mona doesn't stop, and Medaka isn't immune at all, and in fact, he is in denial of his feelings, often thinking positively about Mona. 

After a couple episodes, certain rivals show up to ""charm"" Medaka after he ""charmed"" them, thus repeating its cycle over-and-over until someone wins Medaka's heart.


I find the story very lackluster, it is predictable who Medaka will end up with, but the story keeps on pushing towards the strafe of romance rivalry, which is truly unnecessary, but adds to the essence of fanservice. However, I adore that as the story progresses, we slowly acknowledge the development of each characters. 

img220()

CHARACTERS
The main characters of the story (along with Mona's rivals) are given the focus, which is a good thing considering the distinct characteristics that further contextualize the storyline, but certain characters- including the significant supporting ones- have unrealized potential left wasted. There could've been more opportunities for the other characters provided towards a hint of futuristic romance but fails to do so.

I do see the potential detail when it comes to the other characters, such as Tomo, who could've become Mona's rival (and should be). However, I think that the story pushing more characters towards Medaka or keeping other characters down for the sake of main is solely unnecessary and waste of time. 



Though, character designs surely are creative and engaging. Each characters are detailed into their characteristics and designs. 

VISUALS
I have come to the terms that there is this feeling that the anime adaptation visuals is odd. While I have read the manga before, the atmosphere is different. Don't get me wrong, the anime version is purely enhancing the details from the manga, but there is something wrong with the visuals I comprehend. While this is not a general opinion, but something about this series' visuals put me off. 

OVERALL 
If you had a beautiful or handsome schoolmate, you now know how you feel that they charmed you, and how they feel that they have charmed others. Truly, these kind of people who are given the blessing like Mona's, are purely tempting, which is why many people around them might adore or even have crushes to them. BUT if you're given the blessing like Medaka, consider yourself lucky. 

The series is mediocre, but gives us really good fanservice that further engage its audience. If you have read the manga, you know what I'm talking about. The anime adaptation feels different when compared to the manga, but it still executes it properly which is a good thing. The story will keep on repeating until someone manages to charm Medaka's heart, but there's that, most of us know who's taking the prize. 

Sadly, Medaka Kuroiwa was truly Impervious To My Charms because his anime adaptation didn't charm me that bad is executed. ;P"
97660,"A Bottom Line
Sagrada Reset is not the easiest watch.

If a narrative that relies heavily on conversations between characters about philosophical topics does not interest you, then let this one be.



Why, Not What
Ironically though, the things that will drive some away will hook others. The long debates, the introspection, and the stoicism were all aspects that intrigued me.

The show is certainly confident in its production, opting for no visual flare to make up for what is ostensibly people talking.

Flow
It doesn't hurt then that a production primarily about the power our words have, cast actors that are capable of absorbing you into their speech. That is probably the most unique thing about Sagrada.

The meshing of lines together and the fantastic music that is just intrusive enough, makes scenes surprisingly smooth.



Nothing Lasts
However, that smoothness comes at the cost of emotion on the character's part. Their subtleties not withstanding, seldom do they make it past what would reasonably considered monotone. You eventually can pick out their mannerisms and this does punctuate some of the more dramatic interactions.

But with 24 episodes of this, Sargrada has a lot of lines to take in, especially when nearly all of it demands your attention. To be frank, there were times that I watched with the intention of it putting me to sleep.



Illusive
Still, there was something more that I am having trouble conveying.

When the music, the voices, and the story fuse into a compelling experience unlike what I am used to seeing, despite the relative simplicity, it becomes very hard to put down.

 As the tired cliche goes: It's something akin to a very good book.

Which I suppose is fitting.



Sagrada Reset is a potentially engrossing presentation. It is, however, equally a potential casualty of its proficiency that separates it from the norm.

Give the first episode a shot, and you will be able to tell whether or not this one is worth it."

Story
This anime follows the story of Takumi Iruma who’s accidentally reincarnated into a different world. Given a blessing by a God as well as the ability to choose his skills, Takumi is sent 1 year back into the past of the world to get used to the environment. After honing in on his skills, particularly in alchemy, he ends up growing quite a group around him as well as inventing “new” tools for society while adventuring around the world.



Characters
Takumi Iruma is the main character of the story. He was accidentally chosen to be reborn in a different universe alongside other people. To compensate, the god sends him 1 year back in the universe alongside her blessing and the skill of alchemy. In this universe, he meets people such as the protective elf Sofia Sylphid, a friendly person named Maria, a spider named Maple, a magical girl named Reyva, and a girl with bunny ears named Mani. 



The Good
It’s a decent anime. It follows a formula that hasn’t gotten old (yet) in the isekai genre and executes it quite well. I also really liked the idea that the MC gets sent 1 year behind the other reincarnated people and gets somewhat of a headstart compared to the others. Overall, it’s a somewhat fun anime. There’s not really many specifically good things to mention about the anime.



The Bad
One major flaw in this anime is that it lacks something really unique to stand out from other isekais similar to its story. Throughout each episode, it felt like a regular alchemist/scientist reincarnation anime where the protagonist just creates inventions from their previous world and promotes it as their own in the new world. Now, there’s nothing wrong with that idea, but it really needs something more to stand out from the others, and this anime unfortunately didn’t do that. Another major flaw is that lackluster bum ending. Why did it have to end in a cliffhanger? We obviously know what needed to happen and it just didn’t deliver. Instead, we got a regular episode that could have easily been in the middle of the story instead of the ending. Quite a disappointing ending to say the least.



The Downright Ugly
I don’t think that there was anything downright ugly. It was just pretty vanilla.



Is It Worth The Watch?
To be honest, there’s definitely a couple of other anime similar to this that does its story better and in a more entertaining way by throwing something different in it. Therefore, I don’t think this show was worth the watch.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope this helped you with your decision on whether to watch this anime or not! If you already have watched it, I hope that you can agree with me with some of the points I made. ^^"

""I just mean that they're made by people. You can't gather every word. And words are alive, so their uses and nuances change with the times. When you think of it that way, you would say there's no real correct definition. Even so, those who make dictionaries continue to try.""

This review is a love letter, to a love letter, about a love letter.



I started watching Fune wo Amu on impulse. Long story short, I wanted something brief and uplifting to put my mind at ease. I'd been hearing relatively good things about Fune wo Amu since it first aired in 2016. I'd also seen it likened to both Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru - two of my favorite anime. Therefore, I came in to the show with high expectations.

Fune wo Amu was a joint project, written by Shion Miura and illustrated by Haruko Kumota - which explains the comparison to Kazetsuyo and Rakugo. Miura wrote the former, and Kumota the latter. Each author's respective brilliance unite beautifully in this tale of stubborn passion and unrelenting struggles.

But more on that later.

Fans of Haruko Kumota will immediately pick up on some familiar motifs in Fune wo Amu's plot. Rakugo's exploration of complimenting yet opposing forces, for example, is channeled through Mitsuya Majime and Masashi Nishioka, our two main leads. 



Nishioka is a frivolous fast-talker and go-getter. Originally, he applied to be in his company's PR department, but somehow ended up compiling dictionaries. He doesn't bemoan his placement. At the same time, he won't pretend to be passionate about something he has no interest in. He does his job well for a sense of self-satisfaction and pride, nothing more. While he lacks in overt passion, he more than makes up for it with likability, uniting the rest of the office in a strong bond.

In contrast, you have the socially-inept Majime. He originally starts out in sales, but fails quite spectacularly due to his timid and obtuse nature. Just like Nishioka, Majime is not one to complain about his job. Rather, he's the kind of person to flounder in an ill-suited position his entire career and never once dare to dream of something better. 

The one solace in Majime's life is found on the pages of a book. Not so much the stories themselves, but rather the language piecing them together. Majime loves words. In that sense, he is a walking contradiction: a man who intimately knows words and has their various meanings memorized, yet can never express himself competently.

Only through a chance encounter do the two foils collide. When Nishioka witnesses Majime thinking over the myriad interpretations of 空気 (kūki, or air) he can't forget he strange encounter. Off-handedly, Nishioka describes Majime to his co-worker Kouhei Araki, a veteran of the department searching for a suitable apprentice.  Nearing his retirement, Araki knows he won't be able to see their latest project through to the end. Upon learning about Majime's fondness for words, Araki is determined to recruit him into their ranks, convinced he will be the one to carry the torch in his stead.



The rest of the show tackles 13 years of effort and strife, as the dictionary department take on all kinds of obstacles standing in their way of eventual publication. 

Exciting content, right?

I'm joking, of course. Exciting is honestly the last word I would use to describe Fune wo Amu. That might be a damning statement for some. If that's the case, then feel free to stop reading now. I'm not going to try and sell you on the premise. Really, there's nothing to sell if you already haven't been sold. It's an anime about making a literal dictionary - there's no amount of sugar coating that can sweeten the facts.

For those of you with piqued curiosities, however, hear me out. I mentioned earlier that what led me to Fune wo Amu was a desire for something short and uplifting. Those two adjectives are quite fitting. At a mere eleven episodes, this anime can be devoured in one sitting. Personally, I spread the experience out over two nights. Part of this was because I'm a working adult with worldly obligations. Mainly, however, I didn't want the show to end.

Both narratively and technically, Fune wo Amu is near flawless. It's solid production and thoughtful writing had me hooked immediately. By episode two, I was jotting down quotes and researching it's conception. And come episode seven, I was ready to profess my undying love.



The most apt word I can think of to describe Fune wo Amu is ""adult"". Typically, I don't like throwing around such an inane platitude. Something being ""adult"" means about as much as something being ""deep"". That being said, I will break this rule for the sake of discussing how Fune wo Amu handles mature topics.

When I say mature, I don't mean in the mainstream context. Fune wo Amu isn't an adult story for any gratuitous reason. It simply features adults as they go about their lives and tackle setbacks with careful consideration. If you've ever worked on a professional team, I can guarantee you will find these characters familiar and relatable. Similarly, if you've ever had to deal with bureaucracy in your job, certain scenes will ring painfully true. I've never seen the dichotomy between well-intentioned individuals and the corporate agenda so skillfully portrayed - and in an anime, of all mediums.

Bureaucracy seems like a big word to be throwing around, but truly this anime tackles the issue with surprising nuance. It takes a look at what happens when genuine passion is confronted with people who just aren't interested. And that's a pretty heavy topic to cover, especially when it wears the guise of something inspirational.

It's important to note that there are no real antagonists in Fune wo Amu. If you pressed me to name an opposing force, I might say time or apathy or human error or miscommunication. But they're all abstract threats that come as a natural course of life. 

The obstacles in Fune wo Amu aren't really what matter. What matters is how the characters overcome them, and more importantly, why.



As a side note, I'm typically not a fan of media where authors preach about the importance of words and story-telling. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it comes off as overly-indulgent and self-congratulatory. 

In many ways, Fune wo Amu feels like an answer to these frustrations. It walks a thin line, for sure. But never once was I off-put by this anime's enthusiasm for language. It always came off as earnest, and pure. 

This anime isn't about the power of stories or the brilliance of orators. Instead, Fune wo Amu removes people entirely. Meaning is found in words alien from the author's intent, for words aren't tools. They can’t be controlled by humans, and Fune wo Amu denounces those who try.

Rather words are alive, vibrant and free. As living beings, they are born, evolve over time, and eventually fade from existence. 

That's honestly the closest thing this anime gets to a thesis...words encompass a vast, ever-expanding sea, and the feat of capturing them in a cohesive collection pretty much goes against all logical reason. Why compile a dictionary when eventually, inevitably, it will fall out of use and submit to the ebb and flow of time?

Well, that brings us back to the why. Why do these characters spend 13 years of their lives compiling and editing over and over again? Even if the dictionary does manage to get published, they must continually return to it for the rest of their lives, reviewing and updating it as needed. Why do they suffer through the endless revisions? The endless set backs? Why not just give up?

Because, fickle as they may be, words are necessary for human connection. Hence the title of the dictionary. The Great Passage refers to a ship, built to navigate the expansive sea of language and communication.



The main cast recognizes this truth. They know intimately the power that words possess, as they've experienced it themselves. A clumsy and meandering love letter can lead to a lifelong connection. Two contrasting personalities can learn to appreciate the others strengths through communication. And a carefully curated dictionary can be one thing to bridge human understanding.

Look at me, waxing about the importance of words, like the hypocrite I am. I would say more, but honestly half the joy of this anime comes from listening to the characters yourself.

On the topic of human connection, let's quickly talk about love. Along with ""adult"", I would also describe Fune wo Amu as ""loving"" in all facets. The characters are well-intentioned and passionate. They assume the good in humanity always, and do their job to the best of their abilities. Watching them work tirelessly makes me want to surround myself with people like that in my own life. 

Beyond work, they are loving in their philosophies. They are constantly reflecting on their efforts, and reaffirming their purpose. These people fully believe in the weight of their work. Never once do they succumb to apathy - it doesn't ever occur to them not to care. And ultimately, those are the characters that mean the most to me.

One other thing I was not expecting from Fune wo Amu was fulfilling romance. The two love stories featured only take up only about 30% of screen time. Even still, this anime's handle on romance has to be some of the most competent and fulfilling I've ever seen in josei. I don't want to dwell too much on this aspect, because ultimately it's not the most important part of the show. I just wanted to highlight that fact that Fune wo Amu treats even it's minor storylines with deft care.



In terms of visual presentation, I can't imagine many sakuga enthusiasts will love this series. Not to say that it doesn't look great - it does. The character animation and backgrounds are especially pleasant. That being said, the aim of Fune wo Amu is not to be flashy. The entire show is incredibly grounded, animated almost as if it were a live action drama (actually, very little would be lost or changed if it had been live action).

The only reprieve from this realism comes during brief moments of visual metaphor, where two recurring motifs are featured: a literal ocean to represent the vastness of language and a far-away, ever-turning Ferris wheel to represent the circle of life.

The music is also phenomenal. Composed by Yoshihiro Ike, it acts as a perfect compliment to the show's feel: uplifting and hopeful.

And then there is the setting. If the characters of Fune wo Amu feel reminiscent of Haruko Kumota's other works, then it's the settings that undoubtedly belong to Shion Miura. Miura is especially talented when it comes to creating memorable locations. The dorm from Kazetsuyo is a good example of this. Chikusei-sou felt real and lived in, like a character in and of itself. By the end of the series, you develop a real attachment to the rundown building, for you've spent so much time there alongside the characters. Moreover, in the beginning of the story, Chikusei-sou is the only force unifying our cast, acting as the literal glue keeping them together.

Like the dorm in Kazetsuyo, both Majime's building and the dictionary department offices serve to enrich the narrative. The former offers clear insight into who Majime is as a character. When we are first introduced to his living situation, we learn he is unmarried, messy, and surrounds himself with a wall of books.



The astute viewer will also notice that this clutter follows him everywhere, even to the office.



In terms of that office...well, I'll just let the characters explain its significance...

""It's an old building, isn't it?""

""Yes....er, I mean no.""

""It may look like the dictionary editorial department was relegated to the corner, but this was the main building around the time I first started here. The company has put in effort to making dictionaries, so we weren't relegated - we remained.""

The dictionary department offices are a physical embodiment of the effort and passion of the people who work there. They've managed to prove their worth time and time again, stubbornly refusing to be defunded or dissolved. The building is old because making dictionaries is old; it's a practice that's been preserved against all odds. Passionate people will keep it alive, like that ever-turning Ferris wheel, working hard to pass on the baton.

One final thing I feel compelled to praise is the voice acting. To begin, the characters are phenomenally well-cast, especially our two leads. Takahiro Sakurai is flawless as the well-meaning yet awkward Majime. He can so perfectly balance the moments of whimsy and kindness with charming humor and quirky mannerisms.

Playing off his performance is another legend, Hiroshi Kamiya. I've always thought his voice was well-suited for a fast-talking businessman, and Nishioka's flippant personality allows him to have fun with the delivery. You can always expect quality performances from these two actors, but combined this show's realism, their voices are given new life.

“Perhaps dedicating your life to something frees you from the world somehow.”

I don't know exactly when I stopped being fun - perhaps sometime in college? Who can say.

The point is, I'm gradually losing interest in stories that are not grounded. Obviously, there's a time and place for shenanigans. And occasionally I'll turn off my brain for bit of fun. But more often than not, I want something feels real and relevant to my now.

But that seems rather ill-fitting for a medium like anime, no? A medium that's known for it's over-the-top story-telling and irreverence. 

The truth is, as an adult anime fan, I've become very picky. I only have so much free time, so I want to invest wisely. That's why I'm thankful for Fune wo Amu. Not only was this anime wonderful, it gave me much needed motivation. While watching, I was simultaneously overwhelmed by work - so much so that this review was delayed by a week. But ultimately, it was for the best. Because watching these people work so damn hard and never once waver in determination made me re-evaluate my own intentions. 

For someone younger, this might not be a good enough reason to watch Fune wo Amu. 

If you've ever felt yourself lose purpose in your professional life, however, I highly recommend this anime. The only critique I have is that it's far too short. I would have happily watched 50 more episodes detailing those 13 years of effort. But I suppose that's a telling flaw: when a show is so good that you never want it to end. 

In summary, Fune wo Amu won't be for all, but it was definitely for me."
5781,"Tenchi Muyo is one of the most iconic and beloved harem anime out there. It is a series that has spawned various tv series, OVAs, spinoffs and a tone of mechanics. All stemming from the original OVAs from 1992 titled Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki. With that said I was not introduced to the Tenchi Muyo universe with Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki, but rather a spinoff show that is regarded as one of the better Isekai around Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar.

As a person who’s grown tired of the oversaturation of modern Isekais barring a couple of expectations, I decided to check out all pre-Sword Art Online’s Isekai's out there and Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar ended up being one of my favourite Isekai’s.

You don’t necessarily have to be a Tenchi fan to enjoy this show as it can stand on its two feet as an engaging Isekai harem mecha story.

As soon as I loaded the first blu-ray disc and pressed the play, I was hooked on the story. Instead of the MC getting killed off or when the MC gets transported the moment the MC touches an object, our main character Kenechi was kidnapped and brought into the world of Geminar against his will. He was assigned to assassinate the newly crowned princess Lashara if he wants to return back to his own world, however, due to Kenchi having a good heart she recruits him as a personal servant.

There are two halves of the Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar. The mecha side and the slice of life school side. Out of the two, the mecha side is much stronger writing-wise, although the slice of life school side of Tenchi War on Geminar is just as good. One of Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar biggest strengths is how well structured the story was.

The biggest issue I have with modern Isekai’s outside of their wish-fulfilment nature is that they struggle to form a competent storyline post the main character’s transportation to another world. Sure some modern Isekai doesn’t suffer from those issues, but the majority of them choose to meander around tropes and cliches to a point where these Isekai barely have a skeleton base of a story by the end. Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar doesn’t make that mistake, as every episode has a point.

The first half of Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar serves as the lighthearted slice of life hijinks where it spends its time developing its setting and characters while having a lot of fun. The show ensures that you like or appreciate the characters during the lighthearted half of the show.

The second half aka the mecha side of the show is engaging and interesting to watch. Without going into spoilers, the show really dives into the drama and lore of the setting and characters, with the majority of that being dedicated to the war of Geminar.

Is the writing perfect? Does it have flaws? Yes, but I feel like Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar has merit and charm to a point where I can overlook most if not all its flaws. Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar is honest with itself.

Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar’s biggest strengths are its characters and I ended up liking almost if not all of them.

Sure some characters were better than others, but I feel like the characters had a sense of importance to the story.

Kenshi is a unique harem protagonist. Unique its harem peers, Kenshi views female characters as acquaintances (later on friends) instead of his plays things to grope on. Hell in the first couple of episodes, he often runs away from the majority of the girls as he doesn’t want to get involved with their lovely dobby antics as he just simply wants to live and adapt to his new life at the academy.

Besides that, Kenshi is a compelling and well thought out character from beginning to end. I liked his character growth in the show, where goes from someone who just wants to go home, to someone who values his friends to a point he will risk his life to protect them. He’s also a badass that has strong talent in almost every field from swordsmanship, martial arts to cooking.

The female characters are fun, compelling and charming.

As much as I want to cover all the girls, I will only be talking about four as they were the most noteworthy girls, top of them being my favourites Aura, Wahanly, Chiaia and Lashara.

I start with Wahanly aka Lashara’s best friend. She was a joy to watch as I liked her various mad scientist antics that she pulls out on top of her geeky personality.

Aura is, without doubt, the most intriguing character in the show, being a dark elf, she’s the character that embodies the rich naturist culture of the setting on top of being the strongest female character in the show due to her skills being similar to on par with Kenshi.

Chiaia was the character that surprised me the most in the show. I’m usually against aggressive Tsundere characters in anime as 9/10 these characters tend to abuse the male leads for their self-amusement, however, Chiaia ended up being one of the few Tsundere’s that I liked on top of being the character that grew on me the most. I liked her tough brother and sister dynamic with Kenshi as she makes sure he doesn’t go out of line to embarrass himself as well as Princess Lashara, the person that gave him a chance.

Despite being harsh at times she deeply cares for Kenshi to a point where she would risk her life to project Kenshi
Beyond her dynamic with Kenshi, I found her to be compelling. Despite being the bodyguard of Lashara, I like how she questions her values and worth without feeling preachy.

Lastly, we have my favourite character in the show Princess Lashara. She’s the character that ended up impressing me the most. Despite being a wealthy 12-year-old leader, she’s mature and coolheaded who has strong leadership. She does her spoiled and selfish moments where she will do anything to get money and laugh it out to support her wealthfare at a young age. She’s the character that is bursting with fun and her dynamic with Kenshi was equally as compelling as the other girls.

The rest of the characters are solid. Some were more memorable than others, but I feel the supporting cast served their purpose well for the story.

Gorgeous is the best word to describe Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar visuals. Despite the OVA coming out in 2009, it is still as visually pleasing to the eye. It’s colourful, nicely detailed and filled with life. The character designs are distinctive from each other, character interaction especially the slice of life were expressive. The animation is smooth and fluent throughout. I didn’t notice any times where the production values drop in quality.

The mecha designs are unique and appealing to the eye.

Oh, how can forget the lovely tasty fan service that Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar has to offer. Ecchi fans will have a good time watching the show.

Overall a top-notch production from ALC.

The soundtrack was composed by Akifumi Tada who also did the soundtrack for Skip Beat, and it’s great. Most of all tracks fit the setting/tone of the show and I liked the variety of upbeat, adventure and classical fantasy tracks used in the anime.
The opening theme “Follow Me” by Seira Kagami ft. Sound Around is a catchy high spirited song that captures the light-hearted adventurous tone of the show.
The ending theme “Destino” by Alchemy+ is a slow catchy theme that nicely closes an episode of the show.
Voice acting is top-notch in both languages, but I prefer the English dub from Funimation. It’s one of the more underrated dub offerings from Funimation as each dub actor blew it right out of the part.
Best performances go to Lydia Mackay as Aura, Cherami Leigh as Wahanly, Jad Saxton as Lashara and Morgan Garrett as Chiaia.

Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar was a blast. It’s a breath of fresh air compared to the majority of its modern Isekai peers. I loved almost everything about Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar. Easily one of my favourite non-seasonal show’s that I watched in 2021.
If you’re looking for a unique Isekai harem show then Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar is the anime for you.
Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar thanks for existing and I hope it will get a season 2 in near future."
120859,"Burning Kabaddi does the thing it was made to be, a sports anime. It really did that well since you could never and I mean never guess who would win. The author seemed like he didn't even care about the main character and there was no plot armor whatsoever but of course it has many flaws.
Spoiler free as much as possible


The plot is very normal, nothing unique other than the sport which I had never heard of before. The main character Yoigoishi quits soccer for reasons that are explained in the anime and is then forced to join the Kabaddi school team. Then, like any other sports anime, we get introduced to the different characters and of course the badass captain. Most of the anime was practice because most of the team was fairly new to the sport and we only got 2 matches with other schools, which were really exciting by the way. The way the author didn't care how what happened to the main character really created suspense since you would never know who would win and who won't.
img(v)


Throughout the anime the one thing that really annoyed me was the animation. It was very bad the shading and frames were so low but the studio was capable of utilizing the budget they had at hand to make it watchable. They used some CGI to show how the game worked and it didn't really annoy me too much but if this gets a second season it has to get some better animation because it was just what they did to it.
img(


The music was pretty good and the OST's set the mood for the suspense and hype moments pretty well. The OP was also really nice and they didn't have an ED since they would just tell you what would happen next episode.
img()


The main character had some depth like Yoigoishi and some character development but most of them had joined earlier so they tell you their backstories from before. Some of them even had gotten character development from before Yoigoishi joined and they would tell you there stories. Also the captain was pretty cool. The other team mates that join later on don't have much time for character development and we don't learn too much about them. We do learn a little bit about the people they go against and most of them had ties with the captain and were always trying to surpass him. Also their interactions were really funny.
img(v)


I personally really enjoyed the anime since it had so many hype moments and was really unpredictable so if it had more episodes and a better budget it would've probably been a 9/10.

An overall great sports anime that I would recommend to anyone that doesn't mind animation since I'm not into sports anime and really enjoyed this one."
468,"Lately I've not really been motivated to write reviews for some odd reason, but since this movie is my 100th finished anime, I thought I may as well make the effort of writing one, since I feel an urge to make people aware about this rather divisive and overlooked gem in the GiTS Rabbit Hole. So with that being said, here's my part-analytical, part-critical review of Innocence.

Plot, Structure, Pacing - The Plot is rather barebone and, its structured like a neo-noir detective drama in the first half and then turns into a surrealistic, trippy action packed blockbuster in the second. Not a whole lot to say, besides the fact that Innocence is a movie which moves at its own leisure and takes its sweet time to pick up and also sets up its mood as with any Oshii Film. Another aspect which I find rather difficult to put into words is that, this movie doesn't really feel like a GITS property and feels like a blend of Hollywood thrillers and Experimental anime with complex themes. It's this rarely seen mashup, which to me makes this film even more interesting and special.

Characters- When it comes to Sci-fi as a whole, characters aren't the most important aspect in its narrative, at least in comparison to worldbuilding or themes. But Innocence was the movie which made me connect to its leads on a much more deeper level. To put it simply, this anime does a great job of characterizing Batou and Togusa (as per Sci-fi standards at the minimum) and my appreciation for Batou increased after watching this movie. The antagonist while not interesting as the previous ones, served his job, and the same can apply to the other minor characters.

Themes- Innocence as a whole gets a lot of criticism for being so vastly different from its predecessor and TV Counterpart and I can understand the criticism-this anime is full of quotations and an endearing amount of exposition and symbolism which I won't pretend to fully understand. The movie keeps on throwing dense exposition onto the audience without a moment of pause for them to comprehend it. This can certainly be an issue for a lot of people who are not used to experimental media and went into this movie expecting it to be like a standard GiTS installment, which is really intelligent but also packed with action and is a lot more subtle at tackling its themes. The reason behind this anime being the way it is because, this movie is Oshii's ideas being put to life. This anime is more of Oshii's Brainchild and he tries to tackle complex themes in a very explicit and direct way through the use of the GiTS universe. Now whether this whole ordeal will work out for you or not depends on you, but in my humble opinion, Innocence from a purely thematic standpoint is better than the 1995 movie. The movies explores a lot of complex ideas via its dialogue, which forces the viewers to think even more deeply because of their abstract nature. To get it straight this film not only expands upon the OG film's themes, but it also asks questions such as

1.Are all sentient beings equal?
2.When does the line between inanimate objects and humans start to blur? Can Having a soul in a manufactured body make any creature a human?
3.Why does Humankind pursue A.I and why do we even make objects resembling us?
4.Is there any Significance to Human life? Can we be reduced to mere mechanical terms or are we complex beings?
The central idea behind both of the movies has been to explain the nature of sentient living beings as a whole and trying to answer the questions surrounding their existence. Questions like if unnatural lifeforms deserve to have their own will or if they can even said to be lifeforms, are some questions being put at the forefront and this movie in particular expands a lot on it
Another noteworthy point I'd like to make is that Innocence is also centered around the concept of dealing with grief and loss, thus its thematic exploration feels even more intimate and personal. The quality of dialogue is out of the roof when complex ideas and theories are being discussed (Like the whole discussion with Haraway) but it drops a bit when the anime exploits the concept of making direct and explicit references to other literary/religious/scientific works. That said this anime does put a lot of faith in the viewer and expects them to come to their own conclusions. Personally I like this way of conveying themes and I really appreciate what the film did. And I can see myself re-watching the film over n over again, because it has a high re-watch value.

Soundtrack, Art and Tone- OST is minimalistic but dang is it GOOD. The Ballade of Puppets suits this anime so much, the overall atmosphere is very moody and trippy depending on the act- and its just something I rarely see, add to that Oshii's masterful use of scenic shots. The mood kicks in. The Art is great. Sure the CGI looks a bit old, but I'd be lying to myself by saying that it doesn't look beautiful and pleasing. Even if PS3 level CGI has aged, it doesn't it looks bad. Easily Audiovisuals was the thing which carried this one for me. Not to say how fluid the animation was.

Action- Awesome, feels believable and Come on its Batou.

FINAL VERDICT
watch it if you have an affinity for stuff like serial experiments lain and if you can tolerate loads of exposition.
That being said, this show is easily 8.00+ on MAL IMO, yet it rests on 7.81 which is a shame really. So yeah it is underrated and overlooked, and if you can watch this gem.
MY FINAL SCORE is
87/100"
874,"You probably recognize Digimon as one of the biggest media franchises in Japan.  If you’ve spent a decent amount of time watching the anime that airs on American TV, and especially if you did so while growing up in the early 2000s, there’s a good chance you have fond memories of watching the Digi-Destined go on adventures with their digital pals, saving both the real world and the digital worlds from cosmic enemies that threatened all life on both planes of existence.  You probably played the video games, collected the cards, maybe even competed against other fans for cash and glory...  But what if one day, you found out that the franchise you’ve been obsessed with has been real all along?  And to make matters even more insane, what if the digital world started leaking into ours?  This is the situation that several ten year old children in a quiet, unassuming suburb have been dealing with.  For an average fanboy named Takato, an ultra-responsible pacifist named Henry, and a ruthless champion named Rika, the fantasy world becomes all too real when they wind up pulling their own digimon partners into the real world.  You might say this sounds like a dream come true, but as the rift between worlds becomes more and more unstable, the lives of our heroes and the people around them are about to be turned upside down forever.

When I was in my early teens, there was a huge culture war being fought between Pokemon and Digimon.  Much like the days of Star Wars versus Star Trek, you were either on one side or the other, and if you liked both, then you probably kept that detail on the downlow.  Personally, Pokemon was a hardcore obsession for me, which probably shouldn’t be surprising seeing how I’m on the spectrum and I have a dangerously addictive personality.  Pokemon was my life, like few other obsessions ever have been, but I did watch Digimon too.  I saw most of the first season, and I liked it just fine.  I saw some of the second season, and...  Well, I certainly saw some of it.  I don’t know, I guess because I got into Pokemon first, Digimon didn’t really gel with me, because the story wasn’t about collecting Digimon?  I dunno, I tend to love the first entity that sparks an obsession more than any other related entities that follow it.  There’s also the fact that, while Digimon may have had superior animation, I liked the designs in Pokemon a lot more, as the human cast of Digimon looked too cartoony for me, and my first impression of Digimon themselves was that they looked like rejected Pokemon designs.  Same with Monster Rancher, tbh.

I didn’t watch Tamers when it aired, rather, I wound up checking it out in the mid-2010s after a critic I followed gave it a stellar recommendation, and there wound up being a lot of things about it that absolutely floored me.  The animation was more or less the same as I remembered...  Digimon never felt like a particularly high budget franchise, but it never felt cheap either, and while they did sometimes take a page out of Pokemon’s book by using static images of characters firing off special effect long distance attacks to save money, the action scenes have always been way more dynamic than Pokemon’s, because Digimon in the anime fight each other using more than just their specialized attacks.  They can punch, kick and slash without having to call out some name from their moveset.  The battles were thus far more interesting, and yeah, you do kind of have to have a decent budget for that.  Thankfully, Digimon has always been produced by Toei, who have been around since the sixties, and are no stranger to managing their budgets just enough to pull off well choreographed and intense fight scenes without having to compromise too much to compensate for them. 

With Tamers, this is kicked up a notch in a few ways.  First off, while the design aesthetic is largely the same, the characters do look slightly more realistic in terms of anatomy and wardrobe.  Characters not only dress more like normal people than in previous seasons, they have more normal looking hairstyles as well,, with a pleasant enough color palette so as to not appear too generic.  Sure, the fact that everyone still wears the same clothes day in and day out is a little immersion-breaking, but for an anime series based on a children’s toy and trading card franchise, Tamers swings closer to Beck than Yugioh on the “people who could feasibly cross your path on a normal day” scale.  The real world also feels more believable...  The first two seasons could get away with having more generic settings because they spent most of their runtime in the Digital world anyway, but in Tamers, you only get brief glimpses of the Digital world up until the halfway point of the series, so the human setting has to have a sense of weight and history to it...  And it does.  From the forests to the suburbs to the big city, it doesn’t take long for the viewer to develop a sense of familiarity to any area the characters interact in. 

The digital world also has a ton of personality all its own, but that’s getting into spoilers.  I also personally like the designs of the Digimon more, but maybe that’s because you’re not presented with like a dozen of them all at once?  Unlike previous seasons, Tamers takes its time presenting the first few main Digimon to you, developing them and their Tamers individually to establish their role in the story and why they’re worth getting invested in...  In my opinion, this is a far stronger approach than presenting the entire cast with one Digimon each right off the bat, leaving your first impressions of them heavily unbalanced.  The designs of both the Tamers and their Digimon aren’t just gimmicks or toy blueprints, they tie into the personalities and identities of the characters themselves.  For one relatively spoiler-free example, Takato is obsessed with Digimon, so it makes sense that the Digimon he designs and brings to life is kind of a rip-off of Agumon...  And the fact that he wears goggles on his head is deliberately explained away as him mimicking Tai and Davis.

As far as the English dub is concerned, the acting is just as strong as it’s ever been, with the cast list reading like a who’s who of industry titans from the turn of the century, some of whom...  Like Bob Papenbrook and Philece Sampler...  Have sadly passed away.  Actors who play the main few Digimon also went the extra mile of voicing all of their digivolutions as well, and while that might not sound like much, the great Steve Blum plays at least half a dozen characters here, and he is unrecognizable as every single form of Guilmon.  Melissa Fahn...  You know, fucking Ed from Cowboy Bebop?  Gives the prickly Rika a slightly gravelley cadence which she’s able to play around with as she portrays her as a fierce tsundere in the early episodes, as well as a compassionate friend in the later episodes.  Brian Beacock had his first anime role as Takato, and despite being in his thirties, he pulled off a crackly-voiced adolescent very convincingly.  Bridget Hoffman probably had the toughest job of all in the role of Jeri, given all of her character’s eccentricities, and the gauntlet of emotional trauma she had to run through.

I don’t think it’s controversial to say that anime airing on American TV back in the day had a long, long history of censorship and rewrites, to a point that I don’t think any title was really safe from.  Don’t get me wrong, Digimon wasn’t owned by 4Kids or anything, but neither was Cardcaptors, and look what happened to THAT property.  Digimon Tamers was owned by Fox, and they made the kind of cuts you could expect at the time...  Blood, obscure cultural references, stuff like that...  But the only changes they made that actually hurt the series were some of the dialogue rewrites, which I’m pretty sure were done to simplify some pretty esoteric topics for the sake of younger audiences, but wound up either obscuring some important details about a character’s development, or outright turning a moment of forgiveness into a condemnation of a well meaning character who had made mistakes, but earned their redemption.  I can’t get into more details because these moments occurred towards the end of the series, but suffice to say that other than those few solitary issues, it’s a pretty damn good dub.

So to say Digimon Tamers has a reputation would be putting it mildly.  It’s one of the most unique entries in the Digimon franchise, as well as one of the most polarizing, for a variety of reasons, and to understand why, we need to take a step back to the creative mind behind the series, Chiaki Konaka.  You may not know him by name, but once you see some of his more famous works lined up in front of you, it’s not hard to pinpoint what he’s all about.  Konaka is an auteur who likes to use dark tones and trippy visuals to explore psychological themes often relating to identity and reality, which isn’t surprising once you hear that he’s also a massive fan of Evangeleon.  Personally, I’m not a huge fan.  I’ve seen a lot of titles from him that are popular, but that really didn’t grab me.  My impression of him has always been that he treats his own themes and ideas with a higher level of priority than the characters and stories he’s supposed to be using to communicate them to us, which at least for me, makes it difficult to engage with his narratives enough to care what he’s trying to say. 

Out of the anime he was heavily involved in, I thought Ghost Hound was kind of boring.  I’ve already given you my full thoughts on Serial Experiments Lain and the original Hellsing TV series.  I only recently found out that while he was involved with The Big O, the bulk of his involvement happened in the entire second half...  Which seems obvious in retrospect...  And good God almighty, I am only now learning that he was involved in Shadow Star Narutaru, including writing the script for the objectively putrid final two episodes.  Oh, and he also very recently revealed himself to be a right wing conspiracy theorist nutjob, but that’s irrelevant to the discussion, so we’ll put that aside for later.  For now, I have another pressing question to answer;  If I dislike Chiaki Konaka so much, and I find his work to be boring, pretentious and sometimes downright incompetent, why is none of that true for Digimon Tamers?  What is it about the third season of a childrens’ anime that was designed to sell toys that has me doing a complete 180 on him?

That’s a difficult question to answer, but I think the saving grace of Tamers is that it offered Konaka the perfect amount of freedom, as well as the perfect amount of restraint.  When the subject of a third season of Digimon came up, nobody attached to the franchise really knew how to move forward, as the ending of season 2 had been nothing short of conclusive.  Konaka already had some buzz behind him at this point, and while he hadn’t been one of the main minds behind the series prior to this, he had done some work for it off and on in the second season, and he’d written a couple of fan favorite episodes, so when he volunteered, Toei was happy to hand him the reins.  Konata had ideas for the franchise, and to his credit, they were the kind of ideas you’d have for a franchise you genuinely love and feel inspired by...  He wanted to explore the more dangerous and primal side of Digimon, paying attention to the conflict between their roles as friendly playmates and wild animals.  He wanted to make Digivolution special again, as he felt it had become too commonplace in the second season, to the point that nothing really felt like a threat.  Speaking of threats, he wanted to get rid of the element of reincarnation and make death permanent, to raise the stakes and the emotional gravity of each battle to new heights.  Toei let him get away with all of this, and a lot more.

There were obviously rules he had to follow, as this WAS a children’s action series, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  I’ve always held to the belief that creativity shines the brightest in the shadow of adversity, because when you have rules and restrictions to follow, you pretty much have to find creative ways around them, and that philosophy perfectly describes one of the most important elements of Tamers;  While the censors were bafflingly kind to Tamers, letting Konaka get away with some mature themes and downright terrifying imagery, they also had a few very odd mandates thrown in...  They told Konaka they wanted him to find a way to include the video games and trading cards in the story, and I shouldn’t have to explain why that’s a ridiculous request, should I?  That’s an unreasonable demand by any definition, but Konaka took that request and ran with it, conceiving Tamers as a meta-season where the entire franchise up until that point was completely fictional...  Even by fictional standards.  This upset a lot of people, and I can see why...  Being told that the characters you’ve fallen in love with were never real even outside of the real world is a lot to take in. 

Personally, I love stories like this, and I don’t think they get told nearly often enough.  There’s a movie where Freddy Krueger comes to life and starts killing off his own director and actors...  There’s a sequel to the Blair Witch Project that nobody on Earth likes other than me...  There’s that one Ebiten OVA...  I think that’s it.  It’s pretty common these days for fictional characters to break the fourth wall, but to THIS degree?  It’s honestly pretty rare.  There’s a lot of places you can go with an idea like this, and while Tamers was too busy telling its own story to really explore the relationship between its own franchise and its fanbase, it also doesn’t NOT do that.  The Digimon franchise isn’t just some cool thing all the human characters love, it’s something they all have their own unique relationship with that ties in with their personalities and backstories.  Takato is the full-steam otaku who collects all the merch and dedicates his life to his fantasies.  Henry’s time with the video game informs both his pacifism and why his beliefs went that way.  Rika’s domination of the card game tournament scene gives her a level of control over her life while her Mother tries to force her into a modeling and beauty pageant career.  For Jeri, Digimon is that weird thing she has to dive into if she wants to make friends with the other kids.  I’m telling you, if you grew up with any multimedia children’s franchise, at least one of these should be relatable to you.

We can take this even further, because each character who receives their own Digimon...  With two small exceptions that I won’t name for spoiler reasons...  Each tamer has a unique dynamic with their partner that’s unlike any of the others, and this is partially because the characters themselves are all well written and distinct, especially compared to previous seasons.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the cast of either of the previous seasons were shallow or even boring...  They were all fleshed out and developed, and it wasn’t hard to get to know them, but it was still pretty easy to divide them into archetypes, with most of their distinguishing qualities being attributable to said archetypes.  The cast of Tamers is far more complex right off the bat, with the exception of a couple of forgettable side characters and one Mary Sue from the video games who makes some cameo appearances towards the end. 

I know I’ve been talking about this show in a lot of vague ways, and that’s largely because it’s a heavily spoiler-filled show.  Huge reveals and twists happen early and they happen often, and I can’t even talk about half of the characters who receive Digimon partners without spoiling way too much.  All I can say is that, while I haven’t seen everything from the Digimon franchise, Tamers is by far the deepest, smartest and most mature title I have seen...  But that brings up an interesting question regarding its audience.  It’s easy for me, as a 37 year old critic, to give this show the green light, but it is ultimately a kids show...  And would it be popular with kids?  Is it even safe for kids?  I’m gonna be honest, I don’t know.  I’m not a parent, I don’t exactly have kids to show it too.  It’s entirely possible that the themes are too mature for kids to appreciate, and maybe it could be considered too scary and potentially traumatizing for them.  For a lot of kids it probably is.  Maybe most kids are better off sticking with the first two seasons, and pretend the franchise never made that fateful vault over the fourth wall.  But what about when I was a kid?

I’ve already mentioned how I didn’t watch Tamers during its initial airing on American TV, but I wasn't a child then, I was in my late teens.  If I were a child, and someone showed Tamers to me...  I think I would have absolutely loved it.  Don’t get me wrong, I was not the bravest child when it came to scary media, but I have a pretty good memory for the kind of things that used to bother me, and I can’t think of any lines that Tamers crossed.  I think I would have appreciated the more adult themes and darker, dramatic tones just fine, and here’s why;  When I was really little, there were two Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons.  In the self entitled “Sonic the Hedgehog,” or “Sonic Sat Am,”  the story took place in a dystopian future where an evil, menacing Robotnik was using technology to turn animals into robots.  In the other series, Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic just ran out, trolling Robotnik, and guzzling down chili dogs.  I’m not going to pretend I didn’t watch a ton of stupid shit back then, but I still knew the difference between good Sonic and bad Sonic.  I’ve rewatched several nostalgic shows from my childhood that left me cringing like I’d just been hit by lightning, but shows like Sonic?  Batman the Animated Series?  Samurai Jack?  Pirates of Dark Water?  They’ve all stuck with me into adulthood, and I believe Tamers would have joined them.

Hell, you could even make the argument that Tamers was legitimately ahead of its time when it came to presenting a sophisticated narrative.  Chiaki Konaka got rid of the Town of Beginnings and made death permanent for various reasons, one of the most important being that he thought kids shouldn’t be sheltered from the concept of death.  I’ve been rewatching Gravity Falls lately, and there’s an episode where the mayor of town, an elderly man who had previously joked about being excited to meet the grim reaper, dies offscreen, and the plot of the episode revolves around electing a new mayor, but here’s the thing...  When I was a child, no kids show could have gotten away with that.  Christ, even in my teen years, death was off-limits in any show kids were able to watch.  Remember How the Teen Titans villain Deathstroke had his name changed to Slade?  If that show came out today, I’m convinced they could have just called him Deathstroke.  Media is evolving at a rapid pace, especially children’s media, and as modern cartoons begin to trust the intelligence of their audience more than ever before, it’s becoming increasingly clear just how ahead of its time Tamers was.  It’s not a perfect show...  It has some plot holes here and there, and of course it has its share of silliness, but for a TV series that was meant to sell toys?  I don’t think it gets much better than this.

Digimon Tamers was released on DVD a few years ago, but has since gone out of print, although you can stream the series on Hulu.  A few sequels have been released, including a 50 minute movie that’s not very good, and a 30 minute bonus episode that’s pretty fun if you turn your brain off.  Chiaki Konaka also made waves when he recently released a new audio drama called Tamers 2020, where our heroes reunite to battle cancel culture, censorship, political correctness, and perhaps the most evil force in all of humanity, fact checkers.  I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried.

Well, Chiaki Konaka may have put in a valiant effort for the title of “Creator who shat the hardest on their own work to prove how stupid and unsubtle right wing commentary is,” but Stephen Pastis still holds that honor, and despite Konaka’s best efforts, Digimon Tamers still holds up beautifully to this day.  I haven’t seen every installment in the Digimon franchise...  Honestly, I haven’t seen anything released after Tamers...  But from what I have seen, Tamers is easily the best of the bunch.  I can’t guarantee everyone will enjoy it as much as I did, especially among younger and more sensitive audiences, and I know some people find it boring when a story takes the scenic approach, taking its sweet time introducing it’s world and characters before finally diving into the plot, but personally?  I love how dark and mature it is for a kid’s show, and I love slow burn stories that give you time to get interested in everything...  Besides, even at its slowest moments, Tamers is never shy about delivering intense action, chilling twists and surprisingly effective humor.  Whether you’re a fan of the Digimon franchise or not, Tamers is well worth your time, and I’d highly recommend checking it out.

I give Digimon Tamers an 8/10."
104460,"WARNING: HERE THERE BE SPOILERS, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

It's almost been two years since I finished Yuru Camp S2, and now I finally got around to the movie. Having that much time since then, I was worried I wouldn't be able to get back into it... Oh, how wrong I was.

Watching this right after Fall '22 (and more specifically DIY) made this an even greater experience with their similar philosophy when building the campground, and I can't wait to get into it.

Really funny how immediately I was reminded of why I fell in love with the more mature take on a kirara manga this show was, with them literally being fully grown adults from frame one. I had an inkling of that from the KVs, but that still really took me by surprise for them to literally be adults now, lmao.

img700()

I know it's not really that impressive in the grand scheme of things, but still... Kind of a weird feeling in a Kirara adaptation to see these characters that we were introduced to as high schoolers, now fully-grown adults. New Game exists obviously, but that's not rly the same thing with Aoba starting as an adult. The closest thing we've got to this was in Koias with the senpais, but even then, we never got much focus on their life beyond high school since we were focusing on MiraAo's story. Here we immediately see Shimarin dealing with an OL environment, with rejections to her proposals that she has to take like an adult. But still, it's kirara, so they still keep it light and breezy with cute shimarin [faces](), and it's not like she has to completely ignore those feelings of frustration. It's just, it's immediately made clear that her conclusions from the experience is a much more mature & constructive one than we'd expect from a kirara character—to know it's not the end of the world and to move on. Yuru Camp was always the most mature kirara manga in order to keep up with its chill vibes, but that's even more the case now.

Nadeshiko also shows her experience in her job with her knowledge of the equipment and ability to tell what they need just from their few comments alone, even knowing exactly what their shop does and doesn't sell before sending them to another store. That desire to help the customer in any way she can, even if it means not being able to squeeze every cent of money out of them... and the boss was completely fine with that. sasuga kirara (tho only bc she believed the good service would bring them back to buy more lol but still). Nadeshiko being able to make others fall in love with camping already [felt like second nature](https://twitter.com/hoshiiZoras/status/1379665924496617478) to her, but now she's making it into a job that she genuinely enjoys... So mature that it really feels like Shirobako in the best of ways, but it's still filled with fluffy & optimistic (& leaning on idealistic again) kirara-isms that makes all these aspects of life feel that much more approachable & less soul-crushing. As they said in the intro, even though a lot's changed and they have way more adult responsibilities, that's in-turn opening up so many more opportunities for their camping adventures—with Nadeshiko's desire to get a driving license and Rin wanting to go camping overseas now seeming like a real possibility as adults.

Man... all this adult talk... I really love what this movie's doing, but... maybe this is because of my life situation rn, but it feels a bit underwhelming. And that's probably by design. Watching this right after Bocchi is quite an Experience, bc that show has all these Big, passionate Emotions that the characters pour every fiber of their being into, because that's what being a moody teenager is all about. But adults... they don't have the energy for those Big Emotions anymore after their responsibilities saps all that energy from their bodies.

Anyways, enough of that depressing talk; this moment...
img300() img300()

IT'S LITERALLY JUST DIY LMAO. And the DIY comparisons are actually pretty interesting... Because in DIY, they were only able to build a treehouse, and even then they struggled a bit. Here, they're building a whole fucking campground, and that's only possible because they're getting the help & approval of the local government and companies, which comes with its own whole set of caveats.

In DIY, they were free to build whatever they wanted, which made for such a liberating experience that celebrated the freedom of creativity and ambition, but that freedom ended up having its own caveats for Serufu who ended up struggling to find her own role when she was all on her own.

But here, while the scope of things they're able to do are so much larger thanks to the help of others (which, btw, is an extension of what I talked about [here](https://twitter.com/hoshiiZoras/status/1374966136719073282). seeing things come full circle like this, it rly is such a great reminder of why i love this show); but on the flipside, they also had all these restrictions, not only with their budget and what was feasible, but with the desires and needs of other companies like when the archaeologists discovered the artifacts, and their need to use the campground's space throwing a wrench in their plans. That hit a bit harder than it did for highschool Rin this time, because they've been investing so much time and energy into this, but the conclusion is fundamentally the same as it was back then: that some sacrifice of what you specifically want is necessary when working with others, and the sooner you accept that like a mature adult, the more time you'll have to think of how a compromise can make the end result something you can still be happy with, and in some ways even better than you expected.

In DIY, Serufu's ideas were a bit too extravagant to be feasible, but it was through the help of Takumin & the others that she was able to see the potential in those ideas and apply them in a practical way. It was through the others' help that she found her own role. It wasn't quite to Serufu's vision, but was still something that Serufu's immediately grateful for, for her to feel useful and like she's actually participating, even if she isn't the best at handiwork. And I feel like seeing the very same resourcefulness & accepting of other's help replicated here really helped me to appreciate both this movie and DIY that much more.
webm(https://files.catbox.moe/n9ptpm.mp4)
Just like Serufu's friends, instead of only fighting for their own ideas, they're thinking of ways to integrate their own and the other's ideas in a feasible & productive way that benefits everyone. The end result is different than they'd hoped for, but that doesn't mean it's worse for it. That's what Rin discovered when introducing Nadeshiko to camping all those years ago, and seeing that same conclusion exhibited here, just on a larger scale and more maturely really made it feel like such a solid movie that celebrates the spirit of Yuru Camp. I'm always expecting a laid-back time with this show, only to be blown away by how much there is to talk about and how dense the character writing is; and I'm so glad to say that's still the case with this movie, even two years after watching the show and having a flimsy memory of it. Yep... this is still a favorite of all time for me... 😭😭🙏♥ Can't wait for season 3..."
146234,"Anyone ever watch a show specifically for one character? Everyone has their own reason for watching something, no matter how odd or specific, no matter how the thing they decide to watch looks like it’ll turn out. Sometimes they just like the vibe and wanna experience that all the way. Sometimes they just really like a song or one of their favorite artists is doing the OP or ED. Sometimes clips have convinced you that a show has baller fights, or in the case of this show, clips have demonstrated one character who sells the anime alone.

It’s not the sister. In fact, let’s get this out of the way now, the titular one-hit-kill sister, Maya, is gonna be a make or break aspect of the show, as other aspects and faults will often be supported or hindered by the experience of watching a brocon constantly smother and even sexually harass her little brother. That’s certainly a fetish some people are down for, but perhaps the main reason this show is even worse-received than its contemporaries this season (many of which seem significantly more poorly-produced and include fucking Smartphone S2) is the fact that Maya is insufferable most of the time. They can range from kind of annoying to disturbing and even manipulative, though of course that means we’re supposed to find it gut-busting (or even nut-busting).

There are some decent bonding moments and snippets of conflict between her and actual MC Asahi. The weakling’s desire for independence and his need to grow stronger both for his own sense of self-improvement and his own sake given the dangerous world is combined with how adventurers caught falsifying their rank are dealt with, is an alright source of character development. Asahi’s a bumbling little squirt annoyed at how unlike basically every other isekai MC this season alone, his base stats are equivalent to how original world’s self without any crazy OP powers, therefore making it harder to do anything, including evading Maya’s advances until episode 4. 

Still, slowly but surely, he trains (which we should see a bit more of), he acquires powers, and improves his evasion and techniques to the point of being able to make up for his weaknesses. He may not recognize it, perhaps many viewers don’t either, but Maya does, which helps elevate both characters up a little while solidifying perhaps more character development than some isekai consumers (and haters) are used to from one of these. She herself has some surprising moments of actually sincerely looking out for him in the shadows, even if it’s always preceded by or followed up by a gaudy sexual or romantic advance in the same episode.

Otherwise, this show has a comfortable enough vibe. Tensions are minimal but they get played upon to at least a perfunctory degree, and there is some decent comedy to be had with Asahi’s bullshitting or some of the character dynamics. The latter aspect is mainly found in the borderline sitcom arch nemesis who carries the show on its back, Kilmaria. She’s a blood knight demon, among the demon lord’s top guys, and after being saved by Asahi despite tryna fight him on the grounds of his reputation, she quickly develops her own dynamics with the main duo, evolving them over time. She goes from casually hanging out with and mildly looking down on Asahi as a sort of little brother, to someone who cares about him more and more with each passing adventure. She goes from seeing Maya as this insufferable and hypocritical rival to one she eventually starts getting along with and making fun of. Perhaps her best showing is in episode 5 where, in a human disguise, she starts being excited by all the little things in a human society like horses, bridges, and the weak masses before rubbing Asahi the wrong way about how weak and inconvenient being a human must be. 

Of course, the show never hard commits to any conflicts it dredges up, save for one example that introduces one of Asahi’s eventual harem members he builds up over time, but the inklings are welcome enough and some of them get just enough exploration without making the show actively need to take itself seriously. The other characters in this show are…fine? Sophie the healer is kind of annoying as an overzealous Asahi-worshiper, Tanya’s the quest-giver and total fangirl who does get an ok story with her little brother who also looks up to Asahi. Gloria’s a fun meathead girl who eventually swaps out her suspicions towards Asahi for a dorkaholic romantic interest in him that her servant, Kuon, attempts to wingman. She’s probably the second or third most fun girl in the show. Some of the other side characters like the eventually washed-up adventurer Siegfriend are amusing as well, especially when the source of his party’s humiliating downfall unknowingly greets him again. 

The cast is honestly on the upper half of isekai rosters in all honesty, and you bet that Kilmaria makes at least some of them bounce off her. Even without her elevating everything for most of the show, eventually enough of them come into their own to help make the cast surprisingly decent on the whole. They’re actually kinda funny, with nearly every episode having at least one funny moment and a few bits actually being kinda hilarious. It’s also oddly nice how much they back each other up, defending each other’s character in the face of whoever’s goading, intimidating, or otherwise confronting them. It adds a sense of camaraderie to everyone that can’t quite be found in a lot of this show’s contemporaries, even Slime, and that series actively has a community being built from the ground up. The ways everyone comes together in the finale are rather fun and rewarding to see as a result of everything.

Another aspect of the show that’s better than it realistically should be is the visuals. For the most part, it looks pretty subpar. It’s Gekkou’s first release as a studio, and a directorial debut by Hiroaki Takagi, and it could be worse on either front. Sometimes it absolutely is. The show’s production is so jittery that while 60-95% of the time it looks about what you’d expect from your average seasonal, sometimes it’ll either dip into astonishingly terrible territory or bust out a couple of surprisingly decent cuts. There are plenty of animation errors even outside of the freakish drops in quality, like with the dragon in Kilmaria’s Chinese dress disappearing a lot. The action rarely gets past just ok, even when we get an oddly fine burst of sakuga. The volleyball scene in the beach episode (episode 11) is an atrocious minute of slideshows and the fanservice can range from perfunctory to downright crudely drawn, so just be glad this isn’t classified as an ecchi because as mediocre it is as an action show, it would fare even worse as an ecchi title.

The outlines tend to not stick out, but sometimes the show thickens them as part of a gag of for more climactic close-ups. The show also does play around with aspect ratios every now and then, like letterboxing in the first half of episode 1 and 4:3 in the flashback sequence that kicks off episode 7. The characters also deform into charmingly drawn chibis for a bunch of silly gags and spats, usually Maya and Kilmaria who also carry the brunt of the relatively amusing facial expressions. They do try to spice things up occasionally, and that is welcome. It honestly feels like there’s enough potential in the visuals that if it were made to simmer for another 3 months, the end result could have wound up being legitimately above average for a seasonal, let alone an isekai. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.

A more consistently mediocre aspect of the series is its music. The ED, Mukyuu Platonic” by VALIS is an oddly decent electropop song with hints of melancholy in it, which makes it better than both OPs. The music is also fairly forgettable outside of Maya’s theme and Kilmaria’s theme which get spammed basically every episode. There is an occasionally decent track once in a while like when Kilmaria tries to get Asahi to abandon Maya and become a demon, and there’s an alright insert in episode 11 that gives the siblings some time alone to discuss how far they’ve come in a mostly pleasant scene. However, that doesn’t really elevate the music much, as it’s still incredibly whatever across the board.

One Turn Kill Neesan can be a pleasant, goofy ride that revels in its own absurdity while boasting more character development and fun dynamics than one might expect. It’s also got brocon shit that will either elevate the experience for you if you’re into it, or make the show a trudge to sit through for the good bits if you aren’t. It’s very annoying and kind of embarrassing, but it is kinda cute and fun, especially whenever characters are being dorks or having each other’s back. Still, there’s enough here to elevate the show well above the likes of Smartphone, Master of Ragnarok, Arifureta, or probably half of the isekai you’re watching this season (because Kamikatsu looks like it was edited by YouTubers [derogatory] and animated by an outsourced studio in another country). In terms of an isekai you can just sit back and watch, you can do a lot worse. Name another isekai that has Kilmaria in it.

Also, this is a non-Sunrise show, non-mecha seasonal at that, which features a relatively acceptable mecha transformation sequence...in 2D. Wasted as it is on a last-minute outing and one-shot, that fact alone is borderline commendable for one of these, especially considering it’s an isekai."
101343,"I remember watching Made in Abyss when it first came out in 2017, and, along with the rest of the anime community, I was floored. Everything works together, cogs meshing and moving in harmony to serve this well-oiled machine. But as the years ticked by, I began to lose interest in anime, and by the time 2020 rolled around, the Dawn of the Deep Soul movie had come out, and I didn’t feel like watching the show over again. Then Season 2 was announced, and I started feeling nostalgic. By that point, I was fully back into anime, more than I’d been before. Granted, I still didn’t want to rewatch the whole 13-episode season, but I was certainly willing to watch the recap movies instead. And here we are. 

The story itself is still phenomenal, and as far as I’m aware, nothing important gets lost in this shorter edit. Having the audience understand the stakes for the characters and the dangerous nature of the Abyss is so vital, and they do so masterfully even before Riko and Reg descend. You really want to root for them, especially in spite of the reality that they may very well die horrifically. The side characters are so fun and interesting; I love the kids at the orphanage (the unspoken tension between Riko and Nat is well-written), and characters like Ozen and Marulk bring such a history to the world of the show. In fact, all the characters bring a sense of grounded realism to this fantastical world. And these are just some of the people we meet in this first half of the season.

And while the story and characters are well-written, the thread that sews them together is the music. Ah, the music! Kevin Penkin’s score is so lovely, and fits the show like a glove. I find myself listening to the score when I take walks nowadays, or whenever I'm in need of good background music. The score is everything the show needs: When things are peaceful, the music is there to soothe you. When things get intense, the tones shift to accommodate. And when you need to experience the gravitas of the Abyss, Kevin’s got your back.

Taking a step back, I was actually concerned that the pacing would be messed up since it’s just a TV show cut down to movie length. But Journey’s Dawn actually works really well as a movie. The story beats you’d see in a typical movie are basically all there, and they even made a special intro animation just for this movie (which is pretty darn cool of them to do). Ever since I watched the first two Attack on Titan recap movies, pacing has been a real concern in my mind regarding these, but I didn’t have to worry at all. My enjoyment has been reinvigorated, and I’m looking forward to experiencing the rest of season 1 again, as well as everything else the Abyss has to throw at this loveable duo."
1222,"Es una historia que hemos visto mil veces. Una chica más bien tímida se enamora del el chico popular de su clase. Mil y un formatos de cómo contar la misma premisa existen en el mundo, sin embargo (como bien indican los que estudian el tema), el truco consiste en qué vuelta de tuerca le da el autor a la historia. Y Yuuki Obata lo sabe hacer muy bien. Tanto, que ganó el mayor premio del manga en 2005, y vendió más de 10 millones de copias sólo en Japón. 

La historia va así. Takahashi Nanami tiene 15 años y es su primer día en el primer año de secundaria. Conoce a varias personas, principalmente quienes serán sus amigas, Mizuguchi y Taka, y a su compañera de clase Yamamoto Yuri que le da mensajes mixtos sobre si Nana le cae bien o mal. Todas sus compañeras hablan del chico lindo de la clase, Yano Motoharu, a quien Nanami no ha tenido la oportunidad de conocer. Sin embargo, como suele pasar, Nanami se olvida el nombre de su nueva amiga ""Mizu-chan"" y decide preguntarle a un compañero que pasa por ahí. Sin saberlo realmente, Nanami tiene el presentimiento de conocer quién es ese chico. Y no se equivoca. Pero Yano dista de ser ese chico buena onda y simpático que describen sus amigas. Por el contrario, es bastante arrogante. Para conveniencia de la trama, Yano termina siendo el subdelegado de la clase junto a Nanami, que es la delegada. Y así, comienzan a conocerse mejor uno al otro.

Con el correr de la historia, Nanami descubrirá que debajo de esa actitud arrogante y esa sonrisa ganadora, se oculta un chico con muchísimos miedos e inseguridades. También con varias heridas sin curar, que no ha podido compartir ni siquiera con su mejor amigo de la infancia: Takeuchi Masafumi. Por su parte, Nanami aprenderá también a controlar, por momentos, y a dejarse llevar, en otros, por sus sentimientos. Y el significado de las palabras ""promesa"" y ""eternidad"".

Es interesante para mí, el trabajo que hace Obata como autora a la hora de abordar esas dos temáticas. Describe muy bien, así como también dramatiza muy bien, aquellas cosas que significan el mundo para un adolescente de ese rango de edad. Las amistades, los primeros amores y desamores, las promesas de eternidad y el peso de que estás promesas se rompan. Todo es dramático, porque también es absoluto. Cuando sale bien, es perfecto y cuando no, es lo peor. En la narrativa, se destaca por dejar frases muy lindas o momentos de telenovela (de hecho, luego en el manga, se hace mofa de esto cuando los personajes son adultos y reflexionan sobre sus versiones adolescentes). Por ejemplo, una que me gusta a mí es:
>Siempre me has fastidiado, desde el principio. Dices cosas egoístas y remueves mis sentimientos. Eres tan pegajosa. Pero luego me dejas y te vas con tanta facilidad. Eres cruel. Pero a pesar de todo, te quiero.

A nivel narrativo, sin dudas el manga supera al anime. Principalmente porque en el anime la historia concluye en el último capítulo del tomo 8 (de 16) es decir que literalmente se queda a mitad de la historia, y no vemos toda la evolución que luego tienen sus protagonistas. Pero, para mí, es destacable que en lo que dura, sea tan fiel al manga. La realidad es que hay muy pocos elementos que no estén y la historia sigue siendo muy interesante si lográs pasar el tema de la animación. Sí, la animación no es buena. Y no porque sea del 2006, sino porque en el afán por mantener la estética del manga, se vuelve rara y tiene muy poco movimiento. Pero la banda sonora lo compensa muchísimo (para mí). Es sencillamente una de las BSO más hermosas que haya escuchado a día de hoy, y eso es porque todas y cada una de las canciones tienen una letra preciosa y un manejo del tono increíble. Vas a llorar y vas a cantar seguro con varias. 

El Op es súper wholesome, sobretodo en contraste con la carga dramática que tiene la historia. Es uno de esos OP que te hacen sentir que todo es hermoso y que va a ir sobre ruedas la relación, cuando en realidad, tienen más crisis y problemas que los Pérez García. Así y todo, como amante del drama que soy, es una historia que volvería a ver de tanto en tanto, porque me hace emocionarme y llorar como la primera vez que la ví, allá por el 2009. No es una historia que le recomendaría a cualquiera. Tiene que amar el drama, de otro modo, es lógico que se vuelva una historia tediosa y que destaque mucho más que es una relación ""tóxica"". Tema que además, se toca de la mano de Takeuchi. Pero eso sería quitar del medio el factor de ""ficción"", que es mucho muy importante. Nadie quiere tener una relación como la de Nana y Yano en la vida real, pero eso no quita que nos guste ver su historia y su evolución. De otro modo, no existirían los fans de Crepúsculo o de 50 Sombras de Grey."
99366,"If you've watched Asobi Asobase or Daily Lives of High School Boys, then Chio's School Road is a similar deal. It's episodic, each episode consists of multiple short gags, and the main cast is great. Where Chio's School Road diverges a bit from the two would be:
1. Its setting — from the perspective of Chio (the protagonist) on her way to school.
2. The original creator, [Kawasaki Tadataka](https://anilist.co/staff/110041/Tadataka-Kawasaki)'s other works were all hentai doujins.
3. There's a lot of lewd elements (which is expected given the author).

Now, depending on the person, the fact that the author is more known for their hentai might be a deal-breaker. Even if that does bother you, I still implore you to check this out. I've watched some pretty raunchy ecchi and the lewd parts in this weren't close to as bad (this isn't even an ecchi).

All that said, what makes comedy tough is the fact that it's subjective. What someone (like myself) finds to be funny others might not and vice-versa. That's just how it is. For me, all that matters is enjoyment. And I can definitely say I got a whole lot of that from this show.






When one watches an anime adaptation, how faithful it is to the source material is a fair question to ask. Now for me, it doesn't necessarily have to be an exact 1:1 translation. However, the original spirit and intention should be intact. In the case of a comedy such as this, that would be preserving the humor.

I actually didn't read the manga prior to watching this. However, upon finishing this, I did check it out. As far as I could tell, the anime adapted 30 or so chapters of the manga (it looks like some weren't in the exact order). Given that there are 53 chapters, that does leave a bit more content for people to read if one takes a liking to this.

img() webm(https://files.catbox.moe/9d7knz.mp4)


But was this adaptation faithful? Yes, I'd say so. In fact, I think it was so good that whether you watch this or read the manga boils down to personal preference. From what I can see, you won't be missing out on anything by choosing one over the other. I really liked Kawasaki Tadataka's art style (I may or may not check out his other works to compare). The style used in the anime obviously isn't the same, but I do think that [diomedéa](https://anilist.co/studio/51/diomeda) still did a great job.

If I were to choose between the two, I honestly think I'd have to go with this anime. No disrespect to Kawasaki Tadataka, I did really like the original manga. Between his art style and the comedy, he really did have a great idea. However, I think that this anime took the novel idea he had and really elevated it for me. To have sound (the VA and the effects/OST) accompany the illustrations and to see it in an animated format really did make a big difference for me. I liked the OP and ED and thought they were a good fit. I'm also pretty sure the seiyuu for the main cast sung in them (trio for the OP, Chio and Manana for the ED).






What I really like about this type of show is how the focus is on the characters. There's no complex, overarching plot or some villain to defeat. Just regular people and crazy shit happening to them. And I thought that the main cast was phenomenal. Chio would be the 2nd anime schoolgirl that I've related to a lot (after Bocchi). I really liked that she was a chuunibyou that instead of fantasy, was obsessed with western PC gaming. A lot of the gags played off this too and it was just fun to watch. Also, the fact that [Naomi Oozora](https://anilist.co/staff/117329/Naomi-Oozora) did the voice for her was perfect. I loved her as [Jahy](https://anilist.co/character/124618/Jahy), so I quickly recognized that voice. Manana's VA I wasn't familiar with, but I also think she did an excellent job.



Speaking of Chio and Manana, I loved their relationship. They were both adorable assholes, but still clearly best friends. Every time they were both on screen, I was excited to see what shenanigans I'd witness. I don't recall being disappointed either. There is a 3rd girl, Yuki, who I also liked. I definitely didn't like her as much as the other two, but she was weird and goofy. She's one of those brutally honest types, so as you can imagine, she says stuff that is hilariously savage.








Mayuta is a biker gang leader that Chio ends up running into. I actually thought that he was fine for the most part. I enjoyed most of his gags. However, I wasn't overly fond of his relationship with Chio. They clearly got closer with each time they interacted. But given their age gap, it felt really weird and at times made me uncomfortable.

img()

I read somewhere that there's only a 4-year gap. Even so, I personally just wasn't a fan (especially with how drastically different they appeared in age). It would be one thing for this to appear in a hentai doujin, but in this context, it just felt plain odd. Despite this though, I was able to just overlook it and still enjoy the show for what it was.


Then there's Madoka, an older girl at Chio's school. She's captain of the Kabaddi Club who and has a desire to grope other girls. Because why not. When she first appeared, I thought it was sort of funny. But then the gag continues with her grabbing Yuki's ass. Who repeatedly tells her to stop. And she doesn't.

img()

A character like this might've been something that would've made sense in a hentai or ecchi, but here, it just felt out of place and forced. I guess the mangaka really wanted to include a character like this here. If you don't mind more lewd humor and aren't sensitive to this sort of stuff then it might not be that big of a deal for you. For me, I've seen far worse, so I wasn't fazed all that much. But everyone is different, so make of this what you will.


Lastly, there was this random homeless dude. It gets suggested that he got to where he was because he groped a schoolgirl. I just felt uncomfortable whenever he was on screen. I didn't find him funny at all nor did I think he added much. Thankfully, he didn't have many appearances in the anime. But unfortunately, he still exists.






From everything I've said up to now, you can probably gather that this anime has fan-service. It's definitely there, but it's not to the point where it's constantly in your face. It is definitely present and comes up enough where it's worth pointing out to anyone thinking of watching this.

Aside from the lewd stuff I've already mentioned, I only recall unsolicited panty shots. I know with anime and/or manga this can happen. I wasn't a huge fan of it here. I simply found it weird and would often try to look past it. But it happens multiple times throughout the show (sometimes more than once in a single episode). Just another treat from the mangaka, I suppose.

Whether or not one wants to watch/read this depends on how much they care for lewd stuff. Again, I didn't think it was terrible, but it is undeniably there and is baked into some of the comedy.






To close this all off, I will acknowledge that this anime is flawed. There might've been a few things I wasn't fond of in this anime. Maybe not all of the comedy worked for me either. The issues I had might have been relatively minor-mild for me, but for others, they could be a bigger deal. Despite all that, I would still say that I got a fair amount of enjoyment out of this. If you enjoyed Asobi Asobase or Daily Lives of High School Boys, I'd recommend this one too.

As for how I'd rank them all personally, I'd probably go:

Asobi Asobase = Daily Lives of High School Boys > Chio's School Road

There was no ignoring all the flaws and I just couldn't give it a 9/10 like what I gave the other two. Even so, I'd still rank it well above a lot of other comedy anime I've seen up to now.

For that reason, I give Chio's School Road an 8/10."
101336,"People evolve. We venture beyond our comfort zones, adapting and adjusting to new environments. In the end, we become better versions of ourselves. However, for the shirogane (masters of magical puppets), this is not the case. Defined by their silver hair, slim figures, and seemingly ageless bodies, they’ve been fighting monsters for hundreds of years. Their reasoning for this lies within a traumatizing event from long ago; this event permanently affected them. While the seasons change, the shirogane stay the same. It's apparent in their fighting style (the manipulation of puppets). With the issues they confront, the shirogane insist on an approach that’s not only unreliable but is also (more or less) outdated. To me, the shirogane are frozen in time.

The same can be said of Karakuri Circus. Like the shirogane, this show is from a bygone era. July 9, 1997 was when Karakuri Circus first emerged, as the brainchild of mangaka Kazuhiro Fujita. And although it was recently adapted into an anime (thanks to Studio VOLN), the premise is typical of the era it hails from. At the outset, we’re introduced to Masaru Saiga (a timid soul with a big heart, a photographic memory, and a lofty inheritance), alongside his companions Narumi and Eleonore. Loyalty is established (and romance blossoms) as they voyage through a coming-of-age tale involving daddy issues, the power of friendship, and eventually saving the world. This did not grab my attention (at least, not at first). For me, the overarching story is redeemed when it connects to its various subplots, specifically the shirogane’s struggles against the automata.

Here's where the magic unfolds. Masaru’s journey may be this show’s backbone, but it’s in the feud between these two factions that Karakuri Circus comes alive. Their various showdowns are engaging to watch, mostly thanks to composer Yuki Hayashi (he’s the brains behind the soundtracks for Haikyuu and My Hero Academia). It’s because of him that, for each action sequence, viewers are blessed with a colorful array of accordions, drums, and guitars. And the fights themselves are quite impressive. The puppets that the shirogane weaponize and maneuver are rendered in stunning CGI. Gaudy explosions often follow the attacks these fighters unleash (at one point, a column of fire erupts as lightning bolts dance around it). And the battles end stylishly; it’s mesmerizing to watch the automata crumble piece by piece, under grey ooze and hissing steam.

Fight scenes are this show's pride and joy. However, what's said during these fight scenes isn't always as inspiring. As far as dialogue is concerned, there are certain areas I enjoy; the one-liners here are very much appreciated and the soul-stirring speeches are genuine highlights, especially in the final six episodes. On the other hand, this show is held back by a hamfisted sreenplay; the dialogue is both excessive and redundant, often emphasizing the most obvious ideas. Karakuri Circus provides character development but not without pointlessly detailing the process. It presents ingenious tactics but not without long-winded explanations of how they work. It features personality traits (like Eleonore's weaknesses or a hospital patient's hobbies), but not without an extended monologue about them soon after. For most shonens, infodumping is a recurring issue, and Karakuri Circus is no exception.

Ideally, these monologues would be reduced (if not removed entirely). Studio VOLN, though, were occupied elsewhere, with modifying the manga’s overall storyline. Looking to comply with the 36-episode format, they condensed the events of the source material, disposing of specific plot threads in the process. Among others, the Beast Tamer arc and the Kuroga Village training period were axed. Although it caused complaints (especially from fans of the manga), the differences, for the most part, aren’t too severe. To be clear, the editing process and the end result are by no means perfect, but they don't detract from the overall experience. By holding onto the original’s ideas and themes, Karakuri Circus remains true to Fujita’s vision.

- - - - - - -

It’s a mess. The table is cluttered with mess; it's practically submerged in folders, calculators, pencil shavings, ink stains, and rough sketches. However, Kazuhiro Fujita and his three assistants ignore this. An idea has caught their attention instead. “Aren’t there idiots who get excited just from being on a cliff?” Fujita wonders aloud. He then rises from his chair, gesturing with his hands to emphasize the point he’s making. After doing this, a voice intones, “For Fujita-san, if he’s not talking to people, then it appears he cannot progress in his work.”

Kazuhiro Fujita is a featured guest on “Urasawa Naoki no Manben,” a 2015 documentary series that captures a mangaka’s journey in creating their material; it’s intended to provide a glimpse into the process’ inner workings. In the documentary, Fujita and his assistants are filmed at work for four days. When this is finished, Naoki Urasawa (Manben’s host) and Fujita convene to examine the footage.

While doing so, they discuss a variety of manga-related topics. Naturally, the conversation shifts to detailing the early stages of Fujita’s career. At the age of 25, he was hired by Shonen Sunday and soon after he reviewed what they had to offer. Fujita scrutinized the magazine’s catalog, a lineup of sports stories and romantic comedies, and he wanted to invigorate the ranks with something new. In order to succeed, he derived inspiration from his childhood influences.

Ever since his days growing up in Asahikawa, Fujita loved reading manga, especially shonens. At the time, he was entranced by series like Shotaro Ishinomori’s “Kamen Rider,” Go Nagai’s “Devilman,” and Ken Ishikawa’s “Getter Robo.” However, out of all his childhood influences, there was one that towered above the rest: Rumiko Takahashi’s “Yami wo Kakeru Manazashi.”

“It was a short story with regular humans that fought the weird and won. I thought ‘Oh, I am really glad she drew something like this.’ Like, ‘This is just the kind of thing I want to read!’ It was the kind of thing that made me think ‘Manga’s amazing!’ And I think it was the thing that turned me on to doing manga”, - Kazuhiro Fujita

- - - - - - -

This idea would define him. Throughout his career of thirty years and counting, Fujita waged war against the unknown. In his stories, he would maneuver his everyman leads into confronting opponents of unnatural origin, like evil spirits (in Ushio to Tora), fairy-tale denizens (in Moonlight Act), and sentient haunted houses (in Souboutei Kowasubeshi). With Karakuri Circus, it’s the automata that adopt this role. However, there’s a crucial difference between this show and the rest of Fujita’s works. Beneath the speeches, the references to Chinese culture and the slapstick comedy lies Karakuri Circus’s true intent: to find common ground between the shirogane and automata through their goals. For the shirogane, that goal is learning from the past. After centuries of failure, they finally abandon their age-old stubbornness, which causes them to evolve both in combat (with a wider range of styles and tactics) and outside of it (with more openness in their personal relations). As for the automata, their purpose isn’t as detailed. There’s a backstory here but it’s a strange one, almost impossible to make sense of. Regardless, this show succeeds in providing both sides a cause worth fighting for. It’s not much but having this makes it easier to understand the automata.

However, this show fails to humanize them. Excluding the Les Quatre Pioneers (the four oldest automata) and a few others, there's no reason for anyone to care about them. These guys are cartoonishly evil. They kill for sport, getting off on the worst of bloodbaths. In battle, their signature move is to take the children and slap them around before using them as bargaining chips. If children aren’t nearby, they’ll resort to removing women's clothing and gloating about it afterward. The automata are caricatures, plain and simple; they’re card-carrying villains, cruel for cruelty’s sake, cackling at the chaos they’ve created. And they’re not the only ones like this. In Karakuri Circus, almost every antagonist is written the same way. From Zenji Saiga (Masaru’s uncle) to episode 16’s suicidal samurai and even the main villain himself, they’re all reduced to stereotype, burdened with bloated egos and creepy facial expressions.

This black-and-white worldview cripples the show's storytelling. It's also an issue that's appeared in Fujita's writing from the start.

People evolve. We venture beyond our comfort zones, adapting and adjusting to new environments. In the end, we become better versions of ourselves. However, for Kazuhiro Fujita, this is not the case. Defined by his haunting imagery, two-dimensional villains, and references to Chinese culture, he’s been drawing manga for thirty years. His reasoning for this lies within a short story from long ago; this story permanently affected him. While the seasons change, Fujita stays the same. It's apparent in his writing style. With the stories he creates, Fujita insists on an approach that’s not only flawed but is also (more or less) outdated. To me, Kazuhiro Fujita is frozen in time.

The same can be said of Karakuri Circus. Like Fujita, this anime is from a bygone era. And it shows, what with its archaic sense of humor and its bright-red line between good and evil. There's little room for nuance here, the shades of grey few and far between. However, what Karakuri Circus lacks in subtlety, it compensates with heart. The stories here truly inspire. They are love letters to the human spirit, songs of triumph over our past failings and grievances. And although they're constrained by cliches, I'll always remember these tales of personal growth, especially the ones I least expected."

This review has been cooking up in my head for a long time.

Now to the actual review
{if you're not interested in my opinion, skip to Wandering Son technical rundown}

Well, in the most simple explanation, it's an anime about gender identity and puberty.
Our main characters are Shuuichi Nitori, a young transgender girl could pass off as a girl for her feminine physique and cutesy behaviour, but as she grows older, she slowly faces her struggles through male puberty.
A similar struggle is seen through the lens of our second main character Yoshino Takatsuki who is a transgender boy facing the struggles of female puberty.
Seeing these two grow up and interact with the people around them is the lifeline of show, but it can also be detrimental to it.
So;

In short, I find this anime to be the best representation of LGBTQ characters in the medium, usually these topics are treated as minor jokes with the prevelance of 'trp' characters, but the treatment here towards these topics are mature, accepting and honestly touching...
However, this treatment didn't last all the way to the end..
What do I mean by that? 
Well unfortunately the show was cancelled mid way, and the team had to rush an ending not everyone was happy with. 
it's completion left people down because of it's unhappy wrap up.
Now for my perspective: The ending sure is depressing and feels all for naught, but in my opinion, it's a realistic outcome, a sad one sure, but it's honest and hard hitting.
Not everything will go as planned, it's a part of life, Nitori's transformation and it's depressing finale sure isn't happy or motivating, but it's real.

Now with all of that said, it still isn't something that should ruin or demotivate you from watching it, because this anime stands for much more than just a half-baked ending, and the ending was still interesting in it's own right, it just could've been much more.

Now with this part out of the way, i'll move on to the elements of the show, if that doesn't really interest you, skip to 'Summary & Score'.

- Art & Animation -  The art direction and overall animation is top tier and extremely unique, using a bright & warm pastel palette, it suits the show extremely well and delivers  an overall very fitting vibe,
This show looks like what a warm hug feels like.
Overall rating: 10/10

- Sound & OST - Audio in general is of high quality, very good voice acting, appropriate casting and excellent performances.
The OST is pretty darn good also, having a very cute intro, excellent outro song and fitting track usage.
Overall rating: 9/10

-  Story & Characters - A super loveable cast that play well into the school life, all are unique and fun on-screen, they all play into the warm and bright feel of the show.
Story itself is what i've already said before the technical rundown, it's a growing up story with a unique persective and appropriate treatment of the LGBTQ topic, it's relatable, emotional and adorable.
It's ending might've left some people sad, but sad doesn't always mean bad
Overall rating: 10/10

With that out of the way, i'll move onto the;

So to sum up, Wandering Son is one of my favourite anime for what it stands for and what it does, it's one of the rare few times that I felt extremely connected to a show and actually touched by it's message and purpose.
This show isn't only about being transgender, it's about accepting others and living your life  your own way, not letting people dictate what you do and accepting yourself as you are.
You don't have to be a part of the LGBTQ community to enjoy this anime, everyone can learn something from this and I feel like it's one of the most touching and accepting shows out there.

My personal score for the amount of emotion and joy I felt throughout the show is easily a 100/100, but i'll lower the score because of it's incompletion and rushed ending."
21322,"This show was my first and probably my only exposure to Rage of Bahamut series. I went in knowing nothing of the original story.

Apparently there is something important about the two lead girls (Anne and Grea) in context of a larger story but what became more important to me while watching this short series is one thing...will Anne and Grea actually go all the way?

The romantic fan service throughout the 10 episodes is amazing. Anne every episode somehow gets thirstier and thirstier for Grea. Was the whole point of this show for us to see the blossoming relationship between them? I honestly have no idea and to be fair it the only thing that I got out of it.

If the show had shifted to anything else I probably wouldn't of stayed. Am I shallow? Oh yes I am. However even if it did I know that production wise the show would of been stellar either way.

The music of this show was amazing all the way through. Its OST is a must listen. Its wonderful and sweeping orchestra pieces just fit the setting so well and is a nice change of pace.

Visually the show is stunning. Every shot is perfect, from the characters, to the backgrounds to even the little details. During the few times magic is actually used and there is action the shots are fluid and not overwhelming to the eyes.

There are moments of drama is in the show, but everything is always resolved by the end of the episode with no loose ends. The comedy is also really good when its played out and never feels forced.

While Anne and Grea our are main princesses we still get to see a good amount of other characters. Ms. Miranda one of the teachers - who is just a nutty as Anne, Anne's body guard who stalks them, and the student council President Hanna and her assistant. It was nice to see that the studio took the time to fill out the student body with interesting characters and not 1D cut outs copy and pasted in the background each scene. Each person belongs in a shot and it all seems so natural (even if we never see them again).

Overall this show surprised me with some fantastic yuri-bait action and its the best thing ever. The only downside is that there are only 10 episodes of Anne trying to get some dragon tail for herself. Hopefully we get some more sometime to see Anne continue her quest."
1254,"I must say, at first it looks like a pretty ordinary shounen anime. It isn't until the 12 temples arc (starts in episode 36) that the story really turns into something else. The first 35 episodes work as a perfect introduction for the main cast, their abilities, their backgrounds, and their motivations to fight. The story doesn't waste time and has a tournament arc as soon as the second episode. After that, our main character fight against several forgettable foes (except the black saints and the silver saints). But, in episode 36, the real Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac magic starts. Seiya, Shiryu, Shun, Hyoga, and Ikki need to cross the 12 Zodiac Temples to save Athena, each temple is protected by a Gold Saint, each representing a Zodiac Sign (Aries, Leo, Virgo, etc). They are the most powerful saints in the world. And after this arc, it just gets better. Our characters go to Asgard to save it from corruption, they fight Poseidon, God of the Sea, and his army, and later on Hades and his army.

The series breaks a lot of stereotypes as well, instead of being dark and gloomy like most anime released at that time, Saint Seiya is filled with color, emotion, and it has its own unique vibe that really makes it stand out.

One of the most impressive aspects of the series is its music, it is easily one of the animes with the best soundtrack in history. With amazing fighting tracks like ""Pegasus Ryu Sei Ken"", ""Glide! Pegasus"", ""Heated Saints"", ""Arrow Of Sun"", ""Saints Of Hope, Forever"" sad songs like ""Sad Brothers"", ""Frey - Hero Of Love And Justice"", ""Save The Goddess"", ""Remember Sadness"" and beautiful songs like ""Abel's Theme"", ""Blue Dream"", and ""Mime's Requiem"". These are the songs composed by Seiji Yokoyama and they really make the series feel alive, making you feel the emotions that the series portrays in a magnificent way. 

The series is also no stranger to gruesome violence, including blood and pain in many episodes, but in a way that it doesn't feel disgusting like other animes, but in a way, that you the viewer is able to see the struggles the characters are having and how big the challenge is for them to overcome.

Overall, Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac is an amazing series that will not waste your time!

“Akihabara. It is a city of dreams, that accepts everything.”

Colorful character designs, a commitment to truly nerdy comedy, a doofy premise, enough product placement to set Karl Marx a-spinning in his grave, more than a few small dashes of the old otaku persecution complex, and more open-hearted sincerity than you might expect. Mix them all together, and you have Akiba’s Trip, a 2017 series nominally based on a game of the same name from the we-animate-anything folks at Studio GONZO. 

img880()

Akiba’s Trip, fundamentally, is a love letter to the city of Akihabara and to otaku culture itself. The bad news is that it has quite a few glaring flaws and how you feel about it is going to heavily involve your tolerance for nerds patting themselves on the back for liking really cool and/or dorky shit. The good news is that Akiba’s Trip itself, while certainly not up to the level of some other anime in this category, is a pretty cool and/or dorky thing. Its finale in particular is far stronger than what might be expected given the series’ mixed reputation.

The series’ plot ostensibly revolves around the comically-named trio Electric Mayonnaise, who defend Akihabara from infected superhumans called “Bagurimono” or “Bugged Outs” depending on whose subs you’re watching. However, for most of its runtime Akiba’s Trip leans heavily on the ‘comedy’ half of the term ‘action-comedy anime’. Most of the series is highly episodic, with each episode featuring our protagonist Tamotsu diving into some esoteric hobby or another, only for it to inevitably lead to conflict with a Bugged Out which he, along with co-stars Matome Mayonaka and Arisa Ahokainen, must defeat. 


Pictured: Tamotsu's younger sister, Arisa, and Matome. Not pictured: Tamotsu.



The content and quality of these episodes varies pretty wildly. Some are quite good: one involves Tamotsu getting caught up in the workaholic subculture of a butler cafe` in a surprisingly sharp piece of commentary. Another involves ham radio and, like many of the best of these episodes, coasts on the simple joy of watching other people geek out about a cool thing they like. That it ends with a tussle with a radio-obsessed Bugged Out who wants to black out the entirety of Akiba almost feels incidental. 


There's also a Yu-Gi-Oh! parody in there somewhere.



Other episodes are, to put it mildly, less great, with an early episode that cracks a lot of downright gross jokes about the female half of our cast being nearly duped into doing porn being by far the worst of the lot. 


Yeah....why?



We also must bring up the show’s near constant shower of fanservice, which is the sort of thing, as with say [Senran Kagura](https://anilist.co/review/5793), that one must take or leave. If you’re bothered by it, you’re not going to like this series, full stop. It doesn’t help that the series’ particular mechanism for doing this--shred a Bugged Out’s clothes and they either revert to normal humans or disappear in a puff of smoke--may remind viewers of the infinitely better Kill la Kill, which is a comparison the series should be striving to avoid at all costs.

The production values are also quite inconsistent, and the show is somewhat infamous for having both quite good and hilariously bad animation at different points--occasionally within the same episode. Some of the aforementioned fanservice parade, in fact, is rendered more laughable than whatever your default opinion may be by the intermittent low drawing quality. 

Another aspect that must be touched on is the absurd amount of product placement in the series. There is a lot of it, and not always for what one might expect. A maid cafe`? That’s about on-brand for a show about the Jerusalem of otakudom. That Carl’s Jr. shows up, more than once, as a place where Matome drowns her sorrows in hamburgers, is such a crass display of selling out that it loops back around into comedic gold. (Is Akihabara known for having a really good Carl’s Jr.? I frankly don’t know, though I kind of doubt it.) 

But all of this is fairly incidental compared to the show’s real strength, which is, believe it or not, its central narrative. Even the best of the more comedic episodes pale in comparison to those where Akiba’s Trip decides to get, well, not serious exactly, but to remember that it is also an action anime, at the very least. Fukame Mayonaka (Matome’s grandmother) and the organization of Metrotica that she controls are the show’s central antagonists, and if I can levy one major complaint against Akiba’s Trip’s pacing, it’s that Fukame gets nowhere near enough screen time. What we do see of her is fascinating, and in the final few episodes her plot to eradicate Akihabara and the humans who live there makes her by far the show’s most interesting villain. 

img880()

But, well, this has its issues too. That old otaku persecution complex rears its ugly head here in a few ways both overt and subtle. The point of Fukame’s character is evidently that she is intended as a metaphor for those who abhor anything they consider abnormal or deviant and who will do anything to get rid of it. Over here in America, we had people who tried to get Doom banned. In Japan, they have prefectural governors who claim anime inspires people to be murderers. The stages are different, the effect much the same. The impulse to be defensive is understandable.

However, when writing a character who operates like this, it’s important to do so with a lot of care, as it’s easy to overshoot and just turn them into a caricature. Fukame herself does not fall here fortunately, but one of her assistants, a greedy ranting government minister who passes a law to ban Akiba itself? Yeah, it’s a little much.

img880() img880()

More than a little much is the show’s clumsy co-opting of Nazi imagery to portray Metrotica’s agents who burn doujins and the like in the show’s closing arc. It is true that the actual Nazis did, in fact, prohibit what they considered to be “degenerate art”, but their true crimes were those of horrific genocide, as were those of Imperial Japan, and to conflate that with this seems somewhere between clueless and downright harmful. The show neglects to explore any deeper connections between these ideologies and what that might say about Japan’s own past. It’s probably far too much to expect something as goofy as Akiba’s Trip to have any genuine insight into how disdain of “the other” can abet and inflame fascism, but it’s not too much to expect the show not to go there if it can’t walk the walk. It strikes more as ill-considered than deliberately inflammatory, but it’s still not really excusable.

The show’s actual finale, then, being as good as it is, is something of a minor miracle. 

img880()

To simply recap it would be to miss the point, but when a series ends on a gorgeously-animated fight between two massive pink energy constructs while an idol song that jacks the melody to freakin’ ”Ode To Joy” pumps along in the background, none of these criticisms suddenly seem like they matter all that much. Obviously, this will vary from person to person, but it is much easier to take Akiba’s Trip on good faith when it ends as well as it does, and the series’ final few moments seem wide-eyedly optimistic in a peculiar, meta way.

The show’s final sequence sees Arisa, as well as Tamotsu’s younger sister, abruptly emerge from a UFO. Frantically, they explain that they come from 100 years in the future, from the Akiba Empire, and they need Tamotsu and Mayonaka’s help.

The show may not be the all-encompassing, open-hearted call for nerd acceptance it entirely wants to be, but however unintentionally, the finale seems to suggest that maybe someday the world will be peaceful enough that we can entertain such ideas. It’s an oddly pure, almost cute, notion for the series to end on, but for all of its flaws, Akiba’s Trip very clearly believes in the promise of Akihabara as a place where everyone is accepted. It is, in this way, a fitting end.

To, then, a future where we may all share our passions in harmony. Somewhere in the city of dreams, they’ll be waiting.

97645,"(This review covers both seasons, though I will count [my pseudo-review for the first season here](https://joyousmenma93.livejournal.com/326778.html) as well, which I won't post here for the sake of brevity.)

I was first introduced to the world of Tales of Zestiria through the anime, when I kept seeing commercials for it on Daisuki.net whenever I watched episodes of Mama Is a Fourth Grader. Since that anime series was testing my patience and getting more and more aggravating (I place the blame entirely on Izumi Shinohara for being such a terrible character), I decided to kick that show to the curb after ten episodes and watch Zestiria The X, hoping it'd be better. The first half of the series was definitely good. Although I didn't play the game at the time (As of this writing, I have), I was impressed with what I saw. The characters, while not the most developed, had really subtle aspects about them that really go against their archetypes and had more personality than just being the generic hero, the tsundere, the peppy girl, etc. The storyline was very interesting, and while I'm not a fan of politics in anything, the political tensions here were easy to understand. The storyline was pretty basic, but it was still very compelling and intense. The battles were epic, but they knew not to go too over the top. The animation was stellar, the character designs are great (Even if some of the characters' outfits are plain stupid. Alisha and Symmone, anyone?), the music is great, and from what I heard, the anime tried to go in a different direction from the game, since the game has a lot of flaws, and managed to improve on things that the game was criticized for, which I wrote about in my original review for it.

Oh, how I wish I could sing these praises for the rest of the anime. Unfortunately, the good parts were only in the first season. The second season...really didn't fare well. Derailing is a big word. However, now that I have more knowledge of the game, that's exactly what the anime does after the end of the first season.

I'm seriously not kidding. Few anime I've seen have ever gone from good to so utterly messed up in a short amount of time. Trust me, I want to like Zestiria's anime adaptation. I really do, because both season do have good qualities about them, though there are far less of them in the second season. However, aside from the animation, the music, and some occasional cute scenes, I honestly can't bring myself to say anything positive about the completely unbalanced and complicated mess that the show devolves into. The storyline is where the second season really suffers, because not only does it completely deviate from the game in ways that make absolutely no sense at all, it could have been written well if the execution hadn't been so ridiculously stupid. By ridiculously stupid, I mean that many of the game's rules, such as dragons being unable to be purified even by the Shepherd, are completely ignored for the sake of simplifying things. Because of this, while I generally try to avoid talking about spoilers in my reviews, I cannot avoid doing so here, as I simply must talk about them in order to convey just how badly the anime messed up in terms of adapting the game for the screen. They will be hidden, though.

!The Pendrago arc in particular really suffered. In the game, the city of Pendrago has endless rain, which is caused by a woman named Cardinal Forton, who became a hellion after taking on too much responsibility after the Pope, Masedra, ran away due to his own being unable to handle being cast out by his family and friends due to ascending to Popehood. She wanted to ascend to Popehood and bring the people together, but she wound up going about it in the worst ways possible, and anyone who tried to approach her was turned to stone permanently. Sorey and friends are unable to purify her because she's too far gone, and doesn't want to be purified, so they have no choice but to kill her. Cardinal Forton is completely cut out of the anime, and what do the anime creators replace her with? A dead dragon! A dead dragon locked in a church overflowing with malevolence is responsible for the endless rain! First of all, this makes absolutely ZERO sense at all. How the heck did a dragon even get inside a church, and for that matter, how the heck did it not completely destroy the shrinechurch in the first place? Something that big could have easily caused serious property damage that everyone could have been able to notice. How did a dead dragon not only get inside there, but NOT cause any kind of property damage whatsoever? Said dragon corpse also has to be purified, which is a big no-no because in the games, fully grown dragons CANNOT be purified. Not even the Shepherd can save them because dragons, which are fully corrupted seraphs, are too corrupted by malevolence to return to their original forms! The anime completely ignores that and allows Sorey and Rose to purify it, along with another dragon, without consequence, which makes no sense!

Also, Cardinal Forton is cut out, but Pope Masedra appears in one scene in the anime and that's it. Honestly...why didn't the creators make Pope Masedra the source of the malevolence in Pendrago in this adaptation? It would have made much more sense than a dead dragon! In the game, Masedra only became the Pope because he was forced to be one, and he never wanted to work for the church. When working in the church caused his family and friends to turn against him, he couldn't take it anymore and ran away, then being taken in by citizens of a village, which he helped to revive, naming it Goddodin and then later became chief/mayor. But in order to help it thrive, he had to resort to making fake Elixirs and doing black market sales in order to generate revenue and prevent Goddodin from going through famine and poverty. Considering his circumstances, it would have made MUCH more sense had the creators made Pope Masedra the source of the malevolence if they were going to give Cardinal Forton the boot. Masedra could have succumbed to his despair and become a hellion, and he could have justified his actions by putting the blame on Pendrago and its citizens for forcing their expectations on him and then blaming him for when things went wrong. That would have been a much more compelling and more plausible alternate explanation for the malevolence in Pendrago. But instead, the creators just throw in a random dead dragon for the sake of convenience! Why? I don't get it!

Also, Alisha is SOMEHOW able to armatize, just like Sorey. Uhhh...what? Okay, I know she's Sorey's Squire, but she never needed to armatize with any of the seraphs in order to hold her own in a fight. Both the game and anime go out of their way to show that she's a good, strong female character who can stand own her own even when she's at her most vulnerable and make the most out of her bad situation, even when the odds are against her. But not only does her being able to armatize make ZERO sense and comes right the heck out of nowhere, it completely invalidates and nullifies everything she's done in the anime as of that point. There's no explanation provided for it at all. I know I once said that Rose being able to armatize made no sense, but recent events and the prequel game Tales of Berseria have tried to offer explanations for that which make far more sense (I don't know how true this is, but Rose is said to be the descendant of the first Shepherd, a girl named Eleanor Hume, one of the main characters of Berseria, who was able to both see and armatize with seraphs/malaks).

And don't even get me STARTED on how they adapted the Camlann subplot. Sorey and Mikleo's role in the story is completely cut out, which makes their becoming Shepherd and Sub Lord almost feel completely cliche, stripping away the significance that the two have as main characters. It makes Sorey feel like just another cardboard cut-out chosen one who's destined to save the world from the evil lord of darkness, and the final battle where Sorey SOMEHOW manages to armatize with ALL OF THE SERAPHS AT ONCE, WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE GAME, is especially poorly executed in that there's basically no significance to it at all. Also, outright spoiling Maotelus's true identity? Really? What good did that do?!

In doing so, the characters are either pushed into the background, not able to do much of anything, or are wildly inconsistent. Rose can't seem to decide whether she wants to be an assassin or not even though she's lived among assassins her whole life. Alisha is given far too much spotlight. Now don't get me wrong, I like Alisha. I really do. She's a good character. However, I think the anime creators shot themselves in the foot with giving her so much spotlight. By giving Alisha so much screentime, they wound up giving the other characters the shaft and not allowing them to shine, especially Sorey, who's THE FUCKING MAIN CHARACTER. Lunarre is just as pointless as ever, still having zero purpose other than to eat Mason and give the characters a hard time. And don't even get me started on how they completely butchered Symmone and Mayvin.

For the record though, I'd still watch Alisha over someone like Tagiru from Digimon Xros Wars 2 or Shinji/Paul from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. At least Alisha is NICE and ISN'T a raging, abhorrent dickhole!

However, personally, I think Zestiria The X's biggest flaw is the fact that it tried to shoehorn in Berseria into it's plot. Because this is Zestiria, NOT Berseria. Yes, Berseria is the prequel, and that's fine. But the creators could have made more of an effort to integrate its lore into Zestiria's storyline more gracefully than it tried to do here. One of the common complaints against Zestiria's game is that it didn't do enough worldbuilding, and many of the game's lore was left unexplored, which Berseria expanded upon without feeling like you needed to play Zestiria in order to understand it. Both Zestiria and Berseria, even with their connections, were able to stand on their own as individual games, and didn't need to suck on each other's dicks in order to stand out. The anime tried to mash them together and wound up adding too many ingredients, therefore overcomplicating the dish. This is clearly a case of too many chefs spoil the soup. The fact that the series was restricted to two 11-13 episode seasons only amplifies these flaws even more in that there's so little balance that the pacing is completely shot, and the creators clearly threw in stuff just for the sake of throwing stuff into the anime, which doesn't work.

Tales of Zestiria the X is a prime example of how execution can either make or break a show. The reason people aren't too fond of Sailor Moon Crystal is that it stays TOO close to the source material, not letting itself breathe or try anything new. Zestiria The X has the opposite problem, where it completely deviates from the game and makes changes that make no sense. I get it, adaptations have to make changes, but those changes also have to make sense not only in the context of the story, but in the format it takes as well. Obviously video games are no stranger to adaptations, especially bad adaptations. But there are genuinely good adaptations of media out there: The live-action Sailor Moon series did its own thing while improving on the flaws of the original, even if it did have its own flaws, but the positives more than made up for it. The manga adaptation of Zestiria, from what I hear, tells the story MUCH better, and with it having come out, I intend to see for myself.

I really don't want to complain about Zestiria The X. I really don't. Honestly, if you tried to make me choose between this and something like Breadwinners or Kanokon, I'd gladly take Zesty The X any day. However, its many flaws cannot be ignored, and had it been given more episodes, more leeway, and had more competent staff behind it, the anime could have been genuinely good. It's a shame. I will say this though: It's still far better than every single ecchi anime that has plagued the anime industry over the past several decades, and I still watch it sometimes."

In a season devoid of major romcoms, no one expected an ordinary office romance to pop off this hard, but it did. Wotakoi fans rejoice. Romance fans rejoice. Those specific ass people who can't get through generic love stories in a high school setting anymore ... Rejoice! Because what we have here is a clear-cut representation of a mature and healthy relationship, without the need of any bullshit drama.

webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/KonoSuki-OP1.webm)


KonoSuki is a simple story about two lovers secretly dating at their job. When the papers are piled up and their eyes just happen to meet during the busy hours, all they do is fight. However, when the lights shut off and the sheets cover up, they're unable to resist embracing one another's souls. It can't be helped. This is just how the other workers are used to seeing them, so it makes sense to hide their true feelings by acting as they always have. If you hate witnessing them annoying romcom tropes, I doubt you'd have any problems with this one, since the premise can't really be called far-fetched. 

img600()


Lemme provide you a breath of fresh air, different from the exaggerated shit you endured when watching those school romcoms. It's better to explain afterwards, so I'll just give an example rn:

img600()

Masugu wanted to surprise Yui by buying her a gift and taking her to a fancy restaraunt for their 6-month anniversary. Yui happened to see him wandering around after he had reluctantly lied to her about staying home in order to set up the preparations. This was an issue because Masugu and Yui never ever lied to each other. Yui not wanting to doubt his partner, tried to figure out what was going on with him. She trusted him so much that it felt unusual when he started hiding something. Yui being the wife-material she is, directly confronted Masugu and urged him to explain the situation (she waited a few days too). Masugu was hesitant at first, but his priority immmmeeeeediately changed after the secret began to visibly hurt Yui... So, the fancy restaraunt ended up being fully booked and the gift got revealed before the date. And then they fucked

!img600()!

Like, seriously, when was the last time you saw the main couple of a romance have intercourse within the first two episodes. DOMESTIC GIRLFRIEND WAS YOUR LAST TIME, RIGHT? This must be because of the Seinen demograph cuz ain't no way. They made it romantic as shit too. I ain't see no fan service, no nothing. Just two heartfelt individuals embracing each other's physical bodies and souls. (aight I'm not getting into this)


Here's what I absolutely adore about this show the most. The two set realistic goals for themselves to accomplish. They supported each other's work projects to the fullest, whilst also making time for their own. Heck, they even made a bet for motivational purposes. When Yui was stressed out and quite obviously frustrated due to the lack of progress in her project, Masugu let her know that even though he may not be able to physically help her complete it, he would be there. Sometimes, that's all you gotta do. Stay by their side and believe that everything will work out. I see why so many women are into this man. This absolute chad of a male constantly notices the emotions his partner is feeling and acts accordingly- without hesitation. Admit it. Y'all like it when the male lead ain't an incel, right? Of course, you do.

img600(
img600()

These two are able to set boundaries. They're able to distinguish between their love life and their jobs, which is where the premise comes in handy too. A healthy, grown-up couple striving for self-improvement, supporting each other's objectives, providing each other's needs. A good-looking thoughtful dude and a realistically-proportioned gorgeous woman, expressing their romantic desires in a hidden manner, simultaneously being the biggest green flags in existence. What more do you need from a slice-of-life romance? SOL enjoyers. Look me dead in the eyes and tell me ts wasn't gas. I dare you.


I did not expect this type of casual romance anime to be as good as it is. Going as far as getting into my Top 15 favourite romance anime oat. Cmon. If you read my review and watched the show, you understand why I'm favouring it this much. Ever since I acknowledged the quality of this show (around ep 4-5), everytime a new episode came out, I couldn't help but imagine what my own relationship as a working adult would be like. Aye, maybe I could learn a thing or two from this show (abt productivity and a healthy rel). As for the rating, ig somewhere between a 7 to an 8 will suffice. 

Btw: I don't know if it was always like that or was it because of the adaptation, but the romance between Somei and Hayakawa could've been better executed. I think there were people who preferred to watch their progress over the main leads', so it's quite unfortunate. Maybe it's better (more well-paced and more is shown) in the manga though. There probably won't be a 2nd season anyways, so why not move on to the source material?

And now, here's a vibe of an ED from a new artist by the name of [pachae ](https://anilist.co/staff/343890/pachae). His voice is so vibey and majestic that I thought he was the singer for Comedy (Spy X Family Ed 1) at first. Show some love.

Jun’s closed-off heart gets violently shaken from its safe bounds by the arrival of Shinku, a doll imbued with life and magic. A most-unwelcome addition to Jun’s household, she is not merely the harbinger of the Alice Game and its deadlier consequences; she is the bringer of a kind of counter-brusqueness to Jun’s own brusqueness. Impatient and commanding, she has her own fair share of worries, for which she must be mindful. Especially considering that the players in the Alice Game are already trying to hunt her down, she must make a pact with Jun to become his master, and he her servant so that she can make the most of her powers.

Shinku’s presence, as well as the other caravan of dolls that enter the fray (if not through Jun’s window by crashing into it violently), both bring the action to the story and provide enough digression to allow things to settle down for a brief moment and breathe. The Rozen Maidens are a blend of aristocratic panache and childlike—if not outright childish—intrigue and enthusiasm. While they may be there primarily to fight, not every moment in the series can be chock full of action, and the action moments that do exist within it are working with some animation limitations. Therefore, Rozen Maiden allows more slice-of-life mini-plots and the occasional running gag to dial things back. As the cast expands ever larger and all occupy Jun’s room for themselves, it’s inevitable that such personalities would butt heads over things. 





As the material makes clear however, nearly everyone houses something within their hearts that they would rather look away from or not confront. With each new battle in the Alice Game, a little more perspective on all these matters unveils itself. One cannot run from their problems forever, otherwise they themselves could find their entire happiness or outlook akin to an abandoned or broken doll; any beauty that there might have been within is faded and unrecognizable. Hence why Nori so laments what Jun has become, and despite her mindfulness of needing to give him space, she acquiesces with an enabling hospitality that Jun frankly doesn’t deserve in the hope that he may, finally, return to the happier self he once was. It might be tempting to blame Nori for making things worse, but she never could have expected to effectively function as a surrogate mother.

A história conta a rotina de um garoto que se considerava o melhor da sua cidade nós fliperamas (videogames). Um certo dia, ele encontra-se com uma garota de sua idade que, até então, parecia ser superior na questão de habilidades nós jogos. Sendo assim, encontrando uma rival a sua altura. Nessa tal rivalidade, encontrando-se uma bela amizade. A obra mostra o desenvolvimento dos dois personagens e a forma que isso é construído. 

- Os protagonistas. 

A relação desses dois é muito bem construída. Tanto romântica, tanto como amigos. Haruo, um garoto do fundamental despreocupado e que parecia aproveitar muito bem seu tempo como criança. Não era focado muito nós estudos e passava a maior parte do tempo jogando videogame (fliperama). Em um dia normal, como todos dos outros, Haruo foi na locadora que habitualmente ia. Considerava-se o melhor jogador, até esse dia. Havia encontrado um oponente digno, mas espere... É uma garota! Após isso, Haruo decidir viver para um dia ser tão bom quanto aquela garota misteriosa (que agora é sua rival). A construção e evolução de uma laço afetivo, a partir desse encontro, é muito bem feita. Os diálogos, as interações, a forma que aqueles dois personagens agem, parece tão natural. Você consegue sentir um verdadeiro sentimento de afeto emocional vindo dos dois. Muitas obras de romance, tendem a fazer uma relação muito forçada. Os personagens acabaram de se conhecer e, não depois de muito tempo, acabam já a demonstrar um certo afeto amoroso (??). No caso, não acontece em High score Girl. Até o dia que o protagonista decide aceitar que aquela garota não é mais uma rival e sim a pessoa que ele ama, demora. Não é algo as pressas, como muitas obras de romance tendem a fazer. Por isso, ao meu ver, essa obra já merece muito pontos comigo.

- A introdução de uma rival amorosa. 

A Hidaka tem um papel mais importante do que ser uma rival amorosa. Hidaka conhece o Haruo no ensino médio, depois da partida de Oono do Japão. Ela se interessa pelo Haruo, após ver seu vício em videogames. Assim, sempre que tinha chance, ela o observava jogar. Hidaka se encaixa no tipo de personagem que eu havia dito anteriormente. Acabou apaixonando-se bem rápido. Por mais que no início ela não soubesse direito o que era, estava bem óbvio suas intenções. Depois que a Oono voltou para o Japão, Hidaka percebeu o porquê aquele jovem viciados em jogos não lhe dava tanta atenção e é isto que eu mais gosto desse protagonista. Mesmo depois da Oono ter ido embora, ele não esqueceu dela e continuou a pensar nela como uma rival, preso nisso. Mesmo Hidaka deixando bem óbvio que sentia algo por ele, Haruo parecia não ligar. Ele apenas queria derrotar sua rival e ficar ao lado dela. Viveu todos aqueles anos pensando nisso. Hidaka percebeu que a relação daqueles dois era diferente e distante ao que ela tinha. Ela é uma personagem que mostra os verdadeiros sentimentos do protagonista. Ele amava a Oono (por mais que constantemente dissesse que aquele sentimento era apenas uma rivalidade) e não queria estar do lado dela apenas para ter relações sexuais ou satisfazer-se como homem, ele queria estar porquê simplesmente adorava o sentimento que era estar ao lado de sua ""rival"". Ele pensava com o cérebro e não com seu órgão reprodutor masculino.

- Nota da obra. 

Como eu havia dito, essa análise é mais minha visão pessoal. Não sou nem um tipo de analista profissional. Realmente gostei muito de acompanhar essa belíssima obra. Foi a primeira no qual eu realmente sentir afeto entre os personagens ao invés de puro prazer sexual. Para mim, High score Girl merece um 10 pelos os personagens, pelo o desenvolvimento, pela a forma que ele retrata as relações humanas. Sem dúvidas, se você ainda não viu a história, recomendo que veja. Uma obra que ensina de uma forma simples e meiga sobre o que é realmente amar. Algo que nunca tinha visto em nem uma obra. Minha experiência assistindo a tal, foi magnífica. Chega até ser difícil explicar com palavras a forma que me sentir assistindo tal obra. Como eu disse anteriormente, é uma história que merece muito um pouco do seu tempo.

- Conclusão. 

Bem, acho que termino aqui. Quero novamente exaltar o fato de, tudo isso, ser apenas minha visão pessoal. Como outro ser vivo pensante, tem o direito de concordar ou não em respeito ao meu modo de pensar. Foi realmente maravilhoso acompanhar essa obra nipônica que tem como o tema principal o amor. Novamente me despeço. Espero que tenha gostado da leitura e até um outro dia, suponho.

This review was originally written in July 2021, published as a YouTube video on my channel.

webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/TenkuuNoEscaflowne-OP1.webm)

Kanzaki Hitomi, a fortunetelling girl on a high school track team, has a crush on a boy named Susumu Amano. One day, she asks him to give her her first kiss if she can complete a sprint in a certain time. Before she can complete the challenge, a portal to another world opens, with a boy and a dragon coming through and battling each other. Hitomi has a macabre premonition about the dragon killing the boy, and uses that to help the boy, named Van, kill the dragon instead. After that, she and Van are pulled through another portal to Van’s home world, Gaea, where both the moon and Earth are in the sky. While on Gaea, Hitomi and Van find themselves dragged into a large-scale military conflict that will cross magic, mechs, and swords with the Zaibach Empire. At the center are the mysterious Dornkirk and Folken of Zaibach, while Hitomi, Van, their friends and allies, and Van’s mech, Escaflowne, resist them.

The overall conflict takes place in a war, but the series is not dominated by action. In part because the story had to be compacted and the actual plot left largely unchanged, if there’s no action going on, then there’s romance to develop! No romance going on? There’s political gamesmanship at play! No political gamesmanship at play? There’s mythology to explore! No mythology to explore? There’s Folken and Dornkirk wondering what to do next. Vision of Escaflowne rarely sits down twiddling its thumbs; there is always something happening in the story even in its slower moments. Because of the nature by which all the elements factor into one another, each event that occurs carries with it importance and consequences for both the heroes and the villains.

And the heroes and villains together make for a wonderful blend of personalities and motivations. Both Van’s allies and the Zaibach Empire feature many characters that come across as either well-developed, or having strong enough personalities to carry their scenes and the overall narrative. Therefore, most characters and their roles are fascinating to see unfold. Dilandau is a wonderfully-sadistic character, Folken is mysterious, and Allen throws some great wrenches into the political and romantic aspects. Merle might stand out as the only character in the series who I can honestly say that I didn’t like too much, with her attachment to Van and antagonistic attitude towards Hitomi getting tiresome early. Thankfully, her actual role in the military conflict is pretty inconsequential, so when things get particularly hair-raising, she’s not too much of a bother.

The story in Vision of Escaflowne revolves around the show’s main theme of destiny, which while in and of itself is nothing new, is given a refreshing shift in how fate actually factors into the plot. Headed by Dornkirk, the Zaibach Empire’s main goal lies in using its unusual Destiny Prognostication Engine and other similar devices, working towards a future where there is no more war on Gaea, no matter how many people or cities need to be destroyed in order to achieve that end. As a gifted fortuneteller on Earth, Hitomi’s capabilities translate to using her pendulum, tarot cards, and prophesizing to foresee consequences, often dire ones. The series thus frames its military conflict against these two competing vehicles for changing fate. The actions taken by each side, either consciously or unconsciously, seek to create what they each perceive as a better future. As the series goes on and we eventually begin to understand precisely how fate is impacted by the characters’ deeds and thoughts, it makes for a compelling drama.

It’s because Hitomi’s powers are intimately tied to the conflict that she is, thankfully, a main protagonist who gets involved rather than simply being a damsel in distress. Because she keeps seeing visions of death or destruction, she takes an active role in helping Van and the citizens of Gaea survive Zaibach’s assaults. When Van is fighting with Escaflowne against the other mechs, called Guymelefs, she is sometimes right there by his side aiding him, or has done something that gives Van more of a fighting chance. Not to mention that there are times where she doesn’t put up with anyone’s attitude, which was so satisfying to see. Even one of her earlier defining traits gets referenced on occasion; her abilities as a runner come in handy, with one seriously-epic moment of her jumping across a giant chasm in a horribly-underappreciated scene for a female anime character.

Such moments are not limited to Hitomi, but are also shared throughout the series with its action scenes. The mid-90s aesthetic might move and appear rougher compared to the more-modern sakuga, but the overall sense of tension and thrills permeate. Watching Escaflowne slash its way through enemies was always great to see, and the series does not relent on showing some violent moments that, while bloody, never cross the line into gratuitousness. The music that plays throughout the anime, both during the action scenes and outside of them, was brilliantly handled with a plethora of styles utilized. The “Escaflowne chant” was delightfully haunting, while some battle music excellently enhances the weight of each encounter. 

As much as I loved Vision of Escaflowne, it does have one noteworthy issue – its ending. The drama, though dense in its compressed timeframe, never felt like it got out of hand, as learning more about the world of Gaea and the characters personally, mythologically, and militaristically never tired me out. A combination of both short skirmishes and longer, more-grueling battles gave variety to the pace. In brief, I felt that most of the show was not terribly impacted by the reductions. But, unfortunately, it is not true for the ending. While the show may not necessarily add new plot threads that need to be resolved at the last-minute, there are still a few too many left to tie up. With only two episodes to get it done, the series hits fast-forward by having some of the final events and revelations come far too quickly and breeze by, leaving the show frenetic in its climax and resolution. For this particular time, however, it did not bother me nearly as much as it potentially could have. 

Though rushed, it does serve as a worthwhile thematic conclusion to the series, bringing into perspective some of the overarching themes the series was attempting to convey, and even still managed to pull off some great portions nonetheless. As much as the ending might potentially come off as hokey, it was not nearly as infuriating for me as it possibly could have been. Your mileage will most-definitely vary on whether the rushed ending will cause the previous twenty-four episodes to feel like a waste of buildup, and truthfully, I fault no one for saying that it spoiled their enjoyment of the show. I’ll let you judge for yourself, but it was something too important to go unmentioned.

Vision of Escaflowne takes the numerous features of the fantastical and weaves them together into a slow, but always moving, tale. If the isekai genre has tired you out, I would consider putting this series on your list. By dispensing with the usual power fantasy and taking so much time to create imperfect characters, engaging battles, political intrigue, and magical elements, it moves with a level of escalating grace that injects life into the story. It may somewhat botch the ending and not answer every lingering question, but even in its stumble, I can largely forgive it for providing a wealth of fantastic moments, such that it left me ultimately satisfied with the overall experience. One final note to bring up – while I don’t normally comment on something like this, I recommend avoiding the original English dub of the show. It has not aged well. To get the most out of the experience, see either the more-recent Funimation dub or the subtitled version.

20496,"This anime made absolutely no sense, from Episode 1 you will have no idea what is happening. You never get an explanation and the story... well there isn't one? I'm not sure. The main character is the weakest person in the entire show, that being said the ""strongest"" the leader of zvezda absolutely needs his ""power"" which again is never explained and also doesn't exist. Almost every episode will have a battle scene where every enemy is a storm trooper that wen't to ""the academy of bullets that only hit the ground"" not only do enemies never hit there target but the battle always ends the same, zvezda pulls out some Super secret weapon, or ability, or robot, or new character, or... anything that can be explained by ""that's the power of zvezda!"". The characters never develop (Well maybe the main character finally realizes that he actually thinks thoughts and has a brain) and the plot never appears, we just get told that the world is going to be conquered, even that's a lie. I gave this show a 6/10 because I enjoyed the art and the different characters to an extent but most of all it was because I shipped Asuta and Renge. Too bad Asuta want's the loli that does nothing but use him instead, gotta appeal to the lolicons I guess otherwise this show would have been rated a 2/10 overall. There's not a lot of good points to make about this anime. if you like random no point anime shows then this is for you, if you like a plot, good character progression, or a reason other than ""this might look cool"", then this show isn't for you. I thought this anime could have potential at the start so I kept watching but in the end it was just a boring ending where they ""win"" and go back to fighting more enemies to conquer the world. I was hoping that maybe in the end that Kate finished her goal and evaporated and left Renge and Asuta together but sadly it goes on. As a quick side not I might actually enjoy this anime if literally ANYTHING was explained but nothing ever was. This show might have taken a spot for one of my lowest rated shows if it wasn't saved by the fact that Renge is probably the best clueless character right after anyone else trying to hide there identity in this show."
153,"It is common nowadays to open Youtube or any side of the Internet and see a recurrent complaint in the hero and fantasy genres: There is no character development. Critics say that many characters in modern media are overpowered in some sort of way. Maybe they are presented as perfect personality-wise from the start, and they cross their adventure obliterating anything before them without a lesson or something that makes them grow. And if, for some reason they are flawed, they will never grow despite living through many events and life-changing experiences. The same flawed person that starts in Point A is the same that reaches Point B. There is no growth; there is no maturity. We can see that in anime as well.

Let me introduce you to ""Juuni Kokuki"" or ""The Twelve Kingdoms"", a series that aims to challenge the current status quo of overpowered characters that never fail and never experience a situation that makes them grow, as well as the contemporary perception of isekai.



I know many people will hear the term ""isekai"" and roll their eyes after what SAO and its spawns have done to the genre. But this story treats the isekai genre a bit more maturely, avoiding being boring or stale; there is no reincarnation or any modern trope, as seen in the current scene. At first glance, our main character is ""kidnapped"" to this new world. A world that has nothing to do with an imaginary medieval or post-medieval Europe. Instead, this new world takes inspiration from the pre-Sengoku era in Japan with solid elements of the Three Kingdoms era of China. Several new elements completely flesh out this setting, like a monarchy system protected by the will of the gods and dense and complex lore. In many places, this is a perk despite being too overbearing for new individuals trying to get familiar with this setting.

But the principal and foremost reason why this series is as unique as it is, is the presentation and growth of its main character, Youko. In the paper, Youko plays the role of the underdog who climbs the rank of the heroine of this story. But, unlike other series, the underdog is truly a character that lives up to that name. Insecure, low self-esteem, a character willing to lie to gain the approval of the rest... Youko is genuinely a person who does not seem to be the main character of any story and arguably is not even likeable at first. But, slowly, the story puts her in situations where her preconceptions and ideas are brought down to the floor, even her self-esteem. Still, all these opportunities are chances for her to grow and be a better person, not only in the emotional sense of her relationships with her peers and others but also a better person in front of the roles that life and destiny put in her way. And this transformation does not happen overnight. It happens slowly, and you see Youko falling to the floor many times until she learns to stand on her two feet and see straight into the horizon.



Such a unique way to show character development and growth is so rare (at least from my perspective) that it elevates this series to be one of its kind (again, from my point of view). And may I add that this happens not only with Youko, our main character but with others along the way, such as Suzu, Shoukei and more, even with dislikeable characters. And here is another achievement for this series, not all likeable characters and favourites start as likeable characters; their growth made them likeable. This is huge and not common in the fantasy genre. Witnessing the journey taken by any character from Point A to Point B is a treat. Any failure and fall to the floor is an opportunity for them to grow. Of course, some characters start at Pont A being extremely likeable, but they support our main characters' transformations. It's truly a worthy experience to witness.



To close this idea, the plot and storytelling are exceptionally good in presenting true underdogs that will grow... committing mistakes and falling to the ground as many times as necessary for them to grow and mature compellingly and naturally.

To close the positives, the lore and world are unique. Despite the East Asian inspiration, the music and folklore are so engaging that it takes a character on their own. Sometimes the lore can overwhelm the viewer, but at the end of the day, many strange concepts are mentioned so frequently that the viewer will be able to grasp the important ones and, little by little, start to get used to the other ones. My advice for new watchers is to go with the flow and not stress over the thousand names that will be mentioned... the storytelling is smart enough to repeat the important ones!

The world also benefits from the wonderful storytelling. Along the journey, the viewer will meet many characters along many of the Twelve Kingdoms in such a presentation that any of them can be the main character of their own little story. What I mean by this is that side characters have an appeal on their own. Even despite being present for a couple of episodes or less, they feel complex, they feel like living their own problems and objectives to achieve, and that is amazing; it adds depth, and as I said, any fan can theorise or imagine a fanfic focusing in any of them.



Not everything is perfect; I may cite as negatives the animation that clearly hasn't aged well after these decades. Early digital animation has a peculiar style that some may forgive, but others will take as kryptonite. Some sound cues also show their age. In sum, the animation quality and sound were proper of its era, for better or worse. Worry not that the small action scenes are well presented in this series despite being a couple of decades after its premiere. Let's say that this series is aware of its budget and strategically chooses what moments of action will take for a better presentation.

Another negative may be the way the series stops because any viewer will tell at the end that the will was to continue despite its sudden interruption but worry not that the main characters will have closure for their storylines. Or better said, the main characters will experience a high point in their journeys that can leave satisfied any viewer invested in them. Sadly some minor plotlines will remain open at the lack of continuation of this masterpiece. As this series presents events in arcs, the series will conclude after a complete arc, but there is still the feeling of an intended continuation from the people behind this project.

I recommend this series to anyone searching for a fantasy series within a unique world and for actual character development and growth. These two main selling points are so unique that they deserve a perfect score on my part.



Thank you for reading! ^^"

My first encounter with this anime was way too ironic. I checked the seasonal anime on Crunchyroll to find some I could watch. Then I discovered this anime and read through the plot summary. It did sound boring to me, so I didn't watch it. Then someday, when I was bored and searched for something to watch, I discovered this anime again and started watching. I fell in love with it at first sight and it's my absolute favorite. I know this review is going to be super subjective, but I don't care about that, because I want to share my feelings about this anime with everyone.

Story

The story of this anime is extremely adorable. It follows two girls, who want to find an asteroid and join the Earth Sciences Club. It is perfectly written as it progresses slowly in the start to get a feeling for the characters and their goals. The story develops so much, that you won't believe its only 12 Episodes. It has great arcs for every main character and some side characters so that you are satisfied and can't think about anyways it could've been better. 

Characters

The Characters are each individual and have different aspects to offer. First, we have Mira Konohata, who seems to be an airhead, but is actually really empathic and has the right things to say in important moments. Ao Manaka is a quiet character, who is very introverted, but can get very passionate about things she likes, such as astronomy. Then we have Mikage Sakurai, who loves geology and seems to be really mean, but is a very nice person, who has problems to show it. Mari Morino is a person, who is very helpful and seems to be really wisely about a lot of things. At last, we have Mai Inose, who is a very nice and open-minded person, who wants to help everyone. The characters are interacting in a way that I haven't seen a lot. They are helping each other and gather some interest in the other subject.

Music 

There is not much to say about music. The soundtrack is just awesome with a great Opening by Nao Touyama and a really good Ending by Minori Suzuki. The instrumental songs are really good too as they increase the feeling you have in each scene. The music fits every mood perfectly and increases your hype even more.

Visuals

The anime has a wonderful art style and great animation. It is really detailed and you feel good looking at it. The colors are well-chosen, especially when you look at the eyes, which are perfect, due to the decent coloring.

Conclusion 

This is a perfect anime for me. All aspects are absolutely appealing to me. I can understand when people don't like this anime because everyone has a different taste. But I would recommend giving it a shot because it is so different than the majority of ''Cute Girls Doing Cute Things'' anime.

This is my first review so don't be too hard with me and it surely has a lot of grammar mistakes. I am going to write more reviews to improve my writing.

Have a nice day :D"
20881,"In terms of story, Heavy Object is pretty bare bones. The main premise is somewhat unique since instead of focusing on Object battles it instead focuses on the main characters Qwenther and Havia defeating a variety of different Objects without using an object and instead using careful planning, tactics and some split-second decisions. Because this premise is filled with infinite possibilities the whole anime is split into different arcs about 2-3 episodes long each focusing on Qwenther and Havia dealing with a different Object. Because of that it could have been a show that got boring after the first half but thanks to the light-hearted tone and funny characters nothing in this show ever drags at all and the episodes fly by pretty fast. I’m glad they do since there are a few episodes were almost nothing happens. There is also a bit of an overarching plot dealing with another group of Object users but it isn’t really that interesting and major stuff doesn’t happen a lot with it. Overall Heavy Object does a decent job in the story department and you get what you would expect from an arc based light novel adaption. 

The words run of the mill might come up a lot in this review and never is this more apparent than with the characters. The two main characters Qwenther and Havia not only have very silly names but are also very, here it is again, run of the mill. They are your average action show duo: ones got the brains and the other got the brawn (or to be more specific, the ability to fire a gun). While they may be generic they are never boring to watch. They both have good chemistry with each other and have some pretty funny moments. It’s never a dull moment with Qwenther and Havia which is a good thing since they made a potentially boring anime into an enjoyable one. Other than Qwenther and Havia the only other characters (apart from a couple reoccurring villains) that appear throughout the show are the Object Pilot Melinda and Qwenther and Havia’s strict commanding officer, the crazily named Frolaytia Capistrano. 

Contrary to the previous sections of this review, Heavy Object achieves something other than run of the mill in its sound. It achieves above average. This is mainly due to the forgettable soundtrack and first Ending but the main reason is for its dub and the two openings. The openings One More Chance and Never Gave Up by the band ALL-OFF were not only a great choice for this anime but they also fit Heavy Object surprisingly well. They are two very good openings and One More Chance is good enough to have a spot in my Top 50 Anime Openings. The second Ending is also nice to listen to as well. Now let’s talk about the best part of this anime in my opinion: the dub. Before I watched this anime I knew immediately that I would watch this in dub not only because it is dubbed by the best dubbing company around, Funimation but it also has a really good voice cast. Justin Briner who is one of Funimation’s newcomers voices Qwenther and does a really good job and he really fits the character. Micah Solusod voices Havia and also does a really great job. It’s also nice to hear Alexis Tipton and Morgan Garret’s voices as Melinda and Hot Fan Service Girl (Frolaytia) respectively. No voice actor does a bad performance in this dub, but that’s to be expected with any Funimation dub and it’s always great to see Funimation using their newcomers so much which makes me excited for any of their further roles. 

This is where it goes a bit downhill. Even though this anime is animated by J.C. Staff who are one of my favorite studios the animation in this show isn’t that great. The action scenes are pretty good and the CG isn’t terrible but the show has one of the ugliest and bland color schemes I’ve seen in a recent anime. Bright colors are used but they all feel washed out and are not very pleasant to look at. The character designs are also uninteresting and very bland and simple. Granted the show isn’t unwatchable by any means but it’s just not the best to look at most of the time. So instead of average the animation is slightly below average which is unfortunate since if the animation was nice it would have been another positive to the show. 

Average is the best word I can come up with when talking about Heavy Object. But it’s not average in a bad way since this is a really fun anime to watch. Despite its flaws I had a good time when watching it and while it’s no contender for Best Anime of 2016 it deserves at least an honorable mention since while it does have many minuses, the pluses outweigh it enough you to give this show a watch. It’s a 24 episode thrill-ride with a crazy premise and a solid execution."
142701,"I love supernatural mysteries and supernatural stuff in general. I especially love the specific subcategory, where people go to a shop or a hotel or something to have their problems solved. I don't care if its' dark or lighthearted, completely episodic or if there's an overarching plot. Raven in the Inner Palace looked like it would be my type of show, especially with the gorgeous aesthetics, and I am so glad I wasn't wrong.

Deep within the inner palace, the mysterious Raven Consort lives. She may be a consort, but she doesn't serve the emperor, and instead she is fabled to hold a host of supernatural powers and is the subject of many rumors. The Raven Consort can take on any request, be it finding lost things or inflicting painful curses. The current emperor approaches Shouxue, the current Raven Consort with a supernatural case which requires her to step outside of the inner palace. Little do the emperor and Shouxue know, but this will be the beginning of a great change. Shouxue has been taught to desire nothing and remain alone as the Raven Consort, but she finds herself forming bonds with others.

I loved this anime. I enjoyed each and every mystery and how many of them tied to both Shouxue and the emperor's pasts, as well as the lore of the world. Shouxue's character growth over the course of the mystery as she learns how to properly interact with others. I was expecting this to be an episodic mystery series with an emphasis on Shouxue's growth as a person. In my mind, it was going to be something along the lines of Natsume's Book of Friends. However, there was a deeper plot involving the origins of the Raven Consort and her relationship with the emperor. I'm very curious to see how this pans out in the future, since this didn't adapt the whole story. Going into the series, I wasn't expecting to want to keep up with the LNs, but, after I finished it, I wanted to buy them once they're officially released this year. I'd also like to see more about the characters' pasts and how they were shaped, since I found the backstories shown to be very compelling.

I adored Shouxue. She was very endearing to me, since she's very quiet and introverted, but she's also feisty and independent. She lacks the proper social skills and has a harder time understanding people's emotions due to being isolated for almost her entire life. However, she shows a lot of compassion towards others and actively tries to help people. Gaojun, the emperor, I didn't like as much. He was very serious, likely due to his childhood trauma. I just never got a feel for who he was as a person. However, for some reason it didn't bother me as much. I have a feeling that he will get explored a bit more if there is a second season. Jiujiu, Shouxue's lady in waiting, was also a fun character to watch. I found her cheerful and stubborn personality to be compelling. As for the eunuchs, Onkei, Eisei, and Tankai, they didn't stand apart from each other very much. Tankai was more of a background character, but he seemed to have potential to be a charismatic character if given more screentime. Onkei and Eisei I got mixed up, and I only can tell them apart because Onkei has a scar and wears green, while Eisei wears black. I found Eisei's backstory to be interesting, but I wish the two characters had more personality to set them apart.

There wasn't much romance, which made me relieved since the emperor didn't have enough personality to stand on his own, and instead it built more on a platonic relationship. I genuinely think having them develop character chemistry as friends was the right step. It allows them to learn to rely on each other and figure out what they like about each other. I think this might just be me liking natural slow burns, though.

The aesthetics were beautiful and impeccable. The color palettes and outfits were beautiful, and the atmosphere really captured Chinese court life. It reminded me a bit of The Apothecary Diaries. The women in the series have such beautiful and distinct character designs. Shouxue and Jiujiu have such lovely, recognizable designs. However, the male characters suffer from same face syndrome. I had a hard time telling the eunuchs apart, and Gaojun had the same face as most of them. It could get confusing, but at least I always knew which one was Gaojun.

I had a great time with this series, and I feel like it was one of the strongest shoujo anime of 2022. If you like supernatural mysteries, historical dramas, or even just pretty art, I strongly recommend this series. I was expecting to enjoy it, but I was surprised by just how much. I actually didn't know much about LN's for women until these recent adaptations, and series like Raven of the Inner Palace are compelling me to check them out."
146954,"Hol' up I gotta put on some Free Tempo for this one. Rubs Hands Together ALRIGHT! This second season is LEAGUES better than the first season in almost every department. Which at first seems like it should be a positive, but the problem is they decided to forget that it was the second season and get back to the first season's antics but worse! I think the reason why I want to explain this so much in detail is because when this show does something well, it does it REALLY well. But it's just so painful to watch those peaks followed by the lowest of lows. I have to clarify that although I'm tearing this apart and it's a harem, which aren't really known for their interstellar stories, this one tries to do more than just a basic story, but fails in almost every regard when given the chance. I usually tear harems apart with the understanding that they're not representing the best that author has to offer or the idea that they're not meant to be the most compelling in the world unlike SOME people... The start of the show up to episode 3 (Which I now acknowledge why this probably has such a dismal score on here) has amazing animation, coherent storytelling [Sounds like it should be a given, but compared to the first season it's a blessing], actual stakes, a real villain and so on... The animation between season 1 and 2 is basically like watching a 2014 harem vs one in 2023 and that says a lot. Considering they were made 2 years apart with the original coming out in 2021. -\-  I'm very aware of the still substandard animation considerably overall, but I chalk that up to the designs in general. It's really hard to evoke excitement when the main character somehow went from looking like a goofed up penguin in season 1 Post Evolution to looking like Dib from the Invader Zim movie in the anime segment. Once you look it up you'll never unsee it! 
The animation expresses the characters heaps more without feeling like it's too much or assiasin's... assins's? Assassin's pride level. {I forgot how to spell assisn :( } When it comes to the jokes they really just hit that good ol' funny spot reminding how excessive animation used to be back in the good ol' days of harems, back when I used to watch them for fun rather than to complete a goal! Ah... Oh right, it lends itself super well while still allowing for the less passionate scenes to feel like they're being accounted for. Later on though? It's very clear that fun budget they were working off of either ran out or they got extremely burnt out. The animation begins to use scenes that are very easy to animate and the overly excessive jokes that appeared in the first 3 episodes slowly fade away and turn into a sparingly gag that leads back into the drama. But it's pretty obvious that's more of an issue with the actual writing than the animation... for the most part. 
I should probably talk about that. Spoilers ahead for a harem anime oh noes!!!
For real tho I always hate reading reviews for harems because they're so overly negative and just bum me out from wanting to watch the actual show XP They're always picking out the most obvious problems that usually consist with the entire genre... Even though harems aren't really supposed to be giving good stories more so giving the viewer a gratification that they can't get anywhere else... For legal reasons. It comes off as high expectations for such low barrier animes. I just watched about 3 animes in a row that had little to no actual substance and still had a good time. 
Lower your expectations people and just have fun!!! 
Jesus. 
People are so demanding now a day- Oh shit I forgot about the review. Uhhhh... 
Spoilers ahead if you want to watch it I highly recommend you go watch it and come back and watch me complain!

The anime continues right after the end of season 1 well sort of. It shows a clip of the final episode to start it, clearly showing that the budget was dumped into all the blood Sechii had coming out of him after being stabbed! Just even as he drops to his knees you can see how over the top they really worked to hype this fight up. Then we're brought back and set into the carriage (Fun fact: Everyone's eyes are now smaller) They set off to the school and are introduced to the new cast. The teacher who I thought was going to be a stereotypical angry rule abiding teacher was actually given a bit more depth! Not much, but more than expected is always a positive. I can say she's definitely still a one trick pony in most situations which is sort of a bummer, but she has her moments of helping the students grow and understanding the situation.
 Uhhh the Prez was pretty cool? When it came to the term over-excessive in the anime he was that guy. Mad respect in that regard I really enjoyed whenever the voice actor really put not only a voice to the character but a lot of actual depth and silliness in the voice even when it wasn't really needed. When he was supposed to be more serious though, it was quite obvious that he wasn't the most interesting of characters or have any real thing to say. The 11th episode is a clear portrayal of that when the viewer is shown a point where the villain was introduced and helped by him and his assistant The thing he does while he sits there and mourns his parents who were recently murdered he does jokes that are centered around word play. His parents just died, and some guy just comes up to and starts spitting the most random word play jokes you've ever heard. It's quite the oddity. Then his whole death really did nothing to expand on his character nor give any justification to the MC's actions or reasoning. 
The main villain? Oh man I feel bad for him. Not because of the sob story they tried to give him at the end, most of that is the same guilt trip bullshit (Hey that rhymed!) they did back in season 1 to make the viewer feel bad. I mean that he was barely given any screen time or any real time to grow. Whenever he was on screen he was acting as a foreboding presence. The writers really wanted to show how dangerous he was... By not having him do a single thing and even mocking him in most of the less important scenes including the ending scenes which were decent this time around. He was too busy being overshadowed by his fellow colleagues that somehow had a single episode of growth and have more depth than he was given over the course of the series? Wiiiiiild bro.  When he wasn't being the evil bad 4 year old that's watching over the crew (which is basically never btw) He's a pouting child who doesn't want to give up the past. There is one scene where he mistakes Saria to be his teacher. And it's never properly communicated??? She was there in the final battle with no purpose other than to remind him as well I guess??? He really has such a flimsy goal, to kill god because he made him sad. Oh wait no he caused the war that killed his parents. Forgot that part since it was explained in 2 seconds lmao. But yea he blames god for his problems and it's really annoying to hear him rant about how it's not fair that he has to suffer and his fix for that is by killing the people who started the war. I guess that makes sense? But it seems more like he just wants to kill himself lol. Especially in the last episode he talks about how alone and misunderstood he feels. Wanting to get rid of all the pain he feels and literally destroy the world and himself. Couldn't be more on the nose could ya? -\- I just really feel like his motive is more so spurred out of the need for it rather than the cause of it. This is a problem because THE ONE DAMN IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION IS GLOSSED OVER IN 2 DAMN SECONDS. This show has an extremely bad habit of trying to show every second of side plot and enemy planning as if to pad the show rather than actually explain what's happening. To prove my point, I skipped every single one of those scenes[Aka any scene without the MC] because it really just didn't add anything into the story. I can say legit, I didn't miss any important information after going back. It's almost embarrassing how much stuff they put in there you could skip... Actually, it IS embarrassing.
Oh yea the new 4 students I really liked :D They were honestly one of the best parts of this new season giving a sense of purpose for Seiichi being at the school, and just having a more coherent plot to follow as they make up the plot for those first 6 episodes. Surprisingly right after they're essentially cut from the story it goes downhill. When they're on screen they feel like a sense of purpose has been given to the entire anime. As they try and figure out how they can beat the S class and not just be the laughing stock of the entire school. A lot of animes I watch that are based off of light novels, have very one sided conversations where the main characters are made to suffer and take such extreme verbal abuse without any push-back.  It's genuinely infuriating to watch because they just sit there and take it and then do some fancy shit later on basically to negate all that anger. Which is extremely stupid. But I feel like this anime did a good job of having that same energy, but still understanding that the characters wouldn't just sit there and take that shit! The S class really is just one person all things considered, and this character SHOULD have ties to the overall plot, but is relegated to being a power scaler for characters that don't really get a chance to shine besides one fight (WHICH IS 100% SKIPPABLE WITHOUT MISSING A SINGLE STORY BEAT) I think their bond is what really holds me to them. Although they fight a bit, they're very sincere with one another, and really encourage each other to do their best. They act like a family... A family of outcasts that just want a place to feel accepted :'-) It's really nice... That is until they're dumped for the next plot. I will never get over the fact that they never were given a chance to actually use their powers against the S class despite that being their entire damn goal... Man I miss them. :( 
Since the Childhood friend although present, but not really important in the 1st season is given much more time to grow after the ""tossing out"" of the students... BWHAHAHAHAHAHA yea that's bullshit. She was given a total of 1 episode of proper screen-time in which she is treated like a joke and plot device for the main character's woes. I really don't have any problem with her she's just so basic. Besides the whole sniffing thing and that's weird af. I have nothing else to say about her or the other childhood friend(Those two episodes with the second childhood friend can be skipped even if the title and the episode is about Sechii fucking dying LMAOOOOOOOO) and that's about it.The main characters while being there... have somehow been dumbed down a ton. Which a bummer because I really wanted them to grow and become better people. Which also includes the harem element. That was toned down to the max. Even Saria was taken out of the picture... Man, boiling this entire anime down comes to really one big factor that plays into it's downfall. 
Ambition.
 It can be seen in the animation, all the effort was put into the first minute of the episode, the op, and ed. The plot began coherently, but as time went on, they tried to introduce more people, more story beats and paths to new ideas, and focus on others besides Sechii, different dangers and threats. And for what? An engaging story that has tons of depth? It's 12 episodes???? And a harem????? Why include so much if there was no proper way to implement it? Like the best example of this is stakes at the very end. Sechii has lost all of his powers because of poorly explained extremely important plot points. The villain  has Sechii at a strong disadvantage because he's literally been stabbed.  Saria is killed and all the other villains are dead. Oh yea I guess the prez too, but that's negligible. Sechii is forced to suffer the same way that the villain has to feel the pain that he's had to harbor this entire time. The Villain shows Sechii all his past memories and how his entire life has been filled with pain and every good is reciprocated with a bad. Forced to question if any of this is truly worth it only to suffer. His response...? ""Nah fam I love my life"" Proceeds to dance That's basically how it went yea. I've spent more time writing about this review than the actual writers probably thought about that ending. After pushing back against the cringe. He becomes ultra based by unlocking a new power and using it on the villain and that power is... Love. The fucking end of this damn show turns into an RPG about friends facing off against the shadow versions of themselves and accepting it through the power of love and friendship. Sechii sends out a spell From a different dimension might I add and RAISES EVERY CHARACTER KILLED IN THE ENTIRE SERIES. So that awesome. Now I will say I was expecting Saria to come back since she was resed before lol. But everyone else? What the fuck. What's the point in having any sense of danger if everything was going to be reversed before the first episode with no consequences whatsoever??? I get it, I cried when I even THOUGHT about killing off one of my characters in my own story. But that does not permit that from me killing them and bringing them back. It's boring and gives no real sense of satisfaction to the reader in any sense of the word. And all that build up. For nothing! So much of the anime's time was used to build up all those characters that it literally forgot about the main plot. You don't see that every day, but I do. It's really sad to see such an anime go to shit because it decided to try an actually be good. I'm sorry my friend, but harems are cursed to be bad besides the CHOSEN FEW but yea. The anime is pretty good. I guess that should be it- 
WAIT I FORGOT. So recently I've been studying Japanese (俺が本当オタクですが‼）and subtitles become more and more of a pain to read because people aren't faithfully interpreting the words being said. And for this anime in particular. They butchered it so much. Look, I'm not the best at Japanese but as I've been watching this damn anime the most basic stuff is being changed in meaning like this is some damn funimation dub! Sechii and Saria's relationship was stepped down from wife to ""partners"", Ar's relationship was dumped from Girlfriend to Friend Ouch. and the many lines that were just misinterpreted so badly. Like in one scene Saria called the prez a ""エッチおじさん) Echii ojisan which using how he acts most of a time \A total weirdo should be interpreted as ""Perverted/Dirty Old Man"" but instead is interpreted as ""Sexy old man"" I guess it's not an incorrect translation but given the context...?????? What? The line after is calling him a ""Masochist"" and that's the sub's translation not mine. There's tons of other examples, but I've already wasted too much time talking about a literally on this basic anime that I could probably find 100 fold. 
Oh wait...
 I have. I would personally give it a 7.3 just because of the jokes, insane leap from season 1, and coherent plot when compared to 1. This is actually part 1 of a 2 part review! It probably won't have a part 2 this got so boring to make after the like 5th sentence. I might go back some day and look back on how season 1 is just... BLEH. I really don't want to, it's just too tedious If you've enjoyed reading me rambling about an anime that's obviously bad then give this a like! And maybe check out the notes on the animes I've watched if you want to read more. They're like 50 times shorter than this tho lmao."

Plot:
To be honest there isn't really a plot, it's a spinoff of bungo stray dogs which I recommend if you haven't watched it already. The anime follows funny stories and shorts of the armed detective agency and the port mafia. Dazai is still as suicidal, Chuuya always angry and still short and Akutagawa craving Dazai's attention. There isn't any significant spoilers in this spin-off so I recommend you watch it. 

img220()

Characters:
Dazai- A hectic, suicidal man.
Atsushi- An average main character. He's pretty normal. He can turn into a tiger too.
Kunikida- An idealistic workaholic.
Akutagawa- Emo man who craves Dazai's intention and despises Atsushi.
Kyouka- A quiet and cute little assassin, she wears a kimono.
Odasaku- My personal favorite character. He's chill.
Naomi- A highschool girl who is attracted to her brother.
Junichiro- An employee at the armed detective agency who is attracted to his sister.
Kenji- A boy who likes animals and stuff.
Dr Yosano- A scary woman.
President- In this anime he is very clearly expressed as a proud cat lover!
Ranpo- Another one of my favorite characters. This is probably because of how relatable. I mean who wouldn't love to stuff their faces full of snacks all day!?
Mori- Funny lonely man who likes his daughter, I think he sees Elsie as his daughter.
Higuchi- Akutagawa loves Dazai. But Higuchi loves Akutagawa much more. I'm sure a lot of the bungo stray dogs fans hate her.
Gin- Surprisingly they're a girl. Just not always a girly one.
Tachihara- He doesn't stand  out much, he's kinda like Akutagawa's babysitter!
Ango- A boring guy, I don't like him that much.

Animation:
For a side show the animation is great, there is no flaws. I appreciate the cute chibi style and the characters new appearances. However there isn't really anything impressive about it, which is understandable and doesn't really bother me much.

img220()

Amazing side-show which I would definitely re-watch more than once. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer! :D

I really struggled to use the limit of characters as there really isn't much to say about these kinda comedy animes. So I tried to describe some side characters with the littlest amount of spoilers. But I hope yo enjoyed reading this and have a nice day! :)

Oh and also message my account if there's anything you want to ask me or discuss about from this review, I can only think of so much to say.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
21379,"If you're not into the Fate franchise or TYPE MOON anime stuff, just stop reading now. This show isn't for you. The entire Prisma☆Illya franchise is one big Fate fanservice dump to satisfy the otaku die-hard fan theorycrafting like ""What if Saber and Caster fought but Saber somehow could use Shirou's Unlimited Blade Works and they were also both CUTE LITTLE GIRLS???"". It's also sort of like a new-age Lyrical Nanoha, where it's own storyline tries to be a darker, more ""mature"" but not quite Madoka sort of deal and is a series made for a more general or male audience rather than the strictly young girl demographic targeted magical girl show. This series is also notorious for ridiculous lolicon pandering fanservice that caused me to originally go against my 'NoDrop' mantra and actually drop the series. Once I finally picked it back up and muscled through it all, I found a pretty satisfying Fate-joke and action fanservice romp that at the very least kept me laughing at the series' own ridiculousness.

In the first two seasons, nothing really happens plotwise other than various vehicles to get us into fights with different servants and create jokes, all for the purpose of stringing along Fate series fans. 3rei!! throws that formula out the window and decides that Prisma☆Illya really actually had its shit together all along and cracks down with appears to be an actual plot. Needless to say, I was stunned, but not unwelcoming. It got off to a bit of a rocky start, basically throwing us into a new universe to make it clear that this season is really its own story-driven package. There's also noticeably less awkward loli fanservice, which is a welcome change, but still with a large amount of best-girl Kuro screentime. The yank right out from the normal formula into something new and more driven felt almost like a slightly less effective version of what The World God Only Knows pulled over its 3 season run, only using the base and the characters from 2 seasons of formulaic so-so content to tell an actually compelling story in the last season. 

The art and animation style of Prisma☆Illya can be summed up as Silver Link doing its very best ufotable impression while ""moe-fying"" everything it can. The designs are notably more cutesy than anything you'd see in a core Fate title, but have that noticeably Fate flair that we've come to expect from ufotable's amazing adaptations. The ""budget"" for the series can definitely fluctuate, but outside of some major letdowns in the most recent big fight episode, Silver Link has really cranked it up for the fight scenes and really does a good job of hyping up the fights. Nothing is ever unwatchable though, just not as good as it could be, which is honestly to be expected from a series that doesn't really have much money behind it despite getting 3 seasons of adaptation. This is actually the first season that's been a full 12 episodes; the other two have only been 10 each.

Overall, this is a Fate-fan only deal, but if you meet that criteria and have gone through the first two seasons, this is definitely something that you'll want to check out."
19613,"Я люблю машины. 

Ну, пиздец как люблю машины. Очень люблю. Особую страсть некогда питал к немецким. Знаете, они такие элитарные, недоступные, сложные, монолитные. Ух, закачаешься! А когда-то давно увлекался американскими. Тяжелые, мощные, большие, с огромными моторами, гигантскими диванами вместо нормальных кресел, кошмар современных зеленых. Но всегда я с особой, теплой любовью смотрел на японские машины. Возможно, это передалось от отца. Мой батя - апологет японского машиностроения, ебать. Че у него только не было. Даже как в Initial D машина, о как! Nissan Skyline R32 красного цвета. Праворульный, тяжелый, красивый, со спойлером. Цаца, ниче не скажешь. Про всякие маркообразные, ставшие уже нарицательным в российских реалиях, я молчу

И вот любовь эта не давала мне никак покоя, пока я не посмотрел от корки до корки (со всеми Экстра-стейдж выпусками) Initial D. Теперь эта ебучая любовь мне не дает покоя вдвойне, потому что ничто, кроме Initial D, в этом мире не сможет так заразить духом спортивных состязаний, красоты и мощи японских автомобилей, силы и мастерства водителей. 

Я всегда знал о культовом статусе знаменитой Toyota Corolla Sprinter Trueno AE86 в расцветке ""панда"", но только после полного просмотра этого аниме я познал, что это не просто символ какой-то там темы для чисто анимешников и любителей машин в одном флаконе. Это древняя как мир концепция старой японской легенды про самурая, который ушел вникуда непобежденным. Всех выебал и ушел в закат, став героем рассказов, слухов и преданий. Эта черно-белая машина - главный герой аниме в большей степени, чем говорящие головы, которые создают какой-то движ

Я вижу для себя Initial D также, как, например, первый Portal. Все сюжетные перипетии вокруг машин нужны, чтобы искусственно создавать какой-то движ, из-за которого случаются гонки. Поэтому я очень-очень рад, когда на третьем сезоне (вернее, после Third Stage) после, кхм, ПОСЛЕДНЕГО острого угла и сложного любовного интереса Такуми Initial D в мгновение ока перешло от какой-то хуйни про школьников, которые не знают, чем они будут заниматься после школы, в спортивную, мать его, драму с самым сильным накалом страстей, что я чувствовал

И как я уже писал у себя в кратеньком ревью в профиле, можно было бы и вообще к хуям выкинуть большую часть диалогов. Ветка ""настоящим стритрейсерам не нужны девушки"" смешная и забавная, пусть и немного грустная. Но даже если бы ее не было, целостность аниме/манги вообще никоим образом не пострадала бы)) 

Я бы с точно таким же безумным удовольствием посмотрел от начала до конца этот шедевр, в котором пиздеж был бы только у водителя машины с самим собой. Такуми Фудживара - самурай. А его машина - самый настоящий самурайский меч, каждый скол на котором являет собой гадкое воспоминание о собственной ошибке, которую самурай больше не посмеет допустить"
165254,"I have finished quite a few anime and next on my list of reviews is Bucchigiri!! Please note this review has spoilers ... like major spoilers.  

 

Bucchigiri is an anime original, coming from studio Mappa this action genre anime surprises us with a mixed of Japanese and Arabic culture and an old school style of animation/art. With that said the anime sort of fall on its face as soon as the story begins. Some of the jokes which were meant to be funny felt like a waste of time or a parody anime. The plot of the story seemed fine until you realized the writers completely forgot the main point of the plot of the story and sidetracked to making a story not even about the main character. Enough with the initial thoughts let me tell you what Bucchigiri is about.  

 

Story  

Our main character Arajin is back in the city where he grew up and is now going to high school now. Within this we see that the city is divided into 2 gangs (Siguma & Minato Kai). There are 3 gangs initially, but we will get into the 3rd one later. Arajin meets Mahoro the girl he has a crush on, and Matakara his old childhood friend. We see both characters are in different gangs Mahoro is sister to the leader (Marito) of the Siguma gang and Matakara is in Minato Kai. Initally Arajin does not want to join either he just wants to lose his virginity (cliche trope), but he joins Siguma because he is basically a simp doing whatever Mahoro wants.  

Fast forward a bit to where Arajin finds a genie who gives him the power of a honki person. You are probably wondering what the hell is a honki person. From my perspective a person who trains and achieves the ultimate fighter status. From google it shows a person who searches for a heart that does not flee, Yeah Arajin did not reach his goal of becoming a honki person. We were also shown a flashback to where Arajin and Matakara were young and training to be a honki people. This helped put the plot into perspective to see Arajin and Matakara had a common goal, or so you would think initially we find out there is another genie from the 3rd gang the NG boys who leader loses the powerful genie to Matakara. Yes, there is a lot going on and even more. I have not even stated how the genies have a previous history with each other which led the story from Arajin and Matakar to Senya (red genie) vs Ichya (blue genie). 

 

Animation 
img220()
Beyond the horrible story line of this anime, I do appreciate the art and animation. First the character art style is great. There is a bunch of color within the anime and the anime clearly have flavors from Arabic and Japanese cultures. The fighting style is great too; there are some good fighting scenes in this anime. Music wise again it gives an Arabic vibe, especially the end credit scene. Regarding the animation and music aspect Buccigiri passes with excellence. 

 

Characters 

img220(/m/1200x0/filters:quality(95)format(webp))
We have a few characters in this anime. I can absolutely say the main character Arajin is the worst main character of all time. I am sorry I do not see how you put a plot for the main character to rise to the occasion and have heart to fight and he never progresses to doing so. You would think he would change when his childhood friend reaches out to him, but we see in a later episode flashback that he left his friend to get beat up by older kids. Not to mention the power up phrase he uses when he merges with Senya is that he wants to lose his virginity. At first it was funny then later it really gets corny to continue stating that and have no progress with the only girl in the anime.  

Speaking of the only girl in the anime, I will jump to the side characters briefly. Mahoro is the only girl besides Arajin mom within this anime, I found that extremely weird but not as weird as her obsession with her brother Marito. The anime really gets me irritated when she shows that she clearly does not like Arajin but Arajin is too dense to even notice. 

Matakara is the only character that made sense in this entire anime. Yes, the chad of the anime who can fight have the right morals and try to help any and everyone... what could go wrong? Yes, they even fumbled his character with the importance of his brother. Matakara’s brother was once a member of Minato Kai ended up going to jail for some time. So of course he is an important person to our important characters, later as the story begins to enter the climax, we see Matakara is notified that his brother is seriously hurt after a stabbing incident. Bucchigiri proceeds to end this entire important moment with us not knowing whether he is dead or alive. Yes, Matakara goes crazy on everybody once he is synchronized with Ichya but does he even know if his brother is still alive or not. 

 

Conclusion 

To conclude Buccigiri has so much potential to be a good anime but focuses on the wrong things. Great fight scenes and character designs but did not put enough effort into making the story an exceptional story. Also, the cat scene jokes fell flat, I am not sure why they included that in every episode. I rate this anime with a - Basura!!!

The only romance anime I wholeheartedly watched during the Fall 2024 season. Not that I think it's peak or anything, but it was certainly a decently enjoyable experience worth mentioning. Let's talk about why you shouldn't wait 365 days to start the show.

webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/Kekkon365DaysWedding-OP1.webm)

Don't get mad at me for listing its downsides, I'm going to look at it as objectively as I can.


In all honesty, when I first inserted it into my seasonal watch list, I didn't think it was gonna be anything worthwhile. The production looked mediocre, the characters looked bland and the whole marriage premise felt generic. However, that's not where the magic lies for this particular romcom. 

img2200()

First of all, this may just be the best romance with an adult cast since Wotakoi (not including fantasies). For so long, some romance fans have desired a setting different than a school in a romcom and Kekhon (that's what  I'm calling it idc) gave us exactly that. The blossoming love between two office workers pretending to be married, simultaneously trying to concentrate on anything other than love. Did I mention that they were actual introverts? When is the last time y'all seen that? 


Instead of some corny exaggerated confession scene or over-the-top drama, what we have are a good representation of overthinking in the form of inner monologues, rational decisions made by adults, and awkward, yet wholesome exchanges between said adults. It's difficult for introverts to open up about what they really want unless it's somebody close to them or somebody worth opening up to, but that's why it works here. From being ordinary acquaintances, to not being able to conversate normally, to gradually following their hearts. Them not being able to fully express themselves provided us with their adorable thoughts, while also making us feel the perfect amount of: (probably what Tama was thinking)
img2200()

The best part of the show was easily Rika (voiced by [Hayami Saori ](https://anilist.co/staff/95869/Hayami-Saori)). I did like Takuya's development with the whole 'stop half-assing everything' spiel, but it wasn't anything special. Rika learning about romance and learning to distinguish this feeling and live with it has given us the best scenes if anything. Contradictory to her thoughts, her heart always leaked out during important moments like:

!The kiss scene or her declaring to try living together!

img2200()


Man, I did not think I was gonna be invested in this fat man. Lo and behold, I was. At first, he was easily the most annoying character in the show. He constantly complained about his love life to Takuya and it didn't even feel like he was taking it seriously... Until Episode 8 happened. 

!He was immature. He decided that he wanted to take his relationship with Kaori before being prepared for anything - mentally and financially. Honestly, the sudden relationship between them felt childish, but that's what Gonda's perspective on romance was like. Childish. When Kaori revealed her position as a single mother, it was difficult to take in for both the audience and Gonda. She did like Gonda as a person, but in her mind, it had to be done. If he can't handle the responsibility of taking care of a toddler that's not even his, if he's not ready to financially support two people, it shouldn't be forced. That's why I believe Kaori made the right call, and hopefully Gonda grew from this event.

img2200()!


Naturally, a show is not without its faults (unless that show is Monogatari), so I have to talk about them. I simply cannot perceive Kekhon as a 'good' anime. For me personally, a 7/10 rating is given to those that I think can be called good without hesitation. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. There are just certain aspects that I'm obligated to adress. For example, the lack of a strong supporting cast. There was that one episode with Gonda, but what else? I get that they wanted to focus more on their two lovebirds, but maybe we could've gotten more realistic interactions between the office workers and their difficulties in pursuing romance. Instead, we got the common, shallow, NPC-looking cast that exists everywhere.

I enjoyed Takuya and Rika's relationship, but it came out of nowhere. There was no information about their types, so I don't like how they took a liking to each other simply due to their situation. It doesn't work like that. I'm talking about the early episodes, of course.

I do value production unless it's something like Evangelion where the writing and story-telling are top-notch, which is precisely why I deem Kekhon's production as inadequate. Stiff animation, mediocre art, over-used directing methods. I can't get attached to characters who just feel like they're sketches.

-Also, I don't know if this should be a considered a con, but I liked the comedy. It's just that I think this specific creation is better in manga form. Many elements felt like they were bound to be better on panels, rather than on screen. Manga readers, tell me if I'm right.


Fyi, a 5.5-6.0 is not a bad score from me. I utilize the full 0-10 scale, so Kekhon to me is an above average romcom that has its downsides. I don't think I'm gonna miss watching this weekly, but I sure as hell will miss Tama, so for now, goodbye to Fall 2024's top comfort show. Goodnight.

3958,"Esta serie me trae recuerdos de cuando yo aún no sabía nada acerca del anime. Cuando yo tenía 15 o 16 años la mayoría de series que veía pertenecían a la primera década de los 2000. Muchas de ellas eran horribles comedias románticas donde el componente harem era un elemento fundamental de su receta. Hoy me arrepiento de haber visto tantas, pero al menos aprendí rápido a detestarlas. La serie que nos ocupa, uno de los primeros animes de A1-Pictures, no es exactamente lo mismo, pero hay un claro parentesco familiar entre ellas. Veamos porqué.

Kannagi es una comedia romántica enfocada en la vida de Jin, un estudiante, quien de la noche a la mañana tiene que vivir junto con una mujer que se identifica con la diosa Nagi. La premisa es otro caso muy similar al que estableció Urusei Yatsura (1981): una joven de origen extraterrestre, divino o extranjero, con un carácter particular, conoce a nuestro protagonista, un estudiante común. Este hecho cambiará una parte importante de su vida, pasando a vivir todo tipo de aventuras y enredos. Sin duda, ha sido una premisa utilizada hasta la saciedad desde entonces. Sin embargo, al final todo radica en cómo el autor se encarga de cómo escribir lo que viene a continuación. 

Aquí, en concreto, nos encontramos una obra que más o menos mantiene un balance entre un lo que es una RomCom de su época, con algunos enredos y malentendidos entre Jin, Nagi y Zange; y una comedia centrada en su ámbito escolar y diario. Nada extraño si nos fijamos en el año en que salió. Podríamos decir que transita por el mismo tipo de escenarios, situaciones, personajes y demás que el resto de sus hermanos de género. Pero creo que me quedo corto si solo digo esto, así que pasaré a hablar más en profundidad. Además, le amerita no ser un harem clásico, definido por el bochornoso trato que recibe el elenco femenino y la constante utilización de los tópicos de la forma más irritante posible.

Como he dicho Kannagi no hace casi nada muy original o ingenioso, pero en un principio la energía que emanaba de su comedia y las expectativas que levantaba eran suficientes para hacer que sus primeros episodios fueran suficientemente buenos. Diría que parte del mérito está en la atención de los animadores en lo referente a expresión facial y corporal. Desde gestos menores hasta reacciones más importantes recibían el entusiasmo del grupo de animadores. Es una manera costosa, pero sutil de enfatizar y realzar unas situaciones cómicas que, en un inicio, no tendrían que ser especialmente asombrosas. Claro, también pasaba que alguna vez había un exceso de detalle y movimiento que no eran normales, pero eso constituye la excepción. Tristemente y al igual que en muchas otras series de A1-Pictures, esto solo dura un par de episodios. Después el trabajo de animación está más cerca de la media, aunque se recupera al final.

En cuestión de humor, Nagi sería el personaje que más se encarga de hacernos reír porque tiende ser la responsable de los problemas que ocurren. Por curioso que suene es una diosa con un carácter infantil. Podríamos citar algún caso como el capítulo donde se encierra en el armario o aquella vez que intentó ganarse a los alumnos de la escuela para reunir más seguidores. En otras ocasiones, el humor simplemente procede de su interacción con el mundo moderno. Es divertido observar como un ser del pasado trata con objetos tan exóticos para ella como el caso de un televisor. En general, da la impresión de ser alguien pueril, siendo descerebrada, perezosa y un tanto presumida. Pero no es tonta y saber actuar ante los demás como si fuera una chica de alta clase muy educada, algo que deja desconcertado a Jin. En definitiva, hay un simpático contraste entre lo que esperaríamos de una diosa y lo que verdaderamente es.

También contribuyen al humor otros personajes como Zange, Akiba, Hibiki y Kimura. Sin embargo, una parte de ellos solo nos aporta algún tipo de broma concreta. Véase las largas explicaciones de Akiba acerca de algún tema relacionado con la cultura otaku como los maid cafe o las magical girl. No cabe duda de que la serie está muy puesta en este mundillo, algo que podemos ver en referencias y demás situaciones frikis. Otros personajes son algo más variados respecto a sus interacciones con otros y no se limitan a un único chiste como podría ser Zange o Kimura. En particular, la primera, como rival en lo divino y lo amoroso, intenta persuadir a Jin con sus encantos femeninos y vencer a Nagi en su intento de recabar más siguidores. De ahí que sea adorable con Jin y los demás, pero con Nagi deja ver su carácter manipulador y rastrero. ¿Y Jin? Sinceramente, fuera de sus reacciones al encogerse en el suelo, entra en la categoría de prota beta aburrido. 

Respecto del humor erótico, debo decir que no es muy pronunciado. Nagi es el objetivo primordial de la cámara, pero tampoco hablaría de “acoso”. Después están los típicos roces, momentos vergon- zosos, ropa ligera y tal, pero nunca se sobrepasan. Algo que también le dejaría en un punto medio. Podríamos hablar de malentendidos, enredos, berrinches (de Nagi) y demás, pero creo que no hace falta ser muy listo para hacerse una idea del resto. Y soy sincero tampoco me entusiasma seguir con ello porque se trata de una comedia un poco por encima de la media. Nunca logra ser muy cliché o irritante, algo de agradecer en sus tiempos, pero al fin y al cabo solo quiere ser algo entretenido y medianamente relajado. 

De lo que sí me interesa hablar es de que nos hallamos, en parte, ante una premisa desaprovechada. Esto no es precisamente una novedad. Ejemplos de ello abundan en el anime. Por citar uno estaría Sankarea (2012), pero hay decenas de casos. Aquí la cuestión está en como la eliminación de las impurezas, la obtención de seguidores o la segunda faceta de Nagi se olvidan casi totalmente hasta los tres últimos capítulos. De hecho, me parece reseñable que asuntos de esta escala sean ignorados durante tanto tiempo y cuando llega por fin el final pongan en marcha la máquina dramática y las revelaciones vayan una tras otra. Desde mi punto de vista, es una forma de decir que esto nunca fue muy importante. ¡Y eso que lo prometían al principio! 

Pero me diréis que por mucho que diga, sucede. Eso es cierto, pero no aceptable. Algo tan delicado como es dudar de la identidad propia, debería tener su espacio propio en los pensamientos de Nagi y que nosotros fuéramos testigos de ello para comprender su miedo. El problema es que hasta el capítulo 12 lo desconocemos totalmente. Y por mucho que al menos dedicaran tres episodios, no basta para remediar esta torpeza. Además, que hay huecos importantes, siendo el más importante el hecho de que… ¿por qué los recuerdos de Nagi fueron bloqueados por su otra personalidad? No hay algo que lo explique. Sin ese inconveniente el problema ni existiría.

Otro aspecto mediocre sería el aspecto romántico. A diferencia de otros harems, aquí al menos no nos engañan demasiado sobre con quien se quedará Jin, a excepción de ese capítulo donde la amiga de la infancia cobra relevancia. Lógicamente, tampoco entiendo porque aquí hay tanto interés en Jin cuando es un estudiante promedio sin mucho que resaltar. Aquí Zange sería la que sale perdiendo porque la chica poseída por ella apenas interactúa con él así que no tenemos ni idea de porque le gusta. Sobre la relación con Nagi, diría que hay unas bases puestas en la convivencia diaria, con sus más y sus menos. Pero también en el hecho de que Jin tiene sus detalles y gestos con Nagi como preocuparse de su bienestar. El problema es que no pasan de ahí. La relación no alcanza un nivel más alto y, por tanto, todo el drama final con ambos disgustados pues no impacta como pretendían. En cualquier caso, no habrá continuación, así que se quedó así para siempre."
21764,"The most important thing to keep in mind is that the series “WWW.Working!!” is not related to the three seasons of the anime “Work!!” This anime was probably an attempt to make a deep remake or something. Apart from the location and appearance of individual characters, nothing remains from the previous series


The main character, as always, is a serious and responsible first-year high school student. Being forced to look for a part-time job, he turns to the cafe “Warnaria”, where he is immediately accepted... And almost immediately, he realizes that this cafe is run by some weirdos. The Manager is beaten up by some older woman, one of the waitresses sees ghosts, and the Manager himself can’t count on a calculator. The other employees are no better.

The anime has about 10 characters and each has its little storyline. From beginning to the end, it shows the love stories of three very different couples. If you hadn't had a relationship, it might be fun and useful to look at. The branch about the debtor’s son and the creditor’s daughter was hard to watch. It is objectively gross. But this is the most lifelike story. It becomes clear how much ordinary Japanese are sick of living that life. So I guess even in the third economy of the world everything isn't 100% smooth.


The visuals are nothing special and do not draw attention to themselves. The authors somewhat abuse the inserts with the changed appearance of the characters when they are about to say something emotional. Honestly, I don’t know why they do it and what it means for them. The same inserts are in “Non Non Biyori” and some other places, so I guess it’s the norm.
The music is pleasant and exciting, especially the ending.


Everyone who is tired of problems and needs to cheer up. The anime is easy to watch and does not overload at all.  Leaves a lot to think about. Or you can just watch it in the evening when there is nothing to do. Alone, with friends, or with a girl/young man."
105200,"This review contains spoilers!



Retsuko is a red panda, working in the accounting department of a Japanese trading firm, trying her best to navigate through the typical problems encountered by young adults in 21st century Japan.

Taken straight from Wikipedia, the short summary above tells you everything you need to know about Aggretsuko, but chances are, if you’re reading a review about the second season, you are well aware of the show's premise. You know what this show’s about, you know the deal. We’re not here to read a SparkNotes of the show that tells you what you already know. We’re here to talk about the 2nd season, what you may have missed first time through, and how this show, and it’s writers were able to tell a gripping and meaningful story, depicting the brutal truth, and sometimes, scary reality of modern romance.

This is, in this reviewer’s opinion, the best season of Aggretsuko, with a fun, interesting plot in the first half tackling the new guy mentality in the workplace, that gracefully leads into the 2nd half of the show’s plot about romance. 

The first half of the show deals with Anai, who is the perfect stereotype of a young workaholic who didn't get any social skill in school. With Anai, the show points out the absurdities of the seniority complex in office culture, but more than that, the young startup who fears that sort of culture and bullies their co-workers in some delusional attempt to protect themselves.



>I cite a quote from Jasmine Lav: This is referencing kind of a Japan/Asia-specific issue. Since forever, workplace superiors there have taken advantage of younger workers by verbally abusing them and forcing them to do work that FAR exceeds what their job actually is. Apparently that kind of thing has become a lot less common in modern times now that workers have the tools to fight back, but it still happens. Anai is like someone who's hyper-sensitive about racism or sexual harassment, to the point where he sees it in EVERY comment or interaction. That's why he's so unbalanced and can't relax. It's not that his fears aren't real, he's just taking it WAY too far and assuming the worst out of everyone.

It’s an issue that isn’t exclusive to Japan/Asia however. We see this in every walk of life, from work culture, to politics, to even high school clubs. It's something I've seen in my life in such school clubs, the ""senior vs the newb"" mentality, and it almost always ends in a shitty situation for all involved. The show both hilariously and accurately depicts this dynamic with over the top absurdity and ""on-the-dot"" satire of what this mentality does to people, all while remaining a fun comedy for the viewer.



Now for the romance plot. Personally on a first time watch, I actually hated the romance story. I thought it was boring, had no build up, and I didn’t feel Retsuko and Tadano’s connection. But on a re-watch, I realize I was a brain-dead moron, and didn’t see how this show has what is by far one of the most realistic depiction of a romance I've ever seen in an anime. 

It's a deep dive so here we go: The show spends the entire season leading up to it’s main motif. Take Gori and Washimi, two returning (and fan favorite characters) geting into a fight on the topic of marriage. Long story short: Gori, despite reaching her 40s is still looking for the perfect someone and dreams of getting married. ""It can't hurt to dream of that prince charming to come in one day and sweep you off your feet!"" However, Washimi we learn, had been married (for a few months), and divorced. She has a much more pessimistic view on romance and marriage. ""It's foolish for people to think that signing your name on some piece of paper will just make you happy and guarantee things will work out. I tried it, and it doesn't work."" It's this clash of two mindsets that leads them to fight for several episodes in the season, but it's a theme that we'll seen throughout the WHOLE season. 


>Gori: ""What's wrong with a girl dreaming? 
Washimi: ""If you ask me, marriage is a trap. Even if it's great at first, people change. Do you really want a life where you're always lying to yourself?""

Retsuko's mom is introduced in this season, and along with providing some great comedy, brings her own, more pushy views of marriage into the equation. She's arranging match-maker dates, photoshopping the candidates, and manipulating Retsuko into going on these dates. She embodies the old fashion, and at times hypocritical view of marriage. The rush into things, get a guy before they are all married mindset. 


>""By the time you're ready to finally settle down, all the good men might have gotten snatched up and then you're going to kick yourself because you missed the boat!"" 

On the opposite side, we have people like Fenneko with the viewpoint that marriage is a waste. Committing yourself to someone is a scam, and a crappy deal. It's a waste of time, old fashion, and is a mindset that exists in fairytales. This is becoming a much more common viewpoint, especially in the younger generation. I currently go to college and have heard this viewpoint on the topic of marriage brought up plenty of times. Many people in their 20s are no longer seeking marriage or life partner. It’s a clashing viewpoint from the older generation that places such an importance on getting married and starting a family. 


 >""Marriage is so old fashion. In a poll taken on over thousands of people our age, 60% of men and 75% of women say they are not actively seeking a long-term partner or have any interest in marriage and starting a family. People are opening their eyes to the crappy deal marriage really is.""

We have many different viewpoints, ideas, and opinions on marriage in the modern age. From old to young generations, from experienced to inexperienced. None of these are a ""correct"" answer, it is a subject that should be handled on a person by person basis. What’s important on this subject is the individual.

Which leads to my next point. Notice how no quote here comes from Retsuko, the main character of the show. They come from other people outside her life, and other influencers. What is her stance? What is her opinion? I won't spoil it, as if you’ve seen the show, you’ll know the answer. But point being, the show puts her in a relationship that will force Retsuko to answer: Do you want to get married? Do you want to have kids? If you found the perfect man who had the opposite opinion, and did/didn't want those things while you did/didn't, would you give up set those needs aside to be happy with that person? Or do you need to stick to your guns and not give up on what you may genuinely want in life?



The answer isn’t a pretty one. Sometimes, people work well together, but there are too many bumps, hic-ups, and differing opinions for the pieces to fit. Though you may want to stay together, you must face reality, and each person must do what is truly best for themselves at the end of the day. The show really explores every viewpoint on the topic, giving a meta commentary to the viewer, while creating an interesting story for the characters.

Perhaps I'm reading too much into a show with a metalhead red panda. We did a lot of analyzing and dissection in this review. For some, they may have noticed these messages and themes, but for others, this show is a fun, silly slice-of-life with cute characters and emotional moments.
  
On the technical side of things, everything from the 1st season is here. The chibi Sanrio animation style, the spectacular voice acting, the music, all of it is still here. The show doesn't dip in it's technical quality, so if you've enjoyed the 1st season, you're sure to find enjoyment in this one. 

Even if we take away the themes and motifs the team explores this season , the show can still be watched and enjoyed as a light rom-com with cute characters, funny jokes, and some heart warming moments. Aggretsuko stands as one of the best, and at times, most underappreciated slice-of-life shows that I think most everyone can get enjoyment from. Whether it's the thought-provoking themes and message, or the fun slapstick the show has consistently delivered, viewers are sure to get something out of the 2nd season of Aggretsuko."

✦Story✦
What can I say. It's another beautiful Anime about classical music and  piano to be precise. Plenty of music was presented in the middle of very powerful emotional deliverance alongside the music. 

Obviously music itself isn't the only important factor of storytelling in this Anime. But also the character growth, drama, suffering and so on is simply amazing. Story offers who a rather pleasant adventure of seeing pianists growing up wrapped around sound of the piano.

Plenty of characters get introduced throughout the Anime. And mos get their stories told alongside the music they are playing. Thus here comes the extremely pleasing convenience of memories, music, person, emotions and so on,

`10/10`

✦Character✦
We get plenty of characters and backstories to them, but I'll only mention the main cast. As they get the most attention and their journey is rather enjoyable to witness. Not much to add, we get various characters with their own unique traits and they grow up rather well. Going to some silly drama, important drama and so on.

All things considering I enjoyed for the most part the characters themselves, while the only minus would be that some of the drama was rather silly. But eh,  that's how drama usually goes.

`9/10`

✦Art & Sound✦
Well first things first. Obviously sound is epic. I mean it's classical music, can't be bad.

As for art/animation. The only complaint I have is rather hideous CG. In that regard Anime called ""nodame cantabile"" much better job.

`9/10`

✦Enjoyment & Overall✦
Not much to add, I love piano in general, this Anime delivered it alongside with great storytelling of friendship, rivalry and the whole shebang drama that came with it.

I enjoyed it a lot to add it to list of my favorites. As mentioned, the only shortcoming is the CG and some characteristic drama. But those minuses ain't stopping me giving it full mark Anime.

I enjoyed music, I got emotional, I liked characters, their relationships and their growth,

16528,"Plot: 7/10
The story follows ""Kurumi"", a heartbroken girl who just lost her boyfriend 'HAL' in a plane crash, and ""Q01"" a robot who got assigned to help Kurumi by transplanting itself as HAL.
There are only two good things about this film; the plot twist and (read further). Throughout the film, the story carefully plants subtle pieces of information that trick you into thinking one way but completely flip on your head when the reveal happens.
But because of its short run time, many points feel rushed and some things are left completely unexplained like world-building which is severely lacking. The whole story happens in some greenhouse future, where everywhere is green (there's even a cultural event that happens in the movie) but then at the same time, there are android terminator-like cops! And the whole 'people unethically getting sent to dangerous places instead of robots' plot point is very poorly explained. Even the logic they try to explain the main twist is lacking and needs a bit more work, and time.
Everything was laid out just to execute that plot twist, and despite all the hiccoughs, I think it's still pretty good.
! And about the amnesia thing, it might sound a bit weird, but it makes sense considering the heart got replaced with an artificial heart. It really is a bit of a stretch but not completely illogical.!
If you don't wrap up things in a satisfying way, then the twist loses its value.

Characters: 5/10
This also became a problem because of the time constraint the studio is working on. You really can't connect to these characters. The adorable interactions between the 4 grannies at the rehabilitation center are what I remembered and that's saying something about a film where the central characters are a heartbroken young girl and a humanoid trying to help her while looking like her boyfriend. If given more time, at least 6 episodes, then this would've been a bit more engaging, and it would've also helped tie a few loose ends. But if the studio did that, we'll lose another great strength of this movie, the budget.

Visuals: 8/10 
Did you know that this is studio WiT's debut movie? (They still show Production IG at the beginning but AL says WiT, so whatever).
Did you know that this movie came out in Sept 2013, around the time when AoT Season 1 Episode 12 came out; when Armin stabbed his metal blade on Eren's titan back? (Good times)
Have you seen the backgrounds of this film?


Do you see this smooth Yawn ball and hand animation?!

Sound: 5/10
Not the best score or theme song I've ever heard but not bad, I suppose.

Enjoyment: 5/10
A surprisingly bland film. Excluding the constant eye candy, and the twist that occurs during the film's pre-climax scene, everything and everyone are just so boring and uninteresting, from dialogue to characters. What also takes away from the experience is the translation problems.

Important note: If you're watching the sub, then I urge you to be a bit more concentrated on the actual Japanese dialogue. Don't completely rely on the translation, as it ruins your experience a bit.
Or you can watch the dub, but that voice acting is not on par with the original.

Conclusion: Mixed
I think this movie really serves as an example of ""how to write a plot twist"", but it sacrifices the extra time it needs to wrap up things neatly and characters to deliver the emotional punch, all for the sake of one damn great twist.
If all that sounds good to you, then give this film a try."
131149,"I’d recommend reading my review of Gou [(click here to read it)](https://anilist.co/review/11664) to better understand my positions on this series. Sotsu has made many areas of it age like slim milk, but it describes my general feelings of Gou and my expectations going into this.

Out of literally any piece of media that I have experienced, and even those that have been released, the existence of Higurashi Sotsu stands out as a strange anomaly. A sequel to Higurashi, which already had a perfect conclusion with the end of Kai/Festival Accompanying, would strike many people as pointless. There have been sequels to anime that have already had perfect endings before, but in the way that Sotsu does it, there is nothing that is comparable. This is the point where the marketing of the series comes in, since it is basically inseparable from the season that it's attached to. The bait and switch with the lead on that it was a followup to Higurashi Gou, the season that started the new 2020 sequel of Higurashi to continue the story ended off by Higurashi Rei. Instead it ended up being an extended recap of the first four arcs of Gou that told the viewers nothing of substance with only two episodes of an actual sequel at the end. That is it. There is no silver lining. There is no second cour to save it all. That is what Sotsu is plainly.

I really don’t want to come off as someone who hates this series just because or somebody who finds no appreciation in When They Cry. My review linked above should show that I really like Gou even despite all of its problems. Even now, post-Sotsu, I still wouldn’t change my score from what it is right now. Even if it probably defies the reasonable part of me, the second cour leaves such a lasting impression in my mind that I really can’t hate it. The expectations that I had going into this were insurmountable with how much affinity I had for both Gou and the original series. You can even see that optimism in my review.

>”...the revelations involving the point of the existence of this entire season have been so well handled by the final arc of this season, that I barely have any worries about how Sotsu will go about handling the act of providing answers.”

sometimes i wish i could erase my memories and just go back to june 2021 when i was ignorant of what would soon come

My optimism quickly became thoroughly crushed as most of the series became relegated to recapping things that I had already seen twice before. Sotsu recaps Gou’s first four arcs with changes that are inconsequential in progressing the story or further developing characters than what is surface level. But just saying that it is bad purely because it recaps ignores the finer details. When actually breaking down Sotsu’s arcs, most of it is actually composed of new content. Recapping even as a concept isn’t something new to Higurashi. One of Higurashi’s best arcs, Meakashi-hen, recaps Watanagashi-hen for a lot of its story. In a more comparable example, Gou pulled a very similar trick for its first three arcs, and while those arcs are still questionable in terms of quality, there is still an ocean of difference in storytelling of Gou’s recaps to Sotsu’s recaps. Sotsu's recapping problem isn’t a problem of the recapping itself. Rather, it ends up being such an issue due to it being a culmination of multiple core issues that made the story irreparably broken from the very start.

The biggest positive take away from both Gou and Sotsu is the interweaving character arcs of Satoko and Rika. The deep dive that Nekodamashi-hen and Satokowashi-hen took into the two of them made a lot of what Gou does best at. After Gou though, there was only so much room that the story could take for the two of them. After those two arcs, the two characters were nearing the end of their character arcs. Gou was setting up Sotsu to conclude their arcs, but there was a major problem. With Sotsu’s 15 episode length, the series can’t stall Satoko and Rika’s growth to the point of unwatchability. Looking back on the original series, this issue seems irrelevant. While each story arc usually centered around one character, overall, it was about the people of Hinamizawa. The ensemble cast of Higurashi is part of the reason why it even works so well. Beyond all of the gore and horror, there is a unifying message of friendship and community that the relationships of every character helps to truly sell. Keiichi, Rena, Mion, and Shion along with Satoko and Rika share equal parts in what makes Higurashi what it is. With this fact in mind, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that Sotsu’s purpose was to justify the inclusion of the rest of the gang in the story. Sotsu does in fact try to go in this direction for most of its episodes. However, it fell completely short of justifying it.

Aside from time spent on Satoko and Rika, Sotsu’s first two arcs, Oniakishi-hen and Wataakishi-hen are dedicated to showing Rena and Mion’s descent at the hands of Hinamizawa syndrome. This shouldn’t be an immediate problem, but it does come off as unoriginal as Rena had already gone through the syndrome in Tsumihoroboshi-hen. Mion going through her fits of paranoia on the other hand isn’t something the series has dipped into before. It is in the execution where things start to falter. In Oniakishi-hen, Rena doesn’t experience a new dive into insanity. Instead, she experiences events that read like a hybrid of Oniakishi-hen and Tsumihoroboshi-hen. While this wouldn’t immediately catch a viewer as something wrong in a vacuum, where things start to become far more egregious is with Wataakishi-hen. Since Mion hadn’t gone through the syndrome, she had the most potential of having a story be something that was truly unique. Instead of something truly tailored to her character, she gets an arc very similar to Shion’s in Meakashi-hen but instead of Satoshi, Mion goes crazy over Keiichi. Even though they are twins, Shion and Mion are very different characters. The massive gap between their personalities should say that by itself. To see Mion go through an arc so similar to her sister’s shows a disregard for what potential a story where she is the one taken over by paranoia can have. The existence of Hinamizawa syndrome plaguing someone usually shows the deepest insecurities of a character that get revealed more and more as they succumb to it. This complex nature of the syndrome gets lost in Wataakishi-hen since it shows a very simplistic outlook on Mion’s character that conflicts with what she actually would be like. 

Aside from the lack of respect to Rena and Mion being shown here, these two arcs don’t really reveal much in terms of new story details. A lot of the reveals from these arcs are shallow mysteries that could easily be understood by Gou’s reveal of Satoko being a villain. The reveals given are usually ones that can only lead to mild satisfaction rather than something that can carry a story. In a series previously flourishing with bombastic unpredictable moments, the series quickly becomes something that is a boring predictable slog. Up until the series caught up to post-Gou Episode 17, it only really took a little bit of thinking to what the series would mostly be made up of for the first 13 episodes. The first 56 seconds of a meme video predicting the plot of Sotsu below that released after Gou ended shows this accidentally showed Sotsu’s predictability. 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2StEd1Ivs&t)
this video contains some umineko spoilers after 0:56 if you don’t want to see it

The first 56 seconds were created in a very non-serious manner. But it also provides a look into the mentality of many of what Sotsu was going to be in between the last episode of Gou and the first episode of Sotsu. While we may have expected a recap of this nature, the expectation more relied on it being something very quick. But with how the meme plays out, it unintentionally achieves just as much plot progression as Sotsu does in its first 13 episodes. While a lot of the details are incorrect, it doesn’t end up mattering by the end. Since most of the reveals in the first 13 episodes end up being so inconsequential, the end result of the first half of the meme and the first thirteen episodes of the show end up being nearly identical. The general events of Sotsu are a skeleton of a much larger story. It is easy to see what that skeleton was going to be after watching Gou. This skeleton needed flesh and tissue to this skeleton for it to even function. Sotsu ended up just being the skeleton. With only bones and nothing else. With the barren skeleton of Sotsu, it may not technically be a full recap of Gou’s first few arcs, but it may as well have been.

After Oniakishi-hen and Wataakishi-hen came Tatariakishi-hen. It ended up being more of the same as the first two arcs. In terms of every arc that came before the events of Gou Episode 17, this was probably the best one. It should be noted though, that is only on account for it primarily featuring Satoko, who at this point is one of the only interesting characters left. Even then though, her character development stalls until the end of Episode 10 where one Sotsu's actual moments of intrigue occurs. She isn’t in a position for her character to progress far ahead yet, so she stays static for the most part aside from the aforementioned end of Episode 10. Teppei isn’t that interesting compared to Gou, since most of what made him intriguing in this series happened in Gou Episode 23. With that mini redemption arc over, he doesn't exactly have much to grow past that. While I am glad that the framework set up by Gou made his turn to a good guy make sense, that doesn’t stop Sotsu from feeling dry when developing him. Ooishi suffers from a similar problem as Mion in Wataakishi-hen but to a less disrespectful degree. Ooishi under Hinamizawa syndrome is more just a surface level understanding of what he probably would do when affected rather than a new interesting direction for his character. At least there wasn’t a fundamental misunderstanding as to who they are unlike Mion. Tatariakishi-hen doesn’t introduce any more problems, but it just continues old ones. This can also be applied to the first half of Kagurashi-hen. In my personal experience of the arc, Tatariakishi-hen represented the point as to where I realized that this season was going to fall remarkably under my expectations no matter what happened. There was nothing much to do but wait for the end where something good may actually happen.

When looking at it all back, it becomes extremely hard to either justify why or explain how this even happened. Why would Sotsu slow its plot into oblivion to the state that it is like this? This can be drawn down to Sotsu’s converging priorities. With how characters other than Rika and Satoko are treated in Sotsu, it is clear that there is little interest in developing anybody else except for them. On the other hand, the series is also aiming to be similar to the original Higurashi, by being in the same general location of Hinamizawa as well as the month of June 1983 for a plurality of the runtime. This desire for familiarity is what I assume led to the conspicuous marketing of Gou as well as Gou’s first cour being composed of arcs that draw most of their plot from arcs that already happened. A familiar setting for Higurashi also will naturally require the ensemble cast of Higurashi to primarily be featured. This is where these two goals start to clash. With the apparent lack of interest in anybody except for Satoko and Rika, there would be no way for the familiar setting of Hinamizawa to work well with the story being told. Since Hinamizawa is linked to the people that live there, setting a story in Hinamizawa would mean to show the stories of those residents as well. However, the story doesn't care to do so, leaving the plot in a predicament that could only end in absolute failure. Gou managed to circumvent this by mostly setting Satokowashi-hen outside of Hinamizawa and having its first cour have at the very least, a slight allure of mystery. By Sotsu, this house of cards completely collapses in on itself. The story has to include Rena and Mion arcs, but it gives off the impression that it doesn't care enough to truly invest the effort into making those arcs truly worthwhile. 

After the grueling slog of Episodes 1-13, Episode 14 actually manages to be something exciting for once. Finally the continuation of the series after Nekodamashi. This episode actually manages to capture the quality of the second cour of Gou in just one concentrated instance. But if there is one image that can describe Sotsu’s main problems, it is this one.

It depicts one of the bouts of Satoko and Rika as they clash with Onigari-no-ryuuou. As good as this moment is for both Satoko and Rika, there is nobody on screen except for the two of them. As a matter of a fact, throughout all of the fragments where they fight, other characters don’t appear in all but one. The junkyard at this point is an empty stage just to serve in this battle. As good as this episode is, it can’t save what is already here. Episode 14, and I’d even say Episode 15, were each very good episodes. I feel extremely satisfied with the conclusion for the two of them, no matter how flawed it is. However, Sotsu’s primary purpose was not to make the last two episodes good. After Gou, that became nearly guaranteed. Sotsu’s purpose was to justify the existence of everything outside of that. But it failed to do that purely because it didn’t care enough to actually do so.

I usually like to end negative reviews like these on a hopeful note, but for the longest time, the series screwing itself up this badly near the finish line made it hard to hope for this type of thing. Against all odds though, there is something to hope for.



The Higurashi Gou manga is diverging from the anime. After Nekodmashi, instead of Satakowashi, there is going to be an alternative story, called [Higurashi Jun](https://anilist.co/manga/139623). Maybe it is just that this series has conditioned me to pray for miracles, but I have hope for this. From the little I know about the Gou manga, I know that it at least goes on a far more focused course than its anime counterpart. My hope is that the manga can provide a better resolution for what Gou had set up to provide an emphatic conclusion that a series like this needs. I need at least something to reinvigorate my passion for this show again.

But ignoring the manga, Sotsu has to be one of the most underwhelming anime that I have ever seen. It is torn between two different goals that end up ripping itself apart. It has no regard for characters other than the ones that it wants to develop. It stalls to such an extreme that any good qualities that it has get severely dampened. It was facing tragedy, and did absolutely nothing to stop it. As it stands, this series is broken. And with the high hopes I had going into this, that is very disappointing.

149883,"Adopting a cat isn't an easy endeavor, let alone if it's a kitten. You can't just take it home because you feel bad for it or simply because of its cuteness. There are many things to consider before doing so. First, determine whether it's a lost cat, feral or stray one. Then, find nearest vet if it looks sick or injured. Also, be prepared to provide its food, water and other necessities. Even after weighing all these matters, commitment to take care of it for the rest of its life sounds hard for some people. It's a time, energy and resources-consuming activity so it's a really big decision to make.

But what if that cat doesn't need much maintenance and better yet, takes care of you instead? That’s the main premise of Dekiru Neko wa Kyou mo Yuuutsu (The Masterful Cat Is Depressed Again Today)

Meet Saku Fukuzawa, the main heroine of this show. On the surface, she's an office worker you wish to be. Dependable, reliable, respected by coworkers, she has an ideal image of what an office lady should be. Not to mention that she's good at taking care of herself and cooking... or so we thought. Turns out there is a great support behind this great figure: her cat. Her coworkers are aware that she pets a cat, but little they know it's not just your average black cat; it's a masterful one named Yukichi.

Yukichi was a nameless kitten when Saku found him under a snowy bench. In a half-drunk state, she named the cat (which on second thought, is pretty clever one) and took him home. Later, he discovered that her flat was such a mess. This poor kitten actually could just run away from that place, but there's something in her that made him stay instead: her warmth. Yukichi then was determined to make himself a masterful cat for her by growing big and learning to do house chores. Many times passed and now Yukichi is good at housekeeping and cooking, while Saku has a better lifestyle and works hard to buy her cat canned foods. This is where the adventure of their mundane life begins.

Besides the main casts’ dynamic, I find the story surrounding our leads pretty engaging too. From coworkers to neighbors, humans to cat (yes, Yukichi isn’t the only cat here), supporting casts brought something different to the table which keeps the slice of life element fresh. At the same time, the comedy aspect doesn’t feel repetitive and I had a good laugh while watching it.

The animation is... very GoHands, I guess? I don’t have much experience with series from this studio so not a lot can be said here. One thing I can say though is this studio seems to love flexing what they excel at in the first minutes of the show they work on. GoHands also loves to put their 3D CG treatment to the background art, combined with art style for the characters which looks soft and comforting. Never thought it would blend well here, making this anime is just nice to look at.

The music is another thing I love from Dekineko. It’s notable in most scenes and manages to build a fitting mood for the story. As for OP and ED, both are a feast for eyes and ears. Uryou Mon ni wa Fuku Kitaru by somei has a cheerful vibe that compliments the opening sequence. On the other hand, asmi’s Hakai Zenya no Koto as ending theme leans towards slow and chill vibes. It’s a song you’d listen to with earphones on while walking home from work.

Moving to voice acting department, this show's seiyuus really understood the assignment. I'm in awe of Yui Ishikawa's performance as Saku Fukuzawa. Despite having her character whine at times, she's still good at delivering a bulk of dialogue. The same goes for Hiroki Yasumoto who did a good job of voicing Yukichi. He really sounds as if a big cat could talk, although everyone in this show only hears his gasp, grump and 'kuh-kuh-kuh' laugh most of times. Side characters' voice designs are likeable too, especially the minimarket manager with his over enthusiastic tone towards Yukichi. Feels like every VA working in this project had a good time when voicing their respective character, and I love it!

That said, Dekiru Neko wa Kyou mo Yuuutsu is a fun little comedy anime with slice of life elements mixed in. I’m glad to follow each episode when it premiers, and it’s truly a good show for the end of the week. Even if you don’t have a pet, I’ll recommend this anime to those who crave something relaxing and undemanding to watch."
177,"Tsubasa Chronicle is a shounen title based on the manga from female mangaka group CLAMP. It tells the tale of Syaoran and Princess Sakura, two young adults who live in the kingdom of Clow County. Syaroan is the adopted son of Fujitaka Kinomoto, an archaeologist who introduces Syaroan to the world of mining. One evening, the ruins where an archaeological expedition are taking place glow with a mysterious power. Syaroan investigates this and finds Sakura there in a hypnotic state. Her memories are soon scattered from her to different dimensions (or worlds) in the form of feathers. Additionally, strange soldiers with elongated claws soon appear in Clow County and go after Sakura and Syaroan. With the assistance of Yukito, the high priest, Syaroan and Sakura are transported to the location of the Dimensional Witch, Yuuko. There they obtain Mokona, a small white rabbit creature who can teleport between worlds, to aid them on their quest. Also joining them are two others who have been teleported to the Dimensional Witch – Fai, a magician who’s escaping his home country in fear of a king, and Kurogane, a swordsman who was transported against his will to the Dimensional Witch and who wishes to return to his home world.

Tsubasa Chronicle is an interesting anime on account that it features characters found in CLAMP’s other works. Sakura and Syaoran, for example, are main characters in CLAMP’s famous manga Cardcaptor Sakura. The characters aren’t necessarily “reused”, as they have different backstories from their other material, but their personalities are roughly the same. As of this review, I am not familiar with the entirety of CLAMP’s character lineup, so a few cameo appearances may have gone over my head (such as Mokona’s excited reaction to knowing who the Amen’osa are in Episode 11). That said, Tsubasa Chronicle isn’t, to my knowledge, a sequel of any show nor depends on previous manga knowledge to watch, so they serve more as fan-service than something crucial to understanding the show.

CLAMP’s idea for the show is another point of interest. The concept of jumping between worlds has lots of opportunities to let creativity fly. Though I won’t say that wasn’t met (since this is really relative to whoever is viewing the anime), it left me feeling more disappointed than amazed. I would like to say the problem stems from CLAMP being overly ambitious in their pursuit, having a lot of ideas but not really knowing how to execute them. As a result, it left me trying to find ways to generate hype and excitement instead of it naturally coming from watching the anime.

Some of these problems lie mainly with the characters. Fai is running away from his home world, but it is really unclear why outside of that the king wants to get him. The king is shown trapped in some crystal at the beginning of the anime, but how he got there and what else is going on in Fai’s world is a mystery. Fai could be a traitor or maybe someone wrongly accused of something, but after 26 episodes, it still remains unknown. Despite Fai being known as a magician, he doesn’t use any magic in this series. This isn’t because he lost it, but more to the fact that with his “tattoo” gone, he refuses to use it. As the episodes progress, it seems Fai is more in place to be the “yang” to Kurogane’s “yin” – a balance in dynamics more so than an actual character. Kurogane is a more explicit example – in a flashback, it is revealed that he has a curse upon him by the princess of his land. Due to Kurogane’s violent nature, this curse’s effect is that Kurogane gets weaker with every person he kills. This is an idea that can be explored as a way of Kurogane learning about inner strength as opposed to just outer strength. Despite this, these opportunities are passed by – not once does Kurogane kill someone in this series. Considering his alarming backstory (killing countless people just to prove he was the strongest in the land), the fact that he’s so reserved in the present is a rather sudden shift. To me, it would be more effective to see the results in action (such as Kurogane losing against opponents we know he could defeat) rather than have a constant fear of what the consequences would look like.

Tsubasa Chronicle also has a heavy use of supernatural elements. These can add a bit of flavor to an anime but I’m not too fond of them here. The problems with the magical powers stem from how they’re used in each of the worlds. In the first world, animal-like familiars called “Kudan” assist the citizens in fights or day-to-day life. The main party also receives these Kudan, but because of the lack of depth they are given in this “arc”, they feel more like a way to resolve a plot or continue the story than the spiritual extension that they are supposed to represent. Consider Fai’s Kudan – it appears for one scene only and is only used to help Fai fly to the top of a building. That’s not the only time magical elements make a singular appearance. Supposedly, Mokona serves as a magical “translator” for the party so they can understand each other – when removed from the group, they cannot communicate with one another. This only happens in the first arc after Mokona is temporarily away from the party. Since the range of Mokona’s power is unknown, and also considering the party splits occasionally with no issues in translation, this feels like an issue that was forgotten and used to add tension to the one scene it was present in. You could argue that this feeling of false tension happens a lot in this series. During the tournament episode (which, according to what I’ve read, is a filler episode!), Fai warns the party that the fighters of this region can shoot lightning from their hands! Instead of feeling uneasy for our heroes, we see Kurogane brush off the attack like it was nothing and Syoaran dodging these wild shots with ease. No tension is truly felt because our characters don’t have to worry about the threat. It takes the idea of a tournament full of tough fighters and trivializes it. Perhaps Fai disqualifying himself and Kurogane for stepping out of the ring without an actual fight summarizes it best. These are but a few of the instances of Tsubasa Chronicle putting more stock in the fact that it has magic rather than knowing how to properly use it.

The animation studio for Tsubasa Chronicle is Bee Train. Though the backgrounds and scenery are pleasant as is, the animation quality is little more than mediocre. Long stills are used frequently in the first half and CLAMP’s style of drawing people (long limbed and thin people) can look rather goofy in some of the mid-shots or long shots. Even during key frames, there is still something to be desired. During most of the emotional or serious scenes, the characters display neutral or mute faces. This makes the characters look like they don’t care about what’s happening. There are times when some fluidity occurs in the animation, but it’s far and few between episodes. As for sound, the music is a bit sparse but it has a decent amount of variance. There’s a female chorale piece that wouldn’t sound too far out of place on the later Madoka Magica soundtrack, a sad string piece, and a moody jazz arrangement amongst one or two other tracks. They’re not bad, but the limitations are present and I fell out of favor with some of the music due to it being played too often (the female chorale piece in particular). Opening BLAZE is a mid-tempo pop rock piece with a piano hook while ending Loop by Sakamoto Maaya is an OK acoustic guitar ballad. The seiyuus don’t display a whole lot of emotion, which again hurts the heavier scenes and makes them fall flat. The way Makino Yui (seiyuu of Sakura) says “Syaoran-kun” sounds the same in almost every scene and at times even got a bit grating to hear.

Overall, I give Tsubasa Chronicle a 3.5/10. I was hoping to find more favor with this series as opposed to when I read Cardcaptor Sakura but it appears it was not the case. Perhaps those that are more familiar with the CLAMP-verse will enjoy it more than I did. Outside of that, I cannot recommend this title.

147885,"Play It Cool, Guys is a true comfort show to me. Like a warm and cozy blanket, I feel at home. 

Iyashikei anime, also known as shows that focus on healing the audience, are amongst some of my favorites. Play It Cool, Guys goes a step further by introducing us to a bunch of cute guys of varying ages that are just super clumsy in their own way. And let me tell you that every one of their interactions with each other is truly entertaining to watch. In fact, I don’t have a favorite amongst the boys because they’re all so special in their own way. This may sound like a reach but in a way, this is similar to the found family trope to me. The boys feel supported and happy while they're together. They motivate each other, do fun stuff together and have good conversations. Even when another person is added to the group later on, everything remains the same. It feels like they've known each other for years, their bond is beautiful to watch. They're truly themselves while together. The show also excels at both the funny moments and the more serious moments. It discuses expectations for the future, living in the moment and what a certain friendship means to you.

There’s definitely more to this show than the amazing characters. The studio behind it also invested much time and effort into bringing these characters to life and provided the show with a warm and sincere atmosphere. I'm honestly really surprised as I was not sure if they were going to nail it, but they sure did! The color palette is comforting, and the soundtrack is tranquil. Both OPs and EDs are amazing and tell a story in their own way. Furthermore, the animation is smooth, and the comedic timing is well done. All in all, a feast for the eyes!

The episodes are quite short, you’ll feel sad once they are over. While mostly episodic in nature, I would say that there’s still a cohesive plot going on and different episodes are interconnected. I was truly NEVER bored. 

To be honest, I’m sad while writing this. Having been watching this show since October 2022 and it suddenly being over is making me feel melancholic. That’s how much I loved Play It Cool, Guys. I think this show will entertain many different people, so if you’re in need of something comforting and relaxing please give it a try. As for me, I'm going to miss my boys tremendously. I’m planning to read the manga to fill the void!

267,"I can't say I'm too well-versed when it comes to the mafia. My knowledge primarily stems from popular culture, which I'm sure glamorizes some aspects and trivializes others. However, I'm confident that the most vital element in the mafia is the concept of trust. When you're doing illegal activities, for your own sake or for someone else's, a traitor can easily collapse an insurmountable amount of hard work. The mafia in Gungrave are no exception. The members of Millennion, the mafia that rules the underground activities of the city Billion, are all bound by the ""Code of Iron"". This code has a simple definition - never betray lest you be killed. Simple in theory, but in practice, the message can be blurred or disobeyed when members feel they are above the code. Gungrave, for better or for worse, documents these decisions in a tale that tackles trust, friendship, freedom and family over the course of 26 episodes.

The hardest part of reviewing Gungrave stems from its first episode. Unlike some introductions, where they tease what's to come or try to hint at the protagonist's success, Gungrave flat out tells the viewer of many spoilers of what happens and can ruin the buildup of key plot points. For this review, I will be pretending this first episode doesn't exist so as to avoid any ""spoilers"". I suggest new viewers to do the same until they reach Episode 18.

Gungrave documents two young men, Harry MacDowel and Brandon Heat, as they rise from the dirty slums of Billion City through the ranks of Millennion. While Harry's goal is to obtain a Robin Hood like freedom, being able to take and give away as much as he wants, Brandon is along initially for support and for the chance to see his crush, Maria, more often. These roles are reflected in their personalities, with Harry being a charismatic individual while Brandon is a quiet, near mute figure. It can be a bit worrisome when a character is silent a majority of the time in a work, as they can feel more like a ""blank canvas"" than an actual character. Fortunately, Brandon's actions do a far better job voicing his feelings. His loyalty to Millennion is shown early on by accomplishing unpleasant internal affairs as well as risking his life as a sweeper more often than most in the business. Harry and Brandon play off of each other as you'd expect good friends to and their opposite behaviors form a nice contrast that makes them great to watch.

Of course, the other characters of the story are no small fry either. Initially, the characters of Millennion show interesting and human characteristics that make the story feel more real. Big Daddy, the leader of Millennion, is not a scary power-fueled boss as much as a guy who started the organization to protect the ones he cares about (the irony is dampened when Millennion's trust is put in focus). Bunji Kugashira is a lone wolf ""assassin for hire"" who thinks he's above all else in talent, but finds respect in Brandon's abilities and even looks up to him as a older brother. It's true that we don't go too in detail for the supporting cast - after all, this is Brandon and Harry's story - but I did enjoy the early company of these characters just as much as the main characters and was excited to learn more with each episode. 

These character moments aren't just pleasant to watch - they are important for Brandon and Harry. They learn from others what the mafia business is really like and they learn the strengths and weaknesses of each individual working in it. It becomes quite clear that an organization is only as strong as the people who make it up. When underhanded deals and betrayals are made, the impact can not only affect the others in the business but also the ones behind it. Gungrave makes it clear that it isn't a happy story and even when the ""right call"" is made, it can often lead to the despair or downfall of another person. These moments are when the show is the most powerful and interesting. It's not so much a feeling of anguish or sadness as much as it is that of solemn behavior. There's no time to grieve - the show and business must go on.

Unfortunately, Gungrave runs into a dilemma in its story that can either make or break the anime to some. Gungrave's main focus is a serious mafia story but it also dabbles in science fiction. A key element of the show is found in the process of ""Necrolyzation"", a term meaning to bring back those from the dead into strong zombie-men that have high defenses. Like the struggles within Millennion, the show struggles to maintain its story and characters as more of these concepts leak in. I felt that the characters became more ""one-note"" and lost some of their appeal during the second half of the show and the zombie technology and transformations (""Orgmen"") became a bit ridiculous. I could see some people feeling the show was a bit dry and this was a way for it to carve its own identity versus other stories, but I really enjoyed the non sci-fi elements of the show the most. At the very least, the pacing is kept up and the episodes are still enjoyable to watch, even when the show becomes a ""Orgmen of the week"" series.

Another big flaw of Gungrave stems from its animation. I usually am more forgiving towards a series if the animation and pacing are good - it gets me immersed and ready for action! Sadly, Madhouse does a B-grade job when it comes to Gungrave's animation. Some fights during the second half are pretty clean and the use of shading is nice but the lack of fluidity and occasionally awkward drawing can hurt the series more than it should. It's not bad enough to be laughable but it sure isn't the best that Madhouse has done. The music for the show is a bit of an odd one to discuss. I never really felt a strong emotion or power from it - it acted more like a ""texture"" to a scene, trying to enhance it without being noticed (sad violin, expressive guitar, forlorn horn). They don't really work standalone either - I suppose Tsuneo Imahori (who did the music for the series) just wanted it to be support and nothing more. The voice actors do a real good job. They convey emotion well and are very expressive. Major props go to Ryuuzaburou Ootomo for Bear Walken's bass voice and the flamboyant Takehito Koyasu who does the voice of Balladbird Lee.

An interesting aspect of Gungrave comes from the fact that Madhouse adapted it from a video game, rather than a manga or light novel like usual adaptations. The Gungrave video game, funnily enough, scored only middling reviews and was praised most for its character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (of Trigun fame). A glance through some of the gameplay mechanics shows this game is more combat heavy and features even stranger twists than what's shown in the anime. I suppose that director Toshiyuki Tsuru wanted to focus more on the story and character interactions - a smart move considering you can't play an anime.

Overall, I give Gungrave a 6.0 out of 10. It's an addictive and fun show to watch, but I wish it was a bit more down-to-earth overall instead of trying to be a strange sci-fi thriller. However, I may be in the minority - if a mafia tale with a twist sounds like your thing, you should definitely check this one out!

21749,"IBO Season 2 is notorious in the Gundam fan community. If Gundam Seed Destiny had not captured the gold medal for ""biggest fuckup in history"", IBO S2 could easily take the crown. Every positive to S1, is gone in S2. This review will include spoilers. Please, take it on faith, do not watch season 2 and keep reading. If you can't take that on faith, watch season 2 and join me in the suffering pit. 

Starting off with the lighter stuff, let me start with the positives. One, they did not cop out on the implied ending that has been apparent since season 1. Almost every named character in Tekkadan will die, horribly, because they are an underdog that stopped being underestimated. Despite the big fat meme about Orga's death being goofy, everyone who committed war crimes in Tekkadan will get their comeuppance. The fantasy that this team of young boys living by the sword will beat the man and save space, is not happening. They will be crushed by the hierarchy, and their death throes will be heard by no-one. Only the existing power structure, deciding to fix itself, will cause positive change in space. This is totally in step with the setting, the tone, and everything else. You'll occasionally hear people complaining that the big bad meanie general guy didn't get his comeuppance. That's the point. This setting is supposed to be semi-realistic, and that is absolutely in the fantasy department. Item two, is the worldbuilding added by season 2. The fun-but-dumb mobile armor hunt arc vastly expands the world of IBO, so that we can all now pang for an OVA exploring the Calamity War that so names the setting. It sounds like the One Year War on steroids, in the best way. The fight itself, is pretty fun, and the concept that Mikazuki is becoming increasingly physically dependent on Barbatos to function is fitting of the setting. So, onto the bad.

On the negative side, most everything else. Characters, pacing, narrative, twists, suit design, storyboarding... it's an across the board drop from season one. Instead of tediously explaining how each one of these things is a mess, let's laser in on one example that demonstrates all of these things: McGillis' finale. Whereas the Tekkadan sendoff is totally appropriate to the setting, this shit just leaves you scratching your head. Grand chessmaster McGillis, the architect of almost all of season 1 and 2, has invented a master plan to take total control of Gjallarhorn and restore liberty to space: after getting turned on by how hardcore Mikazuki is at murder, he concludes that activating and piloting a nostalgic artifact of Gjallarhorn will magically sway every single soldier to serve him. His grandmaster plan to completely upend the social order in space...is to steal one mobile suit and declare himself winner. He does this with a minor contingent of soldiers, a small mercenary band, and no political power beyond his own seat at the big boy's table. He proceeds to get the everloving shit kicked out of him in every possible way, including his friend / adoptive brother getting to come back from the dead and kill him. He gets his suit, then everyone laughs at his dumb strategy and shoots at him. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how absurdly stupid this plan is. It is possibly the dumbest plan in Gundam history, possibly the dumbest serious plan I've ever seen in an anime. It permanently annihilates his character beyond any recovery. How is this paced? Very suddenly, because it is apparent there's a fight in the writer's room and they can't make up their minds. How is this storyboarded? I hope you like bright lights bumping into each other in the distance, because IBO is still struggling to manage its budget again. Want new suit designs? Too bad, there are still two skeletons available to any given mobile suit, and it's almost always the Valkyrie frame. Twist? The twist is that McGillis is a fucking idiot and apparently was lucky to get as far as he did. 

S2 IBO hurt me more than most shows do, but I can't go lower than 5. There's enough quality scattered in there that it's not TOO bad. Tekkadan's end, Orga getting delusions of grandeur, the escape of what few survived Tekkadan, the fun Armor fight, they keep you going to the end. IBO underperformed in merch sales and is widely mocked in Japan and parts of the western audience. The setting has been exiled to a mobile, presumably to never return.

""The quickest way to achieve happiness is to avoid looking at reality."" Very true. It's the quickest, and easiest way. But it's not the only way. I now know that one can have a reasonably happy life even in the bleakness of reality. Not that I have all the answers, or that there's one simple answer. For me, it's about allowing myself to feel good and being ok with letting myself enjoy things. Simple things even. Maybe things we take for granted in many cases. It's ok to be a little selfish. You have to be, because nobody but you is really going to be able to make you happy. Of course, it's also possible to be happy by staying in delusion. Many people pick this path. I try to avoid it though.

Denpa teki na Kanojo does an amazing job in my opinion on [sic] creating characters that can be psychologically manipulated (Namely, the antagonists.)
The character that does the manipulating- it's questionable how she does it, but with that aside - is very good at what she does, the writing is very smart.
Mainly in episode two, where the protagonist manipulates the antagonist by using the antagonist's mentality of reality as a measure to change the antagonist's perception of her own reality, instead of common law, or common sense that many shows try to force down the antagonist's throats. That was something I have not seen in a production, or at least so obviously pointed out, in such a way.
As the show points out very well, people who are psychotic, do not have common sense, or the same type of common sense that most people have (Obviously), but to understand enough one others psychology to the point of using it to manipulate, is not pointed out in productions like this very often.

Happiness can be found in literally any situation, you just need to be willing to look for it and recognize it.
Having a purpose in life also is important. Some people focus so much on trying to be happy that they ironically become unhappy every time any little thing doesn't go their way. When you have a goal, it becomes less about worrying if you are having a good or bad day, but more anticipation about the next step in your mission, and if something does go wrong, how you are going to get over it. The other thing to realize is that being perpetually happy is just as bad as being perpetually sad. Humans thrive on variety. Adversity is the relative point that allows us to judge a happy moment as what it is.

Living life little by little as I try to understand how life works. As complex as it is, so as I am, it may take a lifetime to understand. But regardless it is not pointless to pursue a near-impossible goal."

As I want to get all my points across, as well as bring this show the justice it deserves, the following review is a lengthily-detailed breakdown of every factor ranging from the story to the overall experience. You may look for other reviews to find a more concise criticism of the show.

Introduction

When we usually talk about things we truly love, it becomes hard to explain why. Most people would not understand the appeal one would get from something—this is especially hard when trying to relay why your favorite book is your favorite book, or why your favorite film is your favorite film.

In cases, the often reasons for this are because one, we might sound too forceful and biased, and two, we feel that our recommendations are not doing our experiences with the said medium any justice. As such, it becomes difficult for a person to talk about his favorite without trying to sound illogical. This is hard for someone looking for a more grounded response.

This review may contain any form of bias, but I will try my best to address the criticisms one may find with this show, and offer my own insights with regards to it, and why it may be irrelevant to my own judgment. Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you a heartfelt review of my favorite anime, Aria the Origination.

Whenever someone hears the name ""Aria"" thrown around in the anime community, it is often referred to by many as the ""healing anime"". Along with the likes of Mushi-shi and Kino's Journey, it is a type of show one would usually mention as an atmospheric series—to say, a show that relies on its execution of audiovisual stimulations to produce an effect of serenity and immersion into the world it's trying to present. It may rely more on enveloping the viewers with its artistic presentation rather than plot progression.

True enough to what people claim it is, Aria is a franchise that needs some patience getting into, which can lead to either one of two things: 1) You feel like you belong with the show, or you become attached to it, or 2) You get bored. Atmospheric anime, after all, take its 20-minute episode runtime to dive in with intentionally slow pacing, allowing the audience to let its philosophy or environment sink in. Of course, this would not pose true for others, who may have a different preference for how things should be presented.

Despite that, I can still say with courage that everyone should still watch Aria. Whatever one person may gain out of it, the series still provides lot of ground for one to get immersed or be appreciative of, whether it may be the story, its characters, its world, or its music.

Story and Characters

>""Lots of things change with the flow of time.""

With 13 episodes, Aria the Origination is the third and final season to the Aria franchise. Three aspiring girls—Akari Mizunashi, Aika Granzchesta, and Alice Carroll strive forward to reach their dreams of being Prima Undines, the highest-ranking tour guides in the gondola services of Neo-Venezia, an exact replica of Earth's Venice situated in the planet of Aqua, or Mars as it was once called.

While the first episodes of the series are episodic and are self-contained tales—again, attributing to its slow and atmospheric nature, Origination retains the mood and flow of its predecessors but handles it with rising intensity with each succeeding episodes. How Animation, the first season, and Natural, the second, were trying to attain that execution, often resulting in an assortment of hit-and-miss episodes, Origination does not. It finally finds its footing and rids of its usually subtle approach to a more well-handled presentation.

However, it does take a considerably inferior beginning, in which the first three episodes can fit in any prior season. Although, after those three episodes, Origination brings new situations and scenarios that provide a refreshing perspective both on the world and its characters. Certain characters get the time to interact with one another in ways unexpected, and it connotes how the cast has developed with time in their own little manners through other characters. It pays a large amount of thankfulness to its previous seasons, and significantly builds on what it began. What follows is a majestic conclusion that makes the story go hand-in-hand with the resolution of the Undines' individual stories.

How Origination works in contrast to the first two seasons is the way it is generally built out. From the beginning up until the end, it reveals a planned direction it's going to take, and as such intertwines these individual tales as essential to the show's overall picture. A major theme that can be recognized from the series is the concept of change—and while it is natural that a story must eventually end, Origination takes the viewers into the eyes of its characters to emphasize how significant this impending change is. Gone will be the days that we see the girls bonding through practice, and the same also poses true for the Undines as they all step forward to face a new tomorrow. This is nothing short of compelling and remarkable, as the use of Aria's episodic strengths into a sequential structure amplifies its impact.

>""But there are things that never change.""

Along with its fresh take on Neo-Venezia, the show prepares to wrap up its story by presenting the final steps the beloved Undines need to face, both in the physical and the emotional sense, as well as expanding and solidifying the relationships they have with their mentors. Every supporting character also gets their fair share of screen time, with great stories surrounding Akatsuki and Al, along with reappearances of characters such as the mailman and Caffe Florian's owner.

Aika reveals a much more realistic side of her, portraying her doubts and fears as the trio's most work-oriented person. While noticeably her focus is relegated to a background character for most of the show, the episodes that do focus on her make up for its well-written setup. Like how Akari affects the people around her, Aika gets her development through her impact with other characters, most especially with Akira. Natural had already done its piece in fleshing out Aika, which may have reduced the necessity to explore her character even further. This series simply leads her into an epilogue as the heir to Himeya.

Meanwhile, Alice's large involvement this time around is monumental not only for the people around her but also for her maturity. Some of the best moments in Origination arguably belong to her, and it surmounts to a satisfying resolution with her initially antisocial demeanor. Bits revolving around Athena's character also show how the two are actually similar, and builds up to a very emotional climax that cements their relationship and solidifies Alice's overall development.

There are many things to be said about Akari's character, but the most subtle yet significant revelation about her is how she actually stands out as an Undine. Aria has always focused on Akari's adventures of the rustic and mystic Neo-Venezia, and thus veered away from depicting her skills as a gondolier. Origination brings her efforts into light, and proves how she is ready to take on the reins of being a Prima.

Another thing to point out about her is the further emphasis of her relationship with Alicia. As the final episode of Natural and the succeeding OVA Arietta sows the seeds through moments where they bond together, it is in Origination where this dynamic between them really blooms—portraying through its scenes how both are influential to one another. Through this, Alicia unravels as a more humane character, as opposed to how the trio perceives her as an unreachable being of perfection.

With the whole theme of Origination revolving around change, Akari, as the audiences' eyes through Aqua, becomes the most affected person within the environment around her. Cheerful and always upbeat, her reaction to these life-changing events pose an internal conflict within her. While she always sees change within the world of Aqua, she has never had the experience to encounter it firsthand—and the way she responds to it shows her strength, and a huge leap for her character to welcome the future that awaits her. In a sense, Origination serves as a journey to hone her as an Undine, one that truly symbolizes the loving and caring welcome of Aqua.

>""Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don't change...both are precious.

>""Don't you feel the same?""

Sound

Origination starts off with another beautiful and calming piece through Yui Makino's ""Spirale,"" setting the tone of this final chapter to the world of Aria. Where Aria the Animation's OP immerses you into the world and Aria the Natural encouraging you to join in its rustic beauty, Aria the Origination's opening song reaches out to you in a nostalgic way. Containing this balance of serene and upbeat elements, it plays in an oxymoronic manner of cheerful and melancholic, much like a prelude to a happy farewell. The ending song, ""Kin no Nami Sen no Nami"" by Akino Arai seems to go along with this theme as well, although with a feeling that is more on looking forward to the future—again, a significant motif in Origination. Despite its departure from the usually calming song equal to that of its OP, it still finds a place to exist within Origination's somber themes, even though it may not fit entirely with Aria's atmosphere.

While it is already undeniable that Aria has great music, it never stopped getting better, and Origination raises the bar with new piano pieces to go along with the original soundtrack. Where Origination stands out against its predecessors is in its well-handled approach to music, never exceeding its use of both instrumental and lyrical pieces. The inserts never seemed off, and everything suited each scene at a most impressive tone.

Two new important tracks cement Aria the Origination as a stroke of genius. Ryou Hirohashi's wonderfully haunting ""Lumis Eterne"" amplifies the climactic scene of Episode 9, evoking a cathartic feeling of tearful bliss and satisfaction. Poetic and symbolic of Alice's character progression throughout the series, this song, much like any other track in Aria's score, acquires its own personality. The other song, ""Yokogao,"" which played in the final episode of the show, is another piece sung by Yui Makino that perfectly captures the essence of Alicia and Akari's relationship, as well as their personal connection to the utopia that is Aqua. While being one of the few melancholic songs in Aria's music, it is still a sublime fit to the scene at hand and Aria's positive and emotional soundtrack.

It is also safe to say that the voice actors do not falter in their side of the job as well, and their takes on the Undines in their most emotional moments are nothing but amazing. Chiwa Saito handles Aika's different emotions with good comedic awareness, along with standout scenes of her serious and melancholic demeanor. Ryou Hirohashi's ""dekkai"" performance-desu of Alice's childish nature is taken in a much more playful way, and her acting is one of the main reasons why Alice had dominated some of the episodes. Erino Hazuki once again lends her voice to the ever-wonderful Akari, and a lot of her contributions to the character from the ""Hahi""s to the ""Ehh""s make her as the only fitting person for Akari's role.

Aside from the main trio, the Three Great Water Fairies Alicia, Akira, and Athena are also reprised by Sayaka Ohara, Junko Minagawa, and Tomoko Kawakami, respectively. While already generally praised for their roles, moments in Origination where these characters are set up in dramatic scenes with their juniors further emphasize their great performances.

Art and Animation

With the transfer from 4:3 to 16:9 beginning from Arietta, the world of Aqua has become wider and immersive than ever. Hal Film Maker continues to work its wonders with stellar and faithful backgrounds mirroring that of real-life Venice. The background department shines with their striking, hand-painted scenery that encapsulates the nearly-ethereal beauty of Aqua, rivaling that of Kozue Amano's original illustrations. Of course, with the series mainly being set in Neo-Venezia—with the exception of an episode that takes place in Neo-Burano Island, set pieces are often used consistently and with less diversity from Natural. It's not to say that they slacked on it, though, as the depiction of the places are not only accurate but also highly detailed improvements to Animation and Natural's already captivating backdrops.

Aside from the major boost in Aqua's scenery, it is also fairly evident how the studio keeps a keen eye for the characters, with small but noticeable changes to their designs. Along with that, Origination feels livelier than other installments, having more motion with its frames and very, very elaborate facial animations in the show's critical moments. The comedic expressions remain a staple of the show, and still carry the bulk of Aria's funniest instances.

This element is not perfect, however, as a 2008 series would somewhat opt to add in CGI to save budget costs. For the most part, the CG in Aria is beautiful and does not really hinder immersion, but there were moments in Origination that it goes beyond using CG water and appears in other elements. Granted, they only appear for two noticeable scenes throughout the show, but these parts were very jarring and could very well be a valid criticism to its animation. Nonetheless, this does not summarize the entirety of the animation, as Origination continues the synchronous blend it has with the soundtrack, initiating a visual and audial experience unlike any.

Criticisms

Wrapping up a series is difficult. While Aria ends in quite possibly the best conclusion possible—and quite frankly, one of the best in anime, there are a lot of things to be pointed at that could have made it a bit more fulfilling.

Character balancing, for example, was noticeably more unbalanced in Origination compared to the first two seasons. While the first season focuses mostly on Akari—as it should, since it's an introduction, the second season diversifies the tales to give the other characters significant depth that they didn't have. It handles every character equally, with the inclusion of the side characters that added more color to the daily adventures in Aqua. Origination tries to shift this focus onto the main trio only, but even in this department it is considerably affected. As aforementioned, Aika does not get as much screen time as she deserves, and while episodes about her are some of the best Aria has to offer, it pales in comparison to the amount of treatment she got in Natural. More importantly, Aika is not the only one to suffer this issue, but to the show's actual protagonist as well. While the last episodes do bring Akari back into the spotlight, the middle part of the show is obviously oriented at Alice, as if the show itself is hinting what is to come for her. It is still a good buildup, and is not necessarily a bad part of the show, as she is underplayed for most of the first two seasons. However, it does betray the point of Origination being a final chapter for all three of them, and it could possibly hamper enjoyment for people expecting a well-rotated character storyline like Natural.

Another important aspect not addressed by Origination was Cait Sith and the mystical side of Aqua. Natural was all about exploring Aqua and building up its characters at the same time, with the introduction of its spirit guardian. It seemed to emphasize that we will see more of Cait Sith's involvement in the story, although it did not turn out to be the case. Origination completely drifted from its magical elements in sacrifice for a character-oriented story which aimed to bring an ending to them rather than to the world.

It could also be said that Origination's subtle but important tone shift to put the cast in situations that are much more emotionally testing than its previous iterations. In service of a plot-driven series, after all, is the necessity for conflict to arise. Yet, to bring up a counterpoint, the drama that stirs from Origination can be felt only if you have found the attachment to the characters. When looked at superficially, the conflicts that are brought up in Origination can barely qualify as drama—and even though the themes may still be somewhat deviant from what the first two seasons offered, they still run under the overall concept of optimism and hopefulness.

With only 13 episodes to end the story, it's honestly surprising that Origination manages to hold out and fill in every aspect it could accomplish in Aria's quite vast world. Not only that, but it ties every loose end about the characters in a very satisfying manner that one can easily overlook its flaws, and indulge in Origination's well-toned balance of drama and the same-old Aria viewers had come to know and love.

Enjoyment and Conclusion

Origination is one of the rare examples of shows that manages to trump expectations from its prequels. What I believed to be Aria's peak in Arietta immediately got dispelled by how Origination mastered its presentation. Other than that, there are few series that get to end on a high note, and this entry to the story of Aqua and its Undines manages to bring its characters into a full circle, despite its hardly noticeable hiccups.

Aria has always been atmospheric, and it pretty much takes the cake as one of the best that handles atmosphere overall, but Origination is the cherry on top, being a conclusion to its well-rounded cast of lovable people. It allows us to appreciate more of the mundane, while also revealing the bigger picture of life.

Some would say that Aria is as saccharine as it can get with its themes, though I would beg to differ. While the franchise certainly is a defining example of things never going wrong, Origination, as it is aptly named, brings us to the beginning of all this happiness—happiness, that you may think is merely blind optimism, but one actually rooted in reality.

It is an enjoyable show—cathartic and introspective. When approaching this, one may need to put aside everything within their to-do list, and the time to be alone when watching it. It might seem like a bother, but investing yourself into it is one of the best payoffs one could ever have. Emotionally charged yet void of melancholy, Aria the Origination can easily bring anyone to tears with its innocent and caressive approach.

Seagulls fly into the sky as the fresh wind coming from the sea dances through your hair. The campanile tolls its bell, echoing throughout this city of stories. Neo-Venezia is a place filled with wonders and history, and one can easily get lost in the countless experiences you could have. Yet fear not, as someone is always there for you. People of different places and of different journeys, cross paths in this place of miracles.

Aqua may seem like an unattainable dream—a place of mere escapism. However, as long as someone welcomes anything before them, whether good, whether bad, like how Akari welcomed Aqua, and how Aqua welcomed her back, there will always exist a Neo-Venezia deep within our hearts.

Simply put, Aria is a masterpiece—the quintessential slice-of-life show. Rife with characters and stories that are intertwined in this euphoric utopia, Origination brings all of these great moments together, and reaches out to us playfully. Definitively, it is a one-of-a-kind experience you could not afford to miss."
21116,"Ecchi has never had a big presence in the wide niche genre Yuri, or Shoujo Ai as it’s more accurately called. Yuri has always been a genre that I’ve always leaned toward the “erotic” side than the actual “romance” one, only because most anime tend to be too sugarcoated with soap opera quality stories. That doesn’t mean that there can’t be any good ones. I think yuri fans deserve better than Valkyrie Drive Mermaid if they want their “dumb ecchi anime.”

If I had to describe the quality of Valkyrie Drive Mermaid in a very short statement, it would be, “Not even trying.” What does it not bother to try? It is an entertaining ecchi anime. The boobs, butts, curves, kissing and tripping all amount to pure nothingness. None pack any charm or sensibility that generally makes ecchi anime exciting escapism. Whether it be from really poor comedic timing or the characters being incredibly stale and formulaic, upon further examination, the latter seems to be the biggest culprit than the former.



It’s not even that none of the characters have any profound characterization that makes them stale. It’s the fact that their personalities, created by their dialogue and actions, are completely devoid of any humanity to them. A few of them even top my list of the worst characters of 2015. These characters are Mamori Tokonome and Mirei Shikishima. Mamori being the biggest crux of them all, is by far one of the most annoying characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of seeing and listening to. It isn’t just the bad, shrill voice performance by Mikako Izawa that makes her insufferable, but also how completely one-note her character is. All of the characters suffer from being one-note, but she takes the cake from her just being a character. Mirei kisses to gain power and be mocked because her name is the same as “virgin.” When something isn’t that clever the first time does not mean it will be funnier five more times.

Mirei Shikishima does do more than our damsel Mamori. However, her development is predictable when she is introduced as a silent character. You could replace her with a cardboard cutout of her, and it wouldn’t make much of a difference; that is how wooden her archetype is. The other characters, besides our two main ones, fall into similar territory. Our only male character in the anime, without spoiling anything (but you can probably guess anyway.), has one twist that comes off as so laughably random. Nothing can distinguish that character other than that noticeable moment before or afterward. The only character that was only semi-intriguing was Meifon Sakura because (1) she is voiced by Yurika Kubo, so I could imagine Kayochin from Love Live doing the things Meifon is doing and (2) she has some charisma that feels genuine.



Setting aside the other characters that are too forgettable even to bother reminiscing, the art is somewhat interesting to look at. On the one hand, the animation feels as though Studio Arms was going on a lower budget than what they usually work with. As much as the girls' gorgeous art designs are nice to look at, I don’t think there was enough material to go around to make these designs blossom. The first episode alone had way more dumb ecchi service than all of the episodes combined. Instead, we are forced to sit through the most contrived story that one can get from an ecchi anime; hell Ikkitosen at least had interesting lore to it that made it intriguing. Valkyrie Drive Mermaid has little to no meat to its story that garners any praise.

Indeed, I don’t watch many yuri anime that come out once or twice a year. I have not seen the great classics like Oniisama e…, Maria-sama ga Miteru, or even Yuru Yuri to appreciate the genre fully. Valkyrie Drive Mermaid seems like one that openly insults the genre. It comes across as, “Well, let’s just put a Shoujo-Ai element to this so that we can attract this niche audience to make money off of.” No, not even putting an ecchi spin on it will somehow make it somewhat different or unique when there is nothing to it. It is lazy implementation as one can get when watching this rubbish. As much as that one episode with the colossal naked girl at least gave me a single ray of sunshine in the mix, that was still not enough after it was over.



You know you've done goofed when you can’t entice me, the self-proclaimed ecchi connoisseur, with boobs and butts. Describing Valkyrie Drive Mermaid in one word is “soulless.” Soulless in every sense of the word. Boobs and butts that have no soul in them might as well not be boobs and butts at all.

This Review Contains Talk of Pedophilia and Sexual Harassment  

I don’t normally say the whole “I don’t have a problem with people who like this show” spiel, before I criticise something. I always found stuff like that condescending personally. That said, given the nature of this particular show, and the specific things that I want to criticise it for, I will make an exception and say it. No, you are not a bad person if you like UzaMaid! I mean...not by default anyway. Maybe you just like this show as a dark comedy. Or maybe you just don’t assign the same kind of morality to anime that you do to real life. Basically, there are non-creepy ways of enjoying this series, and if you do, good for you. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk about the actual show.


 When I first heard of UzaMaid! and read the plot synopsis, I’ve immediately written it off as…let’s just say not for me. Honestly, a part of me still can’t believe that I actually did sit through the whole damn thing in the end. So why the change of heart? Well, you see I’ve actually heard some people on various websites coming to the show’s defence and voicing a belief that UzaMaid! is actually just an incredibly dark comedy. And so I took some interest in it, wondering if it would be possible to get something funny out of a premise so uncomfortable. I can honestly say that I approached this one willing to give it a chance.

 Truth be told, after the first two episodes, I was not exactly hating it. Was I having a good time? Not really, as most of the humour made me cringe more than laugh, but I could see where the appeal of lied. It seemed like the people defending this show as just a bit of dark humour were not wrong at least.

 And then Episode 3 happened.

 Something in that episode made me feel more uncomfortable than all of the pedo jokes from the first two combined. Because it was in this episode where the show started to portray the titular maid, Tsubame Kamoi, as a sympathetic figure. That becomes a theme running throughout the show. Every few episodes we get a moment during which we are clearly expected to be happy about her and Misha getting closer. Whether it would be Misha beginning to realise that she is missing Tsubame when she is gone, Tsubame saving Misha from a bear, or generally acting as an emotional support for the little girl. The intent is clear. We are supposed to view Tsubame as a not entirely negative force in Misha’s life. Someone who may be kind of creepy, but ultimately capable of making a positive change. Perhaps even filling the void that was left by the death of Misha’s mother.

 And once I realised that, I could no longer laugh at all.


 Even if Tsubame would not go as far as to force herself onto Misha, that does not make the things she does do to her any less wrong. She keeps sexually harassing this kid, and thinks up multiple elaborate grooming strategies throughout the show (yes, stupid ones, but still). Despite the show’s gross, half-assed attempts at arguing otherwise, Tsubame is a selfish, manipulative pedophile, and the idea of her being an okay influence on Misha in the end is not just insane, it is also disturbing.

 To those who want to tell me that I’m taking this show too seriously, I’m pretty sure the show itself would disagree with you. I won’t go into spoilers, but the entire final episode is highly dramatic and attempts to talk about Misha’s trauma caused by her mother’s death seriously. And Tsubame is presented as her wise, concerned friend and ally. So no, I don’t think the defence of this relationship not being meant to be taken seriously on any level works here. Perhaps, the show itself should not have taken it seriously if that was the intent.

 As a result of all that, whatever development the writers wanted Misha to go through becomes dead on arrival because it all ends up being directly connected to her grossly tone-deaf relationship with Tsubame. Which is a shame because Misha is actually a character, I can see myself liking if she were in a better written series. In the scenes that she does not have to share with Tsubame, she is pretty entertaining. Her sass and deadpan snark got a few laughs out of me when it was not being portrayed as her being “tsundere” for a fucking pedophile.

 And yeah, I certainly couldn’t care less about whatever “sad backstory” they tried to give Tsubame. Look, none of that changes the fact that she is a child molester that the show tries to portray as “just kind of quirky.” Once again, the sheer tone-deafness of that alone is enough to kill any possible investment I could have had in her automatically.


 The other characters are a mixed bag at best. Misha’s step-father, Yatsuhiro gets some moments that would probably be charming in a different show. His main struggle comes in the form of trying to act as good parent to his step-daughter after the death of his wife and Misha’s biological mother. He is in an awkward position as he has to look after and raise a kid whom he has only really known for a little bit, and who, does not resent him, but does not seem to acknowledge him as her father either. I love the idea behind Yatsuhiro’s character, but I just find it difficult to take this story about the difficulties of parenting seriously, in a series the main premise of which is watching Yatsuhiro’s daughter get sexually harassed behind his back, and that harassment being portrayed as endearing. 


 Then there is Misha’s school friend, Mimika Washizaki, and her frienemy, Yui Morikawa. Mimika is largely a nothing character, without much of any personality to speak of outside of being obnoxiously cutesy. Yui is the better of the two, but still not great. She is a fairly typical tsundere, being aggressive and bratty, but having a sweet side. Her primary gag is her frequent challenging of Misha to different sorts of contests, due to her jealousy of how her peers seem to view Misha as cuter than her. Remember how Riko from Dragon Maid was when she was first introduced? Well, Yui is basically that but for the entire show. Is it funny at least? Sometimes. Because of how one-note her comedy is, it grows old rather quickly, but I won’t deny that her ridiculous levels of arrogance and pettiness can be occasionally endearing. Especially in contrast with her sweeter side whenever it shines through.


 There is one character in UzaMaid! whom I can honestly say I found consistently enjoyable and that is Midori Ukai. A past acquaintance of Tsubame, who has been obsessively in love with her ever since. A lot of the comedy she provides is similar to that of KonoSuba’s Darkness, as she is a raging masochist who gets off on just about any form of physical as well as emotional abuse you can think off. Her over-the-top perviness does make for plenty of laughs. Outside of that, she also gets a few moments of being a pleasant and helpful person during some of her interactions with Misha and Tsubame. An all-around fun and charming bright spot, in a show that is otherwise largely devoid of either fun or charm.


 I will give the show credit that it is quite well made. The animation is very fluid and filled with energy and the art style is nice, albeit nothing too remarkable. The music is catchy. Especially the show’s ED which I found surprisingly hard to skip. The voice acting is also solid across the board with Haruka Shiraishi, Manami Numakura, Mao Ichimichi, Shiori Izawa and Masayuki Katou all capturing their characters very well. So did Sayaka Harada (the voice of Mimika) though she was sadly not given much to work with.

 Still, no amount of technical competence or voice acting talkent can save a story as poorly conceived as this. If UzaMaid! wanted to be a weird, creepy comedy, fine. But the moment it tried to be more than that, it crashed and burned, as it did so in just about the worst way it possibly could have. As I said at the beginning of this review, if you are not bothered by the stuff that I was bothered by, and you can just see UzaMaid! as a bit of ridiculous fun, that’s great. The intent behind this review is not to guilt-trip anyone. Still, for me, it was a chore. I have watched UzaMaid! in 2020 and, while not the worst anime I’ve seen that year, it may have been the one I was the happiest to be done with. And one that made me hate my annoying inability to drop shows once I started them the most."

Inuyasha was somewhat of an important anime for me. It was one of the first anime that I went out of my way to watch. It was also one of the first anime that I identified as an anime instead of a cartoon. Thus, Inuyasha was among the shows that cemented my status as an anime fan. I was enthralled by the moody, creepy tone of the show. I was amazed by the seemingly limitless world Takahashi and the anime staff had created. I was drawn in by the spectacular action and the exciting adventure. I loved the cast of characters-that-weren't-named-Shippo. And yes, I of course patiently waited for Inuyasha and Kagome to officially become an item. I fondly remember going to my tiny, local library at the time, downloading episodes so I could watch them later on my Acer Aspire One since I didn't have internet at home. All that said, I wouldn't call Inuyasha my favorite series by any stretch. It's certainly not a bad show, but it does drag and it just didn't grip me the same way Ranma 1/2, Code Geass, or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood did. I'm definitely nostalgic towards Inuyasha, but not to the point where I hold it on a pedestal. 

My history with Inuyasha is important context for my feelings towards Yashahime. In fact, I'd say this is  important context for any review of this show, because from what I've seen, practically no one in the western fandom is watching this show as a standalone. Feelings toward Yashahime seem to be extremely tied to one's feelings towards Inuyasha. At the end of the day, it's still its own show, with strengths and weaknesses unconstrained from its predecessor, but the amount of leeway you're willing to give said weaknesses, the amount of weight you're willing to give said strengths, depends on your view (or lack thereof) of Inuyasha.

I liked Inuyasha enough to immediately be on-board with its sequel series, Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon when it was announced out of the blue in May of 2020. I was optimistic: after all, I was never one to balk at the [mere](https://anilist.co/anime/104051/Magia-Record-Puella-Magi-Madoka-Magica-Side-Story/) [existence](https://anilist.co/review/3981) [of](https://anilist.co/review/5670) [a](https://anilist.co/review/3555) [sequel](https://anilist.co/review/6501). I was just happy to see that Inuyasha would continue in some form and I was excited to watch the next generation of a show that I enjoyed. Making matters better, despite being anime-only, it was stated that original mangaka, Rumiko Takahashi, would be heavily involved in production. This seemed to confirm that, if nothing else, Yashahime would be authentic. To an optimist, this seemed to confirm that Yashahime would be good.

img520()

And I have to say that it was good, or, at least, good enough. It's certainly not perfect by any stretch; but neither was Inuyasha. For better and for worse, this feels like a continuation of Inuyasha, warts and all. Fortunately, I didn't find the warts bad enough to ward me away from the show.

Yashahime, taking place over fourteen years since the end of Inuyasha, follows Towa, her demon-hunting twin-sister Setsuna, (both are the daughters of Sesshomaru) and their bounty huning cousin, Moroha (Inuyasha and Kagome's daughter). When they were young, Towa and Setsuna were caught in a forest fire and seperated from one another. Towa soon finds herself sucked into a time portal and teleported centuries into the future where she is found and subsequently adopted by Sota Higurashi. Despite being a half-demon, she's raised in the modern era and told to hide her powers, much to her chagrin. When Towa is fourteen the portal to the past opens once more, reuniting her with her half-sister, who seems to have forgotten her, as well as introducing her to her cousin. When the trio return to the past, they are summoned by the spirit of the Tree of Ages. The spirit requests for them to slay their father as well as the dastardly Demon Lord, Kirinmaru. The three refuse and after they leave, we see Rin trapped in the Tree of Ages. The trio decide to forge their own path, with Towa deciding to search for the Dream Butterfly, which may hold her sister's suppressed memories. As the three journey, they find themselves clashing with Kirinmaru's servants, who wish to destroy the trio, referred to as ""half-demon princesses"", for their leader.

img520()

I loved the main trio, the eponymous yashahime. I liked Towa's kind and gentle nature, which contrasted nicely with her relatives' more cutthroat and/or cold personalities. It's somewhat underutilized, but I enjoyed the fact that she's a temporal fish out of water in both eras, thus making it more apparent why she clings so strongly to Moroha and Setsuna. I also thought it was really cool that Towa is intentionally not traditionally feminine in design nor personality. It's pretty admirable that the show doesn't feel beholden to restrictive ideas of girlhood, though I suppose Takahashi has always been good at this. Moroha is an absolute treat and she quickly became my favorite Inuyasha character. She's cheerful, endearing in her knowledge of demons, cocky, and rowdy, with her boisterous nature contrasting nicely with Towa, who's more lax, and Setsuna, who's more aloof. She really commands a presence that the other two don't, drawing you into her antics. Finally, there's the aloof, no-nonsense Setsuna. While I admittedly found her a bit boring, I can't deny that I enjoyed seeing her dynamic with the others and it was nice seeing her gradually ""thaw."" While the original cast don't appear too often (a fact I'll get into momentarily), it's always nice when they do. I definitely thought Kirinmaru was a fun antagonist by the end of the show's run even if he seemed a bit bland at first. 

I hope I don't sound negative when I say that the main trio carry this anime — how much you like it is really determined by how much you enjoy their personalities and their dynamic with one another. This statement in-and-of-itself isn't really a knock on the show; it's very clear that, more than anything, the show is preoccupied with the girls' relationship. I personally loved them as a group and even if every interaction wasn't phenomenal, seeing the three interact with each other every week quickly became a comforting ritual. I came to see Inuyasha continuation and I stayed to watch these cool demon girls vibe with one another.

img520(

I'm pleased to say that the world of Yashahime is as interesting as it was before in Inuyasha. It's expansive, with colorful demons around every corner. We also get to learn more about how the world of demon lords work, thanks to the presence of Kirinmaru and his entourage. Yashahime has essentially the same sense of adventure that I know and love. The show's various moods, at times whimsical, sometimes adventurous, and other times creepy, is thanks in large part to returning composer, Kaoru Wada. All of these aspects serve to make the show feel authentic; stylistically, Inuyasha fans should have no trouble getting into Yashahime.
The fights were also pretty good. 9 times out of 10, they're not phenomenal, but they're animated well enough and always managed to hold my attention. Much like its predecessor, the cast of Yashahime use interesting attacks, some of which return from before. There's nothing quite as iconic as the OG cast’s Iron Reaver Soul Stealer, Wind Scar, Wind Tunnel, or Backslash Wave, but I'm sure that's half because I haven't had to hear them for almost two-hundred episodes and half because I haven't heard the new attacks in English. 

And now onto the less good stuff. They're probably more numerous than things I like, and it's a testament to how much I enjoyed the character dynamic that I walked away liking this show overall.

img520(

Before I talk about anything, I have to address the elephant in the room that is the parentage of the twins. In this show, Sesshomaru and Rin (or Sesshorin) is canonized as a ship. It might seem like a minor thing but this has broken the show for many people. Some have even called for Takahasi and Sunrise to be boycotted due to this revelation. My thoughts and justification of said thoughts regarding the matter are irrelevant — you'll have an opinion and my words won't convince you otherwise. While I thought the pairing was really the most logical choice, narratively, on the onset, it's certainly not ideal and I have to jump through some hoops to be somewhat comfortable with it.

As for the show itself, it can feel really meandering. Its monster-of-the-week format doesn't do it much favors in terms of being interesting. Yashahime very quickly shuffles into a routine and if you're not one-hundred-percent onboard with this routine, then it will get boring, eventually. Deviations from said routine are sporadic; there aren't really ""arcs"" that spice things up to look forward to. The plot barely moves forward; during a given episode, it doesn't feel like we're any closer to a goal. Like I said before, how much you like seeing the main trio bounce off of one another will make or break this show for you, because for more episodes than not, that's essentially all you have.

img520()

This is a legitimate critique, but what gets me are people somehow acting like Inuyasha didn't have the same issue. If you take off your nostalgia goggles, you'll realize that the the pacing of Inuyasha was absolutely atrocious. In Inuyasha, things could get boring quickly if you weren't a fan of the monster-of-the-week format. Inuyasha has a metric ton of filler that you probably won't notice as an anime-only watcher because it fits in so well with the format of the original manga. Inuyasha takes forever to reach its destination. There's no reason the manga went on for twelve years for a conclusion that readers largely could predict when they first picked up the manga. Inuyasha is the quintessential ""it's about the journey rather than the destination"" manga, with the character dynamics and development being the main takeaway from the show. If this sounds familiar, you'd be correct: this is Yashahime. If nothing else, Yashahime is on-brand. And it's fine to criticize this show for taking what didn't work about Inuyasha — after all, a sequel should improve upon the predecessor, and Yashahime shows that the Inuyasha format doesn't quite work in the modern age. What annoys me, however, is that people act like these traits aren't in Inuyasha, calling Yashahime an anomaly. Many criticize Yashahime as being ill-defined, which is a bit unfair as Inuyasha took a while for its plot and characters to solidify, yet no one acknowledges it. I can see if this was going to just be one-season, but come on, this is a sequel of Inuyasha, everyone knows it's going to last forever. I have to admit that some of my fondness comes from feeling the need to defend it from the double-standard of many Inuyasha fans…

...but this defense can only go so far. Yashahime certainly has its own, unique problems. For one, I struggled to think of a conclusion for my synopsis, because there's no impetus for a journey. The trio kind of just stumble upon things. While Inuyasha and Yashahime both feel meandering, Yashahime takes the cake for not having a strong, unified goal for the main characters. Setsuna just slays demons as assignments come up and Moroha hunts demons for their bounties. Towa, at the very least, does have the ambitous goal of finding the dream butterfly, but it really doesn't amount to much when she's not actively looking for it. She kind of just tags along with the other two in hopes that she'll just happen to find relevant information. While having them refuse the Tree of Ages’ request did a good job of establishing their characters, it absolutely neutered a solid goal. 

img520()

With the trio consisting of the children of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, you'd think their family would come into play more. This is unfortunately one of the show's big missteps.

The cast of Inuyasha is criminally underutilized; both as characters and as impetuses for the yashahime's developments. It would be nice to see how Inuyasha, Kagome, Rin, and Sesshomaru work as parents. Unfortunately, all of them save for Sesshomaru are indisposed before the show begins and the trio know next-to-nothing about them. This would be fine...if there weren't characters that could logically inform them about their parents. Miroku, Kaede, Kohaku, and Sango aren't ever too far from Setsuna, yet they don't talk to her about her parents. Hell, despite being good friends with them, they don't seem to inquire about their parents, nor indicate that anything's wrong. Towa lived with the Higurashis, yet she doesn't seem to think anything of Inuyasha and Kagome. Towa, Setsuna, and Moroha themselves don't really seem interested in their pasts, which is extremely unsatisfying to watch. This is where the show's relation to Inuyasha really hurts it — if you watched this show first, you wouldn't be attached to the original cast, thus it wouldn't feel so frustrating to see the characters be so blasé about their family. As is, for most viewers, there's a nasty disconnect between what the characters want and what you want the characters to want. Yashahime creates a bit of a mystery as to what happened to the original cast, but it feels cheap because it would be quick to figure out if anyone cared as much as they should. Besides feeling unrealistic, the lack of interest on the girls' part robs them of yet another potential goal.

img520()

The lack of drive from the characters is made all the worse due to the relative lack of stakes. The girls usually can very handily defeat anything that's thrown at them. The characters rarely have to train and in general, nothing feels tense. The pacing certainly doesn't help — most of the time, a conflict is neatly wrapped up in an episode, ensuring that viewers are seldom on the edge of their seat.

By the time you get to the final third, Yashahime starts to feel like it's running on fumes, with the trio the only thing keeping viewers coming back. The showrunners seemed to realize this, as we finally get an episode dedicated to the events with the original cast that led to Yashahime proper. There are also episodes dedicated to Moroha, Setsuna, and the villains' backstories. Unfortunately, while I enjoyed these episodes, they felt a bit too little, too late and I would have enjoyed them more earlier. Additionally, between these more important episodes, there are still episodes that feel extremely inconsequential.

From my laundry list of complaints, it might be hard to fathom my final score (because I know you already scrolled down to see it). You're doubtlessly wondering how in the world can I come out liking this when it ends up being so messy.

As, I said, I really enjoyed the interactions between the three leads. Beyond that, while I'd prefer consistently good quality (or at the very least, having the lull episodes more evenly spread out), the last stretch does make up for a lackluster beginning. I don't dislike the backstory episodes; they just came a bit late for my liking. We finally get two-parter episodes and the last two episodes are really great.

img520()

This culminates in a finale that hits all the right notes for me. We see genuine development from both Towa and Setsuna, the trio's relationship is very well executed, the plot actually moves forward, and there's a breath-takingly awesome fight. The episode is also very visceral — I remember seeing Setsuna's wound and saying, ""oh damn, that's...gnad,"" somehow mixing both ""bad"" and ""gnarly."" Despite the show's flaws, after seeing that wonderful shot of Sesshomaru giving his sword to his daughter and after seeing the post-episode announcement that there’d be a second season ([as I knew it would)](), I knew I'd be coming back for more; not because I felt obligated to, but because I genuinely wanted more Yashahime. This isn't to say the episode was perfect — the strength of the characters are called into question and the motivations are ill-defined, for one. Unlike with [Destiny](https://anilist.co/review/10290) however, thinking about the ending didn't make it unravel for me. I could think about it a bit, understand its flaws, then realize I still love the episode despite them. I appreciated the spectacle before me. The last episode, and perhaps Yashahime as a whole might be a bit of a ""turn your brain off show."" And I hate to say that because it sounds disparaging and the last time I said that, I ended up being [ so very, very wrong](https://anilist.co/review/3675), but I think it applies here. There's not much to [G-Gundam](https://anilist.co/review/3900) but I still love that. Whether you like to admit it or not, Inuyasha wasn't the absolute smartest of shows either, but it worked. Yashahime might not be great, but it's pretty fun at times.

img520()

Yashahime isn't by any means a masterpiece. I wouldn't even call it great. It's meandering to the point of numbness for most of its run, it underutilizes series veterans, character motivations are seldom used to drive the plot, and its adherence to its monster-of-the-week setup can make it extremely monotonous at times. There are times when Yashahime gets downright bad. Despite all this, I don't think Yashahime deserves all the derision and exhaustion that's lodged at it.

I think a lot of the trouble comes from comparing it to Inuyasha. Part of me wants to say that this show is a better watch if you're not so hung up on the fact that this is a sequel to Inuyasha. I want to say that this show works better on its own and that comparison, ever the thief of joy, is what hurts this show, more than anything. But that's a moot point because, as I stated, it feels like practically everyone who watched this show watched Inuyasha. And why wouldn't they? This is a sequel, after all, so even if it should draw-in new fans, it should also satisfy fans of the original show — comparison is inevitable. Finally, and this is the kicker, I'm not entirely sure that the show would be a better watch without the connection to Inuyasha. I'm sure the show is fine on its own, but its biggest draw is its connection to the previous series, regardless of how satisfying that connection ends up being. I don't know if anyone (at least in the Western sphere) would even watch Yashahime on its own. Beyond that, the trio's relation to previous characters and the desire to see them meet said characters is easy engagement and endearment. Just look at my praises; a lot of them come from the fact that this feels like Inuyasha. That said, as I've spent this review showing, this is a double-edged sword, with the handling of the the returning characters, the trio [growing up orphaned](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride), and the SesshoRin situation being just a few points of contention born from its proximity to its predecessor. So, for better and for worse, the show is made and broken by its relation to Inuyasha.

At the end of the day, Yashahime is nothing groundbreaking, neither as a sequel or as a standalone property. The things that work only just offset the many, many things that don't. But what can I say, at the end of the day, this is a show that I enjoyed, despite its flaws. Even if it's not my favorite of shows, like Inuyasha, I can see myself watching this for a long time because of the characters. Yashahime's a hard show to hate, a bit of a hard one to love, but an easy one to like well-enough.

21319,"Have you ever wanted to be able to fly, not by planes, but by a certain kind of shoes? With those kind of conditions, have you ever wondered what it would be like if there was a sport that you only play in the sky? I'm sure a sport like that would be quite enjoyable, especially in this anime. The only reason for me watching it is the artwork, which I thought was very beautiful, but honestly, I didn't expect too much. Needless to say, the moment I planned to include Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, or Aokana for short, among the anime I watched for the winter 2016 season, I had gotten myself in for a pleasant surprise.

Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm introduces to us the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short. Grav-Shoes, which are used to fly for transportation, are also used in this sport. Touch either your opponent's back or one of the four buoys that float above the ocean, and you score a point. This anime focuses on Asuka Kurashina, a girl who is completely new to flying but quickly falls in love with FC. She, along with Misaki Tobisawa and Mashiro Arisaka, joins her school's FC Club and, coached by Masaya Hinata, competes in various FC matches.

The story of Ao no Kanata was quite an interesting one, and I was fully invested in the FC matches that took place within this anime. There are also a decent number of interesting characters that got a decent amount of development throughout the story, like Asuka and Misaki; those two are my favorite characters, to be honest. There is a problem I have involving the characters, though; there are a number of them I personally thought didn't appear as often as they could of. For example, Masaya was the protagonist of the visual novel, but in the anime, he doesn't appear so much; even when he does, he doesn't have much significance. Instead, the protagonist torch seems to have been passed on to Asuka, and as much as I love Asuka, I would have loved to see more of Masaya.

The opening and ending themes, ""Contrail Kiseki"" by Mami Kawada and ""a-gain"" by Ray, were actually pretty good songs, and I'm surprised by how much they fit the anime. The voice acting was pretty good, too; Misato Fukuen as Asuka was just so freaking adorable! However, we can't forget about the best part about this anime, which is, hands down, the animation. The animation is colorful and bright, and it's cool this way. The animation especially stands out in the FC matches; it had a great use of 3D animation during those matches.

Overall, Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm was a good anime. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great sports anime for a sport that isn't even real. Who knows, though? Maybe several years for now, we may have the technology to make Grav-Shoes into real shoes and Flying Circus into a real sport! (At least, that's a nice thought I'd like to have.)"
104174,"It's been a long day so gonna review something short.
No GIFS today, there is little OVA gifs for this.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) PREMISE OF THE OVA:]()
This OVA  focuses on our main Female gang making some chocolates for Valentines, I honestly don't mind OVAs like these for Slice of Life shows but Steins;Gate's atmosphere is just too dark for stuff like this, its not even after the events of the main series so that means Okabe still supposed to be fucking mentally scarred.

The contents of the OVA weren't even that enjoyable especially with this cast, they just don't belong in such an enviroment. The characters felt off, they weren't really themselves.



[CHARACTERS:]()
The same character as in the main series appeared in the main series, I already covered those in that one but here's a quick rundown:

All these characters just kinda forget the main story and just focus on Valentines day. Maybe thats just their way of coping with all of those events but it just didn't feel, right. Like I mentioned before many times. Because of this the characters feel really unreal and not like them. You will have to watch Steins;Gate 0 and this OVA to see what I mean, the difference is real tho. Trust me on this one.



[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The animation was on par as the main series, it was fluid and smooth but nothing really that exciting to be perfectly honest.
It was watchable, thats what I mean.

The colours, maybe it was just my version, were a bit washed out. This could be due to my version that I...acquired, but just incase it wasn't then yeah, that was kinda bad.



[MUSIC:]()
They just re-used the OP and ED of the main series and I already covered that in the main series review. 

I don't remember much of the OST from the main series but I would believe that they also re-used that as well.
This whole OVA just kinda feels rushed.



[OVERALL OPINION:]()
This felt really mediocre, especially when we compare it to the OVA we go in the Steins;Gate series (not Zero), that one was after the series and showed us what happened after the events, the new daily lives of the characters.

This is not the highest quality OVA I've ever seen."
898,"Like many Dragon Ball Films, Dragon Ball Z Movie 5 Cooler's Revenge is hard to put into the main story timeline and should be seen as an alternative story where Goku beat Frieza and safely came back with everyone to earth.

The movie is about Frieza's older brother who came to earth to restore the honour of the family by killing Goku.
It's a very action packed story with the secondary cast being very active and nobody feels like they exist just because like Goten in the Boo Saga. Despite the short length, the movie really takes full advantage of each second to give us enough time to get to know the characters and their personality. Cooler's henchmen are the equivalent of the Ginyu Force and have some very entertaining interactions with each other and the main cast. They have unique manners and techniques from each others which is why they are more memorable compared your average Dragon Ball henchmen. They show individuality unlike other's that are either reactive or do things as ordered.
The final confrontation against Cooler is set up well too since Goku lost the first encounter and needed to recover until about half of the movie runtime.

Cooler is one of the most interesting antagonist and with his personality being superior to Frieza. While Frieza's selling point was his sheer existence nobody can defy, not even gods, Cooler has the family integrity in mind. In the past, he noticed Frieza letting a Saiyan escape refusing to take care of it himself and predicting that this mistake will be Frieza's downfall.
He is known to analyse the situation showing he is more than just powerful. He noticed that Goku was able to survive his first confrontation and acknowledges the Saiyan's strength being capable to kill his brother.
Cooler also shows assisting his henchmen on various occasion instead of letting them do something and die because they were too weak. And Cooler is one of few characters you can argue deserved the power he has because he is related to Frieza while Frieza was just an overpowered villain pulled out Toriyama's ass without any build up. Something Toriyama and Toei are known for normally.
Cooler's defeat was also one of the best defeats in the franchise to the point it was replicated many times but non worked as well as in this movie. The poetic irony that he acknowledges a fatal mistake he made as his final moment and not having the right to criticize Frieza for his mistakes.

It is the first DBZ movie that features the real Super Saiyan and probably has the best use of it. As it appears as a mystical form that appears in times of despair. Not feeling like just another power up that increases your power by 50 times or something. It became a state that overcomes any hardship presented to it. Unlike what it honestly doing right now.

Criticism that no longer hold ups. This is something I want to mention. And it is about transforming villains. Frieza's first to third form are means to restrict his powers and destructive capabilities. So 4th form Frieza and final form is Frieza's true form. While Cooler was always in his ""true form"" that should be his final form, but he has a transformation that exist to increase his power. Back in the day it seemed like the writers had no idea how Frieza's forms work and brought confusion to the fanbase. But with the awful Revival of F movie this criticism no longer hold up since Frieza can now also transform like a Super Saiyan to get stronger instead of restraining himself.

Actual criticism. That is the strength of Cooler compared to Frieza. It may be a dub error but many are confused who truly is stronger between Cooler and Frieza, even King Cold. As Dragon Ball Multiverse would show if you read that by any chance (not recommended tho). So many believed Cooler to be stronger in the past, while now everyone believes Frieza was always stronger (excluding the awful Revival of F movie).
There is also a question regarding believability regarding Cooler's henchmen power since they seemed stronger than First Form Frieza. But that can be argued around with Cooler perhaps training them.

If you haven't seen this movie and believe you are a big Dragon Ball fan, you should check it out. You won't be disappointed."
256,"Spoiler free review

"" A distance that takes 8 years at the speed of light is no different than saying 'forever' "" 

Hoshi no Koe is a 25 minute movie/ova by [Makoto Shinkai ](https://anilist.co/staff/96117/Makoto-Shinkai) and [Comix wave ](https://anilist.co/studio/291/CoMix-Wave). The scarcity in budget can be traced not only from bad animations or character designs but also from the fact that except for music almost most of the staff work script,character design, animations, direction and production was done by Shinkai himself and the production team, even the VAs were very limited. But that doesn't stop it's heartfelt and very ""realistic"" story from touching viewer's emotions. 

Story- 9.5/10

Hoshi no koe is set in future where space exploration is booming. People from all over the world are recruited for space expeditions and to fight against other alien like creatures from whom all these technologies are derived which led the human space technology in the state it is now.
The story focuses on 2 junior high school students Noboru and Mikako who, as many others, fall in love with each other. But then after graduation Mikako is selected as to join the space expedition to Mars and if situation arises, to fend off aliens inhabiting the place. The story however isn't focused on these fights, explorations and aliens. It's complete focus is on the relationship of these two. Before Mikako leaves earth they decide to be in touch via mails and continue their long distance relationship. But as you might know, nothing can travel faster than speed of light and sadly, not even human emotions. As the distance between them grows, literally but not emotionally, they're faced with cruel reality as the only link connecting them glows dimmer.
Earlier I used the word realistic because the concept is derived from something really plausible which makes the emotions even more spontaneous.

Characters- 8.5/10
There are just 2 characters. I mean not just 2 main characters but 2 characters overall in whole 25 minutes of the movie. But instead of having it exploited as it's weakness, Hoshi no koe uses it in it's advantage by giving great character development to these two. Both Mikako and Noboro go through a lot of changes through the years, but Noboru's character development is especially perceivable, he tries to suppress his emotions and hides his helplessness by pretending to an adult and trying to blend in the society but deep inside he knows himself that nothing can fill that empty void inside of him. Mikako too, as she goes to the places no human has ever went before, sees new places, sceneries so beautiful that can't be described in words but none of it seems to put her heart at ease as the simple rain in July after the school on earth with Noboru did.

Animations - 4/10
Here I wish that it had good animations. This is only part that lets it down. Character designs also are not good. Only good thing in animations are the sceneries( the one on earth specially). It uses Cgi for most of the space scenes in motion and that cgi is bad (still not as bad as berserk 2016). 

Music - 8/10
There isn't much music, but where it is, it's executed perfectly. The inserted song at the ending melts perfectly with the ending and left me frozen momentarily. 

Overall- 8/10
Even though it's quite short, 25 minutes, being the length of a single episode of an anime, it still manages to be better and convey much more emotions than many of the full length animes of this category. I highly recommend it. If you like the likes of Kimi no na wa then you'll probably love this too. Give it as try you won't regret it."

- The number of spoilers will be as minimal as possible to none.  I don’t talk more about the plot points except in spoiler text.  There are some image spoilers but it's all out of context.

- If you come to expect opinions from a very critical sense, sorry, but I’m not your guy as we may have different tastes.  

- I’ll try my best to explain what are the things that worked for me and what doesn’t in this review.  Then you’ll hopefully be able to understand my point of view and maybe come to your own conclusion about what this will be like for you.

I preface because a lot of people online come to expect reviews to fit a mold of what they want which isn’t always realistic.  For me, I just like to talk about anime I enjoy. And so this review is about such things. Sorry if this ain't what you're looking for.

Tonari no Kyukketsuki-san / Ms. vampire who lives in my neighborhood. Is a 12 episode TV anime series released in Fall 2018. It was animated by Studio Gokumi (Kirino Mosiac, Tsurezure Children) and directed by Noriaki Akitaya (Bakuman, Ore Suki). The anime’s source material is based on a manga by Amatou. 

This story is branded as Comedy and Slice of Life on this listing which I can agree with. So, how will you the general viewer fare? I think you’ll be split between liking the show or dropping the show completely. Well that could be said for any show which you might argue. So, let me get more into the nitty gritty.

Camp 1: If you hate all of the characters in the beginning and cannot stand to continue with the show because of its generic storylines or otaku tropes, don’t bother trying. I don’t think the future episodes will convince you otherwise.

Camp 2: If you managed to enjoy the characters for what they are and the silly storylines they go through, you’ll enjoy this show for what it is. I feel like this show manages to get its footing around the halfway point but it’s not a huge improvement, don’t expect that.

I definitely felt like I was watching a very generic show in the beginning. However, as it went along, I liked the characters and storylines. It felt creative with what they were trying to do and I felt a sense of effort as the show progressed. 

This show became a huge guilty pleasure. 

Overall, this show did the job of just letting my brain go empty while watching CGDCT and so I give this a 7.5/10.

If you’re in Camp 1, I can see you rate this as average or below-average plus a possible drop. If you’re in Camp 2, I can see you rate this as average - above-average.

This show isn’t particularly super remarkable but it was entertaining and that’s what I want from my media at the end of the day.

For the rest of the review, I go more into detail about why my rating came to be.

img1080()




I think the common mistake with ratings is that we all tend to judge and associate each review rating on our own personal scale. When people see an average anime - they see that as a 5, some see that as a 6, and others as a 7. As you all know, we all have different tastes hence different rating scales and this is why I’ll post my scale below.

My Personal Rating Scale (Anime):

4 and below = I would've dropped this show already but made myself suffer through it for some reason. Regardless, this is the drop zone generally.
5 = This was really meh and I wouldn't take the time to rewatch.
6 = This was meh and I wouldn't watch it again unless I was forced to.

7 = It was okay and acceptable, it was good entertainment and you enjoyed the ride.
8 = This was a great story and you enjoyed the show/movie but it wasn't considered one of the best experiences. Just a great time overall!

9 = If you watched this show/movie for the first time, you'll love this a lot. It ain't life-changing but god damn you'll have one of the best experiences.
10 = This show resonated with me so hard - chills and intense emotional catharsis.

I have a confession to make, I like CGDCT shows. It’s the slice of life and comedy aspects that personally really appeals to me. This bias/factor will make or break you in respect to liking this show or not. It definitely influences my rating and liking the show severely.

Also, as I said previously, I was watching this alongside Hibike Euphonium which really influenced my mood. Watching Hibike Euphonium was a huge delight that it made me tired out because I was fanboying a little bit too much. So, to rest, I wanted a chill anime and this one fit the bill when recommended from a friend. Head empty strong.

While watching the show, I was using DmonHiro subs and watched it in Japanese Audio, with English subtitles.

img1080()




Now the review.  I’ll be talking about the anime in the following categories:

1) Story / Plot / Characters

It’s structured as an episodic slice of life story, so don’t expect multiple episode arcs.

The story centres around two main characters - a Vampire and a human. It basically follows the lives of these two individuals and the surrounding circle of friends as well as network. A lot of it is silly hi-jinks at the end of the day which gave me some small chuckles here and there. Some of the story is illogical in respect to why certain things came to be but I never thought about it too much at the end of the day. It definitely follows some of the rules it places though which is nice, it actually does try to be logical when it needs to.

Also, I’m not sure why I was able to tolerate the otaku tropes, I generally dislike them. Am I… becoming an otaku??? Kidding, maybe. I think the otaku character tropes weren’t as obnoxious as I generally see or expected, like it fit the character and I just grew to enjoy them all as people. 

Characters are incredibly one-dimensional with a unique quirk here and there. Quite repetitive and their development as people don’t have a lot of depth but I didn’t mind. The most unique characters are probably the Vampire characters because they do delve into their character backgrounds and thus the most interesting of the bunch.

2) Visuals / Animation

In the visual department, very serviceable. Nothing looked ugly or really out of place. When it wanted to look pretty, it did, but I can’t recall any stand-outs personally.

Animation-wise, very serviceable. Again, nothing stood out to me personally.

3) Audio / Soundtrack / Voice Acting

The audio was serviceable in what it was trying to do. Same as the soundtrack, though some tracks definitely fit the bill and scenes really well so good job to the composer on that. For the voice acting, it was pretty serviceable for the given scenes.

img1080()

4) Overall

This show is so generic that I would’ve dropped this if I didn’t have a head empty desire for a show. In the end, I liked the show a lot as I went along and it ended up becoming a guilty pleasure. Who knew sticking to this show would actually satisfy me, I’m pretty happy considering some shows would disappoint me hard.



Hopefully, you learned something useful from the review.  Thanks for reading. :)

18195,"Warning: Contains spoilers for Little Busters! and light spoilers for Little Busters!: Refrain

""We’ve spent time together that made our hearts dance. But every story has to come to an end. No one can stay a kid forever. Time passes, and people grow up. There will come a day when we will no longer be together.”
-Kyousuke Natsume


img220()
Based on the Visual Novel by Key, Little Busters!: Refrain (am I the only one infuriated by the colon after the exclamation point?) is an adaptation of some of the routes left out of the first season that leads into the Refrain route, which is the finale of the visual novel. 

And, going into Little Busters Refrain, I can't say I expected to be hit with a profound and beautiful tale of friendship and tragedy like I was. Even if the poignant and soul touching opening that replaced the absolute banger that was the opening to the VN used in the first season should've warned me that this season would be a bit less happy-go-lucky than the first. The second red flag I probably should've picked up on is that Little Busters! is a Key novel, and anyone familiar with Jun Maeda knows that he loves making innocent SOL shows then gut punching you and kicking you while you beg for mercy. 

img()

Little Busters!: Refrain gives you a taste of what's to come through the form of the first three episodes (Yuiko's route), a tonal shift compared to the first season with an air of mystique and intrigue that makes the viewer really want to know what the secret of the world is that was constantly referenced but never explored in Little Busters!

However, this is really all a precursor to the meat of the story. As, at it's core, Little Busters!: Refrain is a story about the original 5 members of the Little Busters. In the first season, they were never fleshed out too deeply to give screentime to the heroines who make up the routes of the first season. Yet, in this season the reverse is true. The cast recruited in the first season takes a back seat to let the original members truly shine. 

img()

Little Busters!: Refrain deeply establishes the history of the group of friends known as the Little Busters. In this season we are treated to the backstories of all 5 members of the group and how they were all brought together by the real protagonist of the story, Kyousuke.

While yes, Riki may be the person we see the show through and the catalyst for the plot moving forward, the real center of this story is Kyousuke. A character who was hilarious yet very mysterious in the first season but didn't have enough showcased about him to get a full grasp of who he is. And who is he? Well, I think he's probably the greatest character that Key has ever made.

img()

Kyousuke is an icon, someone who Riki respects and looks up to. He's the glue that keeps the Little Busters together and their ever-confident leader who always pushes forward in search of new exciting things for the group to do.
From the first moments of the first episode of last season we are told that Kyousuke is the person that Riki relies on and trusts to lead him. We see this trust pushed to it's absolute limits in Refrain and see character deconstructions of both Kyousuke and Riki.

img()

Little Busters! is a coming of age story. It's about Riki learning to become independent and not be completely dependent on Kyousuke, while still being able to lean on those he trusts for support. It's a coming of age story where Riki isn't ready yet, but there is no other choice but for him to grow up. In this we see Kyousuke push Riki forward into becoming stronger. There's a reason that Kyousuke made Riki be the one to recruit the new members for their baseball team, he could've done it himself quite easily.

It's really in it's last arc, and on it's focuses on the interactions between Riki, Kyousuke and the other 3 members of the original Little Busters that makes this story elevate from a ""good"" story to an ""exceptional"" story. I haven't even mentioned anything much about Rin, Masato or Kengo but they each have as much depth as Kyousuke and Riki and incredible stories of their own, that are told through the final route too. (Even if they are a tad rushed in the adaptation)

This review could've been a full breakdown of almost every scene in the show, however, I didn't want to ruin this experience for anyone yet to see it. Please, do me a favour and watch this anime. And once that's done play the Visual Novel for an even greater experience. Just... get some tissues ready.

I'll leave you now to enjoy the masterpiece that is the opening song to this anime. I think it perfectly captures the difference between this season and the last.

168872,"Prelude
(Season 1 & 2)



“From Me to You” is a classic Shoujo romance manga that has been beloved by hundreds and thousands of viewers alike. We follow our main character, Sawako Kuronuma (Mamiko Noto), whose journey involves having her own self-growth as a fully fledged person through social interactions such as hanging out with friends and making meaningful memories around them whilst traversing through the harsh environment of her surroundings. It's a beautiful and satisfying coming-of-age slice-of-life anime in and of itself, but it manages to go one step above by involving a cute and wholesome romance between Sawako and Shouta Kazehaya (Daisuke Namikawa) and their journey from a slow yet innocent perspective of romance. Sure, the development of the series is quite slow and comparatively slow given the time this series came out, but it's still irresistibly cute and wholesome, with a great sense of comfort and familiarity with its awkwardly tender moments as well as its gloomy moments. 
 
The series is definitely not the best out there, as there are many other Shoujo mangas that came before and after that have surpassed the level with their storytelling and complexity, but this show is not built to be the best. If you just need a series that fills the vibe of having cute characters engaging in cute moments at a slow yet tender pace, this is the perfect anime for you.


Postlude 
(Season 3)



Season 2 of the anime provides a somewhat satisfying ending for audiences alike by providing a high-stakes moment leading up to the reveal of finally being together as a couple. As a chapter closes its pages, another fresh new page opens, which is what Season 3 of Kimi ni Todoke will stand for. We still follow our main characters, Sawako and Shouta, and their navigation about what it means to be a couple. We get to follow their moments together, which is cute and wholesome. The show also does not shy away from providing something that's dramatically intriguing and appropriate for their age. Many criticisms that have been pointed out in the series are that it's just a misunderstanding fest, but it can be argued that the age of these characters would feel that way, especially with first-time relationship partners who would work and discover together. 
 
I also appreciate the series having a proper highlight on its side characters. From the past seasons, Chizuru Yoshida (Yuuko Sanpei) and Ayane Yano (Miyuki Sawashiro) have their own side plots that are impactful and intriguing to watch, especially with the scope of their discovery of true romance, but that has been mostly subsided by the main character’s journey. Not only do we get to follow the main character’s journey in this season, but these side characters as well as their personal growth are greatly condensed into this 5-episode journey.

I would describe Kimi ni Todoke as a simple vanilla sundae with a cookie on top. Sure, it might not be the most interesting-looking amidst the variety of loud-looking or diversely flavored options, but there is nothing wrong with enjoying something that's simple. The comfort it gives is more than enough. Three seasons later, it's still serving that same sundae, and it never fails to give you a smile."
8888,"I came to this show after my 3rd rewatch of the main series, I had consumed all the specials, movies, picture shows and any content the original series had to offer and I was hungry for more. I hoped this would quench my thirst for the high-quality storytelling in the original show and I was woefully disappointed, please allow to elaborate.

The biggest downfall of this movie was its length, it was simply too short for the vision the writer had intended. We are thrown into this new unexplored part of the lore with brand new characters that we need to care about before the end. And this show fails in so many ways, the introduction was fine, but compared to how Lelouch was introduced this is an utter failure. The main character's key character traits were never highlighted, you have no sense of who these characters are. What they care about and in turn you cant care about what is happening. The only key character traits displayed were very generic, like the general who cares about her subordinates despite their social standings. And the edgy emo boy who has a secret no one knows about. Almost all of the characters share this problem, the show never gives time to show interesting character traits and just opting for the most uninteresting options.

This show tries to introduce you to so many characters that are useless to the plot of this movie that it makes the length problem even worse, it also doesn't help that the story jumps from group to group out of the blue. Making it even more boring as you are forced to watch some random dude do stuff you don't even care about.

The world-building is probably the best part of this movie, it was organic and interesting. But it feels like the movie definitely focused on this a bit too much, they tried to flush out the world as much as possible as if this was the whole reason this show existed. Useless details are expositioned to us in dialogue scenes when it wouldn't matter if it was never mentioned, this makes the aforementioned problems even worse, as time is spent on things that are definitely interesting but they do not contribute much to the story.

And the compilation of these problems makes the ending the most boring ending ever, the main story never was given enough time to properly develop so you don't even know why you should care or what's going on, you don't care about the characters and what happens to them, making this the most mediocre anime I've seen in a while.

In short, if you want to experience the great storytelling of the original this is not for you, but if you simply want to see more of the world and fill in the gaps in the lore the original series did not explore this is the only place you can go."
152765,"Life hasn’t been going well for Mitsuha Yamano.  At the age of just eighteen, she’s been orphaned by the sudden, tragic car accident that killed her parents and brother, leaving her alone in the world with her family’s savings, but no clear goal on how to use it.  To make things even worse, when she goes on a soul searching journey following the accident, she’s harassed at a viewing platform at the edge of a cliff by three scoundrels, and when she tries to fight them off, she falls over the edge, presumably to her doom on the jagged rocks in the waves below...  Or so she expected.  However, after cutting her hand on thin air and hearing a mysterious scream, she goes from plunging to her death to sitting in the middle of a vast, lonely open field.  As it turns out, she’s been Isekaied, and as she soon discovers, she can travel back and forth between the two worlds.  Armed with this new power, Mitsuha vows to use her circumstances to her advantage, and adopts a brand new goal in life...  To save 80,000 gold in another world for her retirement!

I feel like I’ve been reviewing quite a few anime lately where I didn’t really have anything to say about the people who made them, and unfortunately, here we are again.  Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for my Retirement, which I’m just going to call 80K Isekai from now on for the sake of brevity, was directed by Hiroshi Tamada, a man who only has one other primary directing credit to his name.  In addition to this, he directed Banished from the Hero’s Party, which I have never actually seen.  This particular series was produced by Felix Film, which does have a small resume of primary production credits to show for the brief period it’s been active, but I’ve never seen any of their other titles before, aside from maybe two or three episodes of Nekopara.  There’s nothing really special about the pedigree of this anime, which is usually a bad omen for most titles I review, so how well do the visuals hold up?

Honestly, if I’m being blunt, this show looks more or less fine?  The animation is a little hit or miss, but it has enough hit in it to be mostly acceptable.  Director Tamada is very careful to work around the limitations of the project, juggling keyframes and animation cycles as well as he can to keep from betraying the limited nature of the project’s resources, but he does slip up here and there.  You may run into an awkward walking cycle, a couple of stiff animation segments, and a few cringey mistakes, such as when a character is turning her head to yell at someone but the lines marking the amplification of her voice hit the screen a second too early.  There were clearly some issues with budget allocation, but I still think the show looks mostly good overall, as its visual shortcomings only prove distracting once or twice overall if you’re not looking for them.

Part of this is due to the design work, which does an amazing job of straddling the line between generic and pretty.  There’s really nothing in this show that you haven’t seen before, at least from a visual perspective.  The population in both the fantasy world and our world look pretty much exactly how you’d expect them to, but they do also look very easy on the eyes, so it’s not much of an issue.  What we see of the kingdom looks believable enough, even though the color palette is way more bright and soothing than the stereotypical grittiness and muted grays and browns you might be expecting.  Actual animated movement is impressive most of the time, with only a few exceptions that I mentioned above, and a couple of significantly large CG objects looking like they don’t belong in this world, which is fitting, because they don’t.  It’s not a perfect looking show, but there’s definitely more good than bad to it.

The English dub was produced directly by Crunchyroll, and I have no complaints with it.  For starters, Trina Nishimura is outstanding in the lead role as Mitsuha.  Her big selling point as an actor is her ability to imbue her characters with a charming hint of mischievous impiness, and since she’s playing a young woman who acts as a positive force in the world while also showing some distinct signs of sociopathy, this role falls smoothly into her wheelhouse.  She brings a lot of depth and complexity to the role, flexing her voice control in all her various inner monologues.  Another standout is Tyson Rhinehart in the role of a nameless mercenary captain, who is probably my second favorite character behind Mitsuha.  He has the deep, gravely voice of a grizzled veteran, but he still comes off as laid back and open-minded.  Alexis Tipton is also a lot of fun as a noblewoman Mitsuha meets early on, but the entire cast does a great job overall.  This is, generally, a really fun English dub.

I’ve made it pretty clear in the past that I don’t follow seasonal releases.  I’m probably repeating myself on that at this point, but it’s still true.  If I’m watching an anime from the last two or three years, there’s usually a story behind it.  Late last year, I was browsing the anime on offer for a holiday sale on the Xbox Marketplace, and I decided to just blindly buy a couple of unique or interesting sounding Isekai anime for about $5 each, and this one sounded interesting enough to pick up.  The first one I watched, something about being a background character in a dating game, was kind of a train wreck, so I wasn’t expecting much from 80K isekai.  What I got from it was an anime that hooked me from the start, and never let me go.  Not only was I enjoying it, I wouldn’t shut up about how much I was enjoying it, despite the relatively mediocre reception it had from everyone else.  Well, this is my second viewing, and while I don’t feel the same intense aura from it that I felt the first time, I was still fully on board, and I can explain why with a few facts about my tastes in media.

First off, this is something longtime readers of mine will already know, the fastest way to earn my love with a piece of media is to present me with a unique and intriguing idea, and then explore the everloving fuck out of it.  This was probably my biggest complaint about Smartphone isekai, because the idea of bringing a working cell phone into a fantasy world has a ton of potential, and they used almost none of it.  I don’t know, maybe this is just one of my own very unique strange quirks, but if I’m presented with that kind of idea in a story, and you’re being lazy with it, I’m going to be so distracted with thinking about all of the things you could do with it and all of the extended implications of it that I’m not going to be able to focus on your story.  I’ve never watched a Purge movie before, because I just know that while the good guys and bad guys are killing each other, I’m going to be sitting there thinking “Okay, if all crime is legal, how many kids are being abused right now?  That would be happening, right?”

It’s not my job, as a viewer, to flesh out your idea for you, and if there’s enough left on the table for me to become distracted, you’re gonna lose a few points.  Well, with 80K isekai, we have a very surprisingly unique idea, and one that I can’t believe hasn’t appeared more often in the anime medium.  I can think of exactly two other anime where the Isekai protagonists were able to swap between the real world and the alternate world at will...  Inuyasha, which I'm a little rusty on, and Digimon Adventure 02, which felt like it had no stakes due to the fact the cast were never forced to be in danger.  I feel pretty comfortable saying, though, that as far as exploring ideas goes, 80K blows both of them out of the water.  The first episode spends a lot of time showing you who Mitsuha is as a person by having her just try to survive and interact with the first people she sees, and she proves to be a pretty clever, likeable protagonist. 

She discovers her ability to jump between worlds while a girl she’d befriended was in danger, grabs a couple of her weird late brother’s weapons, and returns to save her.  Okay, she’s shown bravery and compassion, love it, what about that power?  That’s where things start to really take off.  She meets the interdimensional being who she took her powers from, finds out she has a healing factor(which, to be fair, doesn’t come back for a while), and upon request, gains the ability to automatically learn new languages.  She soon finds out that when world-hopping, she can teleport to any location she’s seen before, so she uses Google Earth to visit a foreign mercenary camp, appraises the other world’s gold and silver currency, and uses some of her inheritance to pay them to give her some guns and train her to use them.  And this isn’t that “Shoot without really shooting“ bullshit like with Stella Women’s Academy, these are the kind of realistic, respectful gun lessons that you don’t see in anime, even as basic as they are, mostly because Japanese civilians aren’t legally allowed to own them, and are often pretty naive about them as a result.

Yeah, I know, just about every modern Isekai anime has some kind of gimmick to set them apart, but we could stop right there and 80K Isekai is already putting far more effort into its premise than most of the competition.  But no, we keep going.  Mitsuha manipulates her way into cozying up to nobility and obtains her own general store to start selling real world items to fantasy folk for a markup that’s profitable for her, but still not as shameless as most hospital equipment.  That is another thing I enjoy, by the way, seeing common everyday items from the real world observed out of context by aliens, people from the future or the past, people from other realities, whatever, I just think it’s usually a really cool and creative idea.  This series doesn’t just have fun with its cool premise, it fully deserves its cool premise, and there are far too many works of fiction that sadly prefer to rest on their laurels and take ideas with lots of potential for granted, so I’ll take inspiration and creativity where I can get it.

As for the other matter of personal taste, there’s a writing principle that I like to call “What would happen vs. What should happen.”  I don’t know, maybe it has a more sophisticated name out there somewhere, but I’m just some dumb internet reviewer who hates doing research.  When you’re writing a story, going through the narrative, you do sometimes have to choose between what would, or should, happen.  What should happen is emotional storytelling.  It’s what the audience wants, and it makes a story satisfying.  What would happen is more logical storytelling, and it keeps a story grounded.  Each has their strengths, but each also fails on their own.  Too much Should, and a story feels empty and meaningless, with endings you didn’t earn.  Too much would makes a story feel cynical and unpleasant, with nothing special to entice a viewer to watch all the way through.  So you do have to find a good balance of these two forces while writing your story.

One of the best ways to do this is to give the audience what should happen, by traveling the path of what would happen.  Have your character overcome a cold and harsh reality to achieve their dreams.  This is, largely, how 80K isekai is written.  There are plenty of examples, but the one I’m going to focus on is what happens after Mitsuha opens her store.  What should happen is that she sells a lot and makes money, but what would happen is that people would be skeptical and not trust her.  They would be too frugal with their money to spend it on some ‘magical’ product that sounds too good to be true, and that what happens on her second day in operation...  So she goes all out to secure the sale!  She offers to not only give them a free demonstration, where the writing goes a step farther in acknowledging that a head of hair that’s never been properly washed would take multiple washings for the shampoo to take effect, but to also make a meal for them!  They wind up spending a bundle on her store, despite suspecting she might be a witch(an idea I definitely remember wanting Smartphone Isekai to try).  This effort pays off over time, and I can relate to her satisfaction over this as someone with a struggling Ebay store.  Successful sales feel special.

And that is really a good example of how the writing in this anime works.  It is a mostly positive and light-hearted series, but there are hardships and challenges to overcome, they’re just not that dire until like episode 10. Until then, the stakes are just high enough to keep the story compelling, but if you’re looking for something more life and death, the final three episodes are worth sticking it out for.  I won’t spoil anything, but a huge threat arises, and Mitsuha is forced to cross many of the lines she’d set for herself to deal with it.  Things get pretty damn epic in the final quarter of the story, putting Mitsuha and some other characters through some dire circumstances that require both intelligence and courage to resolve, and it all leads to an emotionally satisfying ending that had me clapping and cheering both times I watched it. 

I will admit though, it’s not a perfect series, no matter how much I thought it was the first time through.  One huge area of contention I’ve noticed is Mitsuha herself, and personally, I think she’s awesome.  She strikes a very nice morality balance where she’s motivated by both selfish means and the urge to do the right thing, and she’s courageous as a result.  I like seeing her solutions to different problems, and I find moments where she’s completely full of shit but still passing those speech checks to be actually kind of charming.  There are moments, though, where she busts out some knowledge that the people she’s talking to should already have, and HER excuse for knowing it is because of her brother’s wide array of interests.  There are also some points where she comes off as TOO manipulative, almost heartless at times, with questionable motivations.  She cries over her deceased parents because she actually calls two members of the nobility “Mom and Dad,” but this has nothing to do with the fact that she just sold off her mother’s pearl necklace?  And yeah, there are others.

I’ve seen people call her ability too convenient, and they’re not wrong, but I think it’s justified by the hardship she faced leading up to it, and the creativity that spawned from it.  I’ve seen people criticize her for bringing items into this world that will create plastic waste, and it is kind of sus that the narrative never brings up proper disposal options, but I highly doubt she could generate enough waste to actually cause any environmental problems.  I’d honestly be more worried about how selling all those gold coins in our world would affect the economy, not to mention the value of gold, currently an extremely limited substance.  There’s also always going to be people who call fanservice the bane of their existence, but this anime is honestly pretty conservative about that.  There are occasional bath scenes that are tame enough for children’s anime, but there’s also one single bikini scene that kind of transcends all cliches.  I won’t spoil what happens, but it reminds me of a moment from one of my favorite Teen Titans episodes, where Starfire is greeting a little Russian boy, and he blushes at her revealing attire, which in turn makes HER feel uncharacteristically self conscious.  It’s like that, but less subtle, and it goes a few steps farther.

I also guess I can see why some viewers would find this series boring, because at least up until those last three episodes, the tone is extremely light-hearted, the main character doesn’t go through THAT much hardship(aside from losing her parents beforehand) and it might make people a little uncomfortable that she never really faces any serious consequences for all the lies she tells.  If anything, her constant deception and manipulations are rewarded more often than not.  Personally, I really don’t give a shit about any of that, because 80K isekai is just a fun fucking show.  And hell, sometimes I want to see an anime character take advantage of the conventions of their world for their own personal gain.  One of my favorite parts of School Days was seeing Makoto respond to the cliche of female harem members throwing themselves at a protagonist by just saying “Fuck it, why not?” to all of them.  As randomly as I may have discovered this series, I enjoy the hell out of it, and I think you will too.

Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World is available from Crunchyroll, both on DVD/Bluray as well as for streaming.  It can also be purchased digitally from Xbox Marketplace and streamed on their movies/TV app.  The original light novels by Funa are available stateside from Vertical.  A manga adaptation is available from Kodansha.

The first time I watched this series, I was so over the moon for it that I strongly considered giving it a perfect score.  I wasn’t unaware of it’s flaws, just sort of indifferent to them, but I got myself under control enough to give it a more grounded score.  Now that the honeymoon is over, I can say with some certainty that while those flaws are a lot more visible, I still thoroughly enjoyed this series.  It’s smartly written, briskly paced, highly creative, and it shines with a spark of inspiration.  The visuals may be a bit mediocre at times, some people might find it boring, and there are moments where the main character’s use of her silver tongue doesn’t land like it’s probably supposed to, but these aren’t huge deal breakers in my book.  It’s a fun show to watch that makes me happy and helps me to forget how fucked the country is right now, and sometimes that’s all you need.

I give Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for My Retirement an 8/10"
2963,"Well this is gonna be my first review on Anilist so I'll do my best to summarize this show since there isn't any review for 1 of my favorite slice of life series yet.

img290() img290()

Minami-Ke is one of those shows where you can pick it up and just relax and have a laugh. There's no plot whatsoever; a genuine & comedic slice of life about a family of 3 sisters just passing time and having fun in every episode. Their adorable interactions and unique relationships are just so much fun to watch especially Chiaki and Kana's interactions. I will always find myself cracking up every episode and laughing out loud every time I revisit this show. Really hope that another season will be released in the future seeing that the manga is still ongoing. 

My only gripe about this series as a whole is the animation style. I really enjoyed the art style in Season 1 however season 2 and 3 takes some time getting used to. Not saying that the art style is bad but I really love how the characters are drawn in season 1. Currently with season 4's release, I feel that season 4's art style is heading towards a great direction so if you are picking it up make sure to stick around to season 4!

                                                                                               

Plot:
Well there isn't much to say about the plot, there's even a greeting every episode telling you not to expect much. This is a slice of life anime so there isn't one. If you are looking for a plot based show this isn't it, however if you are just looking for something to watch because you're bored and just want to have some laughs and relax this show will definitely do you justice. 

Music:
Straight-Up and simple music nothing too special or epic. The music used in this show really complements the jokes/humor in almost every occasion and you can almost always tell what kind of scene it is by just the music alone. The transition music they always do from 1 scene to another just makes this show so much fun to watch.

Art:
The art isn't anything special in this day and age however, I feel that the art for season 1 is one of the best among the 4. Simply because the art style fits the characters well and emphasizes their unique characteristics. Chiaki's uninterested face but smart looking, Haruka's bright and reliable demeanor and Kana's playful and mischievous look. Nothing really too special to talk about here but other backgrounds and props are drawn really well I haven't really notice anything that caught my eye that looks really bad well it's a 2007 anime so I'm pretty lenient.

img800() 

Characters:
The 3 main characters each have their own unique characteristics. Haruna being the big sister who is smart, cheerful as well as the most reliable whom the other sisters look up to, Kana being the middle sister who is mischievous, playful and gullible and finally Chiaki the little sister who is smart, always looking uninterested(but is full of curiosity) as well as immature and is easily tricked by Kana occasionally during their interactions. The relationship between the 3 sisters is truly sublime. I really find Chiaki and Kana's relation really special even though on the outside Chiaki is shown to hate her and find her annoying but deep down in some episodes you can really feel the bond the sisters have for each other.

This series doesn't just stop at 3 of the Minami Sisters, it also introduces many different unique characters that bring joy and laughter to the whole series. Such as Hosaka who has a crush on Haruna and always thinks/dreams of absurd and hilarious situations with her that will never happen. There's also Chiaki's own gang of friends that each have their own unique traits that always livens up the show at every moment with the Minami family. 

Afterword:
All in all there's never a dull moment and  this is one of those anime that will remain in my top 10 slice of life Anime simply because this is what I feel is the epitome of Slice of life. Highly recommend to watch if you just want to have some laughs and relax after a long day of work.

My Score breakdown for this show:
Plot - N.A
Music - 5
Art - 5
Characters - 5
Overall: 5/5"

Spoilers? Uh, here's a spoiler for you. Don't bother. I honest can't even spoil anything because by the end of the show they take a sledgehammer to everything they previously established in the span of like ten minutes because they ran out of time and providing an explanation for ANYTHING was far, FAR too much work.

...Have you ever wanted to watch something as unbearable as [Lances n' Masques](https://anilist.co/anime/20712/LanceNMasques), that could also get really bizarre/absurd like [Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace), but is as entertaining as watching [literal paint drying](https://youtu.be/nGA-GCq7JWM?t=5h7m41s)? Glasslip is the show for you, then! Thank you, [Junji Nishimira](https://anilist.co/staff/101837/JunjiNishimura) (the director to blame for this show)!

I wonder what he's been doing since Glasslip--[oh...](https://anilist.co/anime/21197/Bakuon)

Glasslip is an original show brought to us by the studio [P.A. Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/PAWorks) whom also made [Another's anime](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another), another one I'm absolutely not that fond of. But they also did [Uchouten Kazoku](https://anilist.co/anime/17909/TheEccentricFamily) and [Shirobako](https://anilist.co/anime/20812/Shirobako) so... I guess the (incredibly) bad shows balance out with the really good ones they did.

This is about when I'd try to describe Glasslip, but I don't think I really have anything to add beyond what I started with. It's only after I've finished watching it that I actually wondered what genre Glasslip would even be considered. 

Slice of life? Technically true, I suppose. But I love slice of life, and there are plenty of slice of life series where stuff does happen and there are actual characters that are either entertaining or neat to watch as they undergo their everyday lives. In Glasslip, there's none of that. No interesting or entertaining characters (chickens don't count) and nothing happens. Absolutely. Nothing. Happens.

""I'm sure people would want to watch unlikeable characters go on a hiking trip for an entire episode. I'm sure that's something they want. It's a sure thing.""

I'd describe it more as a faux supernatural drama about teenage romance triangles (far worse than a mere triangle). Here's a group of unlikeable teenage characters with a deep and complicated web of romance (he likes her, she likes him, she likes him AND her and so forth) between them and also oh hey the main girl can see the future when she looks through glass MAYBE.

Anyways... I'll... I'll try to cover at the very least the main points before my brain erases all lasting traces of this show.

img440()




img500()

Okay, what do we even have to work with here?

The main character, Touko Fukami, is I guess the main character as out of this group of ""friends"", she gets the show's spotlight most of the time. She helps with her family in making glass and whenever the show isn't focusing on episode long hiking trips, teenage romance/drama, or Touko's ""ability"" to see into the future, it's her usually making glass. It's never really brought up in any major way or relevant to the actual story of the show beyond the fact she usually sees the ""future"" whenever she looks through glass.

Although, it also happens when she's not even looking at glass so... why even try to establish that it's related to the glass in the first place? I mean I know glass is in the title but I don't really understand why it has to be glass.


The real life inspiration for Glasslip's best characters. Jonathan the Chicken not pictured. 

Kakeru Okikura otherwise known as ""David"" (Touko refers to him as this once in like the first episode and the others keep calling him this later on despite after having learned his actual name), is unfortunately the main male character. He moves to the town and then for some reason strikes up a conversation about how Touko can see the future and if she leaves her chickens outside, roaming packs of wild feral cats will murder them. As an outsider to Touko's group, he mostly makes zero attempts or efforts to try and befriend the others. Actually, he seemingly purposely antagonize everyone other than Touko (whom he seriously believes can see the future for some reason). He speaks in cryptic nonsense, sleeps outside in the woods or sometimes in a tent (for some reason), and apparently sees copies of himself and holds actual conversations with them (FOR SOME REASON).

WHILE ALSO HANGING OUT IN THE WOODS. No, it's fine. Touko's friends are the ones who overreacted, Kakeru is perfectly fine and well adjusted. IT'S FINE (especially since it's an actually recurring thing). Right in front of Touko, he at one point tries to have a running contest with the other guy who likes Touko, and whomever won would ""win Touko""...? But he was actually not even going to run? I was kind of confused when the other characters actually treated him like he was insane after suggesting this and slapped him. I honestly thought they were going to go along with it.

Because after all, WHY DO THESE CHARACTERS DO ANY OF THESE THINGS THEY DO? IT'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

img440()

Sachi is absolutely the most infuriating of Touko's friends. She wears glasses, she reads books, and she's sickly. You could remove her entirely from the show and almost nothing would change. She's always either in the hospital or there are lines of dialogue being spoken about how she has to or should go to the hospital soon. She also confesses to her already current boyfriend and also Touko for some reason. I still don't really know what was up with that. It just happened so suddenly and then one minute later, we were back to future fragments, chickens, and David's mom playing the piano. Why have a character confess to two characters at once especially when there are NO memorable interactions between that character and the second character she's confessing to prior to this (or future interactions for that matter). 

I honestly can't be asked to go in-depth about Sachi's boyfriend (that's his entire character) Hiro Shirosaki, or the step siblings Yukinari Imi and Yanagi Takayama. I just don't have the energy. Plus they were completely overshadowed by the other three, whom I hated or was constantly questioning their reasons for their actions.

img440()




Character stuff aside (there's certainly more I could have brought up), there's a lot more things in Glasslip that just... bothered me. Yes, the most obvious complaint, the show is slow and never isn't slow because nothing worthwhile of any note happens. Even now really, one of the only things that immediately comes to mind is when Kakeru ended up getting assaulted by both of the step siblings duo. Partially because I had to stifle a cheer because not only did something happen, but Kakeru is infuriating every moment he is on the screen or talking.

img440()

Still, despite how easy of a complaint it is, it definitely is worth noting that I don't think I've seen a show where even less happens than in Glasslip. But you also have to figure in Glasslip, they actually make an effort almost at the very end of the show to render all of the stuff they were establishing completely meaningless/pointless. Touko's mom outright says to her in the final episode something along the lines of: ""Oh by the way, do you happen to see weird things when you look at bright lights and stuff? I sort of thought those were visions of the future when I saw them when I was younger, but the truth is it was all bullshit and in my mind.""

I wish I was joking. They actually did that. I can't even imagine the audacity you'd have to have to pull that on the 13th and final episode of a show.

   

The fact that the future fragments were in fact literally nothing wasn't a surprise at all. But my prediction was that both Kakeru as well as Touko in fact had some sort of mental disease or disorder. It's weird to just be talking with your friend one moment and then the next, you see a random swarm of mind birds just suddenly fly and swarm at you. 

   

It's not something that should have just been explained away in one line of dialogue by the mom. They... the whole seeing the future/supernatural stuff started in the very first episode!

""The show's over, and we didn't explain any of this. Oh well.""



""I'm sure the people who actually sat through all thirteen weeks of this when it was actually airing weren't curious at all.""

As frustrating as a show or a series just suddenly retcons or explains away a whole earlier portion (or in this case, the entire thing), there's still actually more that needs to be mentioned.

The dialogue, holy hell. Most of it is just a lot of yawn-inducing nothing, but some of it is just... really awful. Unsurprisingly, a decent amount of it is sprouted right from Kakeru's mouth. The whole future fragments thing is just a whole bunch of nonsense in the end yet he speaks as if he's so assured that Touko can really see the future. But it is certainly not limited to only Kakeru. There is one specific moment in Glasslip that's burned into my brain because it caught me so off guard it caused me to react physically.

Agonizingly Long and Insufferable Context Describing Actual Glasslip Scenes: So, in one episode following Kakeru goofing on the male of the step siblings duo, Yukinari is depressed. For even while he confessed to Touko, Touko continues to spend time with Kakeru who seems to do nothing but ramble cryptic nonsense and sleep outside in a tent. Therefore, Yukinari begins to start running every day to take his mind of it. The route he takes just happens to be along the window of the pool where Touko's sister and her friends swim at, and they ogle at Yukinari whenever he comes running by the building. But eventually, Yukinari just keeps on getting more and more depressed causing the girls concern for this COMPLETE STRANGER they're staring at. The way Yukinari looks prompts Touko's sister to run out of the building get on her bike, catch up to Yukinari, and then spout perhaps the most ridiculous line of Glasslip that's also come the closest to causing me to physically cringe at something out of an anime.

She yells at him, a probably genuinely depressed person (his knee was messed up due to an accident previously in his life or something yet he was still running every day), to ""stay attractive.""

   

...Please don't try and treat this as some sort of deep and emotional moment. Of all of the possible ways you could came up with to basically get across ""please cheer up"", they ended up going with ""stay attractive."" Then, later Yukinari's step-sister Yanagi approaches Kakeru and hits him with ""IT'S YOUR FAULT MY STEP-BROTHER ISN'T ATTRACTIVE ANYMORE."" Both of these happen in the same exact episode, and it's just too much. Please stop.

 

Oh yeah, and episode twelve very hurriedly introduces a parallel world/alternate universe/imaginary world that is summoned/Touko is sent to because she listens to Kakeru's mother play the piano? Like basically everybody was opposite to what they were really like, and Touko and Kakeru's positions were flipped. Touko was the outsider who moved to the town, and Kakeru was in the group instead of her. Pretty weird, and I don't really see why they felt the need to introduce such a major thing so close to the end. Especially when it didn't add anything, and also in the immediate next episode Touko's mom would literally debunk all of the stuff Touko was seeing in her mind as... well, nothing.



 

Saving the best for last, let's finally talk about the chickens and chicken metaphors. The chickens appear from the very first episode of Glasslip and throughout almost every single episode following. The chickens are in the op and the ed, Touko and her friends adopt the chickens in episode 1 only for them to later end up back at the school where they used to be, during more than a few conversations (especially between Touko and Kakeru), the camera will just switch to the chickens as they're talking repeatedly.

Of the group of chickens, there is a chicken named Jonathan and in one episode, he is shown distancing himself/moving away from the other chickens. Is Jonathan the Chicken supposed to represent Kakeru, who is this loner sort of guy who keeps his distance from Touko's group of friends? Mind you, all except one and Touko herself basically overly hate. Hell, by the end of the show, he is physically struck by at least two of them.

What if... what if in truth, they were chickens all along? Look at the first pictures again. There are five chickens, and there are five members of Touko's group including Touko herself. But there is also a hawk or an eagle in the sky. Is that Kakeru? After all, Touko's group only becomes unstable after Kakeru arrives, and the chickens are in fact running away.

 

She asks the chicken if he's Kakeru for some reason, and then exclaims the same chicken isn't Jonathan. What???

What about the clouds? What are the clouds supposed to represent?

This may all sound like extensive hyperbole, but with a show of so much ""nothing"", it seems this made people more actively search for some sort of meaning. [Chicken metaphors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2hfo2a/spoilersglasslipepisode13finaldiscussion/ckses23/) Perhaps while born out of a desire to try and justify having watched the entire thing, it doesn't entirely sound too implausible. Especially if Junji Nishimira truly does have a history of... using chickens. But I haven't watched [True Tears]( https://anilist.co/anime/2129/TrueTears) so I can't verify that either way.

Yet as far as Glasslip goes, there's no way there isn't something going on with the chickens. I refuse to believe they would purposely include them as much as they did if their only purpose behind it was ""okay, there's chickens."" It was pretty funny at the beginning but by the end, it was baffling that it was still happening/happening even more.

img440()

I think Touko was sitting on those stairs drawing the chickens at least two or three times. Does she just really like drawing chickens or does she want to ditch the glass making and try to be an ornithologist? 

Point is, even though that explanation made me go ""oh, okay, I can kind of sort of see that"", it does not excuse this show for anything at all. If you want to try and make like this complex and deep plot with metaphors while also including all of this supernatural stuff about seeing the future... I don't know, maybe chicken metaphors isn't the best route.

img440()

I'm just saying. I've never made a show, I've never animated, I've never written a script, I've never directed anything but... it feels like, I don't know, that they could have done better than this.




A straight up and unhesitating 1 out of 10. 

P.A. Works doesn't make bad looking shows (I mean come on, did you see those chickens? BEST CHICKEN ANIMATION HAND DOWN). If they had focused on one thing, Glasslip could have maybe turned out better. Make an actual teenage drama/romance series, a supernatural series where a glassmaker sees the future through the glass she makes, or just an outright calm and slow moving slice of life show that's actually about making glass. Don't shove all three together and then just slam chicken metaphors on top of it as hard as you possibly can.

""WE NEED TEN MORE SHOTS OF THE CHICKENS. MORE OF THE CHICKENS, WE HAVE TO HAMMER THIS HOME. OUR ANIME HAS TO BECOME KNOWN AS THE ONE WITH THE CHICKENS.""

While my attention did sort of perk up every single time the chickens came back, or like when they did the episode where it was just a hiking trip and then immediately with the next episode, it was back to the chickens, it's still not enough. Glasslip is very much a bad anime, and even worse than that, it falls far onto the worse side of ""bad anime."" It's not hilariously absurd like Ranpo Kitan, it's not a ridiculously over the top and gory horror like Another... and even in something like Wizard Barristers or Lances n' Masques, at least things happened in those shows.

In Glasslip, nothing happens. What little that does happen, they make a point to essentially undo or deem pointless/meaningless. Therefore, really the only ways I could see recommending Glasslip is morbid curiosity, severe masochism, or if you actually like P.A. Works' other shows and have decided you're going to watch even the... less than stellar ones they did.

For the record, out of the three, I'd argue Glasslip's Jonathan the Chicken would beat Wizard Barristers' perverted frog sidekick and Lance n' Masques' cute horse girl as far as ""bad anime"" mascots go. Everybody loves chickens."
146233,"It's pretty common to see ecchi animes forsake logic for more ecchi scenes and that's not a bad thing if the ecchi scenes are nice but seeing this anime balance out the ecchi scenes and the logic behind the reason why it happens is pretty refreshing to see

Kikuru Madan works as a guard for his city and he wants to graduate from that job because of his pursue for a normal young life. But as fate would have it, he starts receiving new recruits who he thought would possibly succeed him so he could finally retire but turns out they're worst than he thought

That's all the plot actually, there isn't a main goal in this anime, kinda like a slice of life. There aren't any ""defeating the demon lord"" ""protecting world peace"" ""getting revenge"" ""being the strongest"" kinda plot, it's just a man who wants to retire because he's tired of his job. The girls, who're obviously going to be in his harem, all have something they're bad at, such as being scared of monsters, lazy, can't control their powers etc. They join Kikuru's party to get training and overcome their problems. Although most of the time they look carefree and relaxed, when situations comes to worst they actually got themselves together, showing that although this is a ecchi anime, it could still take itself seriously and not just have cheap fan service

I mentioned that this anime's plot actually is constructive and it actually is. A minor spoiler, the monsters that Kikuru and his party are fighting are really attracted to the girls, in a sexual manner of course. When you look at tentacle ecchi scenes, have you ever wonder ""Why is the squid doing that?"" well I haven't but this anime gives an explanation nonetheless. The way and the timing they explain it as well is like it doesn't even matter, the anime does not care about the plot


""The explanation must be pretty bad if they put it off so long until they explained it""
Well no, first of all they didn't leave plot holes unlike most ecchi based anime. And second, they explain it just like how a fantasy anime would explain the concept of magic. Yes it doesn't make sense according to the rules of physics of our world but it makes its own rules and it follows it, that's fine. And I'm not saying all ecchi scenes has a reason or purpose but for the most part it does


I would recommend this to anyone who does not know what they want to watch because of the amount of anime that's released every season. I would not recommend this to someone who is in the mood for ecchi anime because the amount of cheap ecchi this anime has dilutes the value of some of its great ecchi scenes, it almost makes you not wanting to watch ecchi. I also won't recommend this to someone who wants to pay attention to the plot because the show explains the logic of the world at the latter episodes for some reason, so the story seems dumb at the start"
19365,"As of the writing of this review I've sat down to watch this show twice, once while down with a fever and the other time with someone who had no idea what they were getting into. I can still look back at the show fondly for how amazing the viewing experience was. It's a show that constantly makes you thinking  ""There's no way they can top this in absurdity. This has to be the peak of this roller coaster ride, right?"" Yet each and every time it shatters that thought into a million pieces as it draws another card from their ideas hat and slap it down onto their madlib creation that goes for the plot.

Both the main characters of Goto and Masayoshi are enjoyable in their own ways and play well off each other. Side characters range from entertaining to mildly annoying, even the villains get some character that makes them enjoyable to watch. The bromance between Goto and Masayoshi is top tier even if the director tries to deny it.

 Can't say much about the story as half the fun of the show is the journey that goes increasingly strange the farther you get into it. Starts off as just a dude wanting to be like those super heroes from super sentai shows or kamen rider. What I will say for those that might find it slow in the beginning is to at least try getting to episode 7 before calling it quits. If after watching that till the episode till end you still aren't hooked then the rest of the show isn't for you. Not everything may make sense and when it ramps up the story can move forward at break neck speeds.

Honestly it isn't the best and can get noticeably bad farther into the series. It's not bad enough that it ruined the series for me and in some cases it added to my enjoyment, probably for the wrong reasons.

Nothing about it really stood out to me personally, overall I'd say it was okay.

Some of the most fun I've had in recent years marathoning through a series and the fact that you really can't predict where the show is going adds to the experience. Might not be the show for you if you try to overthink things or can't enjoy shows that go off the rails. The ending is also a 10/10 that wrapped up the show perfectly. Overall the show might not be for everyone and some might think it's just stupid but I at least hope a few more people may be able to experience the beauty that is samurai flamenco, considered by some as the swan song of manglobe."
114,"There's a lot of ways to say screw it, and not care about what makes animation technologically pretty. You can make character outlines really sketchy, you can eschew in-betweens for your key poses, you could literally just shift your characters across the screen. Cromartie High School goes the latter route somewhat, letting its extremities lift any concerns about its low-budget feel. It's a classic TV animation principle: you're not watching Space Ghost Coast to Coast for good animation, but because the writing and situations are batshit and hilarious. If we're going way back, you're not watching Danger Mouse, Rocky and Bullwinkle, or Roger Ramjet for anything visually impressive. Let your prejudices against ""bad animation"" go for this one, or else you're just gonna look like a damn fool.

Characters are scaled bigger and/or smaller as they speak, still shots are repeated if needed, character designs are copy-pasted, random background elements will pop out of bare nowhere, stock images are used in place of drawings on more than one occasion. And all this does is add to the joke. Cromartie High School is a parody of delinquent anime that takes every opportunity to be as silly as humanly possible. There are no teachers because who cares? Any acts of delinquency are largely ignored, unless they need to make a joke about, for example, Takenouchi's extreme motion sickness. It's wonderful. I love it.
      

Freddie Mercury is there just because. There's a soda can-looking robot that they do anything EXCEPT take good care of. The leader of an opposing school is actually just intensely into comedy. There's entire episodes about a satirical take on cutesy mascot anime that have little to do with the main cast. The gorilla gets an entire episode about working at a sushi shop based on a singular gag in the previous episode, and none of the established characters besides Mechizawa's little brother do so much as show up.

It's a seriously funny anime that echoes several low-budget peers of the 20th century. It's somewhat of a shame Adult Swim never got its hands on it, because really, this is exactly the type of show that Cartoon Network airs at 11 pm. It's short, has barely any smooth or flashy animation to speak of, and lets the clever writing and characters do the work for it. Well, I say clever, but standout jokes can range from genuinely smartly written (""We need a sumo wrestler on car two"") to ""our robot is now a bike, we are spending the whole episode with our main character doing cool things on the robot bike"". I must add that said episode decides to have a clip show towards the end, and none of the clips have much relation to each other in the first place. If you really care about that sort of thing, you've got to loosen up a little bit. Have some fun in your life. Accept Cromartie High School into it. You'll thank me later."
21748,"“High school girls sure are complicated.”
--Haruko Haruhara, Episode 6

img880()

And so ends one of the most profoundly odd trilogies in the entire medium. FLCL, FLCL Progressive, and FLCL Alternative. What’s maybe most striking about the three entries in what is now a franchise is how different they are from each other despite working off the same “core” premise. The original still exists, to some extent, upon a pedestal. It is a bizarre, ever-shifting thing, both literally (the series was originally conceived as a way to experiment with animation after all) and thematically, and any analysis of it that attempts to be brief and snappy is doomed to fail. Progressive is a darker, and, lord help me for using the word positively, grittier take on the idea. Recasting the villainous but charming Haruko as the much nastier Haruha, and replacing the self-important but lovable Naota with the deeply depressed violence fetishist Hidomi. Those two form a part in of themselves, as much of Progressive’s raison d’arte is to cast a skeptical, leering eye toward the original FLCL, sometimes seeming to question as to whether making the villain so charming is a good idea, and whether maybe the series is a bit too open to interpretation altogether. 

Where does that leave Alternative? The final entry in the trilogy, and in some ways, a bit of a rebuttal to Progressive’s audience-antagonizing take on the series. More than that though, Alternative--at least initially--seems like it has much less to say about FLCL and much more to say about, well, stuff in general. In a strange sort of sense, this makes it rather “traditional”, to the extent that a franchise like FLCL has traditions to return to. 

img880()

If Alternative has an overall theme, it is probably something like this; “People fuck up”. Specifically, our protagonist, 17 year old Kana, fucks up. A lot. In a broader sense, so does almost everyone else in the cast. Kana’s three friends--Hijiri, Mossan, and Pets--each get a focus episode (in a half-cour series, really) in which they make some kind of mistake. Hijiri is caught in a hookup with a college-aged boy, Mossan attempts to shoulder the burden of working up enough money to attend a fashion school on her own, and Pets….is rather complicated. Kana--and Haruko, here in a much more heroic role than her turn in Prog and indeed even the original--helps to solve these problems in her own way, which turns out in the grand scheme of things, to be something of a fuckup in of itself, in the last episode she admits her propensity to help others at the expense of her own wellbeing to be, basically, an act. Something done for her own sake.

The last episode, interestingly, brings back some of the metatext that made Prog as good as it was (or more properly, reveals what's been there from the start) and at the end, FLCL, one of the most strikingly original anime of all time, has its sequel duology go out like a shonen series. All stammered speeches about the power of love and 11th-hour super-powers to rewrite reality and scratch together a happy(-ish) ending at the last minute. Does that sound like a complaint? It isn’t, though it’d be foolish to expect answers from FLCL of all things, the final episode of Alternative is jam-packed with conversation with the show’s predecessors--not just Progressive (the “I don’t know what I want” segment of Kana’s speech echoing Hidomi’s “there’s nothing I want to be”) and the original FLCL (full-on flashbacks as Haruko appears to be flung sideways in time at the series’ conclusion)--but the rest of the Daicon lineage too, most saliently, Diebuster, whose ending this series’ finale somewhat mirrors. Nono’s black hole sacrifice recontextualized as an act of self-empowerment and seizing control of one’s life.

This is without even getting into the minor details; The fan bait that is the Steve Blum-voiced soba shop owner talking about making soba until the end of the world, a statement it’s hard to not read on a meta level as being about the perpetually half-dying anime localization industry. The scarily prescient idea of the richest and most powerful citizens of Earth fleeing to Mars in the face of a doomed planet.The knotted timeline which I can only imagine the most devoted fans will be trying to untangle for years. Alternative even, in parts of Kana's speech in the finale and an earlier conversation in the same episode, joins A Place Further Than The Universe as the second series this year to openly criticize the ""endless everyday"" concept that is foundational to the slice of life genre, and subsequently, much modern anime in general. There’s a lot to Alternative, which is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness.

If anything, I suspect Alternative will work for even fewer people than Progressive. Prog relied on having a working knowledge of the original series and hearts in your eyes for Haruko. Alt cranks that up to eleven and rips the dial off. Invoking the original, Prog, Diebuster, anime youth dramas, and so much more. It’s a lot to ask of the audience, and depending on how you view these sorts of things, you could argue that Alt doesn’t really stand on its own legs. After spending four of its six episodes seeming like it was unconcerned with the series’ legacy, Alt turns out to have the most relationship to the rest of FLCL out of almost any other work in the franchise--the manga adaptation of the original included. This structure can also make the first half of Alternative feel a little aimless, so it’s definitely not a strategy that works perfectly, but of the three six-episode series, Alt might--if only just barely--actually prove to be the most rewarding in the long run, both in how it interacts with the rest of the series and its commentary on the real world. It’s a hard thing to call, but if the original FLCL proved anything way back when it aired at the dawn of the new millennium, it’s that you can be weird, be difficult, be obtuse even, and still have people respect what you’re trying to do, and maybe even love it. 

If there’s a note to close on, it should be this; In a world that feels doomed, works like Alternative are cathartic, even important. A hard-fought struggle for love on a planet that seems like it’s lost it, in 2018, by design or by simple applicability, is something worth praising.

152682,"Watching Sasaki and Peeps had to have been the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced while watching anime. The first two or three episodes were excusable under the pretense of exposition. We learn of Sasaki, Peeps, and the Fantasy World among other concepts. In this review I will be criticizing the plot, pacing, characters, and ost. 

     The plot is something that can be described as unique. The different worlds, power systems, origins of power could have been one of the more interesting animes of this season/genre. However, there is such thing as too much, too fast. Being hit rapid fire with three different systems of ""magic"" with no explanation on how these systems work. Along side these systems are their respective groups. For the overworld you have psychics who work for the company along with an anonymous group that fights with the company, in the Fantasy World you have magicians, and a completely unrelated world/group of ""Magical Girls"" who just randomly appear with no rhyme or reason in the plot besides their hatred for psychics. These four groups interact with each other constantly without any explanation on why they are interfering with the other besides mutual hate and or destruction. Next is what the story is trying to sell you. 

     In the beginning Sasaki adopts Peeps and learns about the Fantasy World through him. He then learns of being able to transport between the two worlds and begins a life of being a merchant, learning magic, and getting hired by the overworld company for a cool double-life type story. However soon after they introduce these things, Sasaki gets whisked away on trying to help some schmuck who got caught up in a political scene for over half the episodes. What could have been a nice little side story turned out to be the most boring part of the anime. Back and forth dialogue with nothing being said of importance. You could skip minutes at a time of these scenes only for the camera angle to be the exact same and the exact same words being said. During these episodes the entire plot (if there even was any to begin with) gets completely put on hold. From the point of imprisonment, the characters completely stop progressing as people. They are a concept of either a world, magical system, or group. They have no depth, no expansion to who they are and what they want to do, and to top it off all their dialogue is dry and repetitive. 

     There isn't a single character I could name besides Sasaki and Peeps and that is probably due to it being the damn title of the show. Lastly is the music. When it was actually playing, it was not that bad, for the first few episodes. Once episode four comes around you realize they no longer have anymore ost to play, so they start and stop it abruptly during dialogue or scene transitions only to start the exact same track again. This anime is just a disappointment and waste of your time. The only thing that could be complimented is the animation itself, while its not MAPPA levels of good, it was at least serviceable and wasn't grating to look at. 

     TL:DR There is no plot, the pacing is horrid, the characters start off as interesting then just get stale and boring, and the music is ok when it actually plays.

Hana no Uta is what happens when you have a bunch of interesting ideas tied into a lose-lose plot. Normally, something like this would be a mess (which it is), but it is still an enjoyable kind of mess thanks to its solidly animated action sequences, cute art style, and quirky characters.

You probably heard of animation studios overworking their staff (cough MAPPA) but sometimes, you get to watch something that looks like there aren't any compromises made during its making. Hana no Uta is one such case, where there's practically nothing to complain about its visuals. In fact, there are many details in visuals that add a lot to the experience. Whether the story is laid back or intense, the visuals do a great job at keeping things engaging.


img400()



The characters and plot are all half baked. The moment it feels like the story or a character arc is going somewhere, it gets sidelined as the next thing pop ups. So the anime struggles a lot to keep a proper tone. The characters would be in a life or death battle, then there would be a sudden gag that completely destroys the seriousness of the situation the story built up until the point. And then there's fan service... Look, there are moments where I [liked](https://anilist.co/review/20983) and [disliked](https://anilist.co/review/16651) fan service, and this goes into the later section. Reasons are similar as mentioned in the other review, Misplaced fan service. There's also this problem where the anime doesn't make a few points clear, so you might get lost in the earlier episodes.
The characters aren't fleshed out either. The anime does care enough to give screen time for emotional investment, but it ultimately falls flat because the characters are ultimately a bunch of soulless ideas roaming without a clear purpose. One's that do have (Juri and Lila) are introduced very late into the show and their character arcs aren't well paced.

The manga ""Yozakura Quartet"" has been in serialization since 2006, and so far it has 2 anime adaptations (one 2008 & a reboot in 2013) and two 3 episodes OVAs. I haven't watched 08 adaptation yet, but it seems the 2008 has same art style as manga but not faithful to story, and 2013 one has different art style but more faithful to the manga's story, though some changes were made.
Anyway, here's the watch order, apparently:
Hana no Uta EP 1-8 (2013) -> Hoshi no Umi 1-3 (OVA) -> Hana no Uta EP 9-13 -> Tsuki ni Naku 1-3 (OVA)

I personally found it enjoyable, the art style and characters are cute, the abilities were interestingly used, the characters are all fun (I particularly liked Lila), but it can ultimately be disappointing once you figure out the manga itself is incomplete, and the anime might not get a S2.

A fun Anime from 2010s backed by a solid budget with plenty of action, but the ultimate downfall is its poorly written plot.
(And this is probably the first time Yuuki Kaji VAd a protagonist that gives a red scarf to his live interest lol)."
97932,"When I was scoping out the Spring 2017 Anime line-up, The Royal Tutor didn’t really hit my radar. From the synopsis and the preview graphics that had been released, I honestly thought it was going to be a very cheesy show with some strong boy-love vibes. As a person who doesn’t usually go for the boy-love genre, I wasn’t interested in it at all. But something about it, and I have no fricking clue what, told me to at least watch the first episode so I could confirm my feelings. I’m really glad that I listened to that tiny, not-so-weird-at-all-little-voice-in-my-head because this series ended up being surprisingly decent.

When I began it I got a very strong Ouran High School Host Club aura from it. You’ve got four boys who very quickly get unique names via our Heine-sensei, and they each have a relatively tropey persona. Initially, this made me very hesitant in watching the second episode. No offence towards Ouran, but this trope is so fucking overdone that I didn’t want to deal with another show that revolved around it. Luckily, my fascination with the mysterious tutor outweighed my frustration and I continued onwards.

My expectations for the show started to grow, but didn’t really turn into anything fantastic as I watched. Mid-way through the season when we still hadn’t learned anything about the Royal Tutor’s past, I began to feel highly sceptical about the writing. I knew that we were running out of episodes and time for a good, fluid explanation of how a teacher could also be so skilled in combat as to equal a highly-seasoned warrior. There were some very vague hints, but not much else to go on. I also found there to be a slight imbalance on the attention given to each of the four boys, where a couple of them received a lot more screen time than the others. These two aspects actually filled me with a bit of anxiously negative anticipation. I’ve seen it many times before. A show starts off wonderfully, but then it overreaches and falls terribly short in its execution. Luckily, that didn’t really happen with The Royal Tutor.

While it’s far from being a glorious masterpiece, it has a decent number of facets that make it quite an enjoyable anime series. The first are the characters themselves. We get to learn about each one of the boys and why they are so vehemently against tutors and education. The reasons aren’t superficial. They are laced with insecurities and bad experiences. Occasionally a reason for one son will seem minor in comparison to another, but it just adds an empathetic dimension to their personas that makes you want to root for their success. I like that these boys aren’t perfect. Their flaws make them that much more engaging.

The tutor himself is someone who reminded me of Onizuka from the anime series GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka. He is a man who took the time to understand the underlying issues that kids have in order to better tackle them with a fitting solution. Heine and Onizuka knew that kids aren’t going to respond to a one-size-fits-all solution. Each kid is different with unique issues and problems. To help said kids, you really have to be willing to get to know them and distinguish them as individuals in a way most people don’t want to deal with.

Remember how I mentioned earlier I was worried about the imbalance of screen-time for the boys? It turns out that some of the boys needed the extra attention because their problems needed that extra support. It also played very well towards plot progression because the imbalance was created to fit the unique issues and insecurities that each of the sons were going through. For example, one of the kids is a very shy and timid person with a fearsome outwardly appearance. He wasn’t shown nearly as much as I had hoped (he became my favourite character because I could relate to him like you wouldn’t believe) because of this demeanour. It wouldn’t have made sense for him to be sprouting up all over the place, unlike the youngest brother who’s a social whore.

The themes in the show were also a bit comforting. Most of it had to deal with accepting yourself for who you are, even if other’s can’t accept you. It was dealt with in a positive way that doesn’t negatively portray awkward social skills, or fetishise issues involving a lower intelligence, etc. etc. I like that the changes that the boys make are gradual instead of just being an instant fix as soon as they comprehend the lessons they’re learning. There’s also a bit of focus on not judging anyone by their appearance or initial mannerisms because there’s a huge chance that you will be wrong about them, friendships come in all shapes and sizes, and soft things will always be cute.

All of these elements made for a pleasant watching experience, however, it does have its faults. The humour, while being kooky and a light-hearted means at softening tough topics, is really predictable at times and felt cheesy and out-dated. The story in its entirety is of average quality and can make you feel pretty indifferent about whether you’re having a good time or not. Although I do like the characters, nothing within the The Royal Tutor truly made me anticipate the next episode with impatient, passionate glee. I felt so apathetic about having to wait a week for new content, or when the content finally did arrive I’d watch everything else before really getting to this. The only thing that I was super fricking curious about was Heine’s past, which was a small bit of a let-down because the morsels of clues left in the wake of one episode to the next made it sound like Heine would have a really badass history. Instead the truth was disappointing and anticlimactic.

The animation itself is pretty much typical; nothing extraordinary or breath-taking. It’s clean and seemingly well-developed. I found the outdoors scenery to be more pleasant than the interiors. There are a lot more details that go into creating the environment and atmospheres amidst nature than within buildings. We see this with the mansion, or palace, as it just felt like an atypical reproduction of a European mansion that seems quite standard in anime with such structures. Within a local café in town, we get a similar situation. The café does look to be quite large and it is nicely presented, but it doesn’t encapsulate the same sort of attention to details that the natural atmospheres do.

Mid-way through the series, we do get a whisper of a small plot that’s being hatched to affect who will inherit the throne if and when the king passes on. This is something that felt extremely out of place to me for multiple reasons. Firstly, it randomly just pops up at the finale of an episode or two and then isn’t brought up again until a few episodes later. Secondly, when it is brought up, it’s only for a couple of minutes; not nearly enough to make any sort of impact. It makes one last appearance during the final episodes, and it honestly felt like the only reason it was tossed into the series to begin with was to add some tension and intrigue to the plot.

Overall, The Royal Tutor is a good, fun average anime to check out. The cast is engaging and you can’t help but feel for them in certain situations. The story is very chill and simple, as is the animation and music. But if you’re in the mood for something that’s going to blow your mind, or totally make your jaw drop, then this anime is not for you.

6 tortes outta 10!"
3342,"This is by far the most boring anime I have watched. I rarely finish a series if I find myself disliking it mid-way through the series. I’m very disappointed since I really wanted to enjoy Mnemosyne that at first, I was very willing to ignore whatever flaws it had. It’s too bad that the negative aspects vastly outweigh the positive ones.

Before I go into the details of why Mnemosyne didn’t appeal to me very much, I’d like to state the things that I did enjoy. The opening song is one of them. I enjoy it so much that I barely skipped it. I'd even go far as to say that it was the most enjoyable thing in the anime. The visual aspect of the opening was mediocre and just plain boring. The other thing that I enjoyed, or at least tried to, is the main character, Rin. Rin seemed to be the protagonist that I was always looking for in anime, which is why I badly wanted Mnemosyne to be good. She was the perfect mix of cool and bad ass and I really did like her character design,  but eventually, she just failed to be interesting.

The biggest problem I have with this anime is the lack of development. Everything from the plot to the characters was left unexplained. They fail to show what the main characters motivations are. This isn’t just exclusive to the main characters, it goes for every character in this anime.

The fight scenes are just meh. The show barely has any entertaining fight choreography and opts for guns and explosions. The most interesting fight scene in Mnemosyne is in the first episode and gets worse as the shows progress. In fact, the previous sentence describes the entire anime perfectly as the animation and stories descend far below pathetic by the last episode. The soundtrack is completely lackluster and seems to have been pulled straight from stock soundtrack library. 

Overall, I think it was mainly a waste of time. The only other thing I felt while watching this show aside from boredom was frustration."
20566,"Look, listen. Nagato was best girl in the Haruhi series. Would be nice to see more of her, yes? Oh, look! An anime about Nagato. Well, you might think so, if you read the title but you are wrong, very wrong. The voice actress is the same, the character design is .. roughly the same? The artstyle is definitely different and I guess it's a question of personal taste but Kyon looks almost nothing like himself. Nagato's personality is not the same. It's like they took everything that made her great and threw it right out the window. What you're left with is an incredibly boring slice-of-nothing anime with characters that could be easily replaced with cardboard cut-outs. Remember Koizumi? His one single role in this anime is to simp for Haruhi and simp he does. 
At the very least there is a little bit of fanservice - mainly done by showing off Nagato's PSVita, what a gem. (
The next section will contain spoilers, but honestly just read it, spare yourself from watching this:
For some stupid reason both Nagato and Haruhi fall in love with Kyon after like one interaction with him. In Nagato's case he helped her get a library card, in Haruhi's case.. he said that maybe Aliens do exist, or something. BAM - love. You might think, well, maybe this rivalry will become a major plotpoint in the series? It doesn't. It goes nowhere, just like the rest of the anime.
The best part of the anime are 3 episodes in which Nagato's personality changes due to a 'traumatic' car accident. She basically becomes 'Old Nagato' but all too soon the tumor that is New Nagato's personality starts to spread. Of course, this Nagato also falls in love with Kyon and she actually manages to confess her feelings before she 'dramatically' disappears, letting New Nagato take control once again.
It only goes downhill from there.
Kyon acts awkward around Nagato after 'her' confession, there's a whole lot of nothing + some nods and referenced to the Haruhi series - you know, an actually good anime?
And don't get me started on the last episode.
They go to a summer festival, including a firework show. The PERFECT opportunity for Kyon to confess, that he too has fallen in love with Nagato, amirite? As the trope goes, he tells her everything but - oh snap - Nagato couldn't hear a thing! No kiss, no clarification but for some reason Kyon feels like he accomplished what he had set out to do, pats himself on the back, and moves on. It's like nothing ever happened since Episode 1.
Oh yeah, and of course the end teases us with a reminder of the endless eight, setting up for a timeloop-scenario that will be covered in the OVA.

Should you watch this anime? No. No, don't. Even if you liked Nagato? Yeah, run, don't look back. Do not let your memory of Nagato be ruined by this generic, trope-abusing, boring piece of media."
4186,"Regios has neither a setting nor aesthetic I typically have much luck with, but I still enjoyed it a good deal. In terms of style and structure, it is very much a typical action LN adaptation of its time. The anime greets its viewer with like 4 dozen characters, non sequential scenes, about another two dozen made up nouns and world mechanics terms. Nothing is really resolved or explained in the end, but I was 100% prepared for that with an anime like this. It is not a series for people who need to have every element spelled out for them, or those who are concerned about  plot holes and the like.

The strength of the show lies in its strong cast of a few heroines I'm fond of, and their different relationships with the MC. It also works at an effective pace, and aside from some plot bombardment in the first and final episodes, takes on a rather relaxed mood (for a dystopian action anime). There is some core theme of the importance of fighting alongside your friends, but for one's own ideals and not anyone else. This is developed mostly through dialogue and is a little redundant at times, but there's enough going on in the anime for it to be acceptable. There is a minor ""chosen one"" theme that becomes most apparent towards the end, which I always enjoy, but it's nothing crazy since the backstory is still vastly under explored.

There is a weird side story here, portrayed in jarring cutscenes sprinkled in at random. I started skipping them in the anime since it was such a strange creative decision. I see these were reorganized and polished up in a separate anime titled Legend Of Regios. I think it is supposed to hint at the creation of the world the main anime takes place in. But even so, almost nothing is actually revealed. I think watching Legend Of Regios on its own after completing the series might at least help me infer my own sense of direction with the plot of this anime.

So, a 7/10 for me. I have the DVD and will keep it on my shelf as I'm left with good memories of this anime. As a whole I might have enjoyed it slightly more than its comparable season-mate Asura Cryin (which to its benefit does have an ""end"" no matter how chaotic it is), but I don't think it's as good as its studio-mate Densetsu Yuusha (which has probably even less of an ""end"" than Regios).



PS. A few random positive things of note are that Felli Loss is one of the best standalone kuuderes I've encountered in anime--she has some genuinely hilarious scenes. This anime is probably very influential in the explosion of ""battle academy"" anime that properly began with Infinite Stratos. While I am indifferent to the OP, the anime boasts a pair of EDs that I found very nice--one of which has a special version featuring a real life husband+wife duet between Nobuhiko Okamoto and Asuka Oogame.

14807,"This review is all subjective and my own personal opinion. You do not have to agree with it, nor am I asking you to. I hope that this just helps you get an idea of what the anime I am talking about is like and form a basic and general consensus on it. The ratings I give anime and manga are mostly my personal overall enjoyment. I have not read the novel, and it has been around a month or two since I have watched the anime. This review will be spoiler free, with spoilers being marked as such. A big thank you to [Nikz](https://anilist.co/user/Nikz/) for proofreading this review and giving me feedback. TL;DR will be at the bottom.

Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin is another iteration in the Kara no Kyoukai series. Despite this being the latest Kara no Kyoukai movie made, it is not the latest in chronological order, except for the final part of the film. The final part of the film takes place ten years after the end of Kara no Kyoukai, which as far as the entire series goes, including novels. The first part of the film revolves around two characters who the power of precognition (in basic terms, they can see the future). The first is Shizune Seo, who has the 'prediction' type of precognition. She is a student at Reien Girl's Academy and is Azaka Kokutou's roommate. The other is Mitsuru Kamekura, who has the 'calculation' type of precognition. He is a serial bomber with a 100% success rate, thanks to his precognition. If you are confused as what the types of precognitions mean, do not fret, a fairly easy to understand explanation of the meaning of the two types is present in the film. I could not tell you myself what it means though. Shiki gets involved due to the supernatural nature of his bombings, and the events of the film ensue...

The inner intricacies of the plot in the other Kara no Kyoukai movies can be notoriously confusing. Even after watching all of the films, I still find myself scratching my head as to what truly happened. Luckily, you never needed to fully understand what was going on to enjoy Kara no Kyoukai, the plot was still captivating. In Mirai Fukuin's case, the plot is much simpler this time around, the most complicated part of it being the precognition. Fortunately, an relatively easy to understand explanation of what precognition is and the differences between the two types is elaborated upon later in the film. The overarching plot is simple, one half being Shizune Seo when she meets Kokutou after (kind of a spoiler, but happens early on in the film) !she saves someone after seeing their death in the future,! and she shares her feelings about having the power of precognition. The other half of the plot revolves around Mitsuru Kamekura and his bombings. Eventually, Shiki is sent in to deal with him and stop his bombings. More straightforward than the other plots in the Kara no Kyoukai series, but personally not as gripping as the rest. Despite that, the plot remained engrossing enough to keep me in. The game of cat and mouse between Shiki and Kamekura's precognition powers was pretty fun to watch, I found myself contemplating how Shiki would defeat a villain who could see the future absolutely. Although the story was not as well written as the rest of the series, it still holds its own. Throughout the movie, I felt captivated by what was taking place, I wanted to know what happened next.
There is also an extra story at the end of the film which takes place ten years after the end of Kara no Kyoukai. Whilst I cannot go into too much detail without spoiling, it was a nice, short and heart-warming conclusion to the series. It is something good to see for fans who have gone through the rest of the series, considering it is the latest place in time Kara no Kyoukai takes place in. 

The returning characters are still great characters. Shiki is her usual self, cold, cynical and merciless self. Fans of Shiki will still like her in this film. Shiki has always been an interesting character, very different from the typical female protagonist. Perhaps that is what draws people in, her unique character and the charm she has along with it. Kokutou is the same as his other appearances. Gentle, sincere, and compassionate, he is simply easy to love. It was certainly easy for me to fall in love with him, Kokutou has become one of my favourite characters. Another returning character is Touko Aozaki, a prevalent character in the previous Kara no Kyoukai films. She mostly serves as the series' exposition, explaining complicated concepts and ideas that are commonly present in Kara no Kyoukai (although they can still remain very confusing even after the explanation). Her role as the series' exposition is vital to the series, allowing the viewer to have at least some understanding of the world and its inner intricacies. As a character, she certainly stands out, she is unique in her own right and is enjoyable to watch. The new characters introduced in this film are also decent. Shizune Seo is timid and introverted, and provides more content to the film. Her precognition powers make her more interesting to watch, seeing how she deals with having a power so involved in her life. Mitsuru Kamekura is also fascinating. There is a sense of mystery surrounding him in the film, and his precognition powers also make him more captivating. The voice acting in this movie is also pretty good. Maaya Sakamoto role as Ryougi Shiki is great, she plays the role of Shiki quite well. Shiki's way of speaking is starkly different from many other female characters, and Sakamoto does well to match her voice acting with Shiki's personality. Kenichi Suzumura also does well to fit the character of Kokutou, I enjoyed his voice acting. Takako Honda as Aozaki was also done quite well, fitting her personality and bring life to her character. I had no problems with the rest of the cast, they all did well to bring the world of Kara no Kyoukai to life.

Kara no Kyoukai is known for having absolutely stellar animation, even back in 2007. Once again, ufotable's animation work is wonderful to see, and the art style Type-Moon is known for looks amazing on the silver screen. This film from 2013 still holds up to today's standards of animation. There is less action in this film compared to the other Kara no Kyoukai films, but the animation is still great to watch. The art looks great on the characters and the settings are pleasing to look at.

The Kara no Kyoukai series has some of my favourite tracks in all of the anime I have watched. Yuki Kajiura and Kalafina have once again excelled in crafting music that melds into the world, making it more alive and captivating. The music fits the supernatural and dark setting of the series extremely well. The theme song, Alleluia (アレルヤ), is a pretty good song as well, great to listen to even outside the film.

This film is a nice treat after watching all of the other Kara no Kyoukai movies. These are side stories, and can be skipped if desired, but I would still recommend this film to any fan of Kara no Kyoukai. Especially so since the final part of the movie takes place ten years after the end of Kara no Kyoukai. If you came to this review without having watched any other Kara no Kyoukai film, I would still recommend this series, but you should start [here](https://anilist.co/anime/2593/-/) (or movie two, since that is the first chronologically). The series is good for those looking for something with great animation, along with a dark and thrilling plot. If you liked the Fate series, chances are you will like this series too. It is written by the same author, Kinoko Nasu and takes place in an alternative timeline in the same universe. Of course, Kara no Kyoukai is not for everyone, and can be pretty hard to get into. But still, I would still recommend giving it a try. To summarise this review:
- An easier to understand plot compared to the rest of the series, but not as captivating.
- The returning cast are still great, and the new characters are fascinating too.
- The game of cat and mouse between Shiki and Kamekura is one of the most engrossing parts of the film.
- Voice acting that brings out the personality of the characters and makes the world more alive.
- Stellar animation and art.
- Fitting music that makes the world feel more alive.

Characters: The characters were pretty much what you would find in a harem anime, there's lolis, an over aggressive female, a distinctive male to say: ""It's not all chicks fellas"", a Trap and a few more I really didn't bother with presenting since they are no different from any other harem anime.
I mean overall it's the normal setting so I really wasn't expecting much nor was I bothered by it, what bothered me the most was the sister's voice that didn't even come close to fitting her character...I don't know if she is the daughter of someone in the company or if she was a new VA but damn that casting was complete shit!
The main character well he is distinctive, an otaku genius that only do what he wants to do at the moment, which normally involves being a cool guy for the legion of chicks he has around.

Plot: Holy crap this is what annoyed me the most and what made me want to write this review.
The plot start fine, interesting but fast forward 3 episodes and you see that it's just a repetition of itself for the most part....and that's okay. 
What's not okay is the way the MC solves those conflicts. Now bear with me, I know anime isn't supposed to be realistic but you need to have fundamentals, you can't just throw words at it and hope people won't realize that you're just saying random gibberish. That's what happens here, random gibberish and actions, for example [Spoilers ahead] when doing the dude's arc they have football, and in football there are rules...well not in here, in here the guy just charges at the goal and tackles everyone else in front of him...keep in mind THIS IS NOT AMERICAN FOOTBALL, this is soccer, you can't just charge and tackle people out of the way.
This was just an example of the ""plot twists"" and ""solutions"" that are found in this anime. On the last arc specially they start throwing around scientific words and procedures without having any, and I mean, any idea what do they mean to a point that it is painful to watch.

Art and animation: I'm pretty sure this anime was animated by an army on interns that couldn't finish an Art Degree in college, I did better animations in 11th grade.

Overall: The anime starts out great but rapidly becomes dull, predictable and incredibly unrealistic, the characters aren't really memorable and the aniamtion is shite.

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
16774,"Every so often, there comes an area where crime has run rampant, becoming a scourge on the innocent people who want nothing more than to live there peacefully. In places like Townsville, Gotham city, Metropolis, New York City, Tokyo and others seem to be under a curse that attracts the worst of the worst to their streets, where they build their empires, corrupt the political systems, or just rain general destruction down on the population. There are many of these locations, all of which are really better off being avoided, but one town stands out among all the others. There’s one town where the light of hope has all but flickered out, and the concentration of evil in the form of gangs, super villains and horrible monstrosities has almost become the majority. This is Jack Knife Edge Town, and yeah. with a name like that, it’s no wonder things have become so bleak. In a town like this one, the only entity that can stand in the way of the forces of evil to protect the innocent is one man… No. One cop.

That cop is none other than Inferno Cop, who is really more a mass of sentient muscles than a man in a police uniform. Oh, and did I mention that he has a flaming skull for a head? Yeah, despite looking every bit like a hellspawn himself, Inferno Cop is the one man the criminal population fears, and he’s dishing out the kind of hardcore, bloody justice that would make Sleepy Johnny Estes jealous. Having lost his family to the Southern Cross gang, Inferno Cop wants both justice and revenge, and will happily fire his inexplicably explosive bullets at any being that opposes him, even hostages on some occasions. Unfortunately for Inferno Cop, neither avenging his family nor cleaning up the streets of Jack Knife Edge Town will be as easy as shooting a bunch of gangbangers, because there’s a lot more going on here than just your average every day criminal behavior. He’s going to have to fight giant monsters, cyborgs, judges, robot dinosaurs and the forces of heaven and hell themselves to bring this story to a happy ending. It’s a mad world out there, but is he mad enough to survive it?

Well, guys, it’s Studio Trigger time again. I talked about this company a few years ago in what turned out to be one of my favorite reviews from my collection, Kill La Kill. That and Inferno Cop are their first two titles, and also regretfully the only works from them that I’ve actually seen. I’ll eventually see Darling in the Franxx when it’s finished airing, how could I resist with the amount of controversy surrounding it, but for now, all I really know about them is their origin. Studio Trigger was established by former Gainax employees, including director Hiroyuki Imaishi, and information about their first official title… Titled Inferno Cop, if you haven’t guessed by now… has been hard to come by. I read in an interview that they were hired by a youtube channel to create a short length anime series, and after a few concepts fell flat, they eventually settled on an idea they thought nobody has heard of before… A cop who’s on fire and slays evil. That explains the show’s low budget, but there was another detail mentioned that I’m a bit more curious about.

Further down in the interview, Hiromi Wakabayashi states that the basic idea behind Inferno Cop was to put in as little effort or time as possible, and that each episode had to be completed in under two hours. I’ve tried to find some explanation on who mandated this, what circumstances dictated it, or any kind of reason why this was the rule, but in lieu of an explanation, I’ll instead say that Trigger responded to these limitations in a surprisingly inspired way. The animation in this series is a strange combination of high-definition sprites and stock visual effects like fire, explosions and blood spurts. I know people like to say that shows like Robot Chicken are just guys playing with star wars toys, but stop motion animation of any kind is a lot of hard work compared to that image. Well, that same difference in effort exists in Inferno cop, with their on screen motions looking like someone cropped an image and is moving it with his cursor compared to actual frame-by-frame animation.

Does that mean it doesn’t look good? Hell no. As relatively easy as it probably was to animate, Inferno cop looks awesome. Kill La Kill would occasionally move a character like they did in this show, and it was usually pretty funny, but seeing it done non-stop throughout the series is kind of a unique experience. It’s especially ridiculous when you see just how gritty, detailed and edgy the designs are, from the run-down, crumbled aesthetic of Jack Knife Edge Town to the masculine, testosterone-laden character designs that look like they were taken out of a vintage western comic book, being used in such a rudimentary way, there’s something about it that just works. The time and budget restrictions also lead to a lot of the characters having repeated templates and poses, with simple artistic and fashion-related changes distinguishing between the characters. Yet, somehow, it never looks cheap. Yeah, the characters are just still images being moved around(which looks hilarious in the racing episode), but there’s so much happening on screen at any given time that the effect is lost.

Well, that works just fine for the animation, but I’d like to think the music got a little more TLC from the producers, because it’s pretty awesome. There are several episodes that include commercials for the Inferno Cop soundtrack right in their run-time, and I would really like to snag a copy of it, because this show’s music is fucking tight. The music is a hard, fast blend of rock and techno, and I don’t air-guitar very often(or ever, really), but these tracks make it pretty tempting, especially with background tunes like Hell Dillinger and Chaser. There are some cool gimmick tracks like the Egypt-inspired Desert City, the ominous Theme of Southern Cross, and the swanky, swinging OZOMBIEDESUKA, but the real gems of the soundtrack are the vocal tracks. The song Die Hollen Polizei serves as both the intro and closing of the show, and it’s also used constantly as an insert song, which would be annoying if it wasn’t so awesome. My personal favorite, though, is Grue Elise von mir, a bona fide rock ballad that gets used for any ‘sad’ or ‘touching moment in the series, even though they’re kind of hard to take seriously.

Inferno cop never got picked up for an American release, which is a huge shame because I know that Funimation would knock it right out of the park, but they did manage to cast an actor for Inferno himself when his character made a cameo in another anime, Space Patrol Luluco. Christopher Sabat wound up being perfect for the role, as anybody could have predicted, but he hasn’t been able to touch the main series, unfortunately. The original Japanese voice actor was Junichi Goto, a newbie at the time who brought a tough and grisly-voiced performance that makes it sound like he was trying to channel Segata Sanshiro. He’s pretty damn good, as far as my English-speaking ears can tell. The rest of the cast was basically just a handful of guys doing hastily improvised voices, and they’re cast so repetitively that… I swear to God this is true… In the credits in the final episode, they actually fast forward through the cast listing, even though they still list every single character, important or not, meticulously crediting each role.

When I was first exposed to Inferno Cop, I really didn’t have any interest in it. I honestly didn’t even know it was anime… I thought it was Russian, or something. I knew made a brief appearance as an okay joke in an AMV Hell movie, and it made another brief appearance in a terrible reanimated clip in a Ponies the Anthology installment, but aside from those glimpses, I spent five years never having any reason to check it out… That is, until April of this year, when I volunteered at my local anime convention. They had me doing a bunch of odd jobs, but my last one was acting as host and head-counter for a couple of showings, the first among them being Inferno Cop(which got a two hour slot despite being an hour long with Fact Files). Having to watch it in a crowded room full of adults whose IDs I had to check, and being part of a group viewing experience, I’ll admit, I got sucked in. I was able to embrace the ridiculousness of it, warts and all, and it wound up being one of the highlights of the con for me.

Having said that, Inferno Cop is stupid. Like, it’s really stupid, a show full of randomness, logical inconsistencies, problematic elements, and an almost impressive number of cliches and deus ex machinas. If you’ve read my reviews up until this point, this would seriously not seem like something I’d ever be into. I mean, how can I have the gall to gush about this series when I very recently called Excel Saga lazy? And no, I’m not going to backpedal on anything I’ve said in the past, nor am I going to make up some bullshit about this show having depth, or some underappreciated metaphors or social commentary. Inferno Cop is exactly what it looks like from a cursory glance: It’s stupid nonsense full of bad writing and juvenile sensibilities. I’m not gonna deny the fact that just about every element that went into this series is something I’ve shat on other shows for doing in the past, so why am I being so much nicer to this one?

Well, there are two things Inferno Cop does right, and they’re both pretty important. For the first thing, let’s take a look at Magical Play, a show I was distinctly disappointed with, despite it being every bit as weird as Inferno. It was appropriately weird and full of batshit crazy ideas, and it created an unpredictable environment where anything could happen in it’s world of fluffy nonsense. Despite having all of this going for it, it got boring real fast due to a lack of direction and a tone that was always shifting in confusing ways. Are we here to see the girls getting into weird dream-like situations, or are we here to see a backstory, plot and earnest attempts at feels? Unlike Magical Play, Inferno Cop is whole-heartedly committed, making for a sense of consistency in the execution. It knows you’re just there to see what crazy thing it’s going to do next, so it never tries to be serious, it never tries to make you feel(it kind of makes fun of you for it, honestly), and it never loses focus of what it’s doing, tying it’s most entertaining element directly into it’s vague and highly forgiving plot threads.

And for the second thing it does right… I’ll be honest, this one feel like the more important one of the two, even though Magical Play actually did kind of nail it. There are several shows based on random lunacy that I just wasn’t able to stay interested in… I’m talking titles like Excel Saga, Hayate the Combat Butler, and Hare + Guu. Yeah, they were great at first, full of wild and exciting comedy that felt brazenly and defiantly weird, but as time went on, they just sort of lost their momentum. Once you’ve seen a little girl eating everything in sight, transporting them to an alternate Kirby-style stomach dimension, there’s really nowhere to go from there. Comedy styles can be overused, at which point they become predictable, after which they became dull. The worst part of Excel Saga was the part where you realized all it was doing was lazily parodying a bunch of genres with by-the-book observations and padding them out with weirdness. And Hayate jumped the shark so often that it just made people miss the manga.

But this leads me to the biggest thing Inferno Cop does right… It’s short. The biggest weakness of random nonsense comedy is that it has a shockingly poor shelf-life. The longer it goes on, the more exposed it gets, and the clearer people are able to see the method behind the madness. It’s not impossible to keep this kind of comedy effective for lengthy stretches, but you have to be working extra hard to keep the comedy fresh by reinventing it and taking it in new directions, like Baka and Test was so good at doing. This is why I’m not really on board with the new FLCL reboot… 6 episode FLCL was perfect FLCL. Inferno cop is only an hour long, and that’s WITH the fact files segments, which I actually feel are a necessary part of the experience. It’s because Inferno cop is so short that it never lags, and it’s able to jump from plot point to plot point like an anime speed-run without ever feeling overwhelming, and all the things it does that WOULD be ran into the ground by a longer run-time, like all the cliches, deus ex machinas and on-point Evangelion references, are able to leave a fond impression on us by only happening once or twice each. And on top of that, it actually manages to have a pretty satisfying conclusion.

Inferno Cop is available on Crunchyroll. It hasn’t been released on any form of physical media that I know of, not even a freaking Malaysian bootleg, but it damn well should. There’s also a series of in-between segments that I mentioned earlier, called Fact Files, which gives deliberately pointless information about what you just saw, and it’s totally worth your time. A second season has recently been announced, but hasn’t aired yet.

As much fun as it is to watch Inferno Cop, and as highly as I do recommend checking it out, it’s obviously going to run into a glass ceiling with me. It’s a good show that’s a blast to see, especially with other people, but there’s still so many more enriching anime titles out there, titles that a lot more time, effort and thought put into them, that I’ll always recommend first. I think the best way to describe the experience of watching this show would be that it’s like seeing two really close friends with similar tastes and interests just try to create a narrative on the fly, making constant attempts to one-up each other and make each other laugh, and even if you don’t get the story they’re coming up with, you feel like pointing out all of it’s problems would just be mean. Like, “why does a world-wide cruise have to be dirt cheap for Inferno Cop to ride it when he just won a million yen?” And the answer is “Shut up, we’re playing with giant robot dinosaurs now!” It’s no masterpiece, not even close, really, but it’s an experience I highly recommend having at least once. I give Inferno Cop a 7/10."
156040,"I usually do not write reviews so bare with me. I just thought this anime deserved at least one review, to hopefully get more people to watch it.

LasTame starts off as a typical reincarnation anime, but this time its in a visual novel that the protagonist has played before.
She finds herself as the main villain, a young princess named Pride. Because she is young she has not done most of the awful things that she is meant to do yet. 
But the staff of the castle was still afraid of her since she is just an awful person.

Because our protagonist is a kind hearted person, she is constantly worried about herself turning into the actual villain. And therefore asks the people she gets close to, to kill her if she becomes an awful queen. And of course the people close to her do not understand why she fears this or would ask them to do so.

Despite our protagonist being the most kind hearted person ever - she never brings up her previous life. This got me a bit in disbelief however maybe she didn't have anyone close to her in the previous life. Or maybe the only thing she remembers is her own death. I do not know if the actual novel provides better information on this since I haven't read it. Perhaps if it gets a sequel we will get to know more.

During her time at the castle, she helps many people and gets close to many people as well.
She actually deeply cares about her subjects and does everything she can for them.
There is also a really nice arc about a villain who turns good because of her not giving up on him. I found this arc really heart warming especially because the villain clearly never let himself feel certain feelings before, or even knew the existence of those feelings.

Because she has played the game before - she sometimes can predict what will happen and thereby prevent awful disasters, sometimes even saving lives. This is also explained as the original princess ability because prediction is a trait that runs in the family. However the reincarnated Pride does not actually have this ability. It is unclear if she will get it later when she gets older. Since if I remember correctly the original Pride did not get her prediction ability until she was older.

Pride is also super powerful because she is the final boss queen. She really knows how to swing a sword, there is some eyerolling anime moments in there but I just found them fun and went with it. :)

During her time - she will face many challenges. But the main reason I like the show is because of the warm characters of the show and the relationships they share. They all give you a feeling of home when watching it. 

Overall I loved the show, and really hope that it gets a sequel. And I definitely recommend watching it.
I hope this review helps some people to be more open to giving the show a chance."
5940,"War is Hell. These words, famously spoken by Union soldier William Tecumseh Sherman during the American Civil War, have lived on ever since, and they’ve been used on many occasions to describe the bloodshed and rampant loss of life that can happen when nations engage each other in combat. It’s probably one of the most apt metaphors ever constructed by man, but what if it were to obtain a literal definition as well? What if there was a war that actually involved the forces of hell, with actual demons fighting both against and alongside the human race? This is exactly what happened in the Vaalbinill war, a conflict where mankind used a powerful magic to turn human sacrifices into powerful demonically-possessed swords called... Well, Demon swords. To do this, a human on the verge of death must read the death song that every person has hidden inside them, which creates a contract for them to sign... One that binds their souls to a magically enhanced sword... Only a few of which can take human form afterwards.

Alas, this war ended forty-four years ago, when the warring nations realized the damage these demon swords were causing, and reached a peace treaty to prevent the collateral damage from reaching a point of no return. Now, in the present day, the stories of demons and sacrifice have faded into legend, and people are just trying to get by, with very few reminders of the conflict left to haunt them. One of these, a demented homeless veteran of the war, is creating a scene in the middle of the marketplace when Cecily Campbell, a third generation knight who has vowed to protect the city and uphold justice in her late father’s name, is almost killed by this man before a quiet boy with a strange curved sword saves her from him. Realizing his occupation as a blacksmith, Cecily becomes determined to convince him to make her a sword that’s just like his... A katana, the sort of weapon from a faraway land, which she believes will aid her in her quest of heroism. He refuses, but she’ll have to find a way to change his mind, as the past has rapidly began to catch up to their land, and Cecily’s courage will soon be needed more than ever before.

Sacred Blacksmith was produced by Media Factory, who, incidentally, are also directly related to MF Bunko J, the company who published it’s light novels. Both companies are located under the umbrella of the Kadokawa Group, and from what I could tell from Media Factory’s Wikipedia page, they mostly do small jobs for other production companies, especially to Studio Gonzo and TMS. Out of the titles I actually knew, I couldn’t find any anime credited to them that had their name listed as their primary producer, with the soul exception to this being 2009’s The Sacred Blacksmith, and if that’s indicative of the larger truth, then thank God, because this show looks a bit on the mediocre side. Maybe that’s kind of mean of me, because I’ve definitely seen a lot worse looking anime than this over the years, but it’s kind of obvious that they had a small budget to work with, and it looks like they probably didn’t know how to handle such a hindrance in such a way that it wouldn’t be too noticeable.

I don’t know what bothers me more... How cheap this show looks, or how commonly cheap it looks, as it carries a lot of the same visual problems that an anime from the late 2000’s is likely to have. It tries to juggle it’s budge responsibly, with minimal movement being featured whenever possible in order to save more money for action scenes, but those stationary scenes look lazy as hell, as characters freeze almost right into the background when they’re not talking or reacting to anything, and they often do so while just slightly off-model enough to create an uncanny valley sensation, and the action scenes aren’t great either. They’re plagued by close-ups and zoom effects to make it look like you’re not just cutting from one stationary image to the other, and while this doesn’t always look too bad, especially if the villain of said scene is represented by some pretty decent CG animation, the amount of cut corners is telling. Backgrounds can be nice and highly detailed, especially when taking place in the market, but that doesn’t save the characters inhabiting them from looking stiff and lifeless.

In terms of the visuals, the only thing about this show that really gives it any sense of identity is the design of the main character, Cecily Campbell, who almost seems like she was drawn to catch the eye, what with her striking shade of red hair and highly questionable knight’s armor that looks like it was specifically molded in such a way as to accentuate her breasts(we’ll get to that). With the exception of the Demon Sword characters, who look like support characters taken from various Final Fantasy games, everyone else looks pretty generic, from the titular blacksmith, who’s only real memorable feature is the fact that his left eye is always shaded differently from his right eye(there’s a reason for it) to the villain, who... And I realize this is a spoiler, but come on, who wouldn’t see this coming... Is of course a sinister looking guy with long white hair. This is an anime, damn it, and you should expect things like that by now. The non-human villains look pretty good, especially the CG ones, but we don’t get very many of them.

I didn’t really notice the music while watching the series, but I never had any complaints about it either, which I guess is a good thing. The opening is your standard rock anthem, with Mayumi Goto belting out lyrics about virtue, triumph over evil and the struggle to do so, and while it’s pretty generic, it sounds nice. Some of the show’s best and worst animation is showcased during the video, clumsily moving between stiff characters in the middle of breathtakingly beautiful backgrounds to characters awkwardly trying to move against said backgrounds. A lot of the same could be said for the ending song, miracle happy day, which is also nice but generic. I like how each song is meant to represent a different character, with the opening representing Cecily and the ending representing little Lisa, but the latter has the added benefit of also being the character’s actual voice actor. As for the rest of the score, it was composed by Terashima Tamaya, and it’s pretty cool overall, especially the epic Kishi no Hokori. The sound is appropriately medieval, with a lot of drums and wind instruments at play.

While the music and animation may not be quite good enough to make an impression on you, the English dub is another story entirely. Funimation did a fantastic job on this one, to the point that even at some of it’s worst moments, the quality of the acting can still get you through. While these titles are by no means her first starring roles, it wasn’t until Strike Witches that she started to become a big name in the industry, and her role in The Sacred Blacksmith came right on the heels of that, and if anything, it proved that she could carry a series while moving away from more diminutive characters. It combines her likeability, strength and sincerity in such a way that it feels almost like a precursor to some of her future roles, like Lucy in Fairy Tail, Asuna in Sword Art Online and Ilia in RWBY. From what I’ve read, the character of Cecily was a really unpopular one in the original sub, with fans reacting negatively to her due to her big, grandiose talk and seeming inability to back it up, but Cherami’s performance does a lot to alleviate that issue and saves the character, even at her worst in the early episodes.

I’m normally not a huge fan of Blake Shephard, but he does a pretty damn good job as the titular Blacksmith, Luke Ainsworth. The character is supposed to be really cynical and blase, which Blake captures really well with his lack of intonation and devil-may-care attitude, adding in just enough hopeful or long-suffering vibes whenever necessary. Monica Rial plays his assistant, a cheerful little girl character who’s generally happy-go-lucky and annoyingly obsessed with his love life, and while this may sound like the kind of role Monica normally gets typecast into... And it is... Her casting was NOT a frivolous decision, nor was it just-another-paycheck for her. She does a lot with this character, and deserves praise for it. Anastacia Munoz plays the demon sword Ilia, and she does a great job, but oh what the hell, I’m just glad to see her. I’m a huge fan, and she doesn’t get enough work. The rest of Funimation’s usual squad of regulars show up at some point or another, with some highlights including Alexis Tipton as a spurned princess, Brina Palencia as a tragic victim of fate, and Colleen Clinkenbeard and J Michael Tatum as probably the only choices that could have made the boring villains more interesting.

And speaking of making things more interesting, that’s exactly the kind of task that Funimation had in front of them when they acquired this anime, which is probably why, when they announced the upcoming release, they were not the slightest bit coy about the fact that there’d be nudity in the release that wasn’t there in the original TV run. I don’t know if that nudity was censored on TV or if Funi just edited it in, but whatever the case, it’s really telling that they went to such great lengths to advertise the presence of some unobscured boobs, although as many forum-dwellers noted back then, it was probably due to the lack of interest that people had for the title. It’s true that nudity can be used well, and be an essential or at least acceptable part of a story, but in this case, it was very obviously being used as a crutch in order to help sales of the title, much like they wound up doing years later when they accidentally released the censored version of Sankarea; Undying love a few years later.

Now, at first glance, if you’re coming in blind and just looking up the plot synopsis and descriptions of the series, it looks like you’d be in for something awesome. It’s a show about knights and demons in a feudal setting, starring a cute and well-endowed female protagonist, and it deals with the introduction of katanas into a western society. There’s a lot of potential there, and you could be excused for going in with some pretty high expectations, even to the point that you’d probably be willing to look past the sub-par animation quality. The katana worship kind of suggests that there’d be some element of eastern influence creeping into the show’s western setting, or that Luke would have some kind of foreign background that could be explored, or hell, even the plot about the war that took place decades prior to the events of the series could have amounted to some kind of interesting intrigue. What I’m saying here is that there was a lot of room for cool ideas, and while they may have possibly been exploited to some extent in the source material, they weren’t here.

Right off the bat, this series shows signs of disappointment from pretty much all corners, from the bullshit about swords cutting through other swords to the fact that anything cool about the art of blacksmithing would be largely glossed over in favor of magical weapon creation. The plot and setting are extremely derivative and offer nothing new or unique to stand out against the thousands of feudal-type anime out there, and the villain is about as boring as you can get. I don’t even remember what his plan was, and I seriously didn’t care about any scenes dealing with the effects of said plan. It takes a special kind of failure to make small demons popping out of peoples’ mouths boring, but that’s where we are here, and the main characters aren’t much better. Cecily and Luke are trapped in a will-they-won’t-they dynamic that never goes anywhere, not that you’d WANT it to, you just want it to go literally anywhere else so you don’t have to listen to their inane bickering and cliched nonsense.

Part of this is of course Cecily herself, who appears to be some kind of joke character, preaching idealistic virtues like justice and compassion, self-sacrifice and heroism, all while proving herself to be ridiculously incompetent, having to be saved at every turn and not being taken seriously by just about anyone. She kind of reminds me of the protagonist of Now and Then, Here and There, but taken completely out of context to her own detriment. Her relationship with Luke is full of pure cringe, as she plays the rough, brutish tsundere to his asexual jerk, flashing boob and berating him for accidentally seeing it, blushing and fervently denying any feelings for him when called out, and most insulting of all, trying to weasel out of paying for the katana she wants him to make. Cap all of this off with a little girl obsessed with playing matchmaker and pointing out how generously well-endowed Cecily is, you’ve got what looks on the surface to be a jumbled mess of bland, cliched elements that nobody was asking for all merged into one show.

So, is there anything in this show that makes it worth watching? I think so, but this is the part where things are going to get a bit uncertain. If there’s anything interesting about this series, then it’s not in the text, but in the subtext, or at least out of what I could read into it. Now keep in mind that this is an entirely speculative interpretation of the material, so take it with a grain of salt, because there’s quite a bit to unload here. I didn’t start to pick apart any kind of deeper meaning to this series until the character ilia was introduced(at which point the series does manage to get quite a bit better, assuming you were able to make it that far in the first place) but when I did, I started noticing some very specific subtext, from which I managed to work backwards and figure out the over-all theme of the story, and I’m actually quite confidant about this part of it(my interpretation gets a little shakier later on), where the main unifying idea of the Sacred blacksmith seems to be the importance of self-identity, especially when compared to the indentities placed upon you by others.

This idea is explored in some surprisingly diverse ways, with the most obvious being the storyline between Luke and Lisa, but that’s kinda of heavy with the spoilers, so I’d instead like to start off with Charlotte, a young girl who begins to make trouble for our heroes halfway through the series. She declares that she’s a princess, the bastard daughter of the king, and demands her rightful place for the sake of her late mother. She instead gets refused by her father, and at the end of her arc(mild spoiler alert) she instead abandons her royal lineage and defects to another nation. This may sound like defeat, but think about what she was trying to do... She was trying to fulfill the dreams of her mother and gain the approval of her father, but was either of those goals what she wanted? What would avenging her deceased mother or proving herself to her father have done for her? I mean, there’s obviously the idea of attaining wealth and status as royalty, but she doesn’t show any interest in that. Instead, she dropped the Royal title from her name and started over on her own terms, choosing to define herself as an individual.

There’s also the demon swords, three of which can turn into humans... Well, four, but we only spend any time with three of them... And they all seem to fall into the same category, as characters who are burdened with the identities thrust upon them by their creators. Even the chant that they use to change form explicitly states that their purpose is to slay God, which could be read in exactly that way. While two of them are also heavily rooted in spoilers, I think we can talk about the first one, ilia, the demon sword who possesses the power of wind. Ilia has been around since the great war, where she was born on the battlefield, and she’s been responsible for countless deaths, the lives of which were taken by her wielders as well as by people wanting to become her wielder, killing said wielder and taking their place. She’s sick of being used as a tool of murder, which is why her life changes so drastically when she forges a partnership with the idealistic Cecily, who... Oh dear, it’s time to start talking about her now.

Okay, so, this is the part where it really becomes a stretch, so bear with me. The idea of self-identity gets a lot more complicated with Cecily, as it also starts to creep into the territory of sexual identity and gender identity, yeah, it’s that kind of show. Cecily is a character who’s trying really hard to find out where she belongs inbetween the masculine and feminine aspects of her personality. Unlike Charlotte, who wants to become a princess for the sake of her mother, Cecily becomes a knight for the sake of her father, even though such an occupation is explicitly shown to be male-dominated, and she’s never taken seriously as a member of their ranks, facing both condescension and open resentment for trying to do what’s considered a man’s job. I’d even go as far as to assume that her breast plate was molded specifically for the purpose of accentuating the shape of her bosom, as the military considers her more of a mascot or a PR stunt than an actual knight, and in all fairness, she doesn’t do much to prove them wrong.

Now, I’m not the kind of person who sees a sword in a story and says “That’s a dick,” unless I’m making a joke about Bleach or something, but that old symbolism cliche does kind of fit in this case, when you consider just how unsuccessful Cecily is while trying to wield them in her attempts at doing what’s considered men’s work. Either they break in her hands, or she flat-out refuses to kill, which is both suggestive of compassion which is a traditionally feminine trait, and on a more low-brow note, a sign of impotence. Yes, I am also including the fact that she’s unable to get the main male character to ‘erect’ a sword for her in my analysis, and you’re welcome for that. Keep in mind, though, she’s just as bad with feminine pursuits, as she’s uncomfortable with the idea of drawing attention to her looks, and she fails hard at performing house work, and she’s really awkward in any sort of feminine clothes, so it could be said that both masculine and feminine ideals are waiting just out of her grasp.

Having said all of that, she doesn’t start to grow as a character, to gain more confidence both socially and in battle, until she acquires a female partner who acts as a sword for her, and she’s finally able to perform successfully. Granted, there’s no actual confession of love or confirmed affection between her and Ilia, but it’s still really easy to read their relationship as a romantic one, with some seriously Utena-esque subtext to back it up. There are several lines of dialogue that seem to almost deliberately imply something deeper than friendship, although that could have just been Funimation rewriting things. I don’t know how things between Luke and Cecily went in the source material, but it’s typically not my style to look into things like that, and Cecily really does seem to grow and develop as a person after her and Ilia form their partnership. Granted, this doesn’t really go anywhere special, as Ilia’s insistence on Cecily continuing to pursue Luke does kind of echo the very Japanese idea of lesbianism being a teenage phase, but I’m just the interpreter, I didn’t write the damn show.

So, to summarize, The Sacred Blacksmith seems to insist that you can’t become a complete person until you come to terms with your own identity, and in order to do that, you shouldn’t live by other peoples’ standards, you shouldn’t live for the approval or fulfillment of your parents, you shouldn’t try to be more of a man, you shouldn’t try to be more of a woman, you shouldn’t try to live up to the role society has placed on you, and you shouldn’t live according to the rules of your creator... You are you, and you shouldn’t lose sight of who you are and what you want. And what if I’m just pulling all of this out of my ass? What if I’m just reading too far into the material and seeing what I want to see? Well, that’s incredibly likely, but it would be a damn shame, because that added depth is really the only thing this show has going for it. On it’s own merits, The Sacred Blacksmith is just about the blandest thing you’ll ever see, with it’s only real saving grace being that it gets less boring about a third of the way through, so I’ll stick to my interpretation, thank you very much.

Sacred Blacksmith is available from Funimation, now as a part of the SAVE collection. The original light novels are not available stateside, but the manga adaptation by Isao Miura are available from Seven Seas entertainment. It also makes a very brief cameo in the anime Haganai.

In a general sense, I want to like everything I watch, or at the very least, I want it to be worth liking, and since there really isn’t anything outright awful about this particular title, the fact that I’m able to read something deeper into it helps me to appreciate it perhaps a bit more than it actually deserves. It’s not one of the worst anime I’ve ever seen, not by far, but the fact that it’s not interestingly bad just adds to it’s lack of noteworthy qualities as part of the reason why I don’t think I’d ever recommend it to very many people. I guess you might like it if you’re a hardcore fan of either the feudal setting or of Cherami Leigh as an actor, or hell, maybe if you’re going through some crisis of identity and need to watch something that might help you affirm your own self-image, and maybe you’ll see the same subtext and symbolism that I did. Other than that, it’s not an outright bad anime, but it really doesn’t offer anything that you couldn’t find elsewhere in both bigger and better portions. I give The Sacred Blacksmith a 5/10."
