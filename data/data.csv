16498,"At first I did not understand the hype surrounding this series. Yeah the plot and everything sounded nice but why did it get so popular?
Well I learned that when I finally decided to watch this series and fall in love with it.


[(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) STORY:]()
Season 1 of Attack on Titan is a nice introduction to the universe of the show. It tells us everything we need to know and it lays it out in such a way that is nice and comfortable to watch.

Summary of the story for anyone that has forgotten:
To start us off. Humanity has enclosed its self within walls to keep out the ""Titans"", creatures which (as the name suggests) are much larger and stronger than Humans. They possess a great threat to the survival of humanity.
 
The show focuses on a group of friends: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Although the show does focus more heavily on Eren all of the characters present have a huge role in the plot. They're living their lives quite calmly... until one day, two Titans manage to break the gates to the outer wall in which our heroes live. With no way of beating the numerous titans pouring in the City the retreat. Eren in the process loses his mother due to a Titan, this is a vital part of the story as it build Eren with unspeakable hatred towards these creatures.

Ever since that moment Eren and the rest have been training to join the ""Scout Regiment"" and defeat the Titans.
After intensive training they manage to get to the top leads in the training group and join the Regiment. Filled with passion Eren tries his best to kill as many Titans during the  new found invasion...he dies...but not really.

It is later revelead that our boy Eren Yeager has the ability to turn into a Titan. Now he can trully be useful, he can plug the Walls and even venture to his old house to find out the secret his father left him...

All in all the way the story builds up along with the character, and even how the atmosphere changes is trully magnificent.
From the get-go this has managed to capture my interest and made me fall in love with the series. I cannot express enough just how much I love this show.




[CHARACTERS:]()
The character we get to see in Attack on Titan are very interesting and work really well in the atmosphere of the show. We have:
Eren, a young lad, he is basically the focus of the show due to his powers. Though he mostly cries and gets kidnapped.
His character is great, he is very determined and tries his best which is something that I admire. The sheer will power he has is incredible.
Mikasa, a young gal, she doesn't speak much apart from screaing ""EREN"" every now and then to check up on him.
She is one of my favourite characters in the show, she is the pure defenition of badass. The way she sets her eyes on a target and smoothly completes her task is to be awed.
Lastly I'll be talking about Armin, the character which does not really build much hype within me but still is an important part of the series as a whole. He is the brains of the whole show. Without him we wouldn't get as much plans. Despite his lack of strength I still do like him, he is very determined on helping people as much as he can which always is a plus in my book!

AoT has many more characters, all of which have important parts in the development of the story. Some have much bigger impact and some are just one off characters. Each and every one of them have their own personalities and back stories. With most of the characters we get to know their backstory which further cements their part in the show and in our hearts and thus makes the whole experience of watching much more enjoyable.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
This show has great art and animation. It does improve throughout the various seasons but the one we see in Season 1 is also quite a sight to behold.
In my opinion I'd have to rate it above the average. The animations too, they are very smooth and fluid. Well that is expected since a lot of the combat scenes have the character move in very agile and fickle ways which require such smooth animations.




[MUSIC:]()
Attack on Titan, man it has a banger of an OST. Each and every song that plays throughout the show is so fitting for the scene which it resides in. They fill the viewer with the right kind of emotion for the scene that is about to unveil, may it be sadness, anticipation, or even sheer HYPE
The OPs, too, are bangers. They are up there with the Steins;Gate OP, which always manages to build up hype and nostalgia within me.
The EDs, too, had (and still do) a huge impact on me when re-listening to them. Much hype to be had.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
All in all Attack on Titan is a series with amazing combat and story.
Like with Steins;Gate (going back to comparing this to Steins;Gate xd) I do try to get people to watch this since it is such a great show.

As I said in the very first sentence:
>I did not understand the hype surrounding this series.

But after watching it I understood why, the story and characters, just the whole show in general fit together so well.
Though I did give it 92/100, reason for that is...Season 3 is soooo good compared to this season."
101922,"I am gonna be totally honest here. I never thought I would be writing a review for Demon Slayer. You can imagine why I say that. It's an obvious answer. It's undeniable the truth I turned a blind eye to most of the issues the first time I watched Demon Slayer. Still, this anime strongest point is the animation, fights. How it executes and explore the simple power-system. Let's not forget about the backstory on the different demon we'll be facing through the journey. Ufotable took the ok manga and made it ten times better. Added some more flavor to the story through extending scenes, like demon backstory or flexing madly on us with that top-notch sakuga and sound effects and what more. But If you look at it with open eyes, it's the usual shounen we either love or hate with a simple premise and story. That said, it's more to a good show, then some flashy actions and tons of money thrown at it. This is no doubt different from people to people, but I have the biggest weight put onto the cast themself. I would never watch any form of media unless the characters first and foremost resonate with me in any way. Now don't get me wrong. Demon Slayer is a decent shounen, but it's far from the best thing out there. 

In the first few episodes, I can already tell this would never have the potential to become a masterpiece at all. It's so simple in anything it does, and it shows Koyoharu has no intention to get out of his comfort zone to explore the dangerous territory. Bless Ufotable for adapting, or it might not be this popular. Think about it, would Black Clover or Fairy Tail not get this amount of fame if Ufotable adapted it? That's nothing but fact since when I first began my anime journey, I too was baited by the art and animation. It's not that it's a bad thing since you can have a good story and fantastic production or even the opposite of the spectrum. Tho, it amounts to nothing if the rest of the content is not all there. I will most likely compare Demon Slayer to many stories to hopefully get my point across with much credibility as possible. If you don't wanna read-on, then let me just tell you that Demon Slayer is the equivalent to Fairy Tail but far worse. Fairy Tail at least had heart. Take it as however you want, but it should be clear what I am implying here. I guess I should start with the characters. 

Tanjiro seems to be many fan favorite since he is so easy to like, but gosh is he one of the most boring protagonists I had the pleasure of following. He is viewed as this picture-perfect person everyone would wanna be, the guy got no flaws from a normal person standpoint. Or the author does not do a good job of conveying them if they exist. Tho, no lie how he is so kind, and it pisses off Inousuke to no end is a good comedy to me. I will give the author that, Koyoharu Gotouge knows how to make simple but effective comedic relief moments. That's not true all the time tho. Also, sadly, I can't say the same about the protagonist lacking proper substance and depth. Tanjiro has no real glaring flaws, and that makes him dull and tiresome in the long run. Additionally, there is little no growth to him as a character and the biggest change is how stronger he becomes. I mean, Asta in Black Clover comes off as loud, curious, reckless, and even stubborn. I could still keep on going. Let's throw my favorite male mad lad of all time here too. Luffy, who is overflowing ball of curiosity, charisma, romance for adventure, an unpredictable fellow, and reckless goofball of a lovable dork. I guess I can throw my scientific lovable nerd Senku in here too, who has many of the traits of those mentioned above. 

Then you have Tanjiro, who is simply kind, had one or two burst out to make him seem more. Still, it feels out of character since he is already established as a gentle, kind-hearted soul. Not that's it wrong either since all those mentioned have that as part of their traits but so much more too. Even the side characters in Demon Slayer are not all that great. Zenitsu is loud and annoying without a balance, and the comedic relief is so absurd it's cringe-inducing. Please tell me I am not the only one who wanted to shoot myself every time this Mineta wannabe opened his mouth? Zenitsu does, in fact, get growth in the manga, but to be frank, it just happened. There was no underlying context to show you the process in a way you could comprehend the character properly. Among the trio, Inousuke is simply the best. He seems to have some layer to him, outside of being a funny, quirky, and a battle-hungry maniac. He is one of the few ones, I would say Koyoharu does a good job with. Every time Inousuke comes by an unprecedented situation, he feels fear, anger, depression, and so forth. We see it clearly in detail and how it affects him. A lot of work could be used, but he is a better example of a properly written character if you ask me.

The Hashiras, who are a significant part of the story, is also not poorly written but far from the best. They all have their own set of unique selves and are not cut out from the same cloth. Shinobu is the most complex I have seen. She has that arara onee-san vibe and one heck of an enticing smile that draws you in with an energetic persona. Did I forget to mention, all of that is merely a facade, and there is more to her than meets the eye? Not gonna sugarcoat it, but since she is a waifu material, I do have a level of bias with my opinion of her. Anyway, Koyoharu clearly has some nicely written characters. Still, since the main trio, or should I say the quartet is the focus, their potential is not fully tapped into. I wanna lightly touch on Nezuko, tell me what is her purpose, besides being an adorable and pleasing sight for your aching eyes who can throw around some punches? She adds nothing to the story before way in and is only a way to lure watchers and readers into this terribly mediocre shounen. And the title of best girl goes to either Shinobu or Kanao, who has more to tell than a cute ""hmmph"" all the damn time. Hey, I am not complaining, just trying to prove a point. Nezuko's purpose also comes out from the left field, even if it was an apparent outcome anyone could see coming.

As if that not enough, the big bad villain, Muzan, who started out with a strong introduction. It is just a scary Micheal Jackson with anger issues, and thirst for blood and is simply a manipulative douchebag. Koyoharu do use shock factor to make him seem intimidating and while some moments do give you an impact of emotions. It's not that he is a well-written villain. In a way, he is also a waste of potential since he could be so much more than this sad excuse of a way to give something at least resembling a closure. You know, going out with a bang so that all you went through was well worth it. But it's not. Why do I say that? I am not a manga reader anymore, I'll wait out untill the story concludes and then we'll see what happens. So take my coming opinion with a grain of salt. Ignorance can be such a bliss when you don't realize the bigger picture, it's factual that the pacing in the manga is terrible. No room to breathe to see character interactions and let you bond with them before we are yet again thrown into more actions. We barely know a thing about the world of Demon Slayer, and there is no realism to give it that authentic feel. So you can feel more significant emotions, which actually amounts to something. The world is flimsily established and is merely just a means to an end.

Now, look at some other work that is simple in the core but has more to offer and has better established it's setting, world, and characters. Before that, I wanna say I am looking at the source material and not just the anime. Black Clover is one such which stars Asta and Noelle. Let's focus on those two for this example. Asta comes off as simple and is generic, just like any shounen protagonist. Still, he is humane and not as easy to describe. At one point, he gains appetizing growth, which makes you appreciate his character all the more. Let's not forget about best girl Noelle, who starts out as a typical tsundere and thinks everything is above here. But slowly mellows out and becomes a truly complex, deep, and very charming of a character you grow to love so immensely. In fact, the whole cast of Black Clover feels more than merely simple. Another shounen worthy of praise is Dr. Stone. Great cast of characters you can easily differentiate. Not to mention, both execute their story efficiently with a level of balance when it comes to pacing to establish the world, setting, and the cast themself. There is a reasonable level of growth, and someone you hated at first might become your fav the next moment and so forth.

Tell me, what does Demon Slayer do differently besides being backed up by the monster of a studio with an unlimited budget to work with? I can tho give some sincere praise to the backstory of each respective demon who feels like such a more interesting character. I mean, in my eyes, both Kyogai, the spider lady, Rui even is more fascinating than the quartet of Demon Slayer. And that's only an example since many demons feel like someone you want to learn about than the actual main cast. It's evidently clear Demon Slayer is only popular since it's animated by Ufotable. Easily accessible to newcomers to anime and get into in terms of manga since it has less than 200 chapters available. There is not much dialogue, so you can burn through the content pretty damn fast actually, and it's easy to digest to boot. However, not everything is average about Demon Slayer. I want to give some praise to one of the greatest episode animated which ironically come out from Demon Slayer. It's not my favorite moment, but it's no doubt worthy of attention and recognition. Episode 19 is Ufotable at best, sure it has some ass-pulls here and there, but the execution and direction are stunning and do the trick. 

The build-up is gradual, as one beautiful soundtrack ramps up in the background before the climax hits and delivers a fantastic finish. This episode displays the bond of brother and sister with the utmost respect, touching on the connection, and subtlety exploring it in-depth. It's generic in its core, but it would be stupid to not appreciate the work that put into it and the meaning behind it Ufotable is trying to get across. Outside of that, Demon Slayer is top-notch when it comes to visual and artwork. There is not a second. It looks terrible or just low quality in any way. Of course, nothing beats the highly engrossing and famous Fate franchise. Especially Heavens Feel, which is in another league when it comes to production value or likewise the Kara no Kyoukai movie franchise. It's not fair to compare TV shows to movies, but I am just trying to give a different point of view many seem to miss now that they are highly influenced by Demon Slayer. On that note, the OP and ED for Demon Slayer are great. I mean with Lisa on both, did you expect anything else but quality, beautiful and catchy tune? Same, me neither. That goes for the soundtrack too which has one of the legends Yuki Kaujira and the equally amazing Go Shiina composition so you better bet your ears will thank you for experiencing bliss.

One more thing the anime provides tremendous justice for is the fighting scenes. And elevate the power-system of Demon Slayer, which otherwise feels simple and is not appropriately shown in the manga. It's not easy to tell what happens every time someone uses one of the many breath styles, not for sure anyway. This has more to do with colors and accurate display of what the author is trying to show, which is not easy to draw in the manga. Often when you don't have colors or can visually show the process of an attack. Ufotable, however, gives justice to this display and shows the attack clearly. They all are flashy, colorful, and packed with sound effects and beautiful spectacle to behold and be astounded by. In which case, I can safely say. At the same time, the power system of the Demon Slayer is good enough. Even while many things feel not as solidly built. I guess it does the trick. And Ufotable does a great job of showing the illustrations of water, fire, wind, and any other Breath Style. 

It also shows the user's traits. For instance, Tanjiro style is water since he is gentle, has self-discipline, among others. While Inousuke, who wears a boar mask and was raised in the wilderness, puts emphasis on that in his Breath Style. Zenitsu is slightly tricky since no bit of his character tells you he hits strong and fast like lightning. Wait for a second, I could put in the fact his growth just happened since it was fast and hit you out from nowhere. One more example is Kanao, who is the Breath of the flower since she is beautiful, peaceful, quiet, and blooms slowly, just like a flower would. So while I am harsh with my opinion of Demon Slayer, I am trying my best to not gloss over the things Koyoharu was able to do well and Ufotable who rose it into much greater heights. As you continue the journey of Demon Slayer, you see more power-system developments, and many of the things are, in fact, foreshadowed every so subtlety by Koyoharu. Without giving way heavily spoilers to anime only, I am referring to the crimson red Nichirin Blade and the mark on Tanjiro's forehead, which was foreshadowed before the battle at Natagumo Mountain arc. Honestly, speaking as I wrote this review. My opinion on Demon Slayer changed ever so slightly again since I looked at both sides and not just controlled by the negative emotions. It's not at all a bad shounen, and I really hope I didn't give that impression. That's not my intention.

There's it's no question about it; it's highly overrated. Demon Slayer has only Ufotable to thank for to gain a massive boost in sales for the otherwise a-okay manga. Besides, any other shounen with a simple basis would've blown out of proportion if a studio with an enormous amount of budget worked on it. At the time of writing this article, Demon Slayer is in its last stage of the story and seems to be suffering a lot. That's the result of glossing over many things that would otherwise result in a much bigger pay-off in the long run. It's the reason One Piece's popularity is more or less consistent and can easily explode if Oda-sensei ever wishes. It's the reason Black Clover gets way-way better later on when introduction and all the things are properly established. It's the reason, Dr. Stone is also just that good after the slow beginning. If you don't want to listen to my side, then take at least one thing out from this review. At the very least, animation and art-style. Will only truly shine if the author's work already has some well-developed parts as we have looked from Demon Slayer, which has some. But it's not a great shounen, groundbreaking or any of that. It's simple and has a huge studio backing them up with unlimited budget works."
1535,"Death Note, Death Note, Death Note. There was so much potential to be an absolute masterpiece. I legitimately thought that it was a solid 9/10 after 13 episodes or so. Then it kept going....And going....And going...And going long after reaching a satisfying conclusion, after two characters that could go down in history as the greatest rivalry of all time concluded their epic intellectual battle. But much more on that later. I'll get to the technical side of the show briefly, then talk about my feelings regarding the show, its characters, and my verdict. Needless to say, I will be going into spoiler territory in the favorite character section and beyond. I feel like I kinda have to do this to effectively talk about the show's postive and negative qualities. Anyway on to it.

I'll keep my discussion of Death Note's technical aspects brief. Audially, I thought it wasn't anything special. There were certain OST songs that really hit hard, such as L's Theme and Misa's Song, but as far as openings and endings went, I really couldn't tell you. I listened to them once I think, then skipped them every time after that. Take that as you will.
As far as the show's visuals, again, it's nothing special. For a show made in 2006, it certainly is very good and has aged fairly well, although it certainly won't be winning any awards for stylistic reasons since it's fairly standard. I liked most of the character designs, although most of them were pretty bland, which was fine. It didn't detract or add anything to the show that way, which is probably for the best. I do have to say though, I really loved the way that they framed some shots, mostly near the end and in episode 25, where I noticed them the most. Very symbolic.

Favorite Character:  L Lawliet
img()
I really don't think there is another answer that's possible here, honestly. For anyone who watches this show. And this is coming from me, who didn't really care for L initially. However, seeing him bond with Light and bitterly come to terms with the fact that his first and only friend was also the person that he was hunting down was both exciting and extremely saddening. Episode 25 really turned me into an L fan, where he comes to terms with his death and accepts that Light has won. It's then that we finally see the cracks in L's wacky persona- a lonely boy who could not be understood by the world and those in it. Something that he grew accustomed to, with only his caretaker and assistant Watari as his companion. It was an absolute punch to the gut watching L deflate in his final episode, finally shedding the detective shell he wore like a skin and revealing the boy underneath. The one who just wanted a friend.

This is probably where I should say that I think these two, Light and L, are up there for greatest rivalry of all time in my mind. Greatest rivalry....And greatest friendship in an alternate world. I think that's what made me so sad about that entire episode and why L's death hit me so hard. Because, in another universe, Light and L are the best of friends and each other's only intellectual equal. It actually made me emotional to think about and still does, if I'm being honest. However, to talk about the actual show a bit more, I thought this stretch where they're playing cat and mouse with each other is the peak of the series. The show is at its best when its focus is on these two and their back and forth, and it reached an intense and perfect climax in the 25th episode. Death Note should have simply ended there, because the snooze-fest that proceeded was absolutely killer to the show in my mind.

Now, before I rant about the ending and the last few episodes, I'd like to say that I also didn't like a single character outside of Matsuda by the end. Misa was an idiot and useless after L, instead of being quirky but useful because of her eyes. The replacement L's were insufferable, Near being the worst offender. And the entire Japanese Police Task Force was way too quick to go back to suspecting Light. Not to mention that Light himself was just constantly doing absolutely nothing the whole time, while Near just picks him apart.

Anyway, the ending. My god the ending. First, I'd like to state that I wish Light had died with L. That they sort of defeat each other, in a sense. Secondly, I would have also happily taken a Kira victory. However, we got neither of those and instead got the worst option: Light just losing. Just because. Don't get me wrong, it was cool to see him torn down like that, but Light just kinda lets it all happen as the episodes are winding down. He has no contingency for if his plan goes haywire, he puts all his trust into his sidekick, who messes everything up and Near just kinda....wins. It just felt lazy, like the author had used up all his ideas with Light and L's arc and had nothing left in the tank for the actual ending, which would make complete sense from how lazy it was and how little Light did to stop Near or Mello at the end. Also, The Japanese Task Force are morons, who, at the slightest mention of Light being Kira immediately jump back into suspicion based on one flimsy piece of evidence offered by this random dude calling in. Not to mention the plot hole that is Light's father literally saying in front of all of them on his deathbed that Light isn't Kira because he has the Shinigami Eyes and can see Light's lifespan. But that's conveniently forgotten about.

Overall, I'm not really sure how to rate Death Note. It was so solid for over 2/3 of the run-time, so it's certainly worth watching, but its just such a disappointing ending to such a promising series. I would say watch it, but just keep in mind that the last 12 episodes are hella boring and, at least in my opinion, ruin the show. Yet even with all of that said, I still greatly enjoyed Death Note for the most part and I hope you do too if you decide to give it a watch!"
113415,"If you read my Demon Slayer review for both anime and manga, you should be familiar with my hate for those two. Well, here is the thing. Jujutsu Kaisen what I am currently going to write about is far worse. I bet you didn't see that one coming huh? To explain my reasoning, I am going to compare the two in some way. If you are easy to trigger, don't care about a different perspective with proper reasoning, then be my guest. Scroll down to the bottom while you are on crack like an angry kid and smack that dislike button with all your might. But in the process, giving me further solid reasons to justify my points. I will tell you this now, that I am not a manga reader as I dropped it 20 chapters in because of the tediousness of the story, inconsistent direction, stagnant and horrible paneling, and the shoddy art style making it hard to make out what's happening. My belief is revolved around anime. Well, let's get going.

There is a misconception going around the community of top-notch visuals and art is equal to good when it's not even close to the truth. I feel most don't realize it themselves unless someone points it out for you. I don't blame them either. I was riding the Demon Slayer hype-train for a while before taking a step back and looking it from my own heart. Rather than being influenced by other words, thus being a slave to their bloated opinions. Yes, I am saying that Jujutsu Kaisen's overwhelming popularity stems from its lush and stunning production value, nothing else. Do you want proof? Where was Jujutsu Kaisen before the anime happened? Just like Ufotable for Demon Slayer, Jujutu being touched by the hands of the passionate and hardworking staff at Mappa got the same prescription due to its insane production value, despite mediocre to dreadful writing.

Well, that's kind of wrong. I won't deny the fujoshi details of glossy lips of the male characters and creating them to be so handsome is another core reason people cannot stop the shill. Seesh, I lost count of the number of times I saw someone simp for a character through a global post, activity, and other means. I don't think I have ever seen someone make a valuable point about the story, crack out some theories/predictions, only a ton of simping. Say, Gojo alone got far more favorites than his worth if you exclude his appearances and look at him from a personality standpoint. The guy is literally a man-child that doesn't even know how to crack out jokes. Remember that awful scene when he wore Nobara's skirt and tried to make a joke out of it? I felt my life slipping from the amount of cringe the scene exuded. There was also that segment with those curses doing a one-note shoujo play. That was so unnecessary and awful. In any case, I liked Gojo at first but the community made me not care about him anymore. Now I only see cringe which was always there. Thank you me for waking up. Well, he's at least not the worst character in JJK even if he is high up there. That title goes for Yuuji the stoic immovable cringe-ass dried face wall.

Yuuji was introduced as this guy who was already incredibly powerful from the getgo. Guy could literally run marathons in a matter of seconds, dent football goals with his abnormal wrist powers batting a baseball, plus he was plenty agile, acrobatic, and got immense jumping power. This was all there before he got a hell of an insane powerup by eating a cursed finger belonging to the king of curses Sukuna. Which led Yuuji to have Sukuna as another lifeform inside of him and not just anyone. A powerful ancient demon essentially boosted his already haxed stats. I don't mind any of this personally. This is a shounen so expect illogical writing and lots of things served on a silver platter for the MC. I enjoy my fair shares of OP characters if they are executed rightly but most Shounen tends to something more than letting them feel like a concept, that's what Yuuji genuinely is. He is not even fit to be called a character. His motivation is as flimsy as himself, he wants to save people and that's where it ends. There is no why or other clarification. You could assume it's due to his grandpa's last words, but a guy we barely knew for a second death does not accomplish anything other than being wasteful baggage. I am sorry to put it like that but it's the cold hard truth. Yuuji is very much the same guy we know and in my case hate as he was introduced in the beginning. A wall with little to no substance outside of being crazy powerful and wanting to save people for whatever reason.

Did you know Yuuji at the beginning of the story was even able to throw cars around casually when that should not even be possible? Do you know how many tons a vehicle even weighs?. If you like Yuuji, be my guest but please don't tell me he is a good main character or any of that nor is Tanjiro that. Both are flimsy and boring. Tanjiro is consistent at least but nothing special in the grand scheme of things and Yuuji is just a ball of mess. The only thing Mappa accomplished by animating this wall was giving it some colors, but at the end of the day, a wall is a wall no matter how many colors you use. Yuuji is no doubt the worst shounen, no protagonist, in general, I had the absolute worst displeasure of seeing. Why do I think JJK is worse than Demon Slayer? Here's the thing. Tanjiro who was portrayed as this fantastic human being and was boring outside of being consistent and having the clear motivation to do things is far better than someone who's there just to be there. 

Sure, it's simple but there is a clear why Tanjiro became a demon slayer. It's to save his sister and return her to human again. And unlike him being totally overpowered from the getgo, there are things about Tanjiro that make no sense but do not become clearer before long. These details about him become clear as foreshadowing as we learn things about him. Well, doesn't change the fact the ending is a disaster, but hopefully, my points got across well. Now JJK is not entirely hopeless as it did try to explore and show us Yuuji's character as more than this overpowered boring beast. When he got acquainted with a guy, became friends shortly after only to die it definitely hurt Yuuji. He got swallowed by rage, it was conveyed on the dot through the visuals. It was the only point I remember Yuuji showing some level of personality besides spamming that stoic face all the time. Not that it matters in the grand scheme, nothing that transpired there was ever put to use again, nor did Yuuji feel any less than a wall from that point on.

Besides, the glaring flaw of Yuuji, there is no flow in the writing or the direction of JJK for the most part. We've been jumping places one after another and quite abruptly. Our main idiot trio got introduced in a rush and was barely fleshed out during their first exorcism job together. It was also against a special grade and here they tried to explore Yuuji again and show him he can be afraid when faced with a monstrous beast beyond anything he imagined. I enjoyed the moment of seeing Yuuji terrified for his life, but it quickly got shafted to the side as Yuuji used Sukuna to get out of the hell hole after making a contract with him. After that, it was never touched upon again. Yuuji had supposedly deceased but was gaining training under a poor man's Kakashi. Nothing like the aloof, hilarious, charming fella we know and love from Naruto.

Entering Kyoto arc where a bunch of characters was introduced and was given the same formulaic backstory as we saw them fighting against special grade curses. Here the author clearly tried to flesh out our cast through a segment of backstory, playing out their sad moments to make us feel sympathetic for them and give us wishy-washy reason to care about them. I never did. But I did think the stark contrast that was shown between Maki and Mai and how they were the complete opposite of each other, basically portrayed as yin and yang respectively was interesting. Plus, the matter surrounding how one cannot use curse power, but is plenty strong and crafty in hand-to-hand combats and with weapons. While the other is not quick on her feet nor good any sort of combat but can use curse power was a good idea by the author. I also adored Miwa, she might've been my favorite character. The fact Gege played her out like she was useless and her being self-aware about it was charming. Dare I say unique? I have not seen many characters like her, plus this thing about her being afraid of not being useful gives room for strong character direction for adorable and air-headed Miwa. There is one more character I liked in Jujutsu Kaisen and thought should've been the main character personally. It's Megumi. Just his name alone got lots of story intrigues plastered over it. He was far more interesting than Yuuji and had felt slightly layered. In what way, you ask? Megumi was obsessed with making his own decisions and being powerless gave him the right motivation and feasibility to become stronger.

I am not the first to admit JJK's production is stunning and Mappa knocked it out of the park. There are many good moments. One of which for me was Gojo's attack, but more than that Megumi scene of destroying that curse as he manically laughs. It's very vibrant in showing his personality and the animation to the direction was immaculate. The same goes for the scene with Yuuji fighting against Hanami in tandem with Todou. The acrobatics and the fluid of their movements were absolutely insane even if the soundtrack was misplaced and kind of killed the experience. I won't deny the scene was eye-candy but Yuuji nor Todou ever showing any expressions other than that blasted stoic immovable face kind of killed it for me and didn't make me care for it as much. Another good use of directing was Nobara moment when she shafted that one-note awful villain clown. It showed her proud and arrogant personality clearly and the facial expression on her face was satisfying. As noted previously, the way the soundtrack, insert song was used in JJK just felt off and weird. It honestly made me cringe on multiple occasions.

It's too bad the inconsistencies about JJK still manages to overshadow the few goods I have seen. What issues are you talking about? I mentioned Yuuji already, the flow of the story being erratic and the direction being random, feeling unplanned and at times even forced. I can't count the number of times JJK failed at comedy. To be fair, it's subjective but please tell me I am not the only one in the world who found the ""funny bits"" obnoxious and honestly cringe? None of the scenes with Takeda and Todou made any sense to have, I even heard that in the manga most of it was only 3 pages but the anime made it feel like an eternity by extending it without purpose. Tell me what did add? Besides telling us the comedy of JJK's absolutely is asinine and a mess. That's not even counting the time when Yuuji and Gojo tried to make a surprise out of the Wall being alive but it didn't hit the right notes. It was brushed off to the side the moment Yuuji opened his cringe-ass mouth. I am still highly disappointed in what could've been a passionate and sentimental moment being done nasty like that. The thing is Nobara was seen crying when she heard Yuuji died and both she and Megumi was clearly depressed. But when the cringing lad was shown to be alive it was like nothing happened. Pun intended. All of the emotions the character shared become null and void. Hell, it was done so it never existed in the first place.

It's time to touch upon about Jujutsu Kaisen power system, which seems easy and straightforward at first glance before getting overly complicated and illogical. To put it simply, cursed energy is a phenomenon nurtured from anger and sorrow. This allows the user to create and manifest unnatural things and apparently nurtures a broken ability that makes not even slightly sense. Take Black Flash as an example which was introduced into the story as this flashy and impressive attack that most users are unable to pull off. All the while contradicting itself by having Nanami explain most users can only pull off two attacks in a single day, while he shows off and says on a good day I could do four. Later, Yuuji the Wall uses this attack multiple times against a curse without any backlash. Not to mention, this attack that was hyped up was no doubt one of the most anticlimactic things I had seen in JJK. It was like there was no weight behind those punches. Not even after few arcs, JJK even forgot the fact it's an exorcism story. I never got those vibes. To me, it felt more like a shounen anime about slaying demons masqueraded as an ""exorcism"" story just without any sense of direction, value, or reason in the thing it with does. If you want exorcism there is Twinstar exorcist and Ao no Exorcist which most definitely sticks to its themes presented in the first episode.

Another notable negative and problematic thing I have noticed about JJK is the vast amount of dialogues. It's clear the author cares more about ""telling than showing"". During a time the scene of the characters running toward each other to throw an attack got significantly reduced to throw a bunch of nonsensical exposition that will get forgotten in the next moment. It's part of the reason I felt it was exhaustive at times to watch Jujutsu Kaisen and this has nothing to with me not tackling heavy works. Look at my favorites. I love my complex and dialogue-heavy stories, but when it's useless it just becomes a massive pain. Not to mention, while I was flipping through the pages of Jujutsu Kaisen out of curiosity to see if anything catches my eyes. I get hit by an extensive amount of dialogue boxes with nothing but text. This was on the level of Hunter x Hunter. To be fair, it's clear JJK takes some elements from there, like the expansion ability which is a more simplified version of a variation of Nen. Sadly, it took inspiration in the wrong things as well like its dullness in exposition. No, I read those boxes and it was literally just explaining the thoughts in the character's head. It was wasteful. It's something that shows the author is struggling to write interesting consistent characters and stories.

My final point is the potential with Sukuna being shafted after having few moments to shine in the story. Sure, it's early but he never really felt like part of the crew. Just a means to an end. If you have seen Naruto, you know how much personality Kurama had. It was one of the best execution of a demon residing in someone else, making their life living hell at every chance he got. While Sukuna just gets forgotten by the Kyoto arcs comes around. My favorite part was arguable during the times Yuuji and Sukuna monologued with each other. I enjoyed Sukuna's arrogant and prideful self and I was curious what the author was going to do with him. He is probably the biggest potential in JJK considering there are many routes the author can take with Sukuna. I don't know if I will be there to see it though as I have little to no motivation to pick up the sequel when it eventually rolls around from the corner.

I don't think Jujutsu Kaisen deserves a silver of the hype it's receiving. It's filled with nothing but issues and again discrepancies, no flow in moments, besides few stunningly produced cuts. Thanks to Mappa. It got an obnoxious cast of characters who are acting in the same way with meager differences, some potential solid ones but it doesn't seem like JJK seems to care about them much. No logic behind its power system which feels to me more like convenient writing. The author literally explained in detail about Gojo's broken ass ability in the extra chapters, not even during the main manga story. To me, it says the author doesn't have things planned out or rather doesn't have an idea in which direction he is heading. I am happy for them to see their work being praised and getting recognized even if I think there are far better stories out there deserving of that. I cannot deny that. However, I don't get why the community calls this messy travesty a masterpiece, excellent, best shounen of all time, let alone of the decade. Nothing has touched the big three yet in terms of writing. Really everything. I hope one day that work will come but Jujutsu Kaisen is far from ever. This is another example of anime being shilled due to it having crazy production value even when it's not worth it as a whole. I don't recommend this to anyone who wants a solid cast and writing. If you want your flashiness and lifeless light hype, sure knock yourself out. But still not worth it at all. Jujutsu Kaisen? More like Pooputsu Shitaisen."
21459,"TL;DR is located at the end of the review.


""My Hero Academia"" takes place in a world where 80% of the population possesses a special ability known as a ""quirk"", unique to the individual person. This story follows Izuku Midoriya. He's a boy who spent his childhood looking up to his idol, All Might. All Might is one of the strongest heroes, also known as the ""Symbol of Peace"", who spends his time fighting evil. He dreams of becoming a great hero like All Might, but never developed a quirk. His only chance at becoming a hero is to make it into UA High School, the #1 hero training academy. He is constantly picked on for not having a quirk by his classmate Katsuki Bakugou, and calls Midoriya ""Deku"" as an insult. Midoriya meets All Might, and discovers All Might's quirk is known as ""One For All"", giving him high strength and making him almost impossible to beat. Unlike other quirks, this quirk can be passed down and gets stronger the more people it has been passed down to. All Might is revealed to have an injury that limits his time where he is able to use his quirk. Midoriya trains his endurance so his body can handle the quirk, and All Might passes the quirk onto him. Despite this, Midoriya can only use the quirk once and then breaks whatever part of his body he used the quirk with. The story progresses and both Bakugou and Midoriya make it into UA High School through a test where they must fight robots representing villians to earn points. Midoriya meets his classmates and teachers, who have mixed opinions on him. The rest of the show follows his journey on becoming a hero.
VisualsThe visuals feel like the standard for a shounen. The fight scenes are what really hold together the show, as they are exciting and decently drawn. The character designs are unique and make them easy to recognize.

 Plot The area where this show is lacking though, is the plot. There's some filler episodes and it doesn't have a great overarching central point. Most of the episodes just show Midoriya training and attempting to become a strong hero. There isn't a strong conflict besides some fight scenes between heroes and villains.

 Characters
While the characters are well done on the outside, they don't add much development to the story. Only a few characters actually make a difference, while most of the class is kind of just there. I'm not referring to main characters and side characters either. Bakugou, one of the most important characters in the show, barely leaves a mark on the story. His only memorable trait is that he bullies Midoriya, which doesn't change anything about the show.

TL;DR/ConclusionThis anime is average. That's the best way I can put it honestly. It doesn't make an impact, but it doesn't suck either. Its main purpose is to entertain the viewer and is meant for younger audiences. It certainly does fulfill that job, but not well. The parts that are meant to be funny are out of place and bad. The visuals are a slightly effective attempt at covering up the meaningless plot. Overall, I'd suggest this show to someone looking for something that isn't deep or hard to understand.

Probably gonna get bashed by the mha fandom but oh well."

Shounen anime are known power-ups which makes no sense, the story behind it feels very weak and illogical, even going by the anime in questions; worlds physics and rules. It's just there to excite you up, make you excited and that in of itself is not a bad thing so to say. However, the build-up to this point, through the world, the character's is significant. This is something I would say Hunter x Hunter accomplishes very well and is one of the few who managed to hit the right notes for this and so much more.

Story

It starts with centering around a young boy, named Gon who sets out on a journey to find his father. Sounds simple enough, but it's the journey to get there and how it does it, is what makes HxH quite special and unusual. For starters, the battles are exciting and fascinating which reflects the rules set up by this world, and it does a great job of showing it to us. It's not as simple as he is the main character and he will win every battle without any real effort or trouble since it can affect us emotionally.

At one point, you will be glued to the screen watching this young boy hunting his prey for his own goals, and while he is doing so, You get to see and hear everything that is going through his head at the time, and it leaves you with his feeling of how dangerous this situation really is and how dire the consequences could become if he where to be detected by his prey. This is just one segment among many which are directed and told so well that you can't help but be glued to your screen watching this all unfold. However, there is more.

What makes it even more fascinating, is the fact that Gon is terrified while doing so, he is acutely aware that he could die if he were to mess this up and how his character portrays this, through his actions and emotions, is a job well done. He doesn't directly attack the enemy with a one-track mind, he strategies on how to hunt his prey. He learns all the ingredients necessary trough mother nature and other hunters he managed to catch a glimpse of doing his own thing.

A big factor in most shounen anime is power, and Gon is not someone anyone sane would want to mess with, even adults. For his age of 12 years old, he is quite strong and fast, and you would rather avoid getting on his wrong side if you know what's best for you. Though, being honest, if brute force were the only thing HxH had going for it, the popularity of it would make no sense. 

We have another type of power and what makes it stand out from most of the others, is how complex and exciting it is. It's not as simple like just getting stronger, unlocking your potential, to mention some. It has its categories which reflect the user's personality and depending on where you have lived, spent your times most, all of this is important in figuring out your type and which category it falls in. Gon is one you would list under Enhancer; these types tend to be simple and straightforward in their demeanor. 

This focuses on the physical aspect of the user, his life energy and how to use it to achieve stronger and higher power. However, it's not that easy, if you were to mess it up, you could put your entire life in danger. You need to know how much to put in each of your attacks, and this is not easy and puts our character's through grueling and intense training segments to make them able to control this power more efficiently and figure out how you would want to use it. 

There is more to this power, but if I were to delve further into it, this entire review would mostly just be focused around that. What I can say, is that at one point, the anime had a one-hour explanation for this power which was one of the most exciting and mesmerizing dialogue I heard in my all time watching anime.

Sound

As for sound, effects, music, it nails all those parts and gives you a great list of many amazing tracks you can't help but get addicted to, at least I was. It feels spot-on and does a great job of reflecting the overall atmosphere and feel of the anime. Like, it would make sense to get bored of listening to the same opening song, over and over, but the things are you don't, and I can't describe adequately ""why?"". First, you might start out disliking the opening (why would you, though?), yet after a few times of listening to it, most persons would be addicted and can't stop looking. It also hits those nostalgia notes well if you are re-watching the anime. The same could also be said for the ending songs. 

The effects are another thing which feels spot-on, not only is Madhouse great at using it, but also manipulating to give you the sense if a character is one assassin, you can barely hear his footsteps, when he runs you can't see sand blowing upward from the steps he takes. Action segments are no exception either, the hits or slashes among other things are done exceptionally well. Madhouse seriously outdid itself and deserved all the praise they get.

Art

The art and animation is another significant deal aspect to an anime and HxH, is one of the best and most consistent. I don't think there was even a moment when I was watching this anime; I taught it looked terrible. Notably, during the fight scenes, it seems and feels, and you can't help but be drawn toward it. It's so fluid with some of the greatest sakuga I have seen. 

Also, depending on the situations, Madhouse does a great job of adapting to it, like the facial expression at severe or comedic moments. Lightning, shading and colors adjustments, determined by the mood or tone of the situations or even the arc in question.

Characters

Just having a good story or writing is not enough, for me at least. You need to love or hate the characters, and I can safely assure you that HxH does a fantastic job of executing them. They feel alive, quirky, noisy, and have a likable personality which makes it, so you don't forget them quickly or the individual's name. HxH has a massive cast of characters, and they all feel necessary to progress our main characters. 

Gon at the start feels simple and straightforward, but as you move forward with the story you start to see flaws in him, I mean he is 12 years old, so it's logical. It would make sense to have some noteworthy issues which make him stand out and make him more of an exciting or annoying character, depending on which category you fall in. If he or the other character's where perfect it would be tedious to follow such a main character, wouldn't you agree?

My favorite part about HxH, though, is the villains or antagonists. You start with hating them when you learn what the hell they put one of your main characters through but when you learn more about them, and you just can't help but like them.. and suddenly, you don't want them to be killed off but be incorporated in the story somehow, to maybe get them a central role in the story because they are just that much exciting and lovable and you can't help but be drawn to their silly nature and personality.

It also features one of my favored antagonists; I started with absolutely hating him and his one-track mind nature of being the best of them all. However, he was still just new to the world, and once he learns more and starts to interact with characters, which challenged his original demeanor. I couldn't help but like him and not wishing death upon him. He is easily one of the most complex written antagonists, and I sincerely hope I can find more character's like him.

You will cry for them; you will hate them, you will love them.

The Negative

This anime deserves all the praise it gets, it's not perfect by any means, but probably close. However, just like any other series, it does come with some flaws which can make the viewer drop it or entirely skip over it. For starters, it's very slow paced and takes it's time to build up. This is not an issue for me, but it might be for other persons, and if they were to stop watching. They will be skipping one amazing anime, which I think at one point, every anime watcher should give a try, it's just that worthy for me.

During a specific huge arc, the pacing became even slower, the explanations for simple things, which could be shown through the animation and art making it more enjoyable is less visible and you get tons of unnecessary info dumping which could be skipped over or replaced with more exciting events. 

This is my most significant flaw in the anime. I don't know how the manga handles this, but just in this regard, the anime did fail to satisfy me. However, this is becoming one tiny nitpick that is easily solved if you watch the anime in a binge. I am one of the persons who experience this arc in a weekly airing manner, and it was not fun to sit through 20 minutes of an episode of not seeing any real progression. Thankfully, I almost looked over this when I sat through the same arc for the second time.

Conclusion

Hunter x Hunter 2011 is one of a kind anime with some amazing and intelligent way to tell a good story, boasting some great and likable characters. Not your typical shounen or anime with some awesome strategizing events and a power that is so complex and difficult to understand but is very fun to learn about. Which totals up to my reason why this still stands strong as my favorite anime to this day and I urge everyone to give it a try, at some point in your life."

In an oversaturated superhero genre, One Punch Man is a refreshing satire demonstrating that being the strongest isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. At first, the idea of a superhero that can defeat anyone in one punch seems like it would get old fast, and… it does. That’s the point. It’s a comedic take on how boring being overpowered would actually be. But don’t be fooled, because the actual story is far from dull.


- Plot: Predictable, yet enticing, and provides a good laugh (9.0/10)

- Characters: A fun poke at superhero clichés, with enjoyable interactions (8.5/10)

- Visuals: Good backgrounds and amazing animation (8.9/10)

- Audio: Great music, especially the opening and closing (8.1/10)

- Bingebale/Hype: Tantalizingly easy to continue watching and strong popularity (8.9/10)

- Enjoyment: A personal favorite and one of few re-watches (9.3/10)




As the name implies, Saitama is so overpowered that he can defeat any opponent in one punch. He trained so hard his hair fell out, and now he’s the strongest man in the world. He’s just a hero for the fun of it, but it’s starting to lose its appeal. After all, it’s not much fun when all it takes is one punch to finish the battle. Life is boring. Then, the cyborg Genos suddenly appeared in front of his home, seeking to avenge his dead family. Awed by the sheer power of Saitama, he begs to be allowed to learn from him how to become stronger. Reluctantly Saitama agrees, but this causes both of them to register as official heroes. Genos easily reached the top class of heroes while Saitama’s in the lowest after barely passing the written exam. This new society of class rankings and power struggle give rise to all sorts of problems with new people being introduced all the time, and on top of that Saitama is still battling monsters day after day. Just as he’s starting to get accustomed to his new lifestyle a world wide threat appears that he has no choice but to face. Finally, a worthy opponent!





If the premise of defeating everyone in one punch was all this show had to offer, then yeah, it wouldn’t be very good. But One Punch Man is more than that. As a satire, it relentlessly pokes fun at every superhero story stereotype there is, exposing just how ridiculous everything really is, making a comedy out of the entire genre. But it also explores the idea of how being the most powerful being actually really sucks. With no risk and no struggle, you just can’t have any fun or thrill. There’s no need to do anything other than nonchalantly sit back and take your time. The only real struggle is the inner one. Saitama yearns for a day when he can actually be presented with a challenge and not just some boring one-hit fight. It’s not exactly the most mysterious plot, in fact, it’s mostly predictable, but just because you can guess what’s going to happen next doesn’t mean you won’t enjoy what comes next. It’s a unique idea that took the idea of being the strongest  very literally and showing the reality of how dull it would be while also keeping everything laughable and lighthearted.




Saitama is one of the most unbothered and nonchalant characters there is, probably because he’s so overpowered. Genos, the cyborg, on the other hand is the textbook definition of someone who must become stronger to avenge their fallen family, nothing else matters. This makes their interactions quite amusing. Besides the main two characters, many other supporting characters appear too, and most of them are also perfect stereotypes, from the heroes, to the villains. In fact, the extent at which the characters portray popular clichés is probably the only thing taken seriously in the whole show. 




As far as the style and artwork goes, there’s nothing too special about the visuals other than the backgrounds. Of course, like everything else, a lot of it is intended to poke fun at the genre, especially character designs. It’s definitely not bad, but it isn’t much more than slightly above average at best. I will say it does vary a bit, but in a good way. It can suddenly switch from an almost too simplistic style, to a highly detailed fight scene in a moment.Where this show really shines however, is its animation. Absolutely phenomenal and iconic fight scenes. Seeing the plain bald Saitama go from egg to incredible powerhouse is amazing and the scenes and angles portray the fights better than any other action anime I’ve seen. It’s exciting, it draws you in and keeps your attention. You don’t want to look away for even a second.




Much like the visuals, most of the audio doesn’t really stand out in any way, but it’s not bad either. It’s good in the same way that every other decent anime’s audio is good. However, also much like the visuals, there is one key element that stands above the rest, and that’s the music. The theme music is just, mwah \chef’s kiss. I don’t know how I would go about explaining it though, other than just saying it’s good. If you’re reading this review to decide whether or not to watch One Punch Man or not, then you’ll just have to watch it, if only for the music.




Despite exploring the idea of a boring existence, the plot is still enticing and keeps you wanting to watch more and more. I can count the number of animes I’ve rewatched on one hand, and this is one of them. Even after finishing, you still aren’t satisfied with watching it only once. Everyone who has been watching anime for even a short time at least recognizes the name One Punch Man, and it’s popularity is indicative of how well received it was. It might be overrated, but only slightly, and not without good reason.




I heavily enjoy this anime. Action and comedy are like my two favorite genres and while they usually are combined, not one show combines them to this extent. I don’t know what good things to say about this anime other than what I’ve already said, but it is definitely a favorite of mine. It combines the qualities of multiple kinds of animes to the extreme, which is the main reason, I think, it’s so good.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
The story focuses on Ken Kaneki, a human, who turns into a ghoul due to his boner doing all the thinking during a date and following a girl into a creepy alley way. That girl being Rize, a ghoul, who gets fucking decked and her organs get given to Kaneki. (therefor turning him into a half ghoul).

He now has to live with the fact that he has to feed on Human Meat or he will fucking die. But of course our main hero is too scared and cowardly to do that, I mean I understand, they wanted to show that he still has his humanity left and wants to protect both Ghouls and Humans but I felt like that whole thing went for far too long, there is only so much whining you can do before Survival instincts kick in.

During the middle episode it is revelead that a doctor is actually producing these human ghoul combos, they don't really do much with this though until much late (not included in the first season).

There is also Kaneki having to hide from ""The Doves"", these lads are basically Ghoul Hunters.

The end parts of this show is what TG is known for, white haired Kaneki. After being tortured Kaneki snaps and unleashes his inner ghoul. I mean the combat is nice and all but after this point Kaneki gets too serious for my liking.

The first season of Tokyo Ghoul doesn't really get into the juicy parts of the series. But you're better off reading the manga since even this was weirdly paced compared to the manga. They didn't skip a lot of the content (they only did that in the later seasons) but still. Not the best experience.




[CHARACTERS:]()
Tokyo Ghoul has a lot of characters, here's a few that are memorable.

Ken Kaneki - The main character, I already mentioned his origin story. At first Kaneki is quite a normal lad, though pretty shy and cowardly I guess is the correct word to use. I didn't mind that to be honest, there are too many shows where the heroes are these extroverted happy machines. I want to relate to a character xd

Touka Kirishima - The opposite of Ken, she is kinda of a tsundere. She likes humans but doesn't say that and gets all worked up when her true feelings are about to be exposed.

Kureo Mado - An insane Dove who will stop at nothing to exterminate a ghoul.

Koutarou Amon - His mentor is Mado. Amon is much more strict and work focused than Mado.

And thats about it. Sorry.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The art style is quite good. I can't really say much else about it, its better than usual stuff we see. The animation is also well made to be honest, the combat scenes are fluid and smooth but apart from that nothing groundbreaking in my opinion.




[MUSIC:]()
Now, I'll let you in on a secret. I forgoten the OST for this show. I do remember that the OP is catchy af though.
Probably the most iconic opening right behind AoT. 




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Tokyo Ghoul (Season 1) has a lot of potential. (though me having read the manga I know that its wasted potential)

They set up the first season quite well but pace it weirdly, the combat was fun when it lasted but its not enough to hook me into watching the rest of the series. Only a handfull of the characters are worth paying attention to, the rest are either annoying or the scum of earth."
20958,"Spoilers will be discussed in this review.

Unlike my thoughts of AOT’s 1st season, I enjoyed my first viewing of S2 a lot. From memory, I remembered appreciating the focus on the side characters more than the main trio, as I felt the strengths of the show were better exemplified with them rather than a screaming lunatic. I also liked the more mysterious air the show had now and remembered the pace being slower than S1. 

After rewatching, the strengths I still stand by (though I appreciate Eren’s value a lot more now) but I could not have been more wrong about the slower and more thoughtful pace. I always found it funny when people discuss the season’s of this show, S1 is always the rollercoaster while S2 is the one with more plot progression. 

S2 is just as much an insane ride as S1, if not even crazier at some points. The set pieces are incredible, and the relentless pacing of important, hype-filled events is astounding. 

The slower moments were a little better in this season because of how much the mystery has grown. Every conversation was interesting to hear and the way this season builds up suspense is masterful. 
The very first episode is very dialogue driven except for the end which is crazy. The Beast Titan is, in my opinion, the scariest titan revealed up to that point and the whole scene with the Scout Captain (can’t remember his name) was bone chilling. Seriously, he has one of the most disturbing deaths in the series so far. 

After a great moment with Sasha in the next episode, we then head to the Castle battle which is my favorite sequence in this season. The hopeless feel and the brutal deaths filled these episodes with a sense of dread. You don’t know what’s gonna happen, especially since none of the main three are present. 

Then, it culminates in an epic reveal and rescue scene. Truly a classic moment. But then…it gets crazier. 

Spoilers in bound (for the two people that haven’t seen this show yet) but Reiner and Bertholt’s reveal was incredible. The build-up with Eren not wanting to believe it, and the casual way it’s revealed was pretty unique and unexpected for a show as bombastic as this. 

But the transformation and subsequent battle steals the show. The epic new songs by Sawano are god tier and mixed with the raw emotion of feeling betrayed by two likable characters makes you, the viewer, feel just as hurt as Eren and the others. This show would not be as good without Sawano’s score, I truly believe that. It brings that something extra to every scene, and the transformation and battle scene is a great showcase of that. 

Then, the rescue operation. So much more was revealed in this arc than I remembered. The way this show builds mystery is honestly award worthy. You see Marley soldiers before you even know who they are, you see the edge of the island where Marley turns people to titans well before Grisha’s past is revealed. 

Ymir for me is the GOAT of this season. She went from a character that wasn’t even named in season 1 to one of the most important players in the story. Her backstory was unique and really made me feel for her. The scene where she looks up to the stars and the song “Call of Silence” peaks actually brought a tear to my eye.

Continuing on with the topic of mystery, there’s parts of Ymir’s past I still don’t know about, and that’s amazing. It’s satisfying and mysterious, and beyond the hype, that is the core of this show, and this arc perfectly exemplifies this. 

But the moment that will stick out to me the most in this season, the one that has stuck with me the most is in the final episode. Death is an important part of this show and is arguably one of the best series to handle it. 

Every death is meaningful and impactful to the story, but most have been characters with no real sentimental attachment. Hannes is different. I’m not sure what the general consensus on him is, but his death is probably the most tear-jerking in the series at this point, even counting both parts of Season 3. 
He was there at the very beginning, he knows the main trio. Their struggles, hardships, and pain. He failed to save Eren’s mother and that has stayed with him. Despite this, he never lets his guilt get the better of him. Throughout Season 2, he helps Eren, Armin and Mikasa continuing moving forward and every scene with him brings a smile to my face. (Special mention to the hilarious flashback scene where everyone gets in a fight).

His burden is mighty, even mightier than Eren’s so to see the titan that devoured her return, Hannes fights to life and limb to avenge her. No scene in this show has hit me harder than his death. The final look he gives to Eren as he is ripped apart and eaten brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. 
Since the beginning of the show, it is the most hopeless moment for our characters. The complete silence surrounding the scene directly connects you to how Eren feels. This scene is incredible and really showcases how smart and well crafted this series is. 

Overall, this is one of the best follow-ups to a hyped show ever made. The non-stop roller coaster continues and keeps on rolling until the very end. I loved this season just as much as the first, and I can’t wait to continue re-watching up until I catch up to Season 4."
11757,"THIS REVIEW IS 100% BIASED (and there are spoilers so be warned)

(I updated the ""final score"" to reflect a more subjective view of the anime without personal bias)

Well, now that i've gotten that out of the way, here is MY PERSONAL review of the anime Sword Art Online. It probably is unfitting of what most people say (I've heard every negative thing said about SAO). However, there is a reason why Sword Art Online is my favorite anime to this day. I'll start with my personal reasons on why I gave it a score of 10. 

To put it simply: The rating of 10 comes from personal enjoyment. Was this anime perfect? No. Was this anime flawed in a lot of ways? Yes. Do I care? NOPE! At the time I decided to watch SAO, I had previously been unexposed to the action genre. Being a young ish (16 yr old at the time) female I typically enjoyed romance and shoujo anime. So SAO was something quite new and exciting for me to pick up. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, so of course at first I did not notice the flaws in storyline and progression that everyone seems to point out (at first anyway). To me, I simply adored the mix of action and romance, considering I still loved watching romance in anime. I will go into more details about this when I discuss characters, but my point is that the combination of action (something new) mixed with romance (something I loved) in a cool stuck-in-a-game setting was REALLY EXCITING to me. I soon fell in love with almost all the characters (talking about you, Silica...) and became a huge fan of the series from then on. I have re-watched the whole anime (both seasons) 4 times, so as that shows, I definitely know my way around the series. 

Now with that aside, I will rate some aspects of the anime like music, characters, story (with some bias obviously, as I stated above)!

Animation
This one is a 10/10 stars for me. SAO had (and has) a pretty large production budget. When you compare it to anime like Log Horizon, you can tell the difference (not to bash on Log Horizon). Many talented animators were brought in to work on this anime, and it is especially apparent with its brilliant action scenes, lively colors, and beautiful landscapes and scenery. I could go on and on, but I believe I have made my point. 

Soundtrack
Again, a 10/10 for me. The main battle theme Swordland is very memorable, and to this day gives me chills. It is no surprise that SAO has excellent music, as very talented Yuki Kajiura provided works for OST. Most people probably know she's done music for other well received anime such as Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero and so on. Every theme is fitting and I still listen to the OST to this day. All the openings and endings are catchy and I personally enjoy them. Overall, a stunning soundtrack for a stunning anime!

Characters
Oooh boy, one of the places where SAO gets bashed a ton. ""Here we have the main protagonist: completely lifeless, pointlessly overpowered, boring personality. Then we have the badass female lead who turns into a cookie-cutter tsundre"". I'm here to explain why I believe that those characters are more than what people negatively say about them. Personally, the characters section gets a solid 7/10. While there are some good characters, there are definitely places where this anime fails to deliver in its characters. To explain, let's start with the good: none other than Kirito (let me remind anyone reading again that this is my personal opinion)

Kirito is my favorite character in the series. At the start, his personality comes across as a cold, introvert. He has trouble making everyday small talk, and this is portrayed very well. As he is a loner, he enjoys playing solo and does not like forming parties (he has trouble finding a partner for the first boss raid). However, we can see that as the course of the anime goes on, certain things happen to him to shape his personality. He goes through heartbreak, does things he regrets, and finds it within himself to beat the death game for a very compelling and heartwarming reason. In my opinion, Kirito is the most interesting character in the whole series. I do not find him boring, and despite all things, I actually find him somewhat relatable. People criticize saying it is hard to empathize with someone who is too perfect, but I disagree. During all his hardships, I truly felt his pain, I could feel real emotion from him as he fought battles and escaped near-death situations. 

So maybe he is a tad overpowered for his own good (hacking the game console, really?) However, is that REALLY bad? I don't find it to be. Sure, it might have been cool to see some progression from when he started off as being a ""noob"", but hey, he was a former beta tester after all, and seems to have a decent knowledge of games in general. That alone can explain why Kirito is a much better player than the majority of the 10,000 who are trapped. There are (unfortunately) some major time skips that happen which fail to show any progression from his character (more on this in the story section), and after a two year time skip, he is leaps and bounds better. Unfortunately, we do not get to see this development. It just happens. However, I don't feel like this limits his character. You can still see his character develop in other ways as he finds his romantic interest, and begins to see a future that involves her. His personality is shaped by the interactions he has with the people around him, and the experiences he goes through. From his guilt of killing the moonlit black cats, to facing Akihiko Kayaba at the end, to nearly dying by a laughing coffin member, and so on. You will start to see how his mindset goes initially from it being all about himself and how he was going to survive... to turning the focus on saving Asuna. A shift from selfish to selfless. This continues to show through in the second half of the first season all the way to the second. He is always determined to keep his party members alive. I loved his determination, how he never gave up. His sheer passion for what he was doing was incredible to watch. I could really see how much he loved Asuna, and how much he was willing to do to clear the game.

Another negative aspect that people say about Kirito is that he gets a special skill: Dual Blades. How could this be? Why is he the only one? Well, Kayaba (the creator of SAO) stated very clearly that this skill was awarded to the player with the fastest reflexes, or someone that he thought would be the one to beat the game. That may not reflect how games are played in real life, and to that I say SAO is NOT a typical game! This is a fantasy game, in a fantasy world, and of course, it does not need to reflect how things are done in our real world, period. 

Before this gets too long, I want to state that I do see where his character has flaws, but to me, the good outweighs the bad. It didn't stop me from absolutely loving him as a character. I know not many will agree with me on this, but this is what I truly believe. 


Asuna is another great character (my second favorite). We can see some fantastic character development in the first season as she goes from seriousness, to learning how to love the dire situation she was in. Although she was trapped in the world of SAO, she didn't hide herself in the town of beginnings, but rather ventured out to clear the game. Even though she had never played a game in her life, she decided that living in fear wasn't going to be an option. In my opinion, that takes courage. In the Mothers Rosario arc, we also see lots more much needed back story of her home life, and we can see how the effects of Sword Art Online make things troubling at home. 

Overall, I can see how people say that Asuna is a ""cookie cutter character"", however, I think she has more complexity than that. For critics, she is too ""tsundre"", but again, is that a bad thing? (Toradora's Taiga... hello?) It may be typical and not unique however, I think Asuna goes beyond her ""lackluster tsundre trope"". For one, she is essential to the story, not only as Kirito's love, but for the sole fact that Kirito and Asuna are a great team. We can see how her experiences in the death game evolve her personality into becoming someone who would risk her own life to save the one she loves. I personally enjoyed her spunk and and feminine, yet badass personality.
I loved seeing such a strong female lead in this anime. At times, she may be slightly shadowed by her counterpart Kirito, but that does not make her any less of a character (more so in the second part of the first season). She and Kirito make a fantastic couple. I was delighted while watching the romance between them ensue. They might have been young, but it was pleasant, and heart-warming to see.

Finally, I have a very quick note on Yui. Personally, I found her as an addition to the family to be extremely cute, which further bonded Kirito and Asuna's relationship. Yui could be seen as a cheat device, but I think the complexity of Yui being an artificial intelligence, yet seemingly having real life emotions adds to the futuristic setting we are in (2024). Yui was created to assist players with mental health problems, but she was attracted attracted to Kirito and Asuna because they were among the few players who still managed to laugh and be happy despite dire situation they were in. She managed to defy the game master and help Kirito and Asuna, something that goes beyond what a normal AI should be able to do. I found that connection between them to be adorable especially the fact that she was their adoptive daughter! 

Now, to try to wrap things up, I'm going to quickly say a few things about the rest of the characters in general. Unfortunately, I believe that some characters were useless in SAO. Silica and Liz are the two that stand out in this category. To me, they did not add much to the story of value, and seemed to be more filler than anything. Other characters like Klien and Agil were great, however, I wish they had more screen time. 
Sinon and Yuuki were well fleshed out characters as well, however, this review will become way too long if I start talking about that. Suguha, or Leafa is another character that had complexity, however, I personally was not a fan of her incest love for her brother. Some of the villains are too stereotypically villain-y (at least that is what most people tend to say), but it did the job (and made me hate them). Overall, there were some issues with characters, but for the sole reason that the two main characters were great, I still can find enjoyment with the rest. 

Story
This one gets a 10/10 for me. It has a fantastic plot. I mean, come on, trapped in a VIRTUAL REALITY video game? That with the added ""if you die in the game, you die in real life"" factor makes this incredibly fascinating to watch. It was a concept that I had never thought of before. That is one of the reasons why I loved it so much the first time I watched it. 
Moving on to the second half, the whole story of saving Asuna is loathed by many, but I found that half to be very moving and driven, as you can see Kirito's determination very apparently in this arc as well (especially when he makes attempts to get to the top of the world tree). I did not mind that Asuna was a ""damsel in distress"" in this case. I loved seeing Kirito's love for Asuna continue to shine through his actions. The downside? It took the compelling death game aspect away, which lowered the stakes in a way. It wasn't a huge problem for me though.

The Gun Gale Online arc attempted to bring back the death game aspect with death gun (who looks and sounds way too much like darth vader by the way) It was enjoyable, but there was a lack of Asuna which wasn't my favorite, especially since Sinon was a LITTLE too comfortable with Kirito in that cave....

The 3 episode arc in between GGO and Mother's Rosario is nothing special. Basically a side quest for a sword. That's it.

The Mother's Rosario arc featured Asuna and some new characters. Easily the second most emotional arc there is in SAO. I really loved the focus on Asuna, and how much emotion and character development there was. (Sorry about the shallow reviews and summaries here, but I've been at this for two hours and I'm starting to feel like this review is too long!!) 

Plot Execution
The worst part of SAO in my opinion (however, this does NOT influence how I feel overall about it). I give it a 6/10. Like I mentioned earlier, there are too many time skips, too many pointless, filler episodes, and I sometimes wish that the anime could be redone but using the progressive novels instead of the original light novels. I also wish there was more focus on the Aincrad arc. Stopping mid season felt so unfinished (although, it was an interesting plot twist. I definitely was not expecting that), as even critics agree that the Aincrad arc was easily the best part of SAO. So with those critical flaws, the ideas and story were great, just poorly executed in my opinion if I will be honest. However, this does not change how I feel about SAO as a whole. As I stated above, my 10 score is based on my enjoyment I have had for the anime, so the negative aspects don't bother me! 

I'm going to go ahead and end the review here. I could easily continue writing this and polish my thoughts even more. However, that is for another time. Kudos to you if you read this far. I bet you're a hardcore SAO fan like me, haha (or heck you might be a hater trying to comprehend how I could even think the way I do). Anyhow, I hope this shows you why I personally loved Sword Art Online so much. Even though I know lots hate it, there are also those like me who love it. Here's hoping this essay explained that thoroughly. Until next time!"
5114,"This is undoubtedly one of the top 3 animes to have ever been produced. The art, the music, the story and it's characters all fit together perfectly. If you choose this as your first anime, you will hold almost every other anime to it's standards for quite a while. For this reason I cannot recommend anyone breaking into watching anime for the first time, to pick this one as your first. Pick another. Hold off long enough so you can appreciate some of the lesser ones a bit better. Nothing else can be said about this apart from that it's not just an anime. It's a masterpiece.

I don't know how to say this. But when ""Again"" by Yui started playing to the intro, I felt a teardrop rolling down my cheek. I rarely cry to any sort of media, but this one really got me. To put things into perspective, that song was my ring tone for a whole 2 years.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0cbUHmVdu4)

The other opening song that really caught my attention was ""Golden Time Lover"" by Sukima Switch. Still all the opening songs were amazing.  That's not the only thing, the scores were downright perfect as well. If the story and the art weren't just as intriguing, then one could argue all your focus would be on the music.

I'm going to let the art speak for itself.

Without spoiling anything, the story is about a search for something by two brothers and the epic adventure that follows it's wake. The emotional connection between the brothers and the characters they encounter in their journey is what sets this story apart. There is something for everyone, be it romance, adventure, drama or action packed fighting. 

The whole thing is set in an alternate universe where military rule and strange powers preside. The bewildering mysteries will keep you on your toes and the action packed sequences will make some characters bad-ass and others hated beyond reason. Despite the story being serious overall, it still manages to squeeze in comedic effect where none would expect. You cannot be disappointed.

Some of you might be wondering, ""How can any anime deserve a perfect score?"". There's a lot of obscure anime out there that might fit your taste better in the long run like it did for me. But this isn't about personal (subjective) tastes. This is about objective popularity. In the majority of cases it is indubitable that this anime will be in the top 10 of lists that rank anime TV series by quality. Don't get me wrong, I'm not appealing to the majority. Rather the contrary, I'm appealing to the genius is takes to appeal to everyone. To be fun for everyone. So if we're going to say there are objectively some really good anime, then you'd have to agree with me that this should always top the list."
20,"Out of all the long-running Shounen series that are out there, to me, one stands above the rest. Even though I only watched this anime recently, it holds a special place in my heart as my favorite long-running action anime that I have ever seen, and for good reason. 

One of the main problem’s that plagues a lot of long-running Shounen’s is their ability to keep an interesting narrative throughout the entire run time of the show. They make it interesting by having the show made up of many different arc’s that each have their own stories, characters and problem’s that the characters must face. A lot of these arcs are self-contained stories that don’t do much for the plot, despite the quality of some arcs. Naruto, doesn’t really do that. While each arc does have their own problems that the characters face the overarching story and the reason these events are happening tie in to the constant narrative that plays throughout the whole show. The plot is always advancing and not once is it ever boring to watch since the characters are always growing and learning different things about their friends and the world that they live in. Normally, if I would ever review any long-running Shounen’s in the future, this would be the section where I do mini reviews of every main arc in the series, but considering the whole show plays out like one big narrative, it’s almost impossible for me to do that. 

The main story itself is compelling enough that it doesn’t feel like reason just to get cool characters to fight it out (Which is the vibe I’m getting from Bleach from my experience of watching it so far. The story in Naruto is always expanding, new characters get introduced, new villains emerge and while a lot of the events in this series are set up for what’s to come in Shippuden (Especially in the Sasuke Retrieval Arc) it’s still worth watching to see where the characters grow and mold into the people they are later in the story (I say this because it seems quite a few people skip this series and start with Shippuden). 
Not everything is flawless in this department, however. Naruto is notorious for having insane amounts of filler episodes and this show is one of the biggest offenders of this problem. It starts off harmless enough by having a recap episode, then a hot spring episode, a fun episode about Kakashi’s face and a five-episode arc about a race which would be fine if that was all it was. Instead of ending the show at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, the show continues into 85 episodes of filler! Even for a long-running show like this one, 85 is an insane amount of filler episodes to have in a row. They even start the filler, right when the story was about to make it to the time-skip. While it was done to wait up for the manga, they could have just ended the original series and waited until they had enough material to start making Shippuden. Instead we got 85 episodes of low-quality random ninja missions that are close to unbearable to watch. I made it through the first few episodes of the first filler arc when I decided to stop and skip to the final episode. Even though this problem can be avoided now since you can just skip these episodes, it only really bugs me when I think of how long fans had to wait until the filler ended back when these episodes were airing. It may not be a problem now but it gets annoying when it still plagues Shippuden. But as I said before, you can just skip them now (Which is the most recommended option). So, in terms of the story department, Naruto does an excellent job considering all the filler is skippable. 

For long-running Shounen battle series, it is important to have cool, likable characters that make up the cast. No matter how cool the battles are, they won’t matter if you don’t care about who is fighting. Luckily, this is where Naruto shines the most. Naruto, as the protagonist of the story, does a great job to make the viewers root for him. Being the ultimate underdog, Naruto aims big in this series and is where the main emotion comes from throughout the show. He’s a boy that has nothing, that aims for everything. His relationship with the other main characters, his rival and best friend Sasuke, his love interest Sakura and his teacher Kakashi is what really drives this show and is what made this show so popular in the first place. As Naruto bonds with these characters you see him grow from being the village loser to their strongest ninja by doing nothing but making friends and working hard to get stronger. His struggles are relatable and his goals make sense for a person like him. At first, he causes trouble because he’s alone and he thinks that everybody hates him. But by meeting his new squad and bonding with other ninja, he becomes aware of how special friendship is and how you need bonds if you’re going to be Hokage (which is the head of the village). 

Apart from Naruto, the cast is made up of the coolest and craziest character’s I’ve seen in any anime. I already mentioned Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi but some of the best characters come in the form of rival ninja teams or the crazy villains that the heroes face. Among my favourites are Rock Lee (the lovable goofball), Shikamaru (the lazy genius), Hinata (the very shy, true love interest), Neji (the vengeful prodigy turned ally), Temari (this one is biased since she is my favourite female character) and Gaara (the frightening villain turned greatest ally). Even characters that I didn’t like at first like Ino, Choji, Kiba, Kankuro and Orochimaru turned out to be some of my favourite heroes and villains. But the best character (apart from Naruto himself) is Naruto’s perverted teacher, Jiraiya. Jiraiya is probably one of the most important characters in the series, mostly because of the impact he has on Naruto. While his squad leader Kakashi is training Sasuke, Naruto heads to Jiraiya who teaches him the Rasengan which becomes Naruto’s signature move and becomes Naruto’s father figure throughout the rest of the series. He’s motivation for Naruto to not give up and to continue moving forward with his dreams and ambitions. While I could continue with characters like Tsunade, Kabuto and Itachi, I’ll end this segment here by saying that out of all the other categories, Characters is what Naruto excels at the most.   

The soundtrack is amazing. The songs are a nice mix of traditional Japanese music mixed in with badass guitar. The Main Theme of the series is one of the most memorable, iconic and beautiful pieces of music to anybody that’s seen this show. If you haven’t heard it, you owe it to yourself to listen to it since it’s probably the most amazing song in the whole soundtrack. In terms of Openings and Endings, Naruto proves once again that just because it’s a long-running Shounen, it doesn’t need to half-ass it’s theme songs. Every Opening is a memorable J-Rock tune and not one of them is bad. It’s hard to pick a favorite from these songs which is why mine is a three-way tie between Haruka Kanata (OP 2), GO!!! (OP 4) and No Boy, No Cry (OP 6). The ED’s, while not as good as the OP’s, are still good and get the job done as Ending songs. Wind (ED 1), Viva Rock (ED 3) and Ima made Nando mo (ED 5) are my favorites while the others are still good, but not the most memorable. 
While I haven’t heard the Japanese voice acting since I watched the Dub, I can still judge the Dub and my god, is this a damn good Dub. Every voice actor hits the mark with every character they play. Maile Flanagan does an amazing job as Naruto and Yuri Lowenthal (who is one of my favourite voice actors) does one of my favourite performances from the show, as Sasuke who is one of the most iconic characters from the show. Tara Platt also does an amazing job as Temari considering that her performance is one of the main reasons that I like Temari so much. Other notable performances are Steven Blum as Zabuza and Orochimaru, Steve Stayley as Neji, Stephanie Sheh as Hinata, David Lodge as Jiraiya and Liam O’Brien as Gaara. Every other performance of the other main characters was also great but those were some of the best ones that were worth mentioning. If you couldn’t tell, Naruto also does a great job in the Sound department. 

Now to some of Naruto’s low points. The best way to describe this show is by saying that you’re basically watching an animated manga with a few great examples of amazing fight animation. While this isn’t Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters levels of barely animated, it’s noticeable considering there are a great number of shots that either linger or are completely still. Despite that, every fight in the show (and there are quite a lot) is always interesting to watch and is never boring to watch. The lack of animation during the dialogue sections of the show is made up for by the great animation for a lot of the fight scenes. Battles like Neji vs. Hinata, Rock Lee vs. Gaara, Naruto vs. Gaara, Naruto and Jiraiya and Tsunade vs. Orochimaru and Kabuto, Rock Lee vs. Kimimaro and Naruto vs. Sasuke are all excellent examples of fight animation in long-running Shounen battle series. 
The animation takes a turn for the worse, however, when you start getting into the filler episodes. They start off fine until the big 85 episodes of filler begins and you see how cheaply the episodes are made and how ugly everything looks. Speaking of things that look ugly, sometimes the character models will look strange and distorted which can come off as very weird and half-assed. I think this might be a problem in the manga as well but some of the off looking characters can be vary jarring when you see them for the first time. This happens very rarely so it’s not too much of a problem. Apart from that, the background art looks amazing and is highly detailed. Even if a shot is barely animated the backgrounds are always interesting to look at and is proof of the crazy amount of work that Masashi Kishimoto put into when he first published each chapter. The show can look extremely beautiful at times but still looks kind of blurry at times (which is a problem shared with Bleach which means that it’s more down to what Studio Pierrot was doing). Naruto does a great gob in the Animation department). 

Overall, if you are going to pick one of the Big 3 (Naruto, Bleach and One Piece) to watch, Naruto is your best bet. It’s fun, easy to get into and has a satisfying story where you see every character grow with every decision that they make in the show. It might be the only one worth watching in the end, since it hasn’t fallen apart like Bleach did and it might end unlike One Piece. Even though the show is 50% filler, you can still skip it which will make the experience shorter than what you may think. As it stands this first season of Naruto defined a whole new generation of anime fans when it premiered all the way back in 2002. A generation of Fighting Dreamers."
21,"One Piece is a great adventure series, with a lovable cast of characters. This series follows the adventures of a boy named Luffy who's goal is to become ""King of the pirates"". This series has some of the best world building in fiction, islands and islands packed with information on geography and rich history. A map of the One Piece world can be so detailed almost as life like as a real world map. One Piece has very strong characters and a very strong protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy is a character that has dreams and goals supported with motive. The cast of characters is so grand that characters you meet 100's of episodes ago will return and impact the story in many ways. My favorite thing about One Piece however is the outside interactions that effect the plot, for example characters that are not apart of the main cast like Ace and Blackbeard will have a battle that can determine how the world will progress. Each arc in One Piece gives you a payoff that will leave you fulfilled. Some of the most impactful moments in anime I have ever seen are in One Piece, scenes will leave you in tears and run shivers down your spine. One Piece is a series that has been planned from the very beginning and you can see this with all the foreshadowing that the author leaves in his writing, even moments that are not planned he is able to integrate them into previous plot points and have them connect with something that was mentioned in the previous chapters. As it is a great spectacular series one issue that might be jarring to readers is the length and pacing of One Piece, it is a commitment of itself, watching and reading one piece won't be easy but the storytelling in this series is like no other. One Piece will fulfill anyone need for it has many genres all mixed into one but it doesn't, effect the theme of one piece in anyway. Speaking of the theme, one piece's theme does not change from the beginning of the series to the end, and has a main character that embodies the message of the theme. There is many more great things about the story ""One Piece"" I do recommend anyone to give it a watch/read I will however recommend you read the manga over the anime due to pacing issues in the anime. Other than that I would give the series a 10/10 just due to the story."
21519,"You’ve probably already seen this movie but regardless, mild spoilers for the premise that truly reveals itself whole past the synopsis and maybe a few specific spoilers along the way

When most people think of Kimi no Na wa, they think of a simple emotionally gripping, beautifully animated masterpiece that touched them at their very core. When I think of Kimi no Na wa, I think of a tedious, convoluted, contrived, and ultimately misguided emotion-based time travel story blessed with wonderful visuals and cursed by its confusingly bad time travel narrative and equally hard to stomach main leads.

I know, I’m a buzzkill. 

So, why my cynicism? Before you try to answer, let me take two of them out for you. It has little to do with it being in the top 10 on every anime aggregation website, or the fact that this not only outsold every single Ghibli movie such as the insanely popular Spirited Away, or that it is the highest grossing anime movie of all time as of writing. I don't feel it was anywhere near good enough to warrant any of that, but it would be incredibly petty of me to call that a reason I dislike the film. With that out of the way, let's begin with the writing.

A boy and a girl suddenly wake up from a dream, only to realize that their bodies have switched. I must say, right out the bat, I like the fact that each new day is told from the perspective of one of the two characters while switching perspectives to suit a new day in the beginning and that it starts on a character being explained to how she was acting weird, and putting two and two together allows us to see that this is the aftermath of one of these body-switching incidents that occur a lot throughout this movie. This is where the compliments of the story end for a while.

How long have these two been switching bodies? Given the montage especially, it's insanely hard to keep track, and I know it's all thanks to a comet, but I doubt a comet would remain visible for a small country like Japan for so long that the montage sort of hints at weeks of this happening? How come these characters start off thinking they're in a dream, even after feeling pain (especially given the whole gag cliche based around this exact trope of waking up after pain in a dream) and seeing the entire day go by in real-time? I know full well that no dream lasts that long without entering at least one period of long, non-R.E.M. sleep (and R.E.M. lasts for about 15 minutes and that's when you dream, and dreams are never this coherent)? How come after so long, nobody tries to put two and two together about this whole thing with their own theories until the second half? Speaking of the second half…

The second half is where this movie turns from just irritating to convoluted and contrived. A comet from 3 years ago is seen 3 years later (I can't fathom how that's supposed to work, especially in such a short amount of time given a comet or a star) by these two main characters and that's what caused them to switched bodies with each other every day, and only them for no adequately explained reason, and that's a missed opportunity. We could've had scenes of some other people acting weird because of that too, though they would still need to explain it well beyond time travel-esque bullshit that doesn't explain anything. It turns out that two people end up, for no good reason, figuring it out: the grandmother of the girl, and the girl’s father. An explosion happens at one point in a major facility and no one considered that a  dangerous threat after being told that more of this can happen (though it's a diversion to evacuate the people from 3 years ago because apparently the comet splits and destroys the city that the girl was in, including her, meaning it would make no sense how she could connect with him, especially since the ending sort of rewrites that, which sort of changes the future but people can't do a good time travel plot for shit). The ending also just ends with the two sort of recognizing each other and then rolling to credits after panning up towards the clouds, so...that's something, I guess.

I had to go back and research literally every character’s name, they were that forgettable. It's not even like Rogue One where they either say most characters’ names once or not at all, they say these guys’ names constantly. This has never happened to me before for any anime. Let that sink in...and then realize how funny it is that the movie is translated as “Your Name” given these circumstances.

Taki and Mitsuha are dense, extremely dense. I mean, I’m a bit of a dense person myself as anyone who knows me IRL for longer than a small bit will tell you, but these two are infuriatingly dense to the point of actual stupidity. There was the “dream” example from earlier but also, these guys constantly set rules for each other to not interfere much with their lives, only to constantly break them. They conveniently forget things for the sake of the plot, though to be fair, that's just the plot actively forcing them to forget things for no reason and not then being idiots, so back to that. When Mitsuha meets Taki in the emotional climax of the film, she straight up calls him an idiot over the fact that he often played with her tits when he woke up in her body...and this is the first thing g she says to him in the middle of an emotional climax. Not “I finally found you” or something befitting of such a scene where they first sorta meet each other truly within the little time they have before convenient BS makes it so they physically don't see each other anymore and proceed to go on their way to accomplish a necessary task, but “Baka”. Fucking really?

It's insanely hard to talk about any of the characters’ personalities since while outside of the protagonists, none of these are truly bad characters, they are insanely forgettable. I forgot everything about these people by the time I finished the movie, aside from the fact that Mitsuha's little sister doesn't like taking shit from people, and that she conveniently forgets something too (not even for plot convenience this time, just her being an idiot at one point in the final act). I genuinely cannot describe these people, and again, this has never, ever happened to me before! That is a cardinal sin for a movie so focused on pathos! So, fuck it; moving on!

If nothing else can be said, let it be known that this is a rather gorgeous film. CoMix Wave Films did an amazing job with the visuals and digital effects here, especially with the environment. Shoutouts to how jaw-dropping the comet was and how despite many shots being busy as hell, they all still look beautiful. Sure, the character designs are pretty bland and I don't enjoy the equally plain and sometimes malformed art style in general but it's all animated incredibly well for the most part. Sometimes it seems as if the characters are animated in CG with 2D artwork put over them as the movements can feel almost uncanny every now and then, but rarely was it that distracting. There are some moments looked insanely choppy with blatantly low frame rates in comparison to everything else, though as per usual, this is apparently fixed in blu-rays and cinemas. Regardless, the film still looks amazing, even if the studio apparently ran out of budget for this film, and the fact that such a thing isn't noticeable at all is astounding, probably thanks to good cinematography and stellar digital effects.

RADWIMPS does several vocal tracks for the film's opening, ending, and background. None of them stick out, unfortunately, though that doesn't mean they're bad. In fact, after relistening to some of them, I find them mediocre at worst and decent at best. If there are any non-vocal background tracks, I don't remember them either. Ironic given what this film is about, which leads me to my final thoughts.

For a film about remembering, this film is awfully forgettable, especially in terms of its characters. As visually stunning as it is, I felt more annoyed than touched. This is easily the most forgettable film I've seen in quite some time, and it's not all that terrible but it's certainly not good in the slightest either from anything other than a visual perspective. Certainly not Number One anime film worthy, especially not when it's this contrived and unintentionally convoluted at time travel. I remember there was something about the director, Makoto Shinkai himself telling people to stop seeing this movie. He claimed that he didn't want people to see this as his magnum opus and for people to hold all of his films to that standard from now on, especially given the production issues that occurred towards the end. For me, I wouldn't know if this was his best film yet, but if so, then I dread his current filmography. With all that said, I bid you adieu."

“A silent voice” by Kyoto Animation, an animated Romantic drama movie, directed by Naoko Yamada is an exceptionally excellent movie that highlights one of the most significant problems in our life, bullying or rather, dealing with bullying, and this time from the side of the bully. And I wanted to tell you about it.

The story takes place in our modern days in Japan and it is divided into two core parts. The first part is about a school student — Shoya Ishida, a troubling and popular boy, and a deaf yet kind student — Shoko Nishimiya, a new student in Ishida’s class.
Ishida recklessly causes everyone to bully Nishimiya because she is deaf and he even does it himself.
img220()

As part of the bullying, he broke Nishimia's hearing aid several times, which eventually caused her mother to transfer the girl to another school.
This is when Shoya went too far. From now on he became the center of attention in his school. 
Shoya was considered guilty of the bullying in his class. And just like that, the tables have turned, and he became an undesirable student who got bullied.
img220()
The second part is the main part of the movie, which happens five years after the first part. Shoya is older, lonely, and tired from his life. He tries to cope with his past, and redeem himself from his acts. He wants to hide his past actions to become a better person.

The story has a powerful message of the way people treat others, the story teaches us to regret bad things that we have done in the past, treating others respectfully, and giving second chances even if we are afraid of it. 
""We live in a world in which judgement is more important than getting to know that person""

img220()
The art style of the film is equally amazing in an extraordinary way. I feel extremely fortunate to witness such an art. The music is outstanding down to the most minor detail. Many people say they did not like the song in English at first, but I fell in love with it and I think it adds.
img220(

Even if you are just a normal movie watcher or an anime fan, if you like tragedy or drama, you will enjoy this movie no matter what age you are, you will love it. I think that it is a very emotional and enjoyable movie, that we all can learn from, and I think it's a must-watch movie."
99147,"An amazing season, animation and story wise. This is where things get real good.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
This season focuses on learning the secrets of the monarchy that rules over the area within the walls.

All of the secrets hidden from us, and even the citizens inside the show are all coming loose. This season was honestly so good, my 2nd favourite to be honest.
The way they handled the story and the animation was phenomenal.

A lot of things happen this season, we don't get to see a lot of Titan fighting but thats because we know that the real enemy is other people. The Kenny squad is equipped with shotguns with what seems to be updated version of the maneuver gear built into them. This adds such a new and great dynamic into the combat scenes.

After all of the amazing fighting between the Survery Corps and Kenny Squad we are greeted with the Royal Family (The Reiss Family). They are the true kings of the world. Meaning that Krista (which we learned her real name is Historia Reiss) is the true queen of the world, that is after defeating her angered dad. I said angered because she refused to take part in the ceremony of injecting the fluid and eating the carrier of the Titan Eren has, she saved him and therefor her father sucked up the juices of the Titan on the floor and became the biggest Titan we have seen.

Near the end of the season we are greeted with Keith, the lad who was training Eren and the rest in Season 1. He knows more than he leads on to. He wanted to protect Eren that's why Eren's gear didn't work during the test in Season 1. I honestly loved all of that, all of the little plot twists which seemed like nothing important at first but then built up gradually to unveil such a massive story.

This season originally was supposed to be two cour but the second part was delayed, which yes at the time I was really impatient and wanted the second half now I am glad they took their time cause Part 2 is 10000x more intense. Get Excited!




[CHARACTERS:]()
The characters matured quite a lot during the span of the season.

Not only that their appearance changed slightly but also their lil quirks.
Of course they still are the same ol' characters we fell in love with in Season 1 but they are much more serious now.

I won't be talking much about the already existing characters such as Levi and Mikasa but instead will be focusing on the new major ones, I also already talked about the changes that happened to Keith and Krista in the previous section so I won't go over them again here. Sorry lads.

First up is Kenny. He is the one who took care of Levi when he was younger. His fighting style is similar that to Levi's (go figure). His character seems much more playful, I suppose, though he is quite serious about his job (which is to eliminate the Survey Corps). He also knows quite a few secrets from the past about the Royal Blood.

Flagel Reeves, he is the son of Dimo Reeves. After the assassination of his father due to the betrayal. Flegel has been huge help to Survery Corps, with not only getting their plans to go smoothly but also few other things.

We also get a lil sneek peek at the back story of Grisha (the father of Eren).




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
The animation of the previous two seasons was great, but this season takes it up to 11.

The smooth motions between each frame and each movement in combat is so well done that I honestly rewatched each and every one of these scenes hundreds of times. My favourite scene out of this whole season has to be the one near the start, the chase between Levi and Kenny Squad.

The art style also got a new coat of paint, it looks much more realistic-ish, which is also a nice change, it adds to the combat just that much more due to the detail.




[MUSIC:]()
Shingeki no Kyojin has an amazing OST everytime, this goes without saying. 
This Season is no different, the intense music during the all scale fights were adrenaline inducing, the calm tracks which appeared in the resting areas of the show where amazing at getting that adrenaline out and make you calm before it kicked you in the gut with more fights so well done it should be a crime.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Season 3 Part 1 is amazing, not only the animation and OST but also the story.
All of the lies and facades are crumbling down from the old kings, the truth is being exposed to everyone.
I honestly had so many moments during this season where I had to pause and appreciate the amazing writing of this series.

Part 2 tho, oh lawd. That just takes it up to another level. Get Excited!"
21856,"I have never been a fan of shounen anime, but dear God if this isn't one of the best shows to come out in the past few years. My gripes with the genre are consistently made to seem completely unfounded every week as new episodes air. To have a shounen manga adaptation clip along at a decent pace is already an impressive feat, but to also include incredible characters, stellar animation, and great music is just a medium-shattering achievement, especially when the series came straight out of SHONEN JUMP. The last I remember having this much pure unadulterated hype and fun with shounen was with YuYu Hakusho back when it aired on Toonami, and there's something to be said for recapturing (and going above) that magic. Oh, did I mention yet that there's nearly no filler? Yeah, there's only ONE anime-original episode, and the only way you'd even pick it out was if you were an avid manga reader. 

It's been said to death by the anime community at large, but the secret to HeroAca's quality is in its perfect execution of what we already expect. You're going to get all of your standard shounen tropes here; HeroAca embraces them to the fullest degree. The difference is in HOW the show does them, and does them so, so, so right. Deku is the most compelling shounen main character I've encountered to date, with, for possibly the first time in shounen history, a believable reason to actually be considered an underdog. You can't help but empthaize with him in his struggles and be hype as all hell for his achievements, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast as well. So much obvious loving time and care was put into making our core cast feel like actual fucking characters instead of power-husk show-offs. Personality-rich, driven, and (most importantly) believable characters are the name of the game here, and I can't help but enjoy pretty much every character that gets any ounce of screentime.

None of this is to say that HeroAca, and by extension this second season, is perfect by any metric. There are some misgivings with the plot and some of the general anime ""bleh"" that plagues all releases to come out within the past several years (high school setting, etc...). World-building is also a little suspect, and there's a clear requirement of being able to both suspend disbelief and to not question the lack of exposition regarding the character's environment. This issue is especially notable when the show likes to play with the idea of the ""ideal"" of being a ""real hero"", with some heavy handed messages about how widespread power has warped public perception about what being a hero really is and what sort of behavior they should exhibit. Although an interesting and compelling discussion for HeroAca, it's heavily damaged by this lack of meaningful exposition, and can come across as misplaced and even boring if you haven't properly ""bought-in"" to the series. 

Still, if we're talking in-genre here, and if you've been with me for this song-and-dance before you know we always are, you'll be hard pressed to find anything better than this. If you have ever been a fan of shounen anime, or you are just looking for an new pick-up with a fair bit of content on the bone, I implore you to check this one out. Whether you end up watching it or just dive straight into the manga, you definitely won't be disappointed."
101759,"With The Promised Neverland wrapping up its first season this week, the only thing I can say about this series is ""WOW!"" Suspenseful, gripping, at times heartwrenching, and with enough cliffhangers to make you feel like you're a mountain climber. 

The art is phenomenal and the sound design is great. More importantly, the direction was on point from beginning to end. All of this culminated in a great viewing experience that kept me on the edge of my seat through all 12 weeks of the season. The chess-like mind games and one-up-manship from both sides made it interesting to watch and made you want to know see what the other sides plan was every time something happened. 

The characters from nearly top to bottom are fleshed out and have their own individual quirks. The three main characters, Emma, Ray, and Norman all brings something different and unique to the table and really feed off of each other when it comes to conversations and planning. This trio makes for an interesting dynamic, especially during times where trust is at an all-time low among everyone. Even when each character holds their own personal beliefs you never once feel like a person's feelings are unwarranted. Each character brings up strong points as to why they are right and that is a good indication as to why this series is so good. I'm no manga reader and for me, I think I might just stick to being an anime only for now. The twists and turns give me life when I have to wait to see what happens next. 

With a series like this there are so many ways that things can go wrong quickly. One slip up, one continuity error and a lot of that suspense can go down the drain. That is just a testament as to why this show is so good. A plan is always in motion whether the view can see is happening or not and that is what gives this show its charm. The writing always has to be on point or else things fall apart.

The last episode gave a me a very satisfied feeling that also left me wanting to know what comes next for our band of mischief kids and it makes me excited to see what comes after. The last episode gave some insightful character development to a character that I won't name to avoid spoilers but it was very much needed and changed my view on that character entirely. This last episode just felt like I had been sitting holding my breath for the past 12 weeks and only now I can breath easily. It's not very often that I feel that way about a show and it leaves me happy.

With all of that said, I look forward to next season and what the future holds for our group of precocious kids."
110277,"Attack on Titan is a modern masterpiece. It’s not just a piece of fiction which has thrown quality season after season, it’s also one of the very few anime to have broken into the mainstream, so much so that people who do not watch anime at all have experienced and loved it. The emergence of the first season of Attack on Titan drove the series’ popularity to levels rarely seen before in the medium. The long wait before the release of season 2 was a major reason (along with certain pacing issues with the manga at the time) for the dying interest in the series at the time. By the time S2 aired, Attack on Titan wasn’t the global phenomenon anymore. One Punch Man had broken the mold in a similar vein to AoT S1 and become the new big anime amongst casuals and non anime watchers.

Then came Season 3, and the series was roaring back. The interest in the series had never been higher, and fans flocked back in droves to have their questions answered. Many began viewing the first two seasons in new light once the revelations showcased the intricate planning and immense foreshadowing that had gone under their noses when they’d watched it first. For me, Attack on Titan was always great. Never has an anime made me feel so hopeless if I viewed the world from the perspective of the characters. The absolute mystery surrounding the titans for most of the first season along with stunning animation for fights, memorable OST for almost any scene and emotional dialogue delivered by passionate voice actors made for an unforgettable experience. Season 2 and 3 bring in more revelations, slowly unfolding the mysteries of the world and the titans and shifting the themes of the series. Season 4 has another tonal shift - much greater than previous ones - and it handles it with aplomb.

img()

A change in studios has often led anime series to ruin. The aforementioned OPM was one of the recent big victims of it, but other popular series like Seven Deadly Sins have also suffered due to it and never recovered.

Fortunately, MAPPA have handled the transition well. They haven’t been perfect (more on that later), but all in all, they’ve done a good job producing a new season of what is probably the most popular anime of the last decade.

The start of S4 might have left some people wondering where the original cast went. There’s not just a change of cast in the first few episodes, but also a switch in perspectives. We’re no longer seeing things from the side of Paradis and the Scouts. Instead, we now see it from the view of Marley’s warriors, who’re training to inherit the titans from their predecessors once their time runs out. Gabi and Falco want to inherit the armor but Reiner, i.e. the plot armored titan (Sorry, had to use this once I saw it on Reddit) can’t catch a break. Someone, grant him his wish to die.

Eren’s growth as a character is one of the highlights of Attack on Titan as a series. He wasn’t always a fan favorite because of his hotheaded nature, but as time went on, his perspective of the things around him changed, most noticeably multiple times throughout season 3. Come season 4, his character undergoes a paradigm shift; calm and sympathetic, yet ruthless. As his famous quote goes, “I won’t stop moving forward until all my enemies are destroyed.” He’s a lot more distant, not just to everyone else in the show but also to the viewers. Unlike previous seasons, his thoughts are a mystery and the season clearly displays the divide between him and the other old Scouts. 

img()

The handling of his growth as a person and a titan shifter is outstanding, firstly in the manga and then in the anime. Yuki Kaji, the voice actor, supported this exponential growth by exceeding expectations on character delivery. I especially love how well he’s transitioned seamlessly along with Eren as a character and nailed almost every line. There’s hardly a line Eren has spoken in season 4 that isn’t extremely significant to the story.

Oh Gabi! Where do I even begin? She’s supposed to be the female parallel to pre timeskip Eren, but apart from some core traits like being stubborn, she isn’t really that similar to him. Gabi hates the Eldians from Paradis for no other reason other than that she thinks they’re devils and should suffer for the crimes of their ancestors. Eren was stubborn, headed into almost unwinnable battles without a second thought. However, his reasons to hate the titans were justified. His mother was eaten in front of him by a titan, his home destroyed and tens upon hundreds of his comrades butchered by titans in cold blood. He fought for his freedom, and humanity’s. 

Gabi, on the other hand, hates Eldians without having seen any of them. She kills people for glory, just for some useless praise. And without spoiling anything, I’ll also add that she’s a hypocrite with her iconic line that’s become prevalent in memes now “But did you see it happen?”.

img()

In her defence, she’s a twelve-year-old girl who’s been brainwashed so it’s hard to not give her some benefit of the doubt. But boy, is she annoying! She’s actually portrayed a lot better at the start of the Marley arc in the anime than in the manga, so I didn’t dislike her as much. She’s neither a bad character nor a great one, but she serves her purpose.

Onto Falco, then. My cute, lovable boy, are you sure you had the same upbringing as Gabi? He’s her polar opposite, able to empathize with his enemies and an antithesis for every one of Gabi’s morals. He views things from a wider angle, often showing maturity way beyond his years. He might not be as naturally gifted as Gabi but he’s a whole lot more likeable. From posting letters for injured people to helping his enemies who shun him instead, this good boy has it all covered. He’s one of the beautiful things in this cruel world.

Pieck is the new waifu that every fan seems to be simping over; Reiner and Zeke share the title of best character amongst the Marleyans for me. Their internal struggles and motives, some of which are only seen by viewers, make a significant contrast to their outer persona, and this holds especially true for Zeke. 

Jean remains the character who makes the viewers question their morals because he questions his own and that’s what I love about him. He’s another one who’s come a long way since the cadet days.

Did you think I’d have forgotten Floch? He might’ve been a forgettable side character who didn’t even have a distinct design before S3 P2 (Isayama has himself admitted as much), but he’s one of the stars of season 4, running the show like the chad that he is. He’s an extremist and his actions are brutal; at times, it seems as if he’s doing it to sate his own ego and hate towards those who’ve imprisoned him and his race behind the walls. But despite all this, he’s one of the most entertaining characters post time skip. He’s unpredictable, spunky and has the audacity to pull off stunts that might’ve had your jaws slacking on the floor more times than one. And who can forget the “shh?” King Floch has unquestionably engraved his name as an Attack on Titan legend. 

img()

There are so many excellent characters in Attack on Titan that the review would be too long if I talked about all of them, so I’ll stop here. 

The character designs in Season 4 see a distinct change, and that’s not all to do with the timeskip or the change in the studio. It’s a mixture of both. To anyone who’s read the earlier chapters of the Attack on Titan manga, it’s no secret that the art at the start was mediocre. Wit Studio did a great job of enhancing the character designs and the art in general, especially in S1.

MAPPA on the other hand have stuck closer to the manga art style for characters (apart from beautifying Armin as compared to the manga, their reasons for which I’d like to know). So there’s a slight change in the art style because they’re following Isayama’s art a lot more closely.



The animation of S4 has been the most talked about point, and for good reason. I’ll mince no words: some of the CGI was downright terrible. There was some genuinely impressive CGI like the Jaw titan, but some very important scenes involving the Attack Titan and Beast Titan were horrendous. It’s not the animators who’re to blame for this but the greed of the production committee and the manga publishers who wanted to have S4 airing before the end of the manga to boost sales.

>An ODM animation from Season 3:

For almost any other anime, I would’ve let even the terrible CGI scenes slide, but this is Attack on Titan, one of the most popular and highly acclaimed anime ever, and surely it deserved the best treatment possible. Unfortunately, it didn’t get that. Does it make the season bad? Of course not since the season covers one of the best arcs in the manga and the adaptation itself was faithful with top tier voice acting. Could better animation elevate S4 of Attack on Titan to higher levels? Greatly.

My biggest problem with the titan CGI was that it just broke immersion. One moment we had fluid 2D animation, the other we had some janky CGI lacking weight, which made me pause and check if I was still watching Attack on Titan. I’ve re-watched these scenes multiple times and every time, I came to the same conclusion: Attack on Titan deserves better. Remember the marvelous scenes with ODM gear we got in the first three seasons or the titan fights or Levi vs the Beast Titan? Unfortunately, we don’t get that level of animation in season 4, and while understandable given the time constraints, it’s disappointing nevertheless.

The CGI wasn’t always as bad, but had enough prevalence in the most important moments (Eg: Attack Titan vs Warhammer Titan) to be a stain on an otherwise stellar season.
 
 
We have some new and honestly breathtaking tracks added to the already great OST from S1 - S3. One of the highlights in the sound composition this season is that there were different composers depending on whose perspective a scene is shown from. For Paradis, we have Hiroyuki Sawano back with all our favorites from previous seasons while Kohta Yamomoto handled the Marleyan side, giving us bangers including Ashes on the Fire. I missed the old OST in the first few episodes because I was worried they’d underuse S1-S3 OST, but they did not. It wasn’t used much because the initial episodes take place from the perspective of the Marleyans. Honestly, having different composers for either side of the conflict seems like a superb choice and helps immersion. 

The only real criticism I have about the sound was the OST choice in some scenes in the latter part of the season. And no, I’m not talking about the basement scene here. I thought the basement scene OST choice was great.

Similar to the OST, it took a while for me to warm up to the OP, but looking back now, it’s great and suits the themes of S4. This was a common opinion amongst the community; the majority seemed to have disliked My War for the first couple episodes, then it just grew on people and now it sets the tone for the rest of the episode.

Now that Attack on Titan’s final season (Part 1) has ended, it’ll be intriguing to see what route MAPPA takes for the rest of the adaptation. There’s anywhere between 13-16 episodes of content left to cover, depending on the pacing. Will the production committee see Attack on Titan as a chance to make hundreds of millions of dollars in a movie format or will we have Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 (lol), only time will tell. I’m not against either, as long as they take enough time and pour passion into making it. I don’t mind waiting longer if it means getting the best production values. Hopefully, that’s the case."
20755,"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, AKA Assassination Classroom, has the sort of fun and silly premise that anime tends to become known for. It features on a classroom full of academically backwards students who are trying to kill their teacher--who is also a yellow smiley face with the body of a tentacle monster--before he destroys the earth at the end of the year. He can do it, too. He's already proved that by blowing a hole in the moon.

Assassination Classroom certainly has some fun moments, mostly related to Koro-sensei's personality and how his body functions. But these moments tend to get repetitive fairly quickly, and the flaws of the series threaten to outweigh them. The rest of the cast is fairly lackluster. This is likely a side effect of its Too-Many-Characters Syndrome. There is an entire classroom worth of students, all of them introduced in the OP, but only one or two are memorable. I can think of four off the top of my head: Nagisa, Karma, Ritsu, and that one dude who has something close to a character arc but not a good enough one that I can actually remember his name. The rest are just a blur of faces and names that have pretty much no real relevance.

What's more, the story doesn't often go anywhere. It is, as most shounen, deliberately drawn out so that the franchise can be milked for all it's worth. The result is that the plot largely becomes filler. Over the course of twenty-two episodes, we spend a bit of time learning how Koro-sensei functions and what his strengths and weaknesses are. The rest of the show is filled with Koro-sensei doing teacher things and the class combating other villains. These diversions would almost be welcome were they not a distraction from the real story. Sure, it's good that we're getting character development for these professors and students, but there are more pressing concerns. Namely, ""why would such a cheerful creature threaten to destroy the Earth?"" and ""why does this creature want to teach a high school class?"" I can ignore that the moon getting a big hole blown through it doesn't mess with gravity or tides. I can ignore that Koro-sensei can fly at mach 20 and is basically a giant emoji. But I can't ignore that the entire premise of the series is built on unanswered questions. The longer it continues, the more it seems like it's simply an excuse to create this specific situation. But instead of addressing these questions, we get a vague comment about Koro-sensei being a man-made biological weapon, then shrug off any other answers in favor of adding new villains so that we don't have to kill of Koro-sensei until sales start declining.

Assassination Classroom is a funny joke that drags on for about 15 episodes too long. Sure, the concept is fun, but a concept can't carry a show. There are too many characters for them to get fleshed out and the plot refuses to progress. What we're left with is a series with glaring questions that only become more frustrating the longer they go unanswered. And the worst part is that the show gives no indication that they're considering addressing them anywhere in the near future. Three stars."
21507,"A wonderful show about a boy with no confidence in himself, and no idea how he should live his life. Completely listless, he simply does what other people around him want him to do in the hopes that he’ll find acceptance. Afraid of his powers, he’s been forced to live repressed, unable to talk about who he really is. Needless to say, plenty of people can see themselves in Mob, myself included. This show really hones in on just about every anxiety one had back at that age. Trying to live up to others expectations while also figuring out who you are.

The central idea of the show is that when Mob gets stressed out and pushed past his limit, he expresses himself the only way he really knows how: with rage. Its again, something I can relate to. When you spend most of your time hiding your emotions, rage is the only thing strong enough that can build and build up until you simply can’t control it anymore. Often hurting those around you, even when they’re people you love. After which comes immediate shame and the desire to simply be another person. 

Mob has two main guides in life. The first is his “master”, Reigen. A con man that has convinced Mob that he’s a psychic like him and can help him control his powers. Despite being a con man, his cons are somewhat innocuous as he truly wants to help people, Mob in particular. While his words may be empty, to others, they carry the weight they need. He gives genuinely good advice and wants the absolute best for Mob.

The other guide is the Body Improvement Club. A club that Mob joined more or less on a whim in an attempt to make himself more attractive. Despite the superficial reasons, and his frail body, the club welcomes him with open arms and are constantly supportive of him, never once judging him or making fun of him. It seems very intentional to me that Reigen and the Body Improvement Club are not psychics like Mob at all, yet they’re his biggest supporters. The show repeatedly stresses that even though Mob is unfathomably strong, he’s not any better than anyone else. He is, ultimately, an average joe. Why shouldn’t he get support from people that don’t share his narrow specialty? 

To me, it seemed to be saying that even though we all have different stuff we’re good at, we’re all ultimately in the same boat. Just trying to live, and no one can make it alone. We all need help from others. Even Mob, as strong as he is, needs support, even from “normal” people. 

Mob and his brother present such a great dynamic. Both are jealous of what the other doesn't have and think things would simply be better if they could adopt these traits. Mob doesn't care that Ritsu can't use psychic powers. However, these feelings of essentially unconditional love were warped into feelings of inadequacy. Mob doesn't value psychic powers because its mundane to him. But to Ritsu, it's everything. This sort of thing is a repeated occurrence throughout the show. Mob is always kind to everyone, to fault even. However even when one has the most genuinely kind intentions, it sometimes can just backfire. It's what makes socializing and interacting with people so difficult.

The show's answer to this is rather simple, and delivered via the Body Improvement Club. To fight on, to keep trying. No matter how much you fail, get back up and go at it again. It's rough, no one will say it isn't. but it's all we normal humans can do."

[Season 2](https://anilist.co/review/13277 ) 
(SPOILER WARNING FOR HUNTER X HUNTER, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, AND NARUTO + SHIPPUDEN)

Season 3 is bad. It is the point where you finally realize that all the potential the earlier seasons flashed was no more than just that: unrealized potential. And all the problems with the writing weren’t blips, they become a constant problem that deflates the tension and drama in every arc.

Every time Deku we’re told Deku is risking his body only for him to be fine after a day in the hospital, every time a villain is hyped up only for them to lose while barely accomplishing anything, every time stakes are established and then retreated from immediately. It all starts to add up.


Now, one thing that’s important to note is that the decline of the MHA anime is not entirely due to Horikoshi’s writing. A fair amount of blame should be attributed to Studio Bones, as well. I complimented the show based on how there was a lot more effort than I remember in season 1, and the reason I was surprised by that is because of how low the quality of visuals is in seasons 3 and 4.

MHA’s visuals in general have never been that sharp (especially in terms of backgrounds), but season 1 did a good job of covering for that by being loose and creative with the visuals.

That is no longer the case. The visuals are flat and the tone is overly stiff. Which uh, is a lot less fun to watch. And if you’re not enjoying what you’re watching, you tend to be less engaged. And when you’re not engaged by what’s in the foreground, you start to zone out and look at the backgrounds out of boredom.

img()
img()

At which point, you start to notice how cheap-looking and shoddily thrown together the backgrounds in this show look. You’ll notice the same tree copy and pasted over and over again, stale coloring, buildings with no style or personality put into how they’re drawn, and sometimes you can’t even tell what you’re even looking at:

img()

This is supposed to be an establishing shot of the city. What the hell is this? Looks like a bunch of digital garbage.

img()

What the hell are those things in the background even supposed to be?


The first two arcs of season 3 are the forest training camp arc and class raid arcs, and they are both very bad. So bad that season 3 (and really, the whole series) never recovers from it. What you realize while watching these arcs that all the bad aspects of Horikoshi’s writing thus far aren’t going to go away: the problem has actually gotten much worse and is deflating any potential drama and tension for new arcs.

The Forest Training Camp arc isn’t as bad as the Class Raid arc, but…it’s still bad and starts season 3 off on a very bad note. Most of why I dislike this arc is the emergence of Horikoshi’s writing becoming…lazy. The problems that pop up in the Class Raid arc are recurring issues that have spun out of control, but The Forest Training Camp arc started to make me question if he even had a plan for where the story is going.

Here’s a brief summary:

Students go on a class trip to train. Deku meets Kota, a kid who lost his parents and hates heroes as a result. Villains attack, Pixie Bob is injured, Deku fights muscle guy and beats him, Bakugo gets kidnapped, arc end.

There’s a lot of dumb shit all over the place here, but let’s start with the villain’s reason for the raid:

img()
img()

What the fuck does that mean? Something I’ve noticed while re-watching is with the villains, you kind of have to ignore what they say at times to make the writing coherent. Like with Stain when he says that money and fame worshippers are ruining hero society, despite there being sort of 1 example of each that fit that description even existing. What he does in the alley though, points to a more coherent ideology.

img()
img()

Iida ignored an injured hero because he was too busy trying to get revenge on Stain for his brother. That selfishness and inability to control his emotions is bad and holds Iida back. You gave me an example of something Stain opposes directly and showed me rather than told me, excellent.

Then you have this shit. I don’t know what the fuck “make them see that their peace is resting in our hands"" means. That’s confusing, vague nonsense. Later on, they explain that they want to kidnap Bakugo and try to show him that there are options other than being a hero. So why not just say that to begin with? You want to kidnap students to convert them to your cause. It conveys your motivations better than whatever the hell “make them see that their peace is resting in our hands” is.

Anyways. Most of the villain attack is standard MHA stuff. Villains attack, have mixed results, students counterattack. Blah blah blah.  The real garbage starts here, with Pixie Bob getting hurt:

img()

This is lazy, last minute garbage. Last-minute characterization is something I really don’t care much for, but this is pathetic. This is literally just Horikoshi saying “Hey I know you barely got to know this character, but you should feel something because I’m abruptly telling you she’s getting married”. There’s no emotional anything here. I don’t know how important marriage is to her, I don’t know who she’s getting married to, I don’t know anything about this woman! If this plot line had been developed ahead of time (aka Horikoshi had scenes where we saw her doting over her fiancé, or just scenes of the 2 together in general), then there would be grounds to put this line here. Because then, the show would have actually earned it. But you can’t do it like this. This is lazy. We’ll get back to this problem in part 4, as it (like the other parts of Horikoshi’s writing) snowballs out of control.

And then we get to the big fight from this arc, Deku vs muscle guy. I don’t care what his name is. His design is bad, he’s badly written, his only notable feature is how muscley he is. He’s muscley guy.

img()
muscle guy

Before getting to the fight, we need to talk about Kota.

img()

Kota is this little dipshit. His parents are heroes that were killed in the line of duty, and he now he hates heroes. Which is whatever. Generic backstory, depends on what you do with it. Its fine by itself. But what I dislike about this is Deku’s reasons for wanting to help him. The show treats Kota as though his opinion about heroes is…wrong. Something that needs to be corrected. This is an annoying part of the way MHA is written, and is yet another problem that spirals out of control in seasons 3 and 4. On its own it isn’t a big deal. But when you take into consideration the fact that Horikoshi very clearly wants to write villains who represent problems with society, but at the same time is unwilling to write flawed superheroes or hold accountable UA or his society’s heroes, and also seems to treat all criticism of the heroes as wrong…like which is it? You can’t have both, they clash with each other.

So obviously, this muscley guy is not a very good villain. Kota’s backstory with his parents was already pretty token, but did you really have to make muscley guy the same guy that killed his parents? That’s like the lamest twist ever. Then you have the fight itself. Which is…whatever. There’s some neat animation here I guess, but overall I don’t really care. The villain is bad, the drama is bad, and there aren’t really any stakes with Deku injuring his body because I know after the arc is over, he’ll sit in a hospital bed for a bit and then be fine. Speaking of...

Before we get to the episodes after the forest training camp arc, I'd like to highlight one thing Deku says during this fight:

img()
img()

Remember this quote. I'll refer back to it a lot going forward.


The episodes between the end of the Forest training camp arc and the class raid are important, in that they highlight the one problem with MHA that it has proven unable to escape from:

Horikoshi is deathly afraid of taking risks. His writing is among the stalest and safest in a popular shounen I’ve ever seen. He’s overly attached to his characters, he never provides long-lasting consequences for the actions of his characters, and he seems terrified of moving a single piece out of place.

There are 2 categories of this I’d like to highlight here:

UA

The first problem area when it comes to fakes stakes is this ongoing storyline with the media's criticism of UA and their failures to protect their students. Or rather, it’s just Horikoshi pretending there will be consequences for the students getting into trouble for both UA and the students, but then immediately retreating from it because actual consequences would be hard to write. Anyways, we're gonna establish the details of this subplot that are important, and I'll explain why this part of the story is a problem in a bit.

In season 1, the media manages to sneak onto school grounds after Shigaraki blows up the wall. This one isn't as notable as the others, but I just wanted to point it out because in this instance, UA couldn't even keep reporters off their school grounds. Maybe a wall and sensor isn't a great security system in a world where nearly everyone has superpowers, yeah? You think maybe someone might try to just jump over the wall or blow it up?

img()

Anyways, then you have the villains that attack students at the end of season 1. Also does not reflect well on the school, and they receive criticism for it. This looks even worse when you consider the people that got in were proven to be morons. That's basically the subplot. The media goes after UA for letting the students fall into danger, and that's uh. That's it. As for the students:

In episode 31, the police guy tells Deku and friends that they and the other heroes are going to receive strict punishment...and then they don't do that at all. Not a huge deal they don't follow through here. But next time they get into trouble, there needs to be actual punishment for the students or UA. This could just be to establish stakes for the future. All you gotta do is follow through next time.
There you go, that's how all that...stuff is setup. The important part of this plotline is that somewhere along the line, the show has to be able to establish real consequences for UA for not protecting its students, and for the students of class A for getting into trouble. And...we'll get to that in a minute.

Deku Destroying His Body

Another recurring problem is Deku's body. The threat of Deku damaging his body so badly he can't be a hero anymore is established pretty early. It’s a good way of keeping One for All from feeling overpowered, and a constant source of drama during Deku's fights. At least, it would be. If Horikoshi was willing to actually commit to it.

img()

Knowing that Deku could permanently damage his body so badly he could never walk again is an interesting subplot, but it can't be if every time he risks his body, he stays in the hospital for a day and then he's fine again. This is, again, something that isn't a struggle for other popular battle shounens:

We're back to Naruto and Hunter x Hunter again.

In Naruto, when Rock Lee uses his Hidden Lotus ability, it has very similar risks to Deku's ability, with Lee's being a bit more extreme the further he goes with it.

Anyways, when we see Deku and Rock Lee overuse their ability to try to win, we do see them exhausted, crippled, etc. But it’s what the writers do after the fight ends that separate the two.

Rock Lee's body is torn up really badly after his fight with Gaara, and they tell Guy that it's likely he'll never fight again. But then, they follow through on that. He is absent from combat for the next 76 episodes, but it is a source of ongoing drama as we see his recovery process and struggle to come to terms with the possibly giving up his entire way of life. And then, several arcs later, when he pops out to fight Kimimaro, you get a huge adrenaline rush. This happens for 3 reasons: one, Rock Lee was gone for so long. Two, the last time we saw him he was in the most entertaining fight of the show thus far. And most importantly three, we saw his recovery process and knew how hard it was for him. So when he jumps out here, we know that his recovery is complete, he's back as a ninja, and we finally get to see him fight again. Great moment, and a great example of establishing stakes for a fight and actually sticking with them.

img()

In Hunter x Hunter, Gon loses control of his emotions after he finds out Kite is dead. His anger leads him to use ""everything"" to kill Pitou. But since Gon is nowhere near strong enough to even fight Pitou, he has to sacrifice...well, everything. Based on what we know about nen and the way it works, seeing him suddenly obtain this much power means the amount he sacrificed is so great he will probably die.

Okay, so our main character has taken on a colossal risk and the stakes are his sacrifice took a massive toll on his body, and he could die. How do we follow up on this?

img()
img()
img()

This is what it looks like to create stakes and stick with them. Gon nearly dies, and Killua has to go through tons of hoops to save him. And while yes, Gon does recover. He is completely absent from the manga for the following arcs. No, really. The protagonist is out of the story for several major story arcs. He can't use nen because of what he did to beat Pitou. Kurapika is the main character during the prince succession arc, which is the current arc. Togashi was willing to take that risk to make it clear that when he declares stakes, no matter how great, he will follow through. As a result, when they say something like ""we could die”, I believe it regardless of who its referring to.

And yet with Deku, we are told time and time again that he is risking his body by being reckless, and every single time he goes to the hospital, the nurse heals him, and he's fine again. There are no stakes here. Deku has the strongest plot armor on I've ever seen.

img()
img()

This isn't even that hard to fix either. Here's how you do it:

Have the nurse heal him a couple times, then have the villains kill her; cutting Deku off from having an insta-heal every time he's reckless with his body. He will then be forced to actually deal with the damage he's doing to his body, and for the first time in the series actually following through with the stakes it established. It would also ground Deku, preventing him from just doing whatever he wants with no consequences.

But killing the nurse lady would be a risky choice to make, and we can't have that!

Or alternatively, stop reminding us of this plot point if you refuse to do anything with it. If you're gonna keep saying he's risking his body, then show the stakes! Have him damage his body so badly that he's absent for an arc. Naruto did it with Rock Lee. And Hunter x Hunter is doing it with Gon right now. The other guys don't seem to have a problem with it, and if MHA is as great as people say it is, it shouldn't either.


Now. The reason I brought up all of that now is because the episodes between the Forest Training Camp arc and the Class Raid arc are so fucking stupid, and it's because of the issues with the writing I just talked about. Deku suffers colossal damage to his body. He is up and walking immediately after. The heroes say that they're going to keep a closer eye on the students, and LITERALLY THE FUCKING NIGHT AFTER THEY SAY THIS, THEY LET THE STUDENTS SNEAK OUT. You even have the stupid fucking press conference the teachers put on, acknowledging all the criticism UA has rightfully gotten for putting its students in danger.

AND AS THEY ARE SAYING THIS, NO ONE IS WATCHING THE INJURED STUDENTS AT ALL, SO THEY ALL SNEAK OUT.

img()
img()

Remember this? Do you remember this fucking line? This is My Hero Academy summarized in a single fucking line. Say you're gonna do one thing, and never follow through. It constantly contradicts the message of its own main theme because of its incompetent and lazy writing.

""Yes, we're taking the criticism seriously and are making changes"" as they are letting the students sneak out because no one bothered to keep an eye on them. Deku is threatened with losing his arms, and yet THE LITERAL DAY AFTER THE ATTACK, he sneaks out with the other students to go get Bakugo back! Ridiculous.

And Iida understandably objects to this stupid ass plan, but since Horikoshi refuses to take a risk like slowing down for a bit to enforce the stakes he just established, Iida backs down and goes with them. 

This was the point where I could no longer deny the truth: My Hero Academy is a big piece of shit. Horikoshi is unable to establish any drama or stakes or tension due to his overly safe and lazy writing, and Studio Bones' effort in its production has gone down significantly.

It had another chance, though. It had one last chance to fix its villain problem. This could have done a lot to ease my growing irritation with the series. But again, it blew it.


So, a growing issue I have had with MHA is the villains. Like yes, they're bad. If we're keeping track of only the ones we've seen so far, Shigaraki is an idiot (allegedly on purpose) and Stain doesn't accomplish much on-screen. That's in terms of writing though. Another big problem I have is that they never kill anyone.

You see, when you have a problem with weak villains like MHA does, a great way to establish a new villain as a threat would be to show them killing a hero we know on screen. Not in the past, not telling us they kill people; actually showing them kill someone. This ties into my problem of Horikoshi being overly attached to his characters and not wanting to make sacrifices or take risks with them. Because there are tons of expendable ones.

Anyways, the reason I bring this up now is because the class raid arc is where we are introduced to All for One, the Ying to All Might's Yang and supposedly the strongest villain there is. He has dozens of quirks stored away. He can use multiple quirks at once. This guy is a FORCE. So naturally, I'm expecting him to have a big impact in his first appearance. After all, All for One is THE GUY. Finally, a competent villain! This is gonna be great!

img()
...Oh.

img()
Oh…

All for One is disappointing for a number of reasons, but really All for One being disappointing is a backbreaker itself. He NEEDED to succeed, and needed to make an impression on the audience.

The villains up to this point have been a joke. They also kinda just…always lose. Not every villain can just inflict ""psychological"" damage to the heroes or whatever. It’s the battle shounen equivalent of a moral victory. That's what Shiggy did in season 1. His raid was a laughable failure that got him ridiculed by the students and All Might. Stain loses without killing anyone in season 2. Dude's name is literally ""Stain the Hero Killer"" yet we see him kill no one and then he gets arrested. Eventually, a villain needs to actually win. Succeed at their goal, outsmart the heroes, kill someone. Just something, so I can believe for once that there’s some competency to these dumbass villains.

The most dangerous villain in the show has to establish themselves as a threat somehow when they show up. They can't just not kill anyone and get owned. Why? Because it makes them look incompetent, and that has a trickle-down effect on the other villains. You REALLY aren't going to take the other villains seriously. After all, if the biggest, baddest villain isn't allowed to win; if the heroes all have plot armor that can't be penetrated even now, ...what threat are the lesser villains? I see them as a joke now as a result of All for One's first appearance. His goal here is to kill All Might here. He does make All Might retire, but whatever. He still loses and gets captured. This is another moral victory.

The best way to shock your audience and establish this guy would be to have him cut down a hero. It would be great! Hasn't happened before, so it would shock everyone. Horikoshi even has 3 excellent opportunities to do it.

img()

Obviously the preferred choice would be All Might. Him dying in a fight with All for One is a better way of inflicting fear admist uncertainty among the citizens for future arcs than him just retiring. And it would display vividly the ultimate act of what All Might says is the most important qualification for a hero:

The spirit of self-sacrifice.

It doesn't have to be him, though. Best Jeanist is incredibly expendable. Gran Torino is old and senile. They're so expendable and yet Horikoshi just...can't...let go of them.

You kill Best Jeanist here, and the following fight with All Might suddenly becomes incredible tense. Why? Because when you kill a hero like that, it firmly establishes the stakes as life and death. Something that was kinda not established during the season 1 raid, Stain arc from season 2, and the forest training camp arc. And, it would completely shock the audience, thus raising their investment. And that shit is important for a series like MHA.

An important principle of being a hero in this series (and for…most battle shounens) is that they are fighting for their lives. As such, it’s important to establish that the stakes of fights are well, life and death. This is something I think My Hero Academy is trying to do. 

But without examples of heroes we know LOSING their lives fighting or just generally, it's hard to really say the stakes are that high. We’re told that people could die, but we’re never shown it. Because all the heroes have plot armor. They aren't allowed to die because they're heroes. Why? Horikoshi is unwilling to take risks. And no, heroes that died before the show starts don't count. Heroes we know and that have been established, that we've seen in the series, dying. That's what it is needed here.
This is, again, something writers of other popular battle shounens understand. Let’s knock these down quick, I don’t need a paragraph to explain each:

Hunter x Hunter:

img()
Everyone Hisoka kills during the Hunter exams: establishes Hisoka as a serious threat and that the Hunter exam is very much life or death, which is very much true.

img()
Ponzu and Pokkle: displays how ruthless and cruel the chimera ants can be.

img()
Kite: juxtaposed with how Kite wiped out an entire squadron with one swing earlier, establishes how unbelievably strong the Royal Guard are.

img()
Those 2 dudes at the beginning of the Zoldyck arc that get killed by Mike: establishes up front how dangerous the Zoldyck manor is.

Fullmetal Alchemist:

img()
Hughes: this is a message from the Homonculi to the audience and the Elric brothers: if you keep snooping around, we'll kill you.

img()
Basque Grand: makes it clear that Scar can kill any state alchemist if he gets the opportunity and Edward and Alphonse are not safe.

Naruto:

img()
Jiraiya: establishes Pain as a huge threat. He just killed one of the legendary sanin for fuck’s sake.

img()
Gaara mercilessly slaughtering those rain ninja in the forest of death and killing Dosu: establishes deadly stakes for the fight vs Rock Lee and vs Sasuke, respectively.

img()
Orochimaru kills Hirouzen: makes it clear how dangerous he is, and more importantly makes the audience worry about what's going to happen when Sasuke decides to chase after him. ""Oh, shit. that guy killed the hokage. And Sasuke's going to go with him?""

Stuff like this sends a message, and its usually pretty good at scaring the audience if they’re invested. When a villain kills someone, it says “this could happen to one of the protagonists if they aren’t careful”.

img()

Killing a character is an amazing way to establish danger, something that MHA sorely lacks at this point due to how shit the villains are and how safe the writing is. This is especially true here, because it ruins what could be a genuinely great fight. On paper, the way it's set up works. But to once again have no one die and the villain lose despite setting the stakes higher than ever; that just can't happen here.


Now hold on just a minute. Because everything I complained about in the Fake Stakes sections immediately comes back again after the All for One vs All Might fight.

During the first half of episode 50, All Might yells at Deku for destroying his body and sneaking out even though All Might and the other dumbass teachers weren't watching the students, and thus let it happen. Also, Deku is fine after all that. Walking around with some bandages. In the second half of episode 50, Deku's mom takes a stand against All Might and UA for continuously allowing them to endanger her son, and threatens to pull Deku out of UA. This, of course, does not happen. All Might begs and she gives up. (flashback to Iida giving up trying to stop the students from sneaking out?). The show declares stakes in the form of consequences for a student and UA, and this is again retreated from in the same scene.

img()

Despite episode 50 focusing on the fallout from the class raid for UA and the students, including showing several parents of class A students angry with the school, not one of those parents pulls their kid out. So, no consequences of any kind for anyone. The most we get is that UA has a dorm system now. Ugh.

Later in this same episode, Eraser says that he would've expelled almost all of them if not for All Might's retirement. The fuck does All Might's retirement have to do with anything? Just expel them. All Might's retirement is just a lazy excuse to not follow through with stakes you yourself established. Stop being lazy and taking shortcuts with the writing. You keep saying you're going to do one thing, and then you don't because you're scared of the risk. As I recall, that seems to contradict what you said earlier:

img()
img()


And finally, we have the last arc from season 3. Like usual, we start with the stakes:

img()

That’s actually pretty intense! Sure hope they don’t immediately retreat from that after the exam like they always do.

Overall, this arc is…bleh. I think its main problem is that it feels like it goes on forever. And due to the repetitive plot structure, this just feels like the 10,000th exam stage. I don't believe you about the stakes. Deku will be fine no matter what they do. None of this matters. I’m not invested anymore. And of course, the visuals don’t help matters at all.

img()
img()

I think the training camp and Bakugo retrieval arcs were just so bad that the show can't recover now. I am actively irritated with the show now while watching. Also, the tone is incredibly tiresome and stiff now. I miss the loose feel of season 1, where All Might swore in front of Deku and it didn't take itself as seriously as a heart attack. Seeing the number one hero in the world, the symbol of peace, swear in front of a young kid is hilarious. It made me feel like at least part of his hero persona was a front that he put on. As such, he felt a bit more human. I liked that side of him. I don't really like him at all now. He's boring. This exam stage in particular is really fucking boring. They're doing a little with making the people they're supposed to be rescuing assholes, but it isn't enough.

And then there's this guy, who has possibly the funniest backstory ever written.

img()
“Todoroki was mean to me and now I don’t like him” ahahahahaha

Exam Stages/Fake Stakes 3

Oh, and guess what? Just like I said, they waved off the stakes. Those who failed can take a 3 month course to get their provisional licenses anyways. Since this is now a problem I can't ignore, I'll address it here. One of the biggest offenders of fake stakes in this series is the exam stages. Horikoshi has a crippling habit of creating stakes for the students during exams, only to backtrack as quickly as possible once the arc is over. For example:

In episode 5, Aizawa threatened to expel the student that scored the lowest on an entrance exam. This is quickly retreated from the next episode. Not a big deal that they backed away from it here. Just make sure you follow through next time, that way I can believe there's actual stakes to these exams.

In episode 38, the students are threatened with having to go to summer school if they fail.

img()

This is again, retreated from after the arc ends. Now it’s a problem. Because twice now, you have declared there to be stakes via consequences for failing or performing poorly in an exam, and both times you failed to follow through. There will be more examples later. So, why is this bad?

Because 1, I don't believe the show when it tells me there will be consequences when someone fails. Because there never are. Be it the students getting into trouble, UA failing to protect its students, or something as simple as student failing an exam. You always retreat from it afterwards. And because of that, I'm less engaged during exams. After all, there are no stakes because Horikoshi insists on giving plot armor to everyone in class A. And 2, because it’s supposed to be difficult to get through UA, right? They tell us that very early in the show:

img()
(From episode 4)

Like a lot of things the show does, this is telling without showing. The show will tell us it is difficult to get through UA, but it really isn't at all. The school bends over backwards constantly to keep students from failing. This is not really something that should be a struggle for a battle shounen at all, at least if you're a writer that's willing to take risks. Want some examples?

Let’s look at the Hunter exam from Hunter x Hunter and the chuunin exams from Naruto. These are basically the same thing as the exams the characters go through in UA. To become a pro hunter/ninja, you have to pass these exams. Naruto and Hunter x Hunter want you to know that these tests are difficult and making it through is a significant is a huge feat. So how do Kishimoto and Togashi support it?

Uh, by having people fail. A LOT of entrants fail in both the chuunin exams and Hunter exams. And not scrubs, either. One of the main characters fails the first time in Hunter x Hunter, and most of the entrants that you end up spending most of the show with end up failing in Naruto. As for as numbers go:

Most of the characters lose before the finals, including main characters.  Killua fails in Hunter x Hunter. if you look at insignificant characters, all but 7 failed the hunter exam. 400+ examinees failed. In the chuunin exams, hundreds failed as well. There were only 5 genin remaining when the Konoha Crush interrupts the exams. (Failing is a bit different in Naruto. You can lose in the finals and still become a chuunin). Why does this matter?

img()
Killua fails the Hunter exam

Because part of the point of having these exams in the first place is to make it clear how difficult it is to become a shinobi/hunter. People need to fail out so 1, the threat of characters failing is established. 2, to establish stakes. And 3, establish the extreme level of difficulty to accomplish the goal, for the purposes of making the task seem daunting (which will be a constant source of drama), and to make those that have accomplished it (in this case the pro heroes) worthy of respect for having reached it.

Hunter x Hunter and Naruto wanted their exam stages to seem difficult and intense, so they supported it by being willing to have characters fail. It’s really that simple. Kishimoto and Togashi as writers are willing to take those risks to make their manga better. Horikoshi is not.

Class B

Another example of fake exam stakes that annoys me is how they keep telling us that if class A trips up, students from class B could replace them. This is another good source of drama, and adds even more stakes for the class A students. But like all the other stakes, the show never follows through with it. I really wish they would too, because there are some weak characters in class A I really wish would get cut out. Like the animal guy, and the tail guy, and especially this guy:

He's boring and his power is boring. Get rid of him.

I would love for Horikoshi to take a risk and move one of these boring dorks out for someone like Shinso, but Horikoshi is again too afraid to move even a single character out of place for some reason. So once again, you say this one thing will happen, and then retreat from it afterwards. You never follow through with what you say you’re gonna do, which, again, contradicts this:

Capping off season 3, we have Deku vs Bakugo. And look. I know people think this fight is amazing. And…I mean it could be. If it was organic to the narrative, had stakes, and wasn’t forced into a place in the story it doesn’t belong. The problem I have with this fight is it doesn't represent a moment where past and/or current differences and philosophies collide naturally due to the narrative. The show is pausing its story to have this fight. Deku vs Bakugo is MHA's version of Naruto vs Sasuke. But with Naruto vs Sasuke, it was very much the right time for that fight, and there were real stakes. Sasuke wants to go off and join Orochimaru to gain power, but Naruto knows and we as an audience know that Orochimaru only wants to use Sasuke as a vessel to switch bodies. And while you might think Sasuke can handle himself, …we watched Orochimaru kill a hokage earlier. (One of the benefits of killing off characters btw). So we know he is a serious threat to kill Sasuke. That's the kind of stakes and emotional drama you need for a fight between main characters. Which is what I think this fight lacks.

Granted, there isn't really a rule to how you write a fight like this. And I'm not really advocating for it to just do what Naruto did. It isn't a bad fight. I just think you need a little more here. Something to be lost for Deku when he's defeated. And have it be written more organically into the story, rather than shoving it awkwardly between arcs.


We end season 3 with episode 62. The first half of it is looking into the idea of how All Might’s retirement is affecting normal citizens. This is, of course, a very good idea. The show hasn’t really put any effort into humanizing the citizens so we gave a shit when villains attack and put their lives in danger. It also is the start of the idea that Endeavor doesn’t really work as an All Might replacement. He lacks the charisma and people just don’t react to him the same way. It’s…interesting. And they follow up on it later. Uh, good stuff.

The second half is more fake stakes for Deku’s body and consequences after his fight with Bakugo. Deku is fine, again. Deku and Bakugo broke curfew, destroyed a bunch of shit, fought, and their only punishment is they have to clean more. Really? After sneaking out during the class raid? Have the teachers at UA learned absolutely nothing this entire time?

Big three arrives, season over.

[Two Heroes](https://anilist.co/review/13322)"
21234,"[Disclaimer: The arguments I've made for story structure and such I'd probably still stand by. However, events of the plot I didn't judge necessary to address when I first wrote this review I can't say if I'd defend now. I made the choice to let the review as it stands and make no further edits.]

I was originally not planning in writing anything in regards to this anime in specific, as I thought I had nothing interesting to say about the title. However, after reading the analysis by Zephsilver, I managed to put together some thoughts in regards to Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (or Erased, if you are not fond of tongue-twisters) that I’d like to offer in addition to the debate. I also would like to say: Zeph, I appreciate and respect your text, since it had a rational depiction of your perspective that I could reasonably grasp, but I’d like to politely disagree.

Before getting into the review, though, I want to give some context: before the beginning of the winter season I had read the synopsis of Erased and added to my Plan to Watch list, as it seemed mildly interesting. Later, after watching the first two episodes, I was hooked by the premise and highly invested in what could be the outcome of the story. Only then that I got to know about the hype surrounding the series and from that point I witnessed the internet go insane over its score.

Story and Characters

My reviewing method for this one will be somewhat different from the norm. By the time I’m writing this, the series itself is still surrounded by controversy with two sides with very questionable motivations either raising it as the best thing since Page 3 or clamming it’s an overrated abomination pandering to masses who want to think of themselves as smart (doesn’t that apply to 99% of humanity?). Here, besides commenting of the story and characters within the work, I’ll also discus some of the arguments brought up against Erased and offer my perspective if they are correct in any form or if they hold any water. The first thing I think it’s important to understand is that Erased is, at its core, a very simple story. Besides the time-traveling plot, it has a very streamlined narrative and it is focused almost exclusively on the actions of the main character, in accordance to the fact that he is the “strange element” in the child timeline (suddenly feels like I’m talking about Zelda!). What it avoids in complexity, it opts to use in character interaction, developing the drama and the motivations that move the story forward. Before I get to the meat of the argument, though, let’s talk about some of the characters.

Fujinuma Satoru is the main protagonist. “Gifted” with the ability he calls Revival, he can go back a few minutes in time, whenever something bad is about to happen. Detached and constantly feeling unfulfilled, he holds a strong regret due to events of his childhood, when two of his classmates were murdered and one of his friends was incriminated. These feelings lead him to distance himself from his past, but he is forced by a Revival to go back to the days of his childhood in order to prevent those crimes.

Hinazuki Kayo is the girl who Satoru wants to prevent from becoming the first victim. Frequently abused by her mother, she avoids interacting with her classmates and is usually seen alone. She initially tries to keep a distance from Satoru, not understanding his motives for trying to get close to her, but his friendly demeanor ends up softening her emotional barriers.

Yashiro Gaku is Satoru’s teacher and one of the main agents in the narrative, as he seems interested in solving Kayo’s family situation. Satoru later comments on how Yashiro was an influence to him due to a speech he gave at school, before the story had began, and a specific moment in which Yashiro looked like what Satoru expected his deceased father to be.

Shiratori Jun, mostly known as Courage, is an adult who was friends with Satoru in his childhood. Socially awkward and with a heavy stutter, he feels more comfortable interacting with children, which leads him to be framed for the child-murders Satoru tries to prevent. Besides feeding the motivations of the protagonist, the story also uses him to briefly comment in how his inability to be socially active and preferring the company of children led society to misjudge his intentions, especially when Satoru faces a similar situation in the future.

While the thriller aspect of the anime is in the center of the driving forces of the narrative, the bulk of the emotional investment Erased strives to build is on the bonding between Satoru and the people he is trying to save, and his motivations within the story. Great focus is given to his interactions with his friends, who with the exception of Ken’ya, who seems unusually mature for someone of his age, are all very believable child characters. By that I don’t mean being as obnoxious as an inch-deep testicle wound, by the way, these kids are actually designed to be likeable. This aspect of the story is built upon until the conclusion, where they play a part in finally getting the killer arrested. Having all of this in mind, let’s tackle some of the complaints about the series.

“The time travel element is underdeveloped”

The time travel element is kept simple. Firstly, Satoru’s ability to go back in time is nothing more than a plot device to put him on the track of the murders and since it seems to be simply a supernatural element instead of the usual sci-fi occurring, keeping it simply is a better idea. The story in Erased isn't about time travel, it just features such element as the one necessary for kicking the narrative into motion. Stories that are centered around time travel usually stumble and fall when they decide to flesh out this element without paying proper attention to consistency, which leads to gross plot-holes. Maintaining this element simple and undetailed allows Erased to avoid major inconsistences and focus on the main drive of the story. Also, I know some people were upset by the second instance where Satoru goes back to his child-self as it seemed he had gained control over his ability. To that, I hope you can forgive me stepping out of my polite demeanor for a while to say: For fuck’s sake, that only happened ONCE and it doesn’t even look like he had much control over it! Being it a supernatural ability, and one that seems to have a mind of its own, nonetheless, the event itself isn't so out of place as one might think.

“The identity of the killer is obvious and the reveal is underwhelming”

This complaint is one that fans and detractors of the series seem to agree, although in different levels of importance. I mean, the opening itself tells you who it is. The point of contention here is not whether or not the average viewer can easily guess the killer’s identity, but the purpose that such attribute plays in the story. To some, working under the mindset that Erased’s genre is Mystery; such flaw would represent a sign of incompetent use of red-herrings, as well as inability from the writer to effectively create other suspects. In other words, hack writing. Fans of the series, however, work under the mindset that Erased is, in reality, a Thriller. Such idea is supported by an interview with the director of the anime, where he states:

- “I see this story as a suspense thriller, or well, a human drama in the guise of a suspense thriller”

By that definition, the tension within the story would come not from the mystery over the killer’s identity, which is constantly flashed throughout the story, but from the knowledge the audience has in opposition to the cast, since knowing who is the killer would raise tension whenever he and the main characters were close, and that emotion would then culminate when the villain finally reveals itself for the protagonist. Some of his attitudes could be very ambiguous, like the ones at episode 09, but they ultimately filled the role of driving him closer to Satoru, which would then lead to their connection in the years to come, finally bringing his downfall, as Satoru himself had become the killer’s weakness. But seriously, folks, the opening just flat-out tells you who it is in the very episode the killer is introduced, how do you get to reach episode 10 still thinking it's supposed to be a secret in the first place? 

“Erased becomes an unfocused mess in the latter half”

This is the one argument to which my response is a categorical NO. Before I get into a fair explanation in relation to that statement, though, let give a better example of how to define lack of focus. For that, I’ll actually give the other face and throw under the bus an anime that just so happens to be one of my favorites, Ergo Proxy, because self-awareness is important. The first 8 episodes of the anime are some of the most tightly written episodes in anime, with barely any line of dialogue wasted and plenty of subtle details in character reactions. Right before the first half, though, the main characters go into a journey looking for the truth behind the main mystery of the series, and from that point on Ergo Proxy adopts a highly experimental structure, focusing plenty of episodes in isolated conflicts tied only to the theme it wanted to address in that specific episode (I apologize for the repetition). Very little of those episodes has connection to the main goal, and when the characters reach their destination it turns out to be a dead end, forcing them to return in order to find the truth. For all of that, it’s not unreasonable to say that Ergo Proxy specifically lacks focus on its narrative. From the point Kayo leaves the center of the plot, Satoru’s objectives change, from saving the girl to protecting the other victims and uncovering the identity of the assassin. As a result, the series follows along with such change and turns its eyes to him, in the same fashion as does the danger of attracting the attention of the villain, just like we would see later on, when Satoru’s actions lead him to be the new target. In that sense, the anime simply shifts its focus, it didn’t lose it and that was the natural root to take. That also leads us to another topic;

“Erased lost its charm once Kayo left the picture”

I always found questionable the idea of attributing the entire appeal of a story in a side-character, but that aside, let’s understand this argument: The idea here is that, since the anime spent so much time revolving around Satoru’s efforts to save Kayo, much of the audience’s investment was crafted around the girl, as she would be the one the viewer would immediately want to see shielded from harm. The series does many efforts to frame her in sympathetic light and give her endearing qualities, so when she is moved away from the plot many felt it had wasted their investment. This is a comprehensible thought, indeed, but I believe it ignores another important aspect of fiction: by maintaining focus on a character that has already fulfilled its narrative purpose, the work runs the risk of saturating such character, diminishing the values that made them endearing in the first place and ultimately compromising the story to make room for them. Moving Kayo away from the narrative not only makes sense from a logical point of view, as it completely places her away from the killer, but also preserves her from becoming a hindrance to the story and leaves her character with the emotional baggage that comes at play during the last episodes. There is a merit in avoiding wish-fulfillment if it prevents characters from becoming a problem to the flow of the narrative.


""The ending is rushed and the villain's motivations are poorly explained""

This criticism specifically I can understand on the basis of how the anime progresses in his final episodes, but I’d like to explain the reason for my disagreement by discussing one of the references made by the villain, the spider thread tale. This element is first brought up at the beginning of episode 11, when the antagonist comments that after a specific event during his childhood, he begins to see spider threads hanging above the heads of his victims, in reference to a tale about a criminal who gets the chance to escape from hell using the thread sent by Shakyamuni Bhudda, but is condemned once again when the thread breaks, in punishment for his selfishness. In this tale, the thread was the last source of salvation given by a superior being to a soul in despair, so seeing it above the heads of those he wanted to kill can be interpreted as the antagonist’s desire to be someone above his victims, to be an “entity” with the power to condemn or give salvation. When he is finally defeated by Satoru, he sees a spider thread above his own head be torn apart. This is the point when he realizes that he was powerless and susceptible to being manipulated and judged just like his victims, he realizes he’s not an entity in control. By the same line of thought, he takes an interest in Satoru, after the kid survives his first attempt to kill him, because Satoru was the one able to escape his judgment.

Presentation

I believe many of you heard Erased’s visuals being called “cinematic” and that is actually a statement that holds water, as the anime utilizes some techniques of traditional cinema in much more noticeable fashion, a result of the experience the director had working with other professionals like Hosoda Mamoru or Araki Tetsuro, this last one an expert on making anime with mainstream appeal. Now, another term I believe can be applied to the show’s presentation, in general, is minimalistic. The characters are frequently framed in wide shots within the scenery, with the fixed camera giving full comprehension of the environment while the figures are kept small and with minimal action. The purpose of this directing style is to avoid the viewer getting lost in the imagery and lead them to focus only on the details that are relevant to the narrative. In the other hand, it also serves to emphasize emotional moments and heighten the impact of scenes that display a little bit more of flare, giving them a whimsical feel.

This trait also manifests in the characterization, as the shots stealthily introduce certain details and character motivations, like the hero’s Mask in Satoru’s bedroom, to show a figure that inspired him as a kid, or in the manner in which the killer is framed, from the point he’s fully introduced to the brief interactions that hint to his identity, like when the camera is focused upwards, mirroring Satoru’s perspective. These choices of framing serve to cut on the necessity of exposition, reducing the dialogue only to what is essential. This can also be noticed on the sound work: important scenes, like the moment Satoru makes the first impactful contact with Hinazuki, frequently opt for not having soundtrack, driving even more attention to the dialogue and giving full responsibility to the viewer to infer on what is going on between the characters. For an anime that has been accused of being heavy-handed, I’d say this directorial decision is pretty respectful towards the audience.

The points that feature soundtrack, though, don’t tend to be impressive. Most of the noticeable tracks play their purpose, but are fairly generic, serving only to highlight the specific mood the scene wants to convey. Exceptions would be, of course, the highly catch opening, the fitting and mellow ending, and tracks such as “Only I am missing”, “I have to save her”, which is brief but very effective at crafting tension despite the upbeat vibe, “Reasoning” and “She was there, alone”. Hum, I’m noticing a pattern here! When it comes to the acting, it’s very consistent with character portrayal and overall quite solid, but one aspect that might raise disagreements, more than usual at least, is Satoru’s voice actor. Despite a solid performance, even taking into consideration it’s his first anime role, Shinnosuke Mitsushima is one of those actors who has a voice that is too singular, which can drive attention away from the acting itself.

Personal Ramblings

I think now we can address some of the external questions related to Erased.

Is Erased the best thing since dark beer? No, I can myself point out more than a handful of titles that are better, without taking away from the anime itself. Was it overhyped? Sure! I mean, it’s hard to refute that an anime getting into MAL’s top 10 before it is even finished is quite a ludicrous event. Is the negativity warranted? My stance, at least, is “not really”. I believe it’s fair to ask how much of the negativity towards the series is a direct result of its hype, as some people might think it pressures them into a position. I’ve seen even better shows get attacked with far less meaningful arguments, as a result of public opinion being highly favorable towards them, so the attitude itself doesn’t surprise me. The most interesting question, though, seems to be: how did Erased of all anime become so hyped? Think about the most notorious titles of recent years that can be considered overhyped: Attack on Titan was a shounen with focus in drama and a high body count, with an overall gritty setting and story; Kill la Kill was a self-aware ride of nonsensical action with very little restraint; One Punch Man was a parody of superhero tropes centered around fast-paced action and comedy. To think that a slow-paced thriller like Erased, with such an emphasis in children interacting and very little action, would become the hit of the season is a very surprising event.

I must admit that I somewhat enjoyed the polemic surrounding the anime, not so much for how it affected the show itself in the public eye, but because it rings specially close to one of my personal beliefs: fixation on scores is bullshit! People going crazy over one title’s score seemed ludicrous and drove the discussion away from the important elements by turning it into an exercise in group-think. Now you had to rate the show a certain way so that your opinion could be taken seriously by certain sections of the anime community. Now, however, the fires of the flame wars are on the rout to be tamed, so I thought it would be a good idea to offer my perspective on the anime, hoping that it can invoke some respect around.

Since this is the section of the review I leave (specially) dedicated to self-indulgence, I’d like to talk about specific details about Erased that I really like: I like Satoru’s interactions with his mom as a child, showcasing that he still cared for her, even with the distance between them in his adult self; I like his interactions with his friends, both as a child and as an adult, when we can see the contrast their relationship takes; I like the lack of control Satoru has when talking as a child, showing the disconnect between his body and his mind; I like the meaning the title takes at the end of the series; I like the whimsical moments between Satoru and Hinazuki, which really drove home the meaning of his actions even at short term; I like the childishly awesome lines Satoru’s friends said; I like when he reads the text he had written as child, about his favorite hero; I like it, simple as that.

With this review I don’t aim to change people’s opinions or scores about Erased (although if it leads more people to give the show a try it would be really cool!), I hope simply to showcase how this opinion in specific can be valid, because as minimalistic of a story as it was, it did something for me, and for that I appreciate it."
20665,"There is a reason why almost everyone who's watched this anime loves it.

Since I absolutely SUCK at summarizing anime, here’s the official one:
>Once an accomplished child pianist, musical prodigy Arima Kousei lost his drive to play the piano after a traumatizing event involving his mother at the tender age of eleven. Now a regular middle school student, Arima spends his days with his two best friends Watari and Tsubaki devoid of music. However, his life changes dramatically after meeting Miyazono Kaori, a pretty violinist every bit as brash as the way she plays.

This anime is beautifully, heartbreaking. ‘Your Lie In April’ takes you on an emotional rollercoaster from the very beginning, and doesn’t stop until the moment it ends. Especially when it ends. It’s the type of show that will tear you apart, almost piece you back together, and then just utterly destroy you. But, I couldn’t seem to stop watching. It’s cheerful, but also agonizing, filled with heavy themes and dark backstories that will make you want to break down and cry for these kids. Which, in my case, I did. 

The animation is beyond stunning, consistent, smooth, and able to portray the characters emotions perfectly, and the music, oh sweet baby jesus, the MUSIC. The opening/closing songs, elegant and precise piano playing, and emotionally-appropriate background music were breath-taking and absolutely magnificent. It was some good shit. 

The relationship that the main characters shared was inspirational, loving, almost familial. It was so tight-knit, and you really see throughout the series just how much they depend on one another. 

>“Truth be told, Kousei never says those three little words to Kaori nor does Kaori say them to Kousei's face. But like all of the other musical performances throughout the anime, they didn't have to. Because their music did the talking for them. Emi's passionate pleas resounded from her piano; Aiza's determination to defeat his long-standing rival echoed throughout the stadium; and Kousei's farewell to the mother he's always feared emanated in a way that only a son could play. Therefore it is only fitting that the final performance be not one filled with selfishness, anger, or goodbyes; it's a duet from the heart of the couple that never got to be.”
-Quote by BanjoTheBear on Reddit.

The overall thing that the creators of ‘Your lie in april’ wanted you to take away from the anime was that music can change lives. Sometimes, life can be really hard, too hard to carry on, but you still gotta live it. You got to give it your best, and live with no regrets."
1735,"Naruto Shippuden : Review |


Naruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years.

Let me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times. But please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has been the best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular and also its flaws.


Story - 8


The story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun while being able to take itself seriously when it needs to. It starts off where the first part of Naruto ended and the very first scenes gives us a sneak peak of things to come. The series eases you back into the world of Naruto with a slow paced , almost SOL like first few episodes. And the story then on is presented in a collection of long well constructed story arcs with the bigger picture stories of Sasuke and the Akatsuki being told parallelly till a certain point. Down the line this is series deals with more mature themes and darker tones and manage to execute well on most of those themes if not all. The story is mainly hampered (not ruined) by fillers and pacing issues which I will discuss below.

Let's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole.
The issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plot line at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don’t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself.
However, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is,

Pacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up.

Now that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives.
The main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply.
Another thing that this series does very well is explaining its core concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile and detailed power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out.

The amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming pretentious.

Something that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he has already started setting up major events that happened in the last of episodes of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. Same thing applies to the moments that tug at your heartstrings , they feel genuine because how the story builds up to those moments.

Being a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines.
As I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series.
Variety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these!

The last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer as the villain had almost no personality and motives were shaky at best. Without spoiling anything all I can say is that decisions taken during the last war arc felt like it was done to unnecessarily prolong the final battle and messed it up with a poorly written villain and bad story decisions. But the final episodes after the War arc manages to reign it all in and give a proper farewell to the series it so richly deserves.

Throughout the series you will witness friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, characters growing up, politics, romance, and the world itself change. It can be flawed at times but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning.


Characters - 10


Now this is the core of the franchise.
Each character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out.
No matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths.
You will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships.

Now let's move on to the ""Villains""
This series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes.
Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex [checked] , Money Hungry Villains [checked] , Religious Psychopaths [checked] , Villain who is after Revenge [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the ""heroes."" The morality here is blurred.

But coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it.


Art and Animation - 7.5


Again we have a mixed bag here.
This show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par.
I think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita’s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11!
Despite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation.

And as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this.


Sound - 10


This is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like.


Enjoyment and Overall Experience - 10


Naruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment. It's by no means a flawless anime , but it's an anime with highs that more than makes up for it's lows. It reaches for the stars but makes a few tumbles along the way , but the best moments of Naruto are some of the best moments in the medium itself.
And with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation.

Sub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended


| Recommendations |


[Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series.

[Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well.

[Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden."
104578,"Every new season of Attack on Titan grows in many areas in an extraordinary way. The first one putting in more simplistic terms was simple and straightforward. Wall Maria was broken down by the Colossal titan, and the city swarmed by all kinds of weird and bizarre-looking ones of his kind. Come to find out, the main character, Eren, had the power to turn into one of these horrifying looking monsters. Then from there on, it's easy to assume everything that could've transpired — eventually followed by the season after when all these new elements started to pop out — for instance, learning about the titan's real identity that broke down the wall. Not to mention, all the signs at something bigger happenings in the shadow but still no good idea what it might be. This was also a time for characterization, as we see them more thoroughly developed and can now feel more tightly connected to them.

Then you have the season 3 where Attack on Titan grows to a whole new height. You get to see deeper into the political aspect, and the titans are on the backburner for a while. We finally find out how they came to be, and the puzzle pieces are finally starting to fit in slowly. There was also light-world building to make sure the experience was even more fulfilling and satisfying. During the next part, the biggest questions of them all are finally answered. Titans history, among others, is revealed, and the mystery surrounding them. Although we still have quite a lot left to be exposed, so the theorists and predictions are, therefore, again running wild, trying to crack the code and form a solution to what we still don't know at the moment.

As always, from the startup till now, Wit Studio delivers yet again. It's clear by how much passion and love is put into every scene. When it's supposed to be invoking emotions, if the situation is right, you can feel everything from sorrow, anger, excitement, confusion, and varieties others kind of feelings. Moreover, art is hugely detailed like you would expect from previous seasons, and it meshes well with the different moods and vibes of the current view or position. Animation, too, is insanely fluid and crisp, and there was not a single moment I taught it was feeling off. We had some small glimpses of not the best CGI, but it didn't make a dent in entertainment value and was quite easy to overlook.

Being a manga reader myself, I can also safely assure you the ""pacing"" was impeccable and barely anything or, if at all, was skipped. On the other, in comparison to the ""Uprising arc"" from part one of the season, which was condensed somewhat, but if you were to ask me, this was a sound decision. It was profoundly political centered, and if it continued to be just that the audience, specifically a portion of the ""anime onlies"" or possibly even manga readers might've liked it less. Of course, thankfully, I was not one of them, and it was many that we're able to appreciate it's grace too. Like any other season, we also had Hiroyuki Sawano delivers once again in the original soundtrack department with his undeniable impeccable and masterpiece of composition. The voice acting was merely outstanding, too, and I find myself just like any other season. Turning the volume full up during the intense conversation, packing lots of impacts to have an even more chilling and exciting experience which never has failed me.

Attack on Titan is no doubt something I would with confidence consider a ""perfect adaption"" up to this point. It's one of the best the anime industry has to offer, and anyone would have a hard time denying it as a fact with the Final season thankfully set to be released during Fall 2020. The expectations are considerably high, as you might've expected. If the studio or hopefully Wit continues to deliver justice as it has been during all these years. You can bet it will be another unforgettable mindblowing, and thrilling experience. Suffice to say my anime of Spring season 2019 and possibly the entire year is already decided."
21355,"Story

Re: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu starts out with Subaru sent to another world against his own will. But he doesn't seem to care much and sets out his new life in this mysterious world. We can already tell Subaru is someone that is probably a shut-in, and don't care about responsibilities and so forth. More likely, he spends all day in his room playing games or watching videos. This anime will play with your emotions on levels you can't even begin to imagine. But compared to other Isekai or anime in general. Our main lead doesn't get everything from power, knowledge, intelligence served in front of him on a silver platter. He has to work for it. The load is realistic in the sense it takes a sane amount of time. In other words, he can't achieve anything heavy like learning a language right then and there. I really appreciate that about Re: Zero.

Subaru will go through the pain and struggle to meet his goals, times the 100, and that's still not enough to convey the torture he will go through. At any rate, Subaru had no idea what he got himself into. His mind embarks on a thrilling and intense journey with despair lurking amidst him and circling around, waiting for the right opportunity strike to make him suffer harshly. Putting it in simpler terms, the world is out to get him both literally and figuratively. Nothing goes as he wants to easily. This journey through hell and back is something that will break Subaru and form him into a better person through multiple meetings with despair itself. However, his story in another world seems to start out happy, since soon after being transported, he befriends a beautiful silver-haired elf girl, Emilia.

For some unknown reasons, she is being hunted by a psychotic assassin who manages to kill them both. Subaru falls in despair, only to open his eyes and standing there like it never happened. He can reverse time to a specific checkpoint and make it seem like his death never occurred. The catch is that only he remembers what happened. And if he were to tell this to anybody, he would suffer severe consequences in the form of immeasurable pain. At this point, you might wonder, but what is this anime about? What is the end goal? Firstly, this is a psychologically character-driven anime that focuses on Subaru and breaks down his character to groom him into a better, more mature person. However, it's not as easy as it sounds. Without going too much into details, let us say he goes through some shit many times and comes back more broken and vulnerable every time.

Until eventually, he falls apart and starts to take it out on others. Then arrives at a point where he could be gone forever. If nothing is done to save his suffering soul from the most bottomless pits of the abyss. Before everything else, Subaru is a hyper, energetic, quite the lively guy. He doesn't seem to care what others think of him and is not afraid to be cringe-inducing or plain weird. But that's part of his charm and what makes him so likable and interesting if you ask me. You will see him at his strongest, and at his weakest. His character is what makes this anime so amazing and unique. Subaru also has great chemistry with almost anyone. Whoever the person might be. The interactions likely will be fun, lively, and won't bore you, just entertain you all the more.

My reason for praising this anime so highly is because of Subaru and his development through the series. You can clear as day see how much he has developed close to the end of the season, compared to the starting point. I could easily appreciate his character, even more at this point, after everything he went through, and the level of progress we got for him. It makes him one of my favorites characters. So as you might've predicted already, specifically, the first season doesn't have a set goal. The characters drive this anime, but as you are going through the journey of suffering. You will see sub-plots that could be considered a part of the main plot, but only if you use this season as the core. Because Re: Zero, as noted by the creator - Tappei Nagatsuki, will be around 12 arcs. The anime covered the first, second, and the third arc. He also stated there will be at least 60 volumes worth of canon content by the end, so this speaks volumes for how big each arc could be and how much is still left unexplored.

Sound

This anime adaptation of Re: Zero excels at many things, undoubtedly, the sound is one of the components. Absolute despair, grief, and even with the comedic moments. White Fox does a beautiful job of meshing and applying the right tune to their respective category. As a result and example, the conversations feel more impactful during certain dialogues and overflows the right mood. So when the soundtrack kicks in. If you already are not experiencing some sort of emotion, this will definitely help you and give you the last push if you ever need it. Even if you don't, it makes everything feel way better and heightens the experience you would go through during those moments. Beyond that, it has some seriously kickass soundtrack, which can be addicting to listen to. Both openings feel spot-on when it comes to the overall feel and atmosphere of the story. Nothing but praises is all I have when it comes to sound department. I just love the OST of Re:Zero.

The ending is the same. I could argue I like the second ending more since it feels more on-point, and no one can't like Rie Takahashi angelic voice? That said, the first ending is definitely a strong one, and I don't dislike it despite my previous remarks. To top it off, we have some quite quality insert songs here and there, which will either make you pumped up or leave you in utter despair. Another strong point is, without a doubt, the voice acting. It feels so real, and the actors can really get into the character they are playing. You will be charmed by the effect the dialogue and the voice acting can have on you. It's so powerful and realistic at times. This anime also has one of my favorites directed episode of all time, the dialogue, to the tension, the overall mood is excellent. It would not be a lie to call some of these episodes a masterpiece from a direction and execution perspective, in my humble opinion.

Art

I absolutely adore the art style used for Re:Zero, at first glance, it gives this vibe of maybe feeling cute or moe-ish. However, White Fox does an excellent job of manipulating it to provides the effect with it should be at different times. Equally, the facial expressions are on-point as well and feel realistic. Attention to detail is seriously one of the best I have seen. During action events, the art and animation look fluid. You can tell White Fox is putting money, passion, time, and effort into producing a solid adaptation. Yes, the action sequences are fun to watch. I found myself at times, going back to see those same scenes over again. And I did not find any inconsistency in art or animation personally, which one needs to be on high alert of. The CGI is not top-notch, but it gets the work done and didn't mind it too much since it was gone before it becomes an issue.

Characters

As stated before, the cast is one of the best. It feels alive, and in some ways, it does help Subaru progress further as a person. To start with, Emilia, which is our main heroine, gives you this vibe of being tsundere-ish. Though you cannot help but find her amusing and start to like her, the design of her is also stunning once you get more characterization for her. I would say it fits her character persona very well. If you see her somewhere, you can easily deduce her psyche from her appearance. As previously stated, the side character is fantastic and one the best. They all have such good chemistry with Subaru, and it is hard not to be amused by their interactions.

Whether it be a certain maid making fun of him because Subaru is silly or with bandits on the side of the road and up to no good. You will also have the side characters where you will hate the individual, but later on, change your opinion toward a positive note and want more screen time for them. To go further, there are some quality side character that stands above the others and could, for instance, be the main role material. Of course, you have those scumbags that you want to just die since they did something horrible. What. I can say without going too much into spoilers, is you will seriously hate the individual so much it hurts. Still, this one is definitely a well-written villain, and personality is one of the strongest points about this person. Just be aware when you do meet the scum, your brain will tremble.

The Negative

It really is a great anime. I cannot stress that enough. Sadly, it is not for everyone, not everyone will feel the exact same feeling as me. Obviously, I can see someone who wants a solely plot-driven story with a set-fixed goal to drop this in the earlier episode and so on. There must be at least some of those out there who would, unfortunately. But Subaru could also be one of those biggest reasons. Depending on how you take his personality, in just a matter of moments, you can come to dislike him and don't want to watch any further. If not, his future actions might have you questioning his character and could be a reason for falling out Re: Zero. My advice going into this anime, as with any media, is to completely forget the concept ""expectations"" and watch this entirely blind. Let the experience you go through this be the judgmental core for you, not your blind insight, which could be the very reason that turns you away from this otherwise fantastic, unique, intense, and emotional anime.

Conclusion

Compared to the usual, not so interesting to bad Isekai anime. Re: Zero has a unique twist to it, which just really works. This is one of a kind with lots of potentials. One of which I absolutely want a second season to see where the story goes from this point on. I will not call this a defacto masterpiece. But there is no denying it has some masterfully directed episodes which could be showered with that kind of praise. Finally, if you like a realistic, character-driven story that uses all it has in its arsenal to heighten the experience with solid side characters. To really up the amusement further. I would highly recommend Re: Zero to both new and old watchers of anime. This is definitely standard for what an Isekai can be if you think outside of the box, and it's a great gateway to anime. And yes, just like HxH 2011, you should definitely give this anime a fair and much-deserved shot at one point.

20464,"I just want to start this off by saying how much I absolutely adore  this anime. Show-stopping, spectacular, never-the-same, amazing, wonderful, funny... Y'all. 
I'm gonna start off by saying the non-personal reasons I have for loving this anime first, because that's what matters in a review, and I'll also be reviewing Haikyuu as a whole and not just the first season, so, yeah. 
So in general, this anime follows the story of Hinata, a first year student finding his way in the volleyball world, especially as a short person. His drive and energy is legit inspiring. I don't like to just say it, but for real. I hear anime protags giving their speeches about what's important and what's not, but it never really compares to Hinata's drive. 
Another thing, the main cast of the show, Kurasuno's volleyball club all have very interesting stories of their own. The character development that Kageyama faces during the show is so great to watch. He went from somewhat annoying and aggravating, to my favorite character in the show. Literally in s4 he'll breathe and my brain says: serotonin. 
As well as the fact that the show gets you to care about the other teams just as much as the main team. It makes the watcher feel so much more when watching the matches. Half of the time, I hope both teams win, because I care so much about all of them. Neko, Aoba, Fukurodani, etc, I love all of them so much even if I root for Kurasuno in the end. Most shows tend to rely on the audience hating the other side in order to make you love the main team, but Haikyuu doesn't do that. In s4, I could not express how happy I was to see Kuroo and Kenma again. Like when they showed up on screen I was screaming, y'all. Same with Bokuto omg.
I think it's so wild how this story makes you care about it. In reality, it's just some volleyball anime. But it leaves this impact on the watcher that I rarely see in other sports anime, or just anime in general.
Also I know way too about volleyball now... lol.
Now to talk about why this anime is so important to me, specifically. 
I'm a transgender man. I have a small frame, I'm actually the same height as Hinata (5'3-4), and I've never been involved with men's sports. Whether it's because I personally don't believe in myself like I should, or knowing that I won't be treated the same as all the others in guys sports. Watching this show makes me feel as if I'm apart of that world that I've never gotten to be apart of. That specific part of the -teen boy experience- that I've never gotten, one of many. It's like I get it back. I also get the feeling of having a close net group of male friends, something I've never really had as well as a trans guy.
I empathize with Hinata so much too, as someone who is looked down upon in sports because of my body. But seeing him try so hard everyday, and seeing him be one of the best on the team, and just... everything. It inspires me so much. In fact, I plan on trying out for volleyball next year. I'll be on testosterone by then so hopefully I won't get fuckin bodied by all the transphobic white boys at my school :)
Anyway. Haikyuu's given me something irreplaceable, I finally get to experience that feeling I never got to, even if it's just an anime.
So yes, watch this anime. The original Japanese dub is awesome and the English dub is fucking hilarious. Seriously, watch this shit.
Fly high, Daichi... RIP to a real one"
9253,"Some context before I jump in. (Just doing this to show how good this show was)
Back before I watched Steins;Gate I used to not be interested in Anime, I loved Visual Novels though (Mainly Katawa Shoujo and DDLC). I was looking for more VNs to play when I heard about ""Steins;Gate"", the visual novel that was amazing. I didn't have the money to buy it at the time and the idea of it seemed really appealing to me so I decided to watch the show and my god has it changed me and my likes.

[(MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
To summarise, the story focuses on a group of friends who discover a time machine that can send e-mail into the past which allows them to alter the future, later on the crew discovers how to send memories back. Each alteration of the past has a huge impact on the future, from Luka turning into a girl to Akihabara becoming a boring old town.

Along the way they look into SERN, an organization with several rumours about them experimenting with black holes and time travel, they find out that they did infact manage to somewhat send people back in time. Soon after finding that out SERN storms in, murdering Mayuri, a childhood friend of Okabe. This moment is the most pivotal moment, the show undergoes a change in genre and atmosphere, from happy group of friends tinkering with electronics to tear producing, adrenaline inducing story of Okabe and his quest to find a World Line in which both his childhood friend (Mayuri), and crush Assistant (Kurisu) live. He tries over and over to save them both only to end up in spiral of depression as he has to work harder for to achieve this goal. (I'll leave out the last few scenes but you get the jist, right?)

We got to see a really interesting story, one that to this day manages to be one of the best stories out there. The way the world got built and the characters developed, it all felt really real, like they were non-fictional friends but animated. 




[CHARACTERS:]()
All of the characters found in Steins;Gate are amazing and well written.
I'll only be talking about my 3 favourite characters but all of them are great and feel realistic.
Okabe Rintarou, the mad scientist and a chuunibyou, despite me disliking his chuuni side I grew attached to it. He acted like he didn't care about anyone and anything but as the show progressed we got to see how he does care deeply about his friends.
Makise Kurisu, best girl for years, she is clearly a tsundere. I didn't know what to think of her character, when I watched the show I was new to the terms and stuff so I was not used to this loving yet aggresive type, though that being said she was an amazing member of the show!
Shiina Mayuri, a cute ball of sunshine, she is not as clever so she doesn't further the plot of the time machine scenes but she fills an important role in the show, so 1. Stress relief. When she enters the scene, you know its gonna be good and fun :D 2. A turning point for the story which grasps me everytime and hooked me in so much.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
Steins;Gate has a great artstyle. Its not the best looking show out there, yeah. But its very pleasant to look at, does not take anything away from the show at all. Steins;Gate being quite a dark and mysterious show the colour pallete is more on the washed out and drab, which adds more to the whole mystery of the show.
The show has really nice and smooth animations, as I said with the art, this makes it very nice on the eyes I was not tired of watching it or had any complaints when I binged it in 2 days.




[MUSIC:]()
The overall soundtrack of Steins;Gate is amazing. Loved it.
Each and every song fits so perfectly with the vibe of the show and the scene its playing in. I even listen to it while doing work (I'm listening to it now even!). Very catchy indeed.
The Opening! The most awesome part of the music topic. Its one of the best ones out there, everytime I hear it I get so nostalgic. Its catchy, plus the lyrics are also very good, they give insight into the world and story that will uneveil itself.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
If what I said above make you think I loved this show so much then let me repeat.
I loved it, so much. The story, characters, everything tied in to so well creating one of the best shows I have seen to this very day.
This was a very great introduction into Anime. I recommended everyone to check this series out or even pick it up again if you dropped it due to the slow start. 

It really is worth watching.

(Note - This is my first review, I hope y'all liked it. I'll write more in the future and try to improve on each and everyone I write!)"
101291,"At the start of the season, I most definitely didn't think that Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai would be my favorite show of the fall. And I certainly didn't think that I'd be fighting countless other glowing reviews upon completion like I am now, but such is the way of anime. Good shows like this don't remain unknown for long, even if they don't have a lot of buzz about them going into the season like Bunny Girl Senpai did. I distinctly remember adding Bunny Girl Senpai to my watch list because I heard from someone that it was a lot like Monogatari, which I absolutely adore. However, I found myself not agreeing with the comparison as much as the episodes ticked on. While there are absolutely similarities between the two (a snarky main character, a new girl of the week with new issues, a main love interest for the main character, etc) I found that, while Monogatari was surreal and ethereal in nature, Bunny Girl Senpai was grounded and had a distinct realism to it, as if these issues could be happening to you or your friends, despite their innate supernatural nature. But anyways, on to the meat of the review.

While I was never absolutely blown away by the animation or art style of Bunny Girl Senpai, I was never really focusing on it enough to notice it being anything worse than good. I actually really fell in love with the character designs in Bunny Girl Senpai more than anything. There was this vague similarity between some characters, but at the same time, every character was unique in a way that you'd never confuse them. At the same time, the color palette of the show was absolutely fantastic for its setting.

However, If I had to name the technical aspect of the show I loved the most, it would be the sound, more specifically, the music. I've said it before and I'll say it again, music elevates shows from a 9/10 to a 10/10. I mean, I look at the majority of my favorite anime and realize that a huge reason for them being there is because they have phenomenal soundtracks. Bunny Girl Senpai is no different. The OST is fantastic and actually memorable, which really makes me look forward to its eventual release. But more than anything, I loved the opening and endings. All five of the variations of the ending are fantastic, though the Mai version is still my favorite. But, I have to say, the compilation version is probably the best. However, my favorite song in the entire show is easily ""Kimi no Sei"", the opening. I'll just leave it here, because I feel as if it needs no explanation.

Favorite Character: Sakuta Azusagawa
img()

Yeah it's a bit of a boring choice, but for me, Sakuta is only choice. So few other characters exist with Sakuta's snark and wit and those that do are, in my opinion, outclassed by Sakuta in certain  ways. Not to say that he's a better character than say, Araragi or Hachiman, but I certainly related to Sakuta far more than either of those two. There's just a realism to Sakuta that's hard to match. He's snarky and standoffish, but also a caring friend who would topple mountains for those he cares for. He has a cold exterior, but even he isn't completely without feelings. I think the last arc of the show really drew out the depth in Sakuta’s character for me, all while keeping him consistent with his character. And this isn't even touching on the real strength about Sakuta and Bunny Girl Senpai in general. This strength that I've alluded to is simply the chemistry between Sakuta and the rest of the cast. You have Mai, who is Sakuta's main love interest, who provides us with the cutest relationship in the show, where they banter and flirt back and forth in an extremely endearing way. You also have a myriad of other characters with similar, albeit, less engaging relationships with Sakuta; Futaba, who explains things to Sakuta and essentially, the audience; Kaede, Sakuta's little sister who absolutely adores him but is stuck indoors from trauma; and the list goes on. There's just something so special when this cast of characters interacts. It's captivating even, to listen to those friends go back and forth, constantly evolving their relationships with each other, deepening their bonds and overcoming their problems together.

If I had to say anything bad about Bunny Girl Senpai, it would be that it never quite reaches the greatness of the first arc again, though Kaede's arc comes closest. And that is by no means a bad thing. It's just that that first arc was so good that it set completely unrealistic expectations for each and every arc and the fact that it almost reaches that mark every time is incredibly impressive. Sure, I was worried about the Koga arc, since it was a little more of a drag, but it certainly rebounded strongly once I had tempered my expectations a little. Seriously. That's all I can think of.

Anime like Bunny Girl Senpai don't come along too often, maybe once a year or so. For me, Bunny Girl Senpai really struck a chord in me, and I remembered how it was like for me in those tumultuous times, how you felt as if no one could see you or you wished some part of you didn't exist. It's truly a haunting time, one where you usually have to come to terms with those things in time, but to see those issues put under the microscope, to see them visualized, that's hard to handle in some cases. It's this combination of fantastically written characters and deep, thoughtful subject matter that truly makes Bunny Girl Senpai special. It's all these little things in unison that make Bunny Girl Senpai, most likely, my anime of the year."
97940,"Introduction: 
People really don’t give Black Clover enough credit. Sure, it may have some typical Shounen tropes and that made a lot of people give up on it early on, but that unoriginality is precisely what makes it so special. It takes the best aspects of every show that came before it and executes those tropes better than any of its predecessors ever did. Once the story picks up, the fun basically never stops. The show is constantly progressing and escalating. I thought I would lose interest at some point, but Black Clover just keeps one-upping itself and only gets better as time goes on. Unlike most Shounen anime, it has complex philosophical themes, heavy symbolism, and great antagonists. Everything is so well done that I can’t help but love it.

img800()

Synopsis: 
The story follows Asta, along with his childhood friend, Yuno, who were both raised in an orphanage in a backwater village deep within the forsaken realm of the Clover Kingdom, after being abandoned at its doorstep as newborn children. From a young age, they both dream of becoming the Wizard King, the strongest mage and the defacto leader of the nation. Unfortunately, the Clover Kingdom is also plagued with corruption and discrimination. For the most part, the nobles are arrogant, classist, and elitist, only using their high magical power as a means to further their agendas and harass the people beneath them. Since the boys are both commoners, they will have to fight an uphill battle for the rest of their lives if they intend to make their dreams a reality.

img800()

World-Building: 
The world-building in the show is rather complicated to explain. I’m guessing the best place to start is the power system. Every person is born with a magical attribute and some people have more mana to work with than others. You can’t change the magic you’re born with, but you can definitely master it and make it your own. There are four primary types: Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind. Almost all types of magic derive from one of those categories in some way or another, like Steel originates from Earth, Lightning originates from Fire, etc. However, there are some irregular types of magic that don’t necessarily fit in with the others, like Light, Dark, Spatial, and even Time. The point is anything can be controlled by magic and a mage can sharpen their skills by obtaining a grimoire. Grimoires are essentially spell books that choose its master. Everybody gets one at some point in their life. The grimoires grow with the mage they are contracted to and can cause a mage’s magic to take various shapes based on personality and life experiences. For example, Finral and Langris are brothers with the same magical attribute, Spatial Magic. They both belong to the famed noble house Vaude. Finral was a kind-hearted boy that refused to use his power to hurt others and was never interested in combat training, therefore disgracing his family, and was ultimately disowned. On the other hand, his brother Langris was the exact opposite and looked down on everybody, seeing others as nothing more than insects. He was put on a pedestal by his parents and appointed the next head of the house. It was because of this distinction that their grimoires manifested their magic in different ways. Finral’s spells focus on transporting people and objects to other locations safely, whereas Langris’ spells primarily focus on erasing space itself, obliterating anything that stands in his way. On an unrelated note, Asta’s magic type is the most irregular type of them all. Simply put, it’s called Anti-Magic. Its true origin is unknown, other than the fact that it’s granted to him by a mysterious devil that resides in his grimoire. His anti-magic manifests itself in the form of swords that nullify any magic type on impact. In opposition to the devils, there are also four divine spirits that are considered the embodiment of the four primary magic types I talked about earlier: Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind. Yuno was also chosen by the wind spirit Sylph towards the beginning of the story. As far as the rest of the world goes, there are also other species besides humans and other nations besides the Clover Kingdom, but that doesn’t really get addressed until much later in the story and I can’t talk about everything without writing a novel.

Rivalry: 
You could say Asta and Yuno are two halves of a whole. Asta was a boy without magic in a world where magic is everything, whereas Yuno’s magical power was always on par with even some royals. Asta gains the power of a devil, while Yuno gains the powers of a spirit. Asta gets accepted into the worst magic knights’ squad and Yuno gets accepted into the best. They are polar opposites, but it’s not like your typical underdog protagonist and prodigy rival character relationship. Yuno doesn’t antagonize or belittle Asta. They have a relationship that can be considered that of a competitive friendship for the entirety of the show. They share the same past, values, and ambitions, and they have an undying trust and respect for one another. They build each other up, rather than constantly breaking each other down. It's a healthy rivalry you don't usually see in anime. It's easily one of the biggest stand-outs of the show.

Symbolism: 
While everyone is born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power, commoners have far less than nobility and are often harassed or even killed as a result. Unknown to most of the world, there’s a truly morbid reasoning behind this. You see, centuries ago, there was a peaceful tribe of elves that resided in the Clover Kingdom, whose magical power was so immense, it was thought that they were chosen by mana itself. Some humans even worshipped them like gods. However, the human royalty had a deep-seated envy and hatred for their species, which allowed them to be manipulated by a certain devil into massacring the elves at a wedding ceremony and stealing all of the elves' mana for themselves. Now, if you take a second to think about what’s going on, you might notice something. The elves are a people that are “chosen by mana”, symbolic of a people “chosen by God”. The event is clearly symbolic of the Siege of Jerusalem, with the elves representing the Israelites and the humans representing the Romans who invaded the land and massacred them. This is further supported by the fact that when the elves are resurrected in the modern-day Clover Kingdom, their revenge plot involves a monument matching the description of the Tree of Life, representing the ten attributes of God, and that two of the major characters from the human side are named after Roman emperors: Nero and Julius. Of course, this isn’t the only example of symbolism in the show. Black Clover also incorporates different religions, some literature, and even various types of mythology into later story arcs.

Character Development: 
Sometime after the massacre, the royal family branched off into three separate houses: Silva, Vermillion, and Kira. Noelle, one of Asta’s best friends, is from House Silva. Despite her lineage, her upbringing was anything but pleasant. Her capacity for mana was abnormally high, far more than any child can properly endure. As a result, she was never able to control her magic, and this only worsened under the constant emotional abuse from everyone around her. She was looked down on her entire life like Asta was and even tormented by her own siblings, until she was eventually disowned by them for making the family look bad. However, after rigorous training and her relationship with Asta, she’s able to accept and overcome her shortcomings and eventually became one of the strongest mages in the kingdom, even outclassing the people that used to belittle her. She’s a phenomenally written character and there are plenty more like her in the show, especially amongst Asta’s comrades at the Black Bulls, the magic knights squad that recruited him at the beginning of the story. The Black Bulls is widely considered to be the worst of the worst magic knights squad. They're pretty much the practical joke of the Clover Kingdom. This is due to the fact that, despite while having a solid roster of mages at their disposal, they tend to cause more problems than they solve and they aren’t exactly the people you’d typically see in the magic knights. They’re reckless, lazy, and sometimes just plain stupid, but they’re lovable, nonetheless. First, there’s Asta, who’s undeniably the backbone for the entire group. His fearlessness and persistence manufacture a deadly combination and he motivates his peers to surpass their personal limitations, just like he did with Noelle. The rest of the squad consists of: Luck – a battle addict, Magna – a street punk, Charmy – a glutton, Vanessa – an alcoholic, Finral – a womanizer, Gauche – an ex-convict, and there’s Gordon and Grey, who are both crippling introverts. There are also four more members that are introduced later on. Then, there’s the captain. Yami is basically the physical embodiment of masculinity. This man makes alphas look like betas, but underneath his tough exterior is a man who’ll go to war for any of his subordinates. He's like a retired Shounen protagonist that has already been through all of his adventures and decided to take over the mentor role for the next generation of magic knights. Anyway, I'm not gonna go over each character's arc, because that would make this a million times longer than it has to be, but as you can see, each member has a different background and personality, not to mention magical power. On their own, it may seem as though nobody stands out, but they’re simply amazing when they all come together. Seeing their growth not only as individuals, but as a team is truly fascinating to watch.

Conclusion: 
All in all, Black Clover is a masterfully written show. Is it relatively mediocre at the beginning? Absolutely, but after watching the entirety of the first saga, it’s obvious why it needed to be that way. There's tons of set-up for some huge payoffs. Black Clover as a show is basically like Asta as a character. People assume it will be bad, so they slander it relentlessly. The show really had to fight for the recognition it has today. It kind of reminds me of Attack on Titan in that regard. The story and world-building are on another level, and it has an entire cast of characters that I actually love to spend time with. Also, the fights and the music are amazing. I never thought I’d say this about a Shounen, but hell, there's been one filler arc so far, and not only was that arc great, but it actually enhanced the story that much more. I honestly don't know how they do it. All I have to say is: don't go into Black Clover expecting it to reinvent the wheel, because it won't. It'll definitely take you for a fun ride though. It's literally Shounen junk food and doesn't attempt to become anything more than that until the end of the first series. All in all, if you have the patience to watch this show, do it. It’s more than worthy of your time."
20447,"If you’ve ever been unemployed, you’ve got some idea of what Yato is going through. Nobody respects him, nobody believes in him, and nobody wants to hire him. On top of all that, the one person he has by his side in life has just left him, citing his constant failures on both personal and professional levels as her grounds for doing so. Now that he’s all alone and struggling to scrape by, he’ll have to set aside his dignity and take every single job that comes his way, whether he’s qualified to complete them or not… We’ve all been there at some point, but where Yato’s experiences differ from ours is that for each job, he can only accept about five hundred yen in payment… Because he’s an aspiring Japanese God.

Just when it seems like he’d be forever alone on his journey, his life takes a sudden turn with the introduction of two people he may have just been fated to meet… Hiyori, a high school girl who somehow obtains the powers of astral projection when she attempts to save Yato’s life, and Yukine, the resurrected spirit of a long-dead teenage boy. Their lives quickly become intertwined as the sins of his past start to take notice and haunt him once more. Can these three kindred spirits get along with each other long enough to help Yato realize his ambitions in the spiritual hierarchy, or will simply surviving turn out to be a tough enough challenge on it’s own?

Noragami was animated by the once famous Studio Bones, and while it’s not their best looking work, it’s probably their best looking recent work. There is a budget disparity, because this is Bones and there’s always a budget disparity, but it’s relatively well managed. While there is a good chunk of action throughout the story, it’s also a very dialogue heavy series full of character-banter and exposition. The budget gets cut during these scenes, which is generally the ideal way to go about it unnoticed. In exchange for this, the action scenes have a great flow to them, the comedic scenes can use just enough movement to give them the energy they need, and guys, the spirits that Yato and his friends have to fight are just resplendent.

The character designs are simple and a little on the generic side, utilizing templates that you’ve no doubt seen in many modern anime. They do their job well enough, but the only thing that sets them apart from the norm are a few unique touches that were added to their outfits and the attractive design of their eyes. That’s not to say they’re bland looking in any way, but there isn’t much visual flare to any of them. The backgrounds and environments are highly detailed and richly colored, but in keeping to form with the character designs, this is nothing you haven’t seen before. The exception to this is in their highly expressive faces, which are versatile enough on their own to distract you from the few times that a key frame lingers on screen for a few seconds too long.

The music, on the other hand, is a lot more original and inspired. I didn’t notice it for the most part… Not because it wasn’t there, but because it was doing it’s job well… But the few tracks I did notice were the kind that I’d have no problem playing in my car, thanks to the diverse compositions of Taku Iwasaki. Most of the show’s more noticeable tunes are blends of rock and traditional Japanese music with contemporary styles like drum and base and techno, creating a unique sound that helps to elevate the series beyond the general aimlessness of it’s story. Blood pumping music makes for good action, and a good beat is essential for making it work. The beat on most of these tracks tracks is so good that you may catch yourself nodding your head and tapping your foot in time with it.

Even outside of the opening and closing, there’s a surprising amount of vocal work in the background music. There’s rapping in these songs… Yes, it surprised me too, not just by how good it sounds but the fact that it’s there at all. Straight up rapping, and if that’s not unusual enough, there are also a lot of instances… Especially in the tune Noratan… That use vocals as if a person were shouting random sounds into a megaphone rather than singing them, and it all comes together really well. This is a series that blends classic Japanese mythology with modern styles and attitudes, and while it’s nowhere near the first anime to do this, it is the only one I can think of that used an equally anachronistic music style, and it fits the series perfectly. The opening, Goya no Machiawase by Hello Sleepwalkers, is a little more standard than the rest of the soundtrack, but it’s still on the high end of the scale. It’s a soundtrack that shines with effort and inspiration over-all, and it sounds just as good whether out of context or in context.

The recently released English dub was a Funimation endeavor, and with the Japanese being such a solid blend of comedy and drama, they had quite a bit to live up to… But Funimation has proven themselves before, and with Bonny Clinkenbeard behind the wheel, they prove it once again. Brynn Appril plays the lead role of Hiyori, the quirky high-schooler who gets caught up in this whole mess, and boy does her voice get a work-out. Between having to scream whenever her character over-reacts to something(which is a thing that happens a lot) and lecturing her new friend over his behavior, or just singing to herself over her new-found powers, she never recites a single line without amping up the emotion behind it. She’s the cornerstone of the chemistry that these three possess, and Brynn does a great job upholding it.

Then again, so do her costars, Jason Leibricht and Micah Solusod. Their performances are just as animated as hers, if not moreso during their stronger moments. As the down-on-his luck Yato, Liebricht really does sound like a guy holding onto hope and trying to enjoy his life despite the huge weight hanging over him, and the dark past that he’s supposedly put behind him. Micah Solusad goes on more of a journey than the other two, following the spirit Yukine as he tries to make do with his situation, although never shying away from openly criticizing the boss he’s been saddled with. He keeps it together, but it’s clearly a struggle, and… As they say… Something’s gotta give, and when it does, he breaks through as the star of this dub. Alexis Tipton as Kofuku is… Alexis Tipton. Which is a good thing.

Noragami gets off to a great start. It introduces us to a very interesting universe and a strong premise revolving around the ambitious but heavily flawed Yato, and his two friends who are just likable as he is, and through them, we get to explore the intricacies of this spiritual society existing just out of reach of normal human acknowledgement. There’s a lot of potential in these early episodes, and I’ve seen a lot of people say that it sort of drops the ball after that point. In a way, I’m inclined to agree, as once everything’s laid out on the table, well, Noragami does lose start to show some cracks.

First of all, it kind of can’t be ignored… This series is based heavily on Japanese mythology, and it makes the mistake of assuming the viewer is familiar with that kind of material. A lot of the details of it’s universe are mentioned without any explanation or build-up, and while those in the know will be able to understand the context of those details enough to not question how it works, most American viewers will likely treat each piece of it with a raised eyebrow and, at best, an “if you say so…” kind of response.

See, in order to do his job, Yato needs the aid of a shinki, or… In the dub… A Regalia. He takes the spirit of Yukine as his regalia, and can turn him into a weapon whenever necessary (See Soul Eater for more on this concept). For those of us who don’t regularly study Japanese mythology, we’ll hear something like “A God will start to deteriorate if their regalia misbehaves, and their deterioration can be caught by other Gods like a flesh eating bacteria,” and we’d respond to this with a blank stare. It fits together about as well as saying that ‘once the human population reaches one million, the moon will blow us up.’ Yeah, we’re along for the ride, but it kind of wrecks the immersion of the experience.

A lot of the details are explained to us through Hiyori… Which I’m sad to say is her main job in the series… But it rarely ever goes any deeper than just “This is how this works, don’t worry about the logic of it.” You could say it’s my fault for not being worldly enough to get it, but I’ve always been a strong believer in accessibility. You shouldn’t have to study to understand what’s going on in a story. That’s not to say an anime with rich cultural subtext shouldn’t inspire people to seek out more information about said culture, but you should still be mindful of those who haven’t or even won’t. I’ve criticized much better shows than this one for their accessibility issues, and I won’t be giving any quarter over it today.

Following the halfway point, the series loses it’s sense of direction, as well as any interest it may have had in Yato’s pursuit of higher godhood. Concepts brought up during the first half are dropped entirely, enemies from his past reappear in the story out of nowhere… Like, seriously, one of them just happens to show up because one of Hiyori’s friends prays to him offhand at a shrine… And the stakes drop rapidly to the point that the only thing Yato’s really fighting for is the one thing that works the best in the series; His friendship with Hiyori and Yukine.

And speaking of Hiyori, she’s kind of a pitiful main character. My plot summary focused mainly on Yato because he’s a lot more interesting than she is, and she doesn’t really become important to the plot until episode 10. She’s likable, and she gets a few laughs in the early episodes, but she’s never really given an identity beyond that point, other than being the glue of their friendship. While the idea of her leaving her body behind whenever she goes spirity comes off as funny at first, they do so little with it, and the fact that her lifeless body has been sitting out in public for extended periods of time is just swept under the rug. She leaves her body outside in the rain for over a full episode, and when she gets it back, she doesn’t have a cold or anything.

While I can understand people saying that the first half was a lot stronger than the second half, I would like to respectfully disagree. I took issue with this series as early as the third episode, and found myself hating it throughout the fourth episode, and my feeling has a lot to do with it’s attitude towards depression and suicide. See, in the world of Noragami, people don’t decide to commit suicide on their own… A malicious spirit attaches itself to people who are experiencing negative emotions and pushes them towards expressing it through extreme methods.

Now, an immediate defense for this might be “Isn’t that how the witches in Madoka Magika work?” Well, no. The witches in Madoka Magika use suicide as a weapon, but they attack indiscriminately against anybody in the area. They’re not the sole cause of suicide, they just utilize it. In Noragami, Yato states twice in episode three alone that if a soul wants to kill itself, then it’s being possessed. Unless this is a translation error… Which I doubt… Noragami openly blames suicide(And murder, and even bullying) on spiritual possession.

On the one hand, you could say that possession is a metaphor for depression, that an undeniable force is taking control of you and urging you towards things you don’t want to do. And yeah, that metaphor kind of adds up, save for two serious problems. First of all, it’s a situation that can conveniently be solved by simply killing or exorcising the offending demon. This throws the metaphor argument directly under the bus, as even if you’re able to stop a depressed person from killing themselves, depression is not that easy to cure. It’s a complicated illness with countless possible catalysts, and to imply that they can all be erased by getting rid of that pesky negative feeling is just insulting. This isn’t a metaphor.  It's an over-simplification, and a stupid one at that.

Noragami didn’t set out to belittle a lot of peoples’ real life problems… I know that wasn’t it’s intention, and demonic possession isn’t the worst way to explore it. It’s been done, and it’s been done well. The problem is that this show just doesn’t show any evidence of understanding the topic it’s dealing with. For the perfect example, there’s an extensive scene in episode 4 where Yato & Friends are accidentally dialed by a man who’s jumping off of a building. Throughout what must be the longest fall in history(Seriously, you could do your taxes before hitting the ground), he tells them that he fell in love with a young woman and from then onwards, he had worse and worse luck resulting in his business failing and going bankrupt. It’s revealed that he was dating the goddess of poverty, so Yato severs his connection to said Goddess, saves him from the fall, and then… Eureka, everything’s resolved!

Except no, it’s not. They haven’t solved his financial problems, nor have they rid him of the hard times and deep shame that clearly came with it, so there’s no saying whether or not he’ll try to die again. Also, his cruel sociopath of a woman gets off easy just because she thought what she was doing to him was funny. No, I’m sorry, they haven’t undone the damage that was done to him, and I don’t believe she’s never going to target anybody ever again. And this is one of my biggest problems with Noragami… By defeating these spirits, you’re not helping anybody, you’re just putting a band-aid on a wound that’s going to reopen again, and you’re just stopping there. “I don’t care what you’re going through, or how much you’re suffering… Just as long as you don’t resort to any methods that’ll make people sad!”

Yeah, I know this has some kind of ties to Japanese beliefs, but there’s another Eastern belief that I’d like apply to this; If you save somebody’s life, you’re responsible for that life. It’s not Japanese, but it’s still relevant. Now that proverb may have many meanings, but in this case, I’d like to use it as meaning that if you step in and prevent them from committing suicide, you’ve become involved in their struggle. You have just taken away their way out, and you’d better be damn well ready to show them another way out, otherwise you’re just pushing your belief on other people to preserve your own sensibilities. In Noragami, the idea seems to be “Nope, you’re not gonna die… Good luck!” And to me, that seems just as irresponsible as not doing anything.

So, with all of these problems that I had with Noragami, is it a bad show? Nope! It’s two strongest elements, thankfully. take up the majority of the series. The first is the action, which… While poorly set up through rushed villains… Is freaking awesome, whether your brain’s turned off or on. The animation never really looks bad, but these fight scenes are where the budget shines through gloriously, and while the villains may have had writing issues, they’re all a lot of fun. They’re well designed and intimidating, and they have compelling motives that are tied to Yato’s dark past, which is a really smart way to grow him as a character… By showing him literally battling against his past sins.

And the second is the relationship between Yato and his Regalia, Yukine. Their dynamic is very effective at holding up their separate yet still intertwined arcs. Yato brought Yukine back to life in order to use him as a tool to help him get back on his feet and maybe even restore his long lost glory. He thinks of him as an object, needing to follow orders and obey his beck and call. Yukine hates this, and rebels almost immediately, acting out in ways that damage Yato. Yato has to learn how to be fair and treat his Regalia like a person, and Yukine needs to learn to accept his fate and respect the one who gave him his second chance.

It’s a very parent/child sort of dynamic, and it works really well because nether character is fully in the wrong, and they’re both acting in relatable, understandable ways. We’ve all been to that place where we resent somebody for disrespecting us and taking our generosity for granted. We’ve all been in places where we felt disgruntled over situations that were forced upon us without our consent, and yes, some dark part of us wanted to see other people suffer what we have to suffer. It’s a very well-developed conflict, and with Hiyori acting as the glue between them, we never have to wonder why Yukine doesn’t just quit the way Yato’s previous Regalia did. In fact, I’ll be perfectly honest, I liked the second half of this series more than the first half, simply because it spent so much time on these two aspects of the series that I enjoyed the most.

Noragami is available from Funimation. At the time of this writing, you can find it on Amazon in the DVD/Bluray combo pack format for just over half of the original price. You can also find it on Funimation.com and Amazon Instant Video, and the undubbed subtitled version is available on Netflix. The original manga IS available stateside from Kodansha comics USA, and from what I’ve heard, it tells a much more complete story than the series does. A second season is scheduled to air in Japan in October, and from the summaries I’ve read, it will be following the story of one of Yato’s enemies, a blonde woman with an eyepatch named Bishamonten.

Noragami is a somewhat problematic show, suffering from issues on almost every level, but the product as a whole is worth more than the sum of it’s parts. If you’re interested in Japanese mythology, then its world-building makes it out to be a decent introduction to the subject. The inconsistency of the writing kind of works in it’s favor, as it tends to give up on the things it’s doing wrong and focuses most of it’s time on the things it does right, for better or worse. Personally, I did enjoy the good parts of it enough to watch it a second or maybe even third time in the future, although I’ll probably be skipping episode four when I do so. Combining that with some solid animation and the most interesting soundtrack I’ve heard in years, I give Noragami a 6/10."
19815,"No Game No Life is an anime by the studio Madhouse famous for works such as “Hunter x Hunter” and “One Punch Man”. It’s about two NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) siblings named Sora and Shiro (A.K.A. 『　』or Blank) who are the best game players in the world. It doesn’t matter which game it is, they’re probably great at it. The show starts by them getting thrown into another world that basically runs on playing games after beating a computer in chess. In that new world they immediately crush their opponents just as successfully as they did in their world.

webm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/cdcb8095ce337335262e141c7026155b.webm)
From the main duo we have Sora, who understands a person’s psychology better than that person does themself. He’s the one that does all the manipulating of the other characters. This is where I have a problem with him. I hold a distaste for anime 4D chess players because the majority of them feel like incredibly unrealistic pseudo-intellectuals. And Sora is no exception, every time he has a match with someone in the show he is instantly able to understand whatever emotions they might be feeling and what their thought process is. I have no idea how he is able to do this, even if he spent every minute of his life from the morning he was born studying others, he still wouldn’t be able to instantly understand everything about a person just from a quick glance. That isn't smart, that's just witchcraft. Also for some reason the creators gave Sora an “arrogant and prideful” personality even though that sort of contrasts with the whole NEET thing. You’d think that a NEET would be depressed or irritable, but instead Sora acts just like how a regular person would. 

On the other hand we have Shiro, the human computer. She does all the calculating in the duo and happens to be a genius at it, better than anyone in human history. And she’s even more unrealistic than Sora because she’s an 11 year old. I’m not saying child prodigies don’t exist, but this is just ridiculous. Apart from her whole brocon thing she really doesn’t have many other important character traits. I don’t know why they made her 11 even though she doesn’t act or think like an 11 year old would, they could have just as easily made her a high school student and that would have fit her character better. She’s pretty clearly just a loli who “loves her onii-chan” for those guys out there that are into that kind of stuff. 

There are also some other characters besides those two, but they’re all pretty much irrelevant or useless. Like Steph shows that she has the knowledge to run a country, but that’s completely useless when you’re in a world that’s run on games. Something which Steph notoriously sucks at unless aided by someone else. And Jibril is supposed to be super smart for her race, but ends up just being a jobber for the entire show after she’s beaten by Mr. and Mrs. Sue.

Now I’m going to tell you why Sora and Shiro don’t work as characters. When you’re writing a smart character you want to give them some realism because when you don’t, you get characters like these who are practically indistinguishable from omniscient gods. They don’t actually look in as smart as they're made out to be and if anything seem ironically less intelligent. It also doesn't help that they have no flaws. I guess the ""can't be in a public place without breaking down"" trait could be a flaw, but it's not like that actually affects them or the story, so I don't think it counts. And this is especially clear when we get into the games and how they’re played.

(This next part is going to be taken directly from a forum post I made a few days ago)

In high stakes gambling shows like NGNL (even though there really are no stakes), usually the creators would have their characters put into a situation where they’d have to find a way to beat the odds through realistic means while playing within the rules of their show, which is where NGNL fails. When Sora and Shiro play chess you'd think that they’d study their opponents playing style, strategize, and find/exploit weak points like in a regular chess game, right? Instead they decide to make a speech to the chess pieces to encourage them and boost their ability. This writing is in no way smart and seems to come out of nowhere. And it wouldn't be a problem if it were only 1 time, but it happens all the time throughout the entire show! Like during the coin flip at the end of the season, Sora got the coin to land on its side by moving a tile on the road backwards. How did he know the tile would be loose and what would he have done if it wasn’t? In fact, why didn’t the miko lady just ask Sora to flip the dang coin again in a different spot? I'll tell you why, because the writers tried to make Sora and Shiro seem smarter than they really are. I think I've said that to the point where it's redundant. 

The animation isn't anything special either. Take for example the fight between Shiro and that wolf girl. Breaking it down we get: panning shot, rotating camera, and shaky camera over bright gun fire in that order. They animate it in a way that creates the illusion of good animation when there's barely any. But it didn't look good, it just looked awkward and distracted me from the actual battle. A large portion of the ""animation"" in NGNL is just slow pans across the screen with minimal detail. And it get's worse once you realize this show is made by people who are capable of making good animation.

TL;DR: No Game No Life fails because the writing is lazy and the animation is subpar."

The episodic formula tends to get tedious in the long run. It's very unusual to get something that hits all the right notes—making it challenging to keep it both fresh and unique. Since you need to have a great cast of characters that are likable and have more than enough room for significant development moving forward. The interactions between them should feel natural and mesh well with each other, in no way give you this sense that it's out of place or inadequately executed. That's right everything I noted and more ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" surpasses those expectations far above and beyond. The studio A-1 Pictures went to every length to make the well-beloved manga, which is already incredible. Even better, giving it some damn extraordinary amount of justice in the process.

StoryIt follows Shinomiya Kaguya our charming and lovable female lead. She is the vice president of the famous ""Shuchi'in Academy,"" where you will find all kinds of an amusing character. Usually, the more famous people attend this academy having made a name for themselves in society. Kaguya is part of the massively influential ""Shinomiya-Zaibatsu."" She's a multi-talented genius add on, which has no trouble accomplishing anything she sets her mind to for the most part.  Except, confessing her strong love without turning it into psychological warfare with our main lead, Shirogany Miyuki. He is someone who has worked himself from the ground to the top of the mountain and is now considered the top student. In a matter of wealth, though, he is quite disadvantaged and works many part-time jobs to help his family at home and himself moving forward. You might be asking: ""but what is the goal or plot for this anime?"". Both characters are in love with one another, and the purpose is to make the other admit that fact. But, whoever confesses first losses or at least is how our lovable main characters see it as. They are proud to do it first. Hence goes to every length to create opportunities to make the other confess to them first. But they always seem to get away in the wittiest and hilarious fashion.

It never gets old either. I can assure you that just this one gimmick can amass forth many hilarious and wholesome situations with our cast in different ways. But you would assume that something so simple would become repetitive very fast. Although instead, it's entertaining all the way through and never lets up the fun. This one of the basis for many things, which makes ""Kaguya-sama"" so unique from other RomCom. On top of that, it's a psychological character-driven and relies heavily on our cast. It's not just about Kaguya and Miyuki coming up with all kinds of schemes to come out on top of in different situations. In return, leading them ever so closer to confessing their feelings to each other. It's not all rainbow and sunshine. The anime can go into some serious and emotional bits, which makes it stand out even more, plus making the experience a lot more fulfilling.  

Yes, that's right. It does a most excellent job of developing the cast and remeaning a proper balance at the same time. Besides, this anime is more or less for both teenagers, and especially the mature audience might be able to appreciate it more. Some of the things it throws at you won't make you think otherwise, and the language proves that likewise. Every episode has some nice moment where our cast gets an explored or given growth, which can come from any situation you can experience in your everyday life. The standard formula is to expand on it and make our cast learn from it in hilarious ways. It never gets old and always feels fresh and new; you really can't help be drawn towards it. Despite the fact it's ""episodic"" in its core, it doesn't feel that way either, as mentioned above. Plus, If I didn't make it noticeable previously. The comedy is seriously top-notch, and never did an episode failed to make me smile or laugh out loud. Comedy is indeed subjective, and it does depend on the person. Still, I feel like ""Kaguya-sama"" might not fail you regardless of your preference. As for the pacing, it was spot-on, and never did I think the anime was rushing ahead. As they used everything viable for them to make the experience magnificent. 

Art and AnimationThe art is so lovely and works well with the vibe of the show and never had any flaws. At least I didn't notice anything significant that stood out. The derp was almost entirely non-existent, and the art always looked terrific and beautifully depicted. A-1 Pictures didn't cut any corners, showing how much love and care they put in animating this fantastic manga adaptation. They were successfully and accurately able to manipulate the art in any given situation and never failed to make me feel the genuine emotion. It is, without a doubt, one of the best works if not the best for the studio. After Kaguya-sama run, I have some profound respect for them and hope they can keep this up for the next anime adaptation they might get their hand on. About animation, for a ""RomCom"" it has very high production value. Some of the scenes, even the minor, gets such a massive upgrade and makes for a more meaningful impact. The animator knows what they are doing. It's over the top, but make you seriously enjoy yourself and sharpens the fun by an incredible margin.

Sound For starters, the voice actors did an excellent job during their roles. This also goes for the side cast and less important ones. How Kaguya's voice actor, Koga Aoi, was able to change her voice swiftly depending on her character's mood. And, It didn't feel off in any way. It was spot-on and how quick the change was left me quite damn speechless and impressed. It could be any state, ranging from ""anger,"" ""sadness,"" ""happiness,"" and the voice actor never ceased to amuse me with her incredible talents. They all deserve a higher wage, no doubt. This is one of the most influential voice actings I have seen in recent years. For the more miscellaneous details, like the sound effect, the quality was high and didn't feel cheap one bit. The opening song was immensely addictive. At first, I started with not finding it impressive, but before I knew it, I was humming the whole tune in my sleep. I fell in love with it and still listen to it to this day. The ending song is beautiful and is an excellent piece to conclude an episode. My favorite would have to be the special one with Chika Fujiwara singing and dancing adorably. The song is super catchy, and the dance was just lovely. Studio ""Kyoto Animation"" animated this segment and nailed it no question about it. I adored every piece of music the anime dished out.

CharactersNot short a fantastic cast as I had implied many times before. They didn't feel dull or tiring from start to end. I didn't dislike any. Only grew more attached to them as they gained built-up, and we learned more of their flaws and charm points. There's ""best girl"" and ""best boy"" material alike. No one is wast and is sufficiently fleshed out, and you can't help but grow genuinely fond. It's in someways rare in most media or literature, but ""Kaguya-same"" has even a strong side with main role potential. Although the focus was around them is mild. What we did get was satisfactory and enough to grow a strong connection with them. Of course, the character development is also vibrant and realistic in a sense. It's slow yet believable, and the pacing is not an issue, at least not to me. Something tells me everyone else who enjoyed this anime would agree. Lastly, you will find all kinds of amusing and quirky characters in Kaguya-sama. Every single of them has a distinct and big personality you can't help get drawn toward them.

To give a brief introduction to our beloved cast: 
Outside of the intelligent combo of Kaguya and Miyuki. You have the charming, but at the same time dangerous, Chika Fujiwara, who is more than meets the eye. If you think she is just innocent and precious, you are entirely right. But she can pack a massive blow when you least expect it; she is quite a secret savage in other words. Then you have Hayasaka Ai, who is the secretary to Kaguya. Some of her more impactful moments are much later on. Still, the anime managed to give her a satisfying intro. She is a delightful character who can speak in a charming accent, on top of being adorable. Her interactions with Kaguya is entirely wholesome. She helps her in many situations and is a brilliant wing-woman. Lastly, for this season, you have the otaku, Ishigami Yuu, with a fragile heart. He is ever so slightly socially awkward around other people. But, like Chika, he's hiding a secret side of his own which you might get to experience now and then if you are lucky. He is my favorite male in ""Kaguya-sama,"" but Miyuki doesn't fall short either. I wanna give a brief mention to our lovely fiesty little cinnamon roll tsundere, Miko Iino, she'll make her debut in the sequel. I can tell you this. Miko's interactions with the group, especially Ishigami, are some of my favorites. She is quirky and so hilarious and adds even more comedy, substance, and emotional elements to the story.

The NegativeIn my opinion, there was nothing quite negative about the anime adaptation for ""Kaguya-sama.""  Although the order at the chapter was adapted was kind of random in some cases, not counting if it was a mini-arc. That said, this was hardly that big of an issue. If anything, you have a lot more to experience in the source material the anime couldn't get to. Also, since it's ""episodic."" The only issue would stem from character growth-related arc. To that end, the studio nailed it, and I couldn't be happier about this solid adaptation.  

ConclusionI wholeheartedly recommend this to all fans, including newcomers. It's an excellent gateway into the anime world and shows you just how much fun you can get if you decide to convert over. It has high re-watch value, and that's rare in short form. Also, be sure to check out the source material. It's impressive. One of my favorites manga I am reading at the moment. If you loved the anime, you definitely should, possible from start and experience everything the anime might've skipped over. It's always lovely to experience two sides of the same coin, you know. Not only that, ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" is by itself is one of the best anime adaptation to date, which far surpasses many others you see nowadays. I would urge anyone who loves some romance with an overflowing cast filled with charm.  And a slight twist to give this a try. I can guarantee for many that it won't disappoint. It certainly did not for me, and I had an absolute blast watching this till the end."
4224,"As I always say with this type of anime that involve love.... opinions are really subjetive, cause honestly, love is one of the most subjetive things on the world. That said, I think this is the best romance anime ever, and for many years has always been my favourite anime of all time.

The strongest part of Toradora! are the characters. Every character is really, reaaaaaally well done and always have a real and logical/coherent way to ""do what/act how"" they do. I have seen a lot of anime, and there is a lot of them were sometimes certain characters act or do things really different of what you would expect based on the personalities they were given, just to make certain situations more dramatic or whatever. After having watchet Toradora! several times (too much probably), I can definitely say their characters feels very coherent and real, and that helps A LOT to make the plot really touching.

Aisaka Taiga, the main female character of Toradora!, is what people would usually call a Tsundere. But contrary of what a lot of people think, being a tsundere is not about being really aggresive and kicking everyone asses at all times. I think Toradora! explains really great through this character what a tsundere really is and why is that they are like that.

!A tsundere is a really really shy person, so shy that he/she act aggresive to ""evade"" embarrasing situations. A lot of time they don't even like/want to be/say those aggresive things, they even think the opposite (Note: Read Vanilla Salt -1st ending- english lyrics). Tsunderes are so shy they just can't avoid to run away of embarrasing situations, they get embarrased so easily, even if you tell a Tsundere he/she is really good at something, or cute, they will get embarrased and will say something aggresive to end that situation. They can be really glad, or even want to say ""you too"", but they are too shy they just can't, they are not capable of saying what they want. Pretty often tsunderes hate being it, they want to say one thing but they just... they can't. They really want to be more open, but they are so extremely shy they struggle SO much to be like/say what they really are/want.

Also, tsunderes don't even have to act violent or aggresive, they can also act confident, or even funny. It's just that on anime they usually act violent, and also cause when a tsundere acts violent is more noticeable that when, for example... Okabe Rintarou acts crazy/funny. Cause yea, Okabe Rintarou is tsundere too. Bet a lot of ppl dissagre/didn't notice that. Also this may sound weird but, my source is really good I would say cause... I am a bit tsundere too IRL xD That's why I understand really well characters like Taiga and other tsundere characters.
!

Toradora!'s plot is basically their characters. Their feelings, their mistakes, their struggles.

Takasu Ryuuji, main male character, has a crush for Kushieda Minori, and his best friend is Yuusaku Kitamura. Both Minori and Kitamura are in the same class with Ryuuji. Ryuuji's hair/face makes him look like a bad guy to others, so he really doesn't have that many friends besides Yuusaku Kitamura, and always has problems with his look even when he is a really good person.

Aisaka Taiga, who is also on the same class, has a crush for Yuusaku Kitamura, and her best friend is Kushieda Minori. She is a tsundere, she is really agresive so she doesn't have that many friends either besides Kushieda Minori.

There are more important characters later, like Kawashima Ami, but those ones are the starting point of Toradora!.

So, since they get to know their crush is the other one best friend, Ryuuji and Taiga decide to help each other with that. That's it, can't say more! A lot of things happen, a lot of things change... you get to know every character on detail, and will love them, I promise! So go watch it already :)

Edit: Several typos :P"
127230,"Preface: This review is primarily a comparison of the anime adaptation of Chainsaw Man and its source material. If you clicked on this review just for an actual review of the first season of Chainsaw Man’s story, only read the introductory paragraph inside of the quote bubble.



>Chainsaw Man’s draw lies in chaos. It may be mentioned in the same breath as other modern shounen, but it is the odd one out. At times, it can feel like it goes out of its way to break norms and conventions. Its main characters are more governed by primal instincts than those of typical heroes. Characters that are more anchored to reality either die or start to become more detached as the world and characters around them. For nearly half of the entire season, its main character’s primary motivation is to fondle a girl’s boobs. This type of chaotic attitude can get out of hand quickly, leading to an incoherent story. However, Chainsaw Man pulls a very important trick. While it poses under the illusion of chaos, under closer inspection, it's supposed chaos starts to become far more orderly. Chainsaw Man examines what constitutes a normal life as a human being. What does it mean to have a normal life? What does it mean to be human? In its more deranged characters, like Denji and Power, these themes manifest themselves by developing them in ways where they are learning how to feel basic emotions of life, like empathy and motivation. By contrast, the one main character that already has actual motivation and drive, like Aki, learns to detach themselves from it in ways that lets them enjoy the pleasures of life. This is the consistent thematic throughline in this story, even if it is intentionally invisible. It is the glue that keeps Chainsaw Man coherent in its chaos. And it is also what makes it click. What makes Chainsaw Man work is in how it imbues its characters, world, and story with seemingly idiosyncratic elements. Even if these elements don’t seem like they fit together at all, when taken in its whole, it forms a beautiful picture. Although its themes surrounding the nature of humanity aren’t fully matured yet, the seeds are planted for a beautiful blossom. 8.5/10

However, to leave a review at just that is to be a tad disingenuous. My short write up can easily apply to both the anime and manga versions of this story, since it only touches on story and plot details. This is a by-product of the anime being extremely faithful to its source material storywise. There is very little deviation from the original storyline, not even breaking from the manga’s weaker plot elements. It is a very faithful adaptation in that sense. Plot is always half of the picture though. In the transition of mediums, presentation needs to be taken as much, if not more into account. Here is where the problem with a Chainsaw Man adaptation lies. Chainsaw Man’s manga is a convention-breaker in the plot-sense, and it also is that way in its presentation. 

Compared to most contemporary popular manga, Chainsaw Man is crude. It lacks much consistency when it comes to art quality, with faces commonly being underdrawn and environments being under detailed or blank. But what it lacks in the detail it gains unique in framing and paneling. In comparison to its competitors, Chainsaw Man’s manga possesses a paneling style that is reminiscent of live action cinematography. There is a real feeling of kinetic motion that can be a bit hard to describe in words. 

Here is an example, take the end of the Leech Devil fight when Aki summons the Fox Devil. 

img()

It is hard to express manga panels through AniList images without clogging up the review, so it is best to experience this moment through the turn of a page and not through a horizontal image of all four pages laid out. This moment is Chapter 10, Pages 12-15.

In three of the four pages where the summoning takes place, the point of view remains stationary. This stationary point of view familiarizes ourselves with the space that is established, from Aki’s point of view. When Aki’s hand moves upwards, it goes from the bottom panel of the first page into encompassing the full second page. Although it cuts back to Aki briefly, the fourth panel features the Fox Devil encompassing the full page, eating the Leech Devil. The framing of objects in the moment leads to a feeling as if we are looking at Aki’s point of view, staring down at the Leech Devil. What makes this moment most impressive is that motion is established through the simple turn of a page. Our brains can fill in what happened within the page turn, leading to an illusion of movement. It is like how animation fools our minds with smooth movement despite being a series of moving images, but it is through a medium made up of solely stationary pictures.

Here is that same moment in the anime:

webm(https://i.imgur.com/HDxmvd2.mp4)

The end of the Leech Devil fight in the anime has the animation, it has the higher visual fidelity, it has the sound effects, but it isn’t nearly as special as its manga counterpart. This isn’t due to any changes in the framing of the moment, because it is nearly the same. By complete necessity, the motion of Aki’s hand movement has to be explicitly stated by the animation. However, a sense of motion in a medium where things don’t typically move is different from a sense of motion in a medium where everything moves. It is just that this moment specifically works because it is in a manga format. Although its techniques are replicants of those found in audiovisual mediums, the end product ends up having an impact that only something in a manga might have. Any attempt to transition it into animation would water it down due to the juxtaposition of techniques and mediums being completely gone. In transitioning into an audiovisual medium like animation, much of the appeal of a moving camera being emulated on paper is lost when it no longer becomes emulated. Much of the more clever moments of paneling get dampened in their anime-equivalents just due to them not being in a manga format anymore. Moments where techniques that were adapted into the manga medium were used can’t have nearly the same impact just due to those techniques being used prevalently elsewhere. Other moments where this type of paneling technique that is lost in adaptation happens in moments like when Power kills the Sea Cucumber Devil, the beginning of the Katana Man fight, etc.

Much of a Chainsaw Man adaptation would be difficult just due to Tatsuki Fujimoto’s idiosyncratic style of art and manga. He is an unconventional mangaka, but he is one that would squeeze the most out of the medium he is working within. Chainsaw Man is great because he can consistently push the medium to its near limit. However, an anime adaptation of Chainsaw Man can’t do that without a direction that is comparable to the manga’s creation of cinematography in a flat space. That is a hard task, and any attempt to create a new direction  without a strong idea or foundation could lead it to easily backfire. So the anime adaptation plays things very safe in terms of visual direction for the most part. Although a scene like the Fox Devil summoning is far better in manga format, the anime adaptation of it was probably the safest way to adapt it. The risk of unwatchability of a scene is persistent when not every element of it is in tune.

At the end of the day, adaptation relies on interpretation. How one would understand Chainsaw Man is key to knowing what they would think about the manga or anime. Is it prestige shounen or is it something else entirely? If you have been reading this review, you may see that I have a very strong preference towards the “something else” angle, but all pieces of media are subject to one’s own interpretation, and to act like there is a correct answer to this question is to be a ridiculous person. Media is made for its medium, and to adapt it into something else will naturally involve infusing one’s interpretation of the work within it. MAPPA’s anime adaptation of Chainsaw Man leans a lot more towards the “prestige shounen” angle, which is a very valid interpretation of what Chainsaw Man as a story is. Even if the visual direction isn’t in the direction that I would like, it is still visually stunning. I know that I have been poo-pooing this entire adaptation for this entire review, but just know that it is because of very subjective factors that are inevitable. Just know one thing,





Just because Chainsaw Man stands out among prestigious shounen, doesn't mean its anime adaptation loses out on the full love and care that other prestige shounen have in their adaptation. As a matter of fact, saying something is “prestige shounen” is usually far from derogatory when discussing presentation. Like others like it, the visuals and animation is top-class. Obviously, the fight scenes are a feast for the eyes. Sure, the CGI is a bit noticeable at times, but it doesn’t look so bad that I would start an [online petition](https://twitter.com/tomogetback/status/1606724288920297472?s=46&t=SIr5bi-Lzo-lV4EbS6NyrQ) over it. That is the thing that jumps out the most with the visuals, as is with any of the anime’s contemporaries. However, the anime has an absurd amount of detail in its environments. The manga’s underdeveloped backgrounds are now contrasted with the anime’s overdetailed backgrounds.

img()

look at this hallway, it looks so good, i think i am legitimately obsessed with it

Combined with extraordinary sound design, the Chainsaw Man anime becomes one of the most immersive anime in recent memory. This culminates in the sequence of Aki’s morning routine, a nearly two minute long anime-original sequence at the end of Episode 4. His morning routine is absurdly overdetailed and absurdly well animated. 



uh, my computer’s storage is full so i can’t download the video of aki’s routine and put it in my review

go watch it on your VERY LEGAL anime streaming service of choice, and if you have already watched it, go watch it again, it is the thing the anime medium has been leading up to for a 100 years



However, if there is one singular blemish on this adaptation, it would have to be the rather dull color palette. Chainsaw Man is a chaotic story, and judging from many of the [volume covers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6fZia9XoAEdxxF?format=jpg&name=large), and even [the EDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEwAiwttN10), it should have a very colorful color palette. A chaotic story and a chaotic cast of characters should breed chaotic colors. However, the color palette of the anime remains extremely dull. Compare this moment from the anime and the manga.

img()
img()

The manga lacks any color, but it makes up for it in contrast. That contrast between the light outside and the darkness in the cart car is what sells the moment in the manga. In the anime, there is a little bit of contrast, but it is dampened by everything looking extremely gray. Considering the existence of nearly every piece of Chainsaw Man media and the colorful color palettes of most other prestige shounens, this is a very weird flaw for this show specifically to have.

Well that was a bit of a negative note to leave on. I can’t think of a better way to transition into the conclusion though, so yeah.


Chainsaw Man’s anime provides a good lesson in adaptation. The change in medium will always lead to a different story being told. Even if all plot beats are completely retained, there will always be a wrench that forces a change to happen. The more entrenched that piece of media is within its source medium, the harder it becomes. Going from manga to anime is comparatively way easier than say, from anime to live action, but it still provides its own challenges. Losing aspects in adaptation is inevitable. To try to adapt everything completely faithfully is to play a fool’s game. If you fail, people will just go and see the source material since it does everything you tried to do but better. The key in adapting faithfully is to build off its own strengths completely unique to it while still retaining the original’s feeling and story.

Is the Chainsaw Man anime better than its manga? I don’t really think so. The manga provides a far more unique experience that would be hard to find elsewhere. The anime is forced to whittle down many of its more unique elements, and just for that, I think that it is worse. However, there is a very strong argument to be made that it is better. The truncated uniqueness of the story is made up for by having some of the best animation there is to offer in the industry as well as being one of the most immersive. Chainsaw Man’s anime and manga are both very good pieces of media that I would highly recommend. It is just that they are very good in two different directions.

105333,"Story: 8/10

This show doesn't have spectacular storytelling, but it's highly entertaining nonetheless. To summarize, following the unexpected and sudden petrification of humanity, nature has taken over and thousands of years pass while mankind remains imprisoned in statuesque form. The story then follows the exploits of Senkuu Ishigami and company, whose singular goal is free all of mankind from their stone prison. What I really liked about the story was that although it's shounen, it still has a captivating story with new world building coming week after week. If you like survival and civilization building, this is one of the best shows out there. However, the background story leaves a kind of meh taste in one's mouth with the cliche antagonists wishing to just destroy science while the protagonists wish to do the opposite. One of my favorite plot points of the story was the reveal of the !villagers actually being descended from Senkuu, something I didn't expect at all and was very surprised.!

Characters: 7/10

Most of the characters in this show aren't memorable by any means and only have surface level plot and character development, with most just being cliche's. Rich with stereotypes like muscle-head with no brains, strong girl with an attitude, and scientist with no athletic ability, this show doesn't distinguish itself from other shounens with it's lackluster characters and dialogue.

Visuals: 8/10

The show has pretty good animation, with the only complaint I have are the clannad-esque eyes of the female characters where they look like hammerhead sharks their eyes are so far apart. Apart from that, the show rarely uses CGI and animations are pretty crisp, especially in fight scenes where they really need to be.

Audio: 9/10

I really enjoyed the opening and ending songs of this show, with all of them being certifiable bangers in my book. The sound effects used in the show are also good, with nothing being audibly terrible or repetitive.

Enjoyment: 10/10

I really enjoyed this show, there wasn't a single week when I started watching where I wanted to wait a few weeks for more episodes or got bored in any way. The civilization building in this show is highly entertaining in my opinion, with an ""invention of the week"" scheme that always leaves you wondering what's going to be developed next by Senkuu and company. Characters aren't annoying, story always progresses smoothly with nothing that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and most of all, the story always throws the most unexpected curve balls that just enthrall you even more.

img()

Overall: 8.4/10

Ultimately, this show is a very enjoyable watch and even has bits of educational elements thrown in. Although it doesn't have storytelling that will leave a significant lasting impression and is comparable to a Saturday morning cartoon, if you're looking for something light-hearted and fun, then this is the show for you.

—Violet Evergarden

img()

Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece that will make you feel once again through its brilliant storytelling and excellent presentation of emotions.  The stories revolve around our protagonist, Violet Evergarden, and how she meets different people and has unique experiences through her job as an Auto Memory Doll to eventually grow as a person and understand human emotions better. These experiences enable her to not only understand other's feelings better but also hers.



Violet Evergarden is beautifully crafted in many senses. The stories are touching and sincere in how one sympathizes easily with all the characters. Not only are the emotions portrayed throughout the series relatable and truthful, but the way in how they are presented in the series make them very strong and profoundly beautiful. They tug at the heartstrings that some have long forgotten they had because of their extended lack of exposure to impactful content such as Violet Evergarden. Every story they have to offer is packed with emotional content and the way they pack it all together and present it is alluring which brings me to my next point—visuals. 

The series' visuals are stunning regarding the animation style, color schemes, and lighting. It is a series that is appealing to the eye much like pieces of art with many scenes being incredibly detailed and being rich in color. There is no mistake in saying that it is one of Violet Evergarden's strongest aspects is in it's visuals. Not only is it all visually pleasant but it isn't tiring on the viewer to keep watching it. 

Finally, last but not least, the characters. Our main protagonist, Violet, is very charming. Make no mistake, she has her flaws and shortcomings but these all contribute to her growth being much more enthralling and beautiful. She is a lovable character. One of those for which you actually root for and wish them the best of luck. This is very good since the series focuses on her development on understanding emotions and how to articulate them. Furthermore, Violet isn't the only good character in this series, albeit the most important one. Since all of the stories are so heavily emotion packed, most, if not all the characters have actual personality, issues, and purpose. They actually feel very human, especially so after meeting with Violet. 

Throughout the various arcs of Violet Evergarden, the show deals with various themes like dealing with the I Ii II L of loved ones, understanding and articulating emotions, the importance of proper communication, love (of course), and many others. All in the form of beautiful stories. 

My linguistic capacity can't truly do justice to how good Violet Evergarden is. It is a series of compelling story after compelling story. The characters are charismatic while feeling very human since have more depth than most others. At first, I came because of the beautiful animations; then, I stayed because of the beautiful stories. All in all, Violet Evergarden is a precious anime that tugs at the heartstrings of those who watch it. It is beautiful."
20613,"spoilers for Akame ga Kill

Akame ga Kill is an endearing case of stupidity and an inability to take itself seriously when it needs to while taking itself seriously when it shouldn't. It's far too edgy for its own good, and it's a riot to indulge in, thanks in no small part to its incompetence, blatant spelling out of already black and white matters, and it's tonal incoherence...or at least it starts that way. It then grows into a more generic and edgy anime that tries and largely fails to wring intended emotions out of us with mostly generic and bad characters, equally badly inserted humor, and improper backstory dumps that are either too early and never reinforced or too late and never reinforced. Alright so, just how bad can it really be with all of that said? Is it some part of Akame ga Kill's plan to kill our brain cells until all we can say is ""ga""? Well, with that little conspiracy theory out of the way, let's find out, shall we?

There is something to be said when your first episode is so rushed, edgy, and tonally incomprehensible, that it automatically informs you that this show is not gonna be pleasant. I mean, the first episode is schlock at its finest, hence my accusations at the preamble. I mean, it doesn't even name a single location, and in fact, not a single location in this series has a proper name, which really sells how horrific the world-building for this show really is. After Tatsumi is roped into joining Night Raid, episodes 2-8 are, for most part, asshole of the week type episodes, at least until two of its members die: Sheele in episode 6, and Bulat in episode 8. It is here that we encounter a few more problems (one of which sorta surfaced in episode 1 but could've been rectified). 

First, the Danger Beasts. We know not of much of the species present here, and there are no real defined danger tiers. They're just there for people to kill while being acknowledged as powerful beings. Second, and thankfully this goes away, but this section of the series is so blatant about being black and white that when a terrible person is having a villain monologue, the anime decides to visualize them as literal monsters, because the audience of gore and boob-loving 14-year-olds apparently needs to be blatantly told that these awful people are monsters.  Subtlety; it's what this series rarely has. Thirdly, the goddamn tone-shift comedy moments. Episode 1 is a major example of this, with the show constantly cutting its serious or even sad mood short in order for a quick, unfunny gag, and then it cuts back. It's really jarring and tonally incomprehensible at times. Finally, and this is the most pervasive and problem-encompassing of the issues, the Imperial arms. 

There are 48 of them (yet we never see even half of them), and for some reason, none of these can be recreated with modern day AGK technology and magic (because of course a magic gun can't be manufactured; that would make sense) and they each have hidden abilities that are often conveniently pulled out of a character's ass (especially Akame's from episode 24 (which somehow doesn't poison her like it does for anyone else who gets cut), Esdeath's from episode 21 which freezes time for an unknown amount of time for the will of the writers to screw her or someone else over, and Tatsumi's golden Incursio form from episode 23). Don't get me started on Mine's ""Pumpkin Pinch"" which almost always occurs when she decides that she's in a pinch without actually being in one (because outnumbered automatically equals pinch). Also, the Imperial Arms are only compatible with a user if said user has a great first impression of it, which is insanely dumb since that means the only way for it to choose you is for you to geek out over it, and nothing else. And, if you allow me to jump ahead for a bit, episode 23 introduces an asspull in which there were this secret Divine Imperial Arms all along, jacking up the count from 48 to 49, and being strong enough to fuck over the unnamed city (you heard me). We'll return to this travesty moment in a bit since we gotta move on with the actual plot of the series, which is also a travesty.

Episodes 9-19 are effectively part 2 of the show, with part 1 being what i described earlier and part 3 being...we'll get there. This new part brings out a new organization by this evil empire that Night Raid has fought against, called the Jaegers, comprising of 7 powerful members of the Capital, most notably, the brutal ice wielder, Esdeath. Tatsumi gets his ass captured, escapes, and then Dr. Stylish (like an Idiot), leads an assault on Night Raid with his bio army, not even informing or bringing along the other Jaegers like a smart member would do, and of course, after Susanoo is introduced  to fight alongside Night Raid, Stylish gets his ass killed by Akame. Then, after Chelsea comes in and both she and Susanoo are indoctrinated into the group, and Tatsumi and Esdeath are teleported to and back from an island, we get Kurome's ability to revive fallen members and danger beasts (and she could've brought Chelsea and Bulat back to really hamstring our heroes but she isn't that smart), and both Bols and Chelsea die. Then, the 4 Kouken Temple Rakshasa demons, 3 of which are killed by Lubbock in the exact same episode they're introduced, which is just plain pathetic. I mean, the Garou Knights from Fairy Tail were a more credible threat than these guys; at least the Garou Knights lasted for more than one episode. The final demon member gets killed by Tatsumi really easily in the next episode (in the anime, not in the manga), and Seryuu is killed. 

Now, for the final 5 episodes: the anime original episodes. Here, both groups are brought down to 2 living members, with the deaths of everyone except: Akame, Najenda, Wave, and Run. Even main character Tatsumi dies, which is rare. That guy who teleported Tatsumi and Esdeath (his name is Shura) and Lubbock kill each other after a Night Raid Plan goes wrong and Tatsumi is captured by Budou (who kills and is killed by Mine), and Susanoo sacrifices himself against Esdeath to get everyone (including Tatsumi) out of a wrecked colosseum. Akame and Kurome duke it out (Kurome apparently is slowly dying from the drugs she was injected in when she was a kid, and she still didn't try to summon anyone from Night Raid to really torment Akame in battle like a smart wielder of her weapon would do in her situation), and then that new Imperial Arms appears with the young boy emperor using it to wreck everything in episode 23, where the story takes one final plunge from awful to rock bottom. Then, Akame and Esdeath duke it out with asspulls aplenty, and then we actually...get a satisfying finale. 

I mean it when I say that the finale to this series is genuinely good, at least the second half of it, after the whole Akame vs Esdeath fiasco. The horrible prime minister who made the empire toxic ended up getting his head smashed by Leone (who get shot a bunch of times by him), Leone says goodbye, goes back to her now happy city (or something, we don't know the name or even if it's a city, town, or village) and the dies there while knowing the difference her and her group's efforts made, and the empire gets a new mode of government, with both main groups (Jaegers and Night Raid, or what's left of them) dissolve and join together (except Akame) and Najenda says one last goodbye to the already dead Lubbock, carrying his headband. Despite the idiotic final fight and the edgy and even more idiotic nature of the series, the finale is genuinely satisfying and sweet, which is far more than I can say for any anime of or near Akame ga Kill's admittedly low caliber.

A majority of the characters in Akame ga Kill barely do anything to avoid being totally one-dimensional, especially our protagonists, and a lot of them do incredibly stupid things, including my Dr.Stylish and Kurome examples from earlier. Another problem with these characters is that backstories are handled horrendously. They are often used as death flags like with Bulat and Bols (in which they die either the same episode or the next episode afterwards) almost never actually animated (since we either see them explain it with no flashback footage or they're so short that they only last up to 25 with little animation) with the only exceptions being Sheele's, Akame's, Kurome's, Najenda's and Esdeath's backstories, 2 of which are mainly done in the episode Kurome dies where the backstories of both her and Akame are fully shown instead of partially shown, and the rest, barring Najenda's, never really being reinforced except at one key moment, with no better example than MIne's generic ""raised and bullied in the slums"" backstory that has no remote elaboration on anything like why she joined Night Raid. It's bad enough that one of these backstories are used for ""episode I die in"" scenarios in which we never really got to connect with a character and see many facets of him/her, and it's bad enough that some of them (like Wave and Lubbock) don't even have backstories, but some are down with literally no provocation or narrative reason, like Leone's and Mine's (until MIne's gets reinforced in episode 19 so that she can kill Seryuu). In fact, I can't even remember Leone's backstory, just the fact that she has one.

The protagonists of the series (Night Raid) are pretty terrible and largely generic, and it's pretty sad when most of the notable villains are better written and more likable than them. Let's start with Tatsumi. In the beginning, he an unlikeable and pompous idiot, and through development, he becomes a very, very generic protagonist. Bulat, his ""bro"", has 2 traits: manly, and gay; that's all there is to him aside from his death flag backstory. The two have a brotherly dynamic akin to Simon and Kamina frkm Gurren Lagann, and it lasts an eerily similar amount of time as Simon's and Kamina's, with eerily similar impacts to their respective MCs, except Simon and Kamina are legendary characters while these two just suck. Akame is one of the better protagonist, though all she amounts to is an edgier, discount Saber with a twisted poison weapon. Lubbock is a generic badass pervert who manages to get the most amount of important kills next to Akame now that I think about it. Sheele is a typical hot, clumsy who is more interesting due to her also being a savant in killing people, and Leone is the energetic, fan-service tease. Now, Mine...where do we begin with her...

Mine is the my most hated character in this show by a gigantic margin, one of the worst Tsunderes in history, and one of my most hated characters in fiction, up there with the likes of Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass and Shin Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny; I am not kidding here. Her levels of hypocrisy are unmatched in this show, her bitchy and even lethal attitude and actions towards Tatsumi is infuriating to the point where I nearly dropped the show because of her on multiple occasions, and by the end, she just becomes a by the numbers tsundere in all aspects. There is literally nothing good I can say about this character except that I'm glad the show killed her off. Fuck Mine and everything about her!

Chelsea, conversely, is my favorite character, in large part due to how she manages to aggravate Mine, and the fact that she has lollipops. She's a bit harder for me to define in a singular characteristic, but she's very playful, cold, and somber all at once, thanks in no small part due to her backstory (that is unseen) of her previous team dying in front of her. Susanoo is very picky about details and is simply the stoic cool guy that has literally every single convenient housekeeping trait a woman wants in a man: the perfect husbando, if you will, which is the antithesis of Sheele's character. Najenda is simply a military leader who kicks the ass of anyone who offends her. That wraps up the Night Raid members; now for the Jaegers...and everyone else...shit.

Esdeath is a hot, powerful yandere sadist who has this ""survival of the fittest"" mentality. Refreshingly, she also feels great pity for any comrade who dies, and often leaves a few people alive in hopes that they'll get stronger in order to provide a greater challenge for her since she's a blood knight. Unfortunately, the filler episodes betray her character big time by making her only the bare bones version of what I described with none of the added remorse and ill-intended mercy I mentioned prior. Wave is basically Tatsumi, but better in every way imaginable, including fashion sense, hair, and Imperial Arms, so we don't really need to go over him and his lack of backstory. Kurome is a more crazed likelier than Akame is, and she also really, really wants to be the one to kill her. SHe's also dying from the drugs injected into her in her backstory that made her a better assassin, which wasn't brought up or remotely hinted at until episode 20. Run was a teacher until his students died in which he decided to take the Suzaku Kururugi route of trying to change the government without actually doing anything other than becoming a soldier in their ranks, and he's a very suspicious and uninteresting character. I can't really remember much about him other than his backstory, methods, and angel wing Imperial Arms. Skipping Dr.Stylish because all he is, is a crazed and stupid mad scientist who really likes when things are ""stylish"". Bols is probably the best of the bunch. His intimidating mask is to cover up how he is insanely shy to the point of not wanting to show his face until Esdeath takes the mask off and makes him eat with the very welcoming Jaegers in probably the most heartwarming scene of the show. He even has a wife and kid whom he communicates within an adorable and actually real manner. He basically carries the more human and successfully emotional side of Akame ga Kill, and while the show tries to hard to be emotions, it rarely works and I'll explain why later. Still, while Chelsea is my favorite character here, Bols is easily the best written, even if that doesn't really mean much here.

I'm sure I'm in a minority when I say that I don't hate Seryuu Ubiquitous. That doesn't mean that she's a good character, but she easily could've been. Plus, I have a bias for anyone who manages to hurt or aggravate Mine consistently, except Tatsumi 'cuz he's lame. They try to make us emotional for Seryuu and put her in a more sympathetic light despite her hypocritical, knight templar tendencies, but they fail miserably. They either do it too early or too late, and no better example than with the death of Dr.Stylish. She didn't interact much with him but then we see her cry over his grave and have a backstory moment about how he was her patron and that he gave her multiple gun implants. If this series was written better, we would've seen them have a really strong, established connection like with Tatsumi & Bulat. Her violent side is also cartoonish as hell to the point where I can't hate her; reason being, I can never take her seriously with those facial expressions that make Code Geass wince. I mean, shark teeth? This is supposed to be taken seriously yet her face becomes the kind of expressive that feels like she belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon. But enough about her and why I can't take her seriously; let's discuss the other people!

Prime Minister Honest (why?) is a manipulative, fat, gluttonous, greedy monster, as if he was the poster-boy for his archetype. Though his dinner interactions with the child emperor (who doesn't even have a name despite being important, especially in episode 23) are genuine-feeling and nice. Shura is a typical complete monster, treating people's lives like toys and Budou is a general who randomly shows up in episode 20 while also being talked about in some of the middle episodes, and he's just an OP general dude, nothing more than that. Plus, he, a being who is supposedly stronger than even Esdeath, is killed by Mine...wow. I already mentioned the 4 demon guys, and I'm literally not even gonna mention any of the minor characters from episode 1-8 or any of the guys summoned by Kurome; they're not worth mentioning whatsoever and have dreadfully dull characterization at the best of times.

While this is not as well animated as say, Steins;Gate, Studio White Fox still did a pretty good job with a lot of the animation and set-pieces of Akame ga Kill, even if their trademark White Fox eyes are unfortunately missing. There are some great looking set-pieces, like the destroyed Imperial Arms used in the background of the Akame vs Esdeath fight. There is also insanely minimal CGI which is a rarity in anime nowadays. The fights are often well animated and the different fighting styles of the weapons are all in full display, from swords to gunplay to strings and what have you. Even the danger beasts look interesting to a decent extent. This isn't Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works or anything, but it still looks pretty good, especially the Akame vs Kurome fight, even if a lot of the earlier fights use the bad DBZ spam thing of characters pulling off an insanely unrealistic amount of hits with things.

The OST is pretty decent, with some really standout tracks like the amazing catchy Hindi track ""Sakaba"", the rustic-feeling ""Kinpaku"", or the amazing and most notable track of all: ""Le chant de Roma"". Also, the emotional ""Sheele OST"" and ""Yume Monogatari"" are just beautiful, even if the show doesn't do as well in making the emotional moments work as well narratively. OP1 ""Skyreach"" by Sora Amamiya, is a mostly generic OP but I always like the part right before the chorus, and the final 13 or so seconds. OP2, ""LIAR MASK"" by Rika Mayama, is bloody amazing and if used for a better anime that was long enough for it to feel like a journey, would honestly be really gratifying and tear-jerking; it is that amazing, even if this show is unworthy of it. Both EDs are mainly generic and not noteworthy despite trying to be emotional. 

The dub is pretty bad. I cannot recognize a single person in the cast list, so I guess this was to be expected. Some voices work well and make certain insignificant moments better, but the voices of Akame and Esdeath in particular are really not working for the characters, and Akame's often sounds flat as sin, and some emotional moments are even ruined by the dub script and voices. Stick to sub for this one.

Inevitably I was going to be really harsh on Akame ga Kill, since it's a pretty terrible show in and of itself. It manages to cycle through almost every single kind of bad you can think of, but I could never bring myself to hate or, or even truly dislike it. You'd think that I would since it has given me almost every reason to, but I simply can't. The first two episodes were hilarious in how bad they were while 3 and 4 were infuriating (and guess which character made them that way and nearly made me drop the show because of it). Then, with aggravating and hilarious exceptions, this show put me in this serene trance of mild boredom. I was never all that angry but never all that entertained, just, at peace in my mind while watching this show. I could've never predicted that from a show like this, and it's because of that, that I'm not angry at it or showing no mercy, even if the way I tackled the plot and characters may make you think otherwise. 

Akame ga Kill is an edgy, silly show that tries way too hard to be cool and shocking while simultaneously trying way too hard to be emotional, despite the script failing to make it work. It fails to establish a strong enough and compelling enough connection between a lot of its characters for their deaths to wring out the emotions they should, like with the death of Sheele, even if the music is just begging you to cry. It beseeches you to feel for these generic shounen characters in this fake seinen world but it just doesn't know how to build anything up properly, nor does it even use its shounen elements properly. It's an absolute mess that was simply blessed with a good animation studio and some good music. It tries and fails at almost every opportunity, rarely earning anything, even if there are subtleties and sweet moments worth defending. Well, with all that said, this has easily been the hardest review I've ever had to do by a gigantic margin, so, thank you for reading, and I bid you adieu."
104276,"I'll preface this review with the fact that no, this isn't going to be a positive review and no, I didn't like this season. 

With that out of the way, feel free to scroll down and downvote because you don't agree with my opinion.

Story: 3/10
I found the story and plot development of this season to be remarkably unremarkable, especially the school festival arc. I will admit, however, that Chisake is quite an interesting villain and I enjoyed his arc. It's quite tragic that one of the most interesting villains in a while is now just stuck in prison, where all we have now villain-wise is Sasuke and his band of misfits. The final fight with Chisake was pretty meh as well, in my opinion, Eri just healing Deku, or rather, reversing his body in time, is quite an ass pull. It's on par with the ass pulls you'd find in shounens such as JoJo, like Star Platinum suddenly becoming the same stand as Dio's or Giorno just immediately getting god-like invincible powers. It's just cheap to build a villain up, give him great power, and then just finish him off with the protagonist getting sudden invincible power to defeat him. It's just bad, boring, and uninteresting story telling to do so. Does that mean it's not enjoyable? Of course not, it's entertaining, but is it  good? No, absolutely not, but again that's just my opinion.

Pertaining to the school festival arc, I found it to be  horrendously boring, to the point where I had to force myself to watch it. Gentle Criminal is an enjoyable villain and character, but his writing is laughably bad in my opinion. His goal was what, to infiltrate the school and go viral? It's beyond lame and they could've given him greater aspirations and greater evil plots, but no, his most evil grand scheme? Infiltrating a high school. Wow, so daring, so adventurous, so evil. It's eye roll inducing how mediocre the school festival arc was. Before you say or think it, yes, I know Gentle Criminal is a foil to Deku and that he's a representation of what Deku could've been had he not gotten his power from All Might. Even with that said, I still think this season was mediocre.

Characters: 2/10

Like many other reviewers have pointed out, this show has a problem with having too many characters in one show. What's more, is that they keep adding more and more every season. Four seasons in, and most of the characters don't even have a smidgen of character development, we don't know anything about most of them!

There's no background or development for:

- Ochako, she's just a cardboard stand-in love interest for Deku
- Bakugou, he's just Sasuke, but with no backstory and is as annoying as OG Naruto saying believe it. God I hate this character, literally all he is, is just loud, annoying, and obnoxious anger.
- Tsuyu Asui
- Momo
- Mineta
- Mina
- Denki
- Hanta
- Mashirao
- Mezou
- Fumikage
- Tooru
- Kouji
- Rikidou
- Aizawa

Even with 88 episodes of development, we know nearly nothing about these characters. They're just cardboard stand-ins for Deku, just a classroom full of nobodies, and don't even get me started on the villains of Sasuke and company, we know less about them than we do about class 1-A! It's terrible writing, and what's worse, is that they keep adding more and more characters. To compare, take a shounen like Naruto, even at episode 88, there was somewhat of a background on nearly every character, even the minor ones like Neji and Hinata. MHA is full to the brim with characters we know nothing about, they just stand there and make the protagonist look good or cheer him on, that's it. In my opinion, that's boring and lackluster writing at it's worst.

Visuals: 7/10

Not much to say, MHA has a huge budget, so the animation is crisp and high quality. With that said, I wasn't stunned or shocked by the visuals, nor was I impressed.

Enjoyment: 2/10

I did not enjoy watching this show, I had to force myself to even complete it. I cannot understand how people rate this show 8-10/10, it's just not as good compared to other shows of similar rating. It doesn't have a background meaning, it doesn't make you think, and it doesn't have a significant story of any kind. It's just cheap shounen action designed to entertain you for the brief time it's on screen. Were the fights entertaining to watch? Sure, but then after those few minutes, what then? It's just boring, especially since the second arc barely had any action in it.


My Hero Academia is a clusterfuck of characters we know nothing about, is overhyped and painfully mainstream, and has absolutely no depth to it at all. It's a mediocre show to watch when you're bored and want to see action, nothing more."
20789,"I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

The Seven Deadly Sins is an anime that makes me vomit blood.

I originally saw a few episodes of it in 2021, back when I wasn’t into anime. They were so abhorrent that they made me despise anime as a medium for a year, and I didn’t even think of touching the series with a ten meter pole. It is an utter failure of a show from beginning to end, and I have not enjoyed a second of my time watching it.

You may ask yourself (or me) why I decided to put myself through all of it today, and the answer is simple. I do not know. Maybe I had something to prove. Maybe my morbid curiosity wanted to know if my original overtly negative thoughts from two years ago were unfounded or not. Or maybe, deep down, I thought that I had simply deserved it. Either way, I have spent eight hours of my life on this show, and this is not time that I will ever be gifted back.



Ever since the myth of Arachne and Athena, it was a trope in storytelling to portray the traditional force of good as actually evil, and vice versa. This is a trope that was around for millennia and is present in many classic works of fiction. The Seven Deadly Sins attempts to execute this trope - ATTEMPTS - and fails utterly.

The main premise is that a group known as “The Seven Deadly Sins” is good, and a group known as “The Holy Knights” is evil, which is meant to be a subversion of expectations, and it is revealed to us in the first episode. The problem is that this diarchy lacks any sort of nuance whatsoever. The Knights are cartoonishly evil, and the Sins are daring, badass heroes which are not once portrayed as flawed. At that point, why have any sort of subversion? You could easily replace the names of these groups and nothing would change. There is no depth to the relationship between the groups except that one (the Knights) is evil and viewed as such by the people, and the other (the Sins) is good and viewed as such by the people.

As for the plot itself, it’s extremely generic. The Knights overthrew the kingdom, and the Sins want to bring back the monarchic status quo. They assemble a team of old friends. They fight the Knights in a boring inconsequential magical battle and they win. The good guys live and the bad guy dies. The end.



There isn’t a single character in this show that I liked. Let’s begin with Meliodas, the protagonist. He’s the captain of the Sins, as well as the Sin of wrath. He isn’t actually very wrathful throughout the show, in fact, a lot of the characters describe him as kind-hearted. This ties into what I said in the previous part of the review, “You could easily replace the names of these groups and nothing would change”, none of the Sins encompass traits that one would associate with their mark. Back to Meliodas, being the captain, he’s extremely overpowered. He defeats all of his opponents extremely easily and possesses a large healing factor that makes all of his encounters with the Knights very much non-threatening. Being a part of the demonic race, he is multiple millennia old and his love interest is a teenage girl that he consistently sexually harasses. He’s never shown to actually care about Elizabeth as a person, he keeps groping her and his pet, Hawk, is genuinely worried that he might rape her (not an unfounded worry), but Elizabeth is all over him simply because he fed her once. How sweet.

Speaking of Elizabeth, she’s just kinda there except for one scene in ep. 24 in which she pulls inherited overpowered healing magic out of her ass. For the rest of the show, she’s completely useless. She exists for Meliodas to grope and have someone to “care” for, even though any one of the Sins could’ve just as easily served that role.

She’s in that regard very similar to Diane, the Sin of envy. The first time she’s useful is when she’s really angry that Meliodas, their golden boy was hurt, and other than that she’s just in the show to be a walking fanservice balloon. Her cleavage is showing perpetually and she wears no pants, which I’m sure was vital for her character development. All the women and girls in 7DS are there to serve that same purpose, to look attractive without actually having any characters of their own.

As for the other Sins, they’re extremely unremarkable. Ban, the Sin of greed is sexually attracted to an ageless being with the body of a 12 year old (and you can’t argue that “she’s older than she looks”. She looks like a kid and Ban finds that hot, end of story), he’s also immortal which takes away any tension that the fights involving him could’ve had. King, the Sin of sloth is… present. He sure is one of the characters. So are Gowther and Merlin (lust and gluttony respectively). Though King was in the show for much, much longer than the other two, and his lack of narrative anything is absolutely inexcusable.

The villains are all single-note and practically all the same. There is absolutely no difference between Gilthunder, Hendrickson and all other Knights whose names I’m quickly forgetting. Some and later all of the Knights switch allegiances near the end of the story, which carries zero emotional or dramatic impact considering that they have taken no one’s life and are now invincible good guys. If you’re gonna pull that shit, you might’ve as well made them heroes since the beginning, literally nothing would change.

That’s it for the heroes and the villains, but there’s also one more party in this, and it’s… Arthur Pendragon, king of Camelot? Wow, ingenious naming there (more on that later). Arthur shows up during the final arc to “speak to the king”, he then fights the villains a bit and fucks off. What an amazing character, I’m sure his inclusion was absolutely necessary.

And that’s that for the characters. They’re boring at best and awful at worst, which is coincidentally how I feel about their designs.

If you call this good character design, I swear by Allah I will shoot myself right here.

img(
Half of the Sins are literally just people wearing normal clothes. Then there are the women, whose only purpose is to look hot, and Ban, who looks like a male stripper.

The Knights only fare a little better.

img(

Their armours are… fine, I suppose. There’s nothing offensive about them, but much like the Sins, they’re all too boring. I also included Griamore in the above picture because I wanted to bring up how his proportions are royally fucked.



4.1 - Worldbuilding

The show predominantly takes place in the Kingdom of Liones, in the land of Britannia, which is an extremely boring location that barely tries to expand on its world.

img(

The author took a lot of inspiration from medieval Europe, which I’m not against. However, we never get to see more of the Kingdom outside of Generic Medieval Setting #24376587. The names are also very uninspired, I mean, Britannia? Really? There’s also a place called Edinburgh, and a neighboring kingdom called Camelot, ruled by fucking Arthur Pendragon because of course it is. I guess the author couldn't be arsed to come up with more fantasy names so he literally just took names of places (and people) that already exist.

Another location that we visit is the afterlife, which the makers of the series couldn’t make interesting if their lives depended on it.

img(

It’s literally just a bunch of crystals. This is where you go when you die. This empty, crystally place. How riveting. The way they get to it is equally stupid. The characters go to a bed of flowers, think really hard about dead people, and a tornado shows up that takes them there. Mind you, people that didn’t think about the dead can also jump into the tornado and come along, how fun!

4.2 - Things Just Kinda Happen

That method of getting to the afterlife is a good example of this criticism. They didn’t actually know that’s how you go there, they just think about the dead and luckily for them it works and luckily for them it progresses the “story” (which I put in quotation marks because it would hurt my soul to acknowledge that 7DS has a story). The reason why they want to go there is because it’s “the only lead they have” on finding King, another member of the Sins.

img(
img(

Why is it their only lead? It just is! They have no reason to believe he’d be there, but he is, which is extremely lucky for our heroes.

This second example is my least favorite one, I hate it to my very core:

img(
img(
img(

Basically, Meliodas was accused of destroying an entire kingdom on his own and murdering countless innocent people (as destroying entire kingdoms usually goes). He tells old man Cain “nuh-uh” and he immediately believes him. This scene is supposed to tell us that Meliodas isn’t a murderer, but rather a good man who tried to help people. This would’ve worked if Meliodas worked hard to clear his name and prove that he is a good person, instead of just saying “I never destroyed that kingdom, trust me bro.” Why does Cain believe him? He just does!

The final example I’ll give is near the end of the story:

img(
img(

The woman in these frames is Veronica Liones (episodes 12 and 23), who stepped on a landmine and died. We saw her die (not that she looked particularly injured), we saw her utter her final words and draw her final breath. Why is she alive? She just is! Death isn’t permanent at all, don’t question it! And the fact that death isn’t permanent ties well into the next segment:

4.3 - Action to Bore You Out of Your Mind

The stakes of this show are nil.

In the very first episode, we see this man fall off a cliff:

img(

A few scenes later, here he is:

img(

The flimsy excuse is that Meliodas saved him, even though he fell much later and realistically had no time to save him. This may seem like nitpicking - because it is - but please think about what this shows us. It shows that characters can die on screen, and with zero explanation come back. This makes it so the viewer is never worried about anyone in a fight because they know that if anyone is hurt, it literally doesn’t fucking matter. And the viewer would be right! None of the protagonists ever die. I’m not saying you need people dying to make your story interesting, but what you do need to do is make it seem like a possibility that they could die, because otherwise the viewer has zero investment in the fights.

Here I’ll bring up a scene near the end in which Diane and King are fighting one of the holy knights.

img(

As you can see, she has a massive hole in her chest, and is perfectly fine. Sure, the anime tries really hard to get you to be worried for her, but this never works because we’ve established that characters we’re supposed to care about simply cannot die. Why would anyone be worried for her in this scene? King later heals her completely and it’s treated as some awesome emotional moment but I haven’t felt anything in the slightest. I haven’t felt any good emotions at all throughout any of the 24 episodes.

4.4 - There Is Zero Emotion In This Pile of Rubbage

I haven’t felt anything watching this show except for anger and anguish - if I didn’t already make that painfully obvious. The “most” “emotional” scenes are relating to Elizabeth and her sisters, so those are the examples I’ll use.

In episode 12, the aforementioned Veronica Liones “dies”. We never actually got to know her as a person, and Elizabeth, as I mentioned, isn’t actually a character. What we were witnessing were two fictional strangers, one of which was dying. For fuck’s sake, Griamore was sadder about Veronica’s “death” than Elizabeth was, not to mention that the animation didn’t help at all. Veronica on her “deathbed” looked bored out of her mind (I was too), and Elizabeth looked mildly content.

No part of this scene moves a person. It was tedious, and all I could pray for was for the episode to end as soon as it could.

In episode 18, Elizabeth meets up with her sister Margaret for the first time in God knows how long.

Wow, I sure am glad that this woman, upon seeing her lost sister for the first time in ages, exudes as much emotion as a dead horse. How amazing, thank you so much animators I love this show yaaaaaaaaaaaaay.

4.5 - The Antagonists Are Extremely Stupidly Written

I’m not even gonna touch on this one for a long time because I’ve lost all the energy required to do so. Basically, the main villain, Hendrickson, wants to bring about a prophecy. The prophecy states that there will be a big holy war between good people and evil people, and Hendrickson wants to summon the extinct race of demons to fight them. Basically, he wants to have a very destructive battle to fulfill a prophecy which doesn’t even predict anything except for the fact that one group of people will fight another. There’s also some lame reveal about covering up a murder but you really can do that without starting a religious war.

Oh also, he gets the idea for it because some kids run past him, giving him that idea completely unprompted. Isn’t that convenient? (No, it’s lazy).

4.6 - Three Romances That Are Impossible to Root For

I love a good romance anime, and because of this I despise everything that the couples in 7DS stand for:

1. Meliodas and Elizabeth - I’ve already stated that Meliodas keeps groping Elizabeth, not to mention that he’s thousands of years old and Elizabeth is 16, making their romance extremely weird. One could argue that Elizabeth is just a reincarnation of Meliodas’ wife but that doesn’t excuse the sexual assault.

2. Ban and Elaine - Elaine looks like a 12 year old child and Ban himself says so. There is also zero chemistry between them, as Ban tries to rob her of her most valuable possession (eternal life juice) and Elaine simply falls in love with him. She does try to kill him a few times, but inexplicably gets over it and falls in love.

3. King and Diane - the only one that isn’t weird from an age perspective (even though Diane acts like a 6 year old kid when she first meets King) but it’s still utterly boring. He finds her hot, and she… I don’t really know. He saved her life once. I guess that’s enough for a woman to fall in love with you. What a tired and sexist trope.



I knew fully well that The Seven Deadly Sins would be absolutely irredeemable, and I still watched it. Did I learn something? Other than the fact that I was too harsh on Demon Slayer, not really.

I feel empty. You know, usually when I finish a bad piece of fiction I try to find a way to spin it to be funny-bad. The Seven Deadly Sins isn’t funny-bad. It’s bad-bad. It’s not so bad it’s good, it’s so bad it’s genuinely the worst thing I’ve seen in my life and I never want to think about it again. 

In summation, all the characters are awful, there is no one to root for, the world is uninteresting, the animation is insulting, the writing feels like something I’d come up with for my LEGO Ninjago fanfictions when I was 7 and the action is mind-numbingly boring. 

Thank you for reading, and good night."
140960,"It’s no masterpiece, but you know why this show is so good? Because it gives me nostalgia towards my childhood. It makes me remember the Saturdays when I was a kid, and just plopped on the couch when I woke up to watch my favourite cartoons. Spy X Family is like a Saturday morning cartoon to me, in that it’s as ridiculous like a kid’s show, but ends up feeling a bit of mature than them. Another reason is that it’s so meme-worthy, since Anya expressions are like a memer’s best friend. I was impressed with the solid animation and groovy OST as well. As an anime-only watcher, I expected a bit more from this cour, but we’re just getting started, because you and I all know, there’s way more to come.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 19.5/25

The thing that stands out is obviously how unique it is compared to other anime. They managed to make a spy show about a “pretend family”, they make it cute and childish looking, but also make it really refreshing to watch. It doesn’t try to have depth, and be very thought-provoking, but what it does is charm the audience through sheer ridiculousness, with the grenade pin proposal being the pinnacle of its absurdity. This show doesn’t need depth to be honest, it’s fun even with it being a simple story. Though, some things would benefit from further explanation, like how Anya can do her mind reading, and the backstory of all the characters. Of course, I’d love to see some more plot development next cour.

ART: 9.4/10

WIT Studio and Cloverworks did a solid job of animating this series for sure. Props to director Kazuhiro Furuhashi for a solid job at creating fun cinematography and over the top scenes, like the dodgeball scene.

MUSIC: 9.6/10

The OST really evokes a sense of a spy atmosphere, while being fun and bubbly at the same time. Opening is solid, but the ending “Kigeki” by Gen Hoshino was by far my favourite ED this season, with the vibes fitting perfectly to the show, and the lyrics were really wholesome, for example, the lyrics of the chorus of the ending in English started with “Shall we hold hands and head home? What should we eat tonight? Here’s what happened today”, which feels like such a wholesome family dynamic.

CHARACTERS: 17.5/20

The characters are straight up lovable, and they each have their developments too. Loid used to be a cold-hearted spy, but after being with Yor and Anya for a while, he became a solid dad, that learned to take care of his family, and learned to trust others a bit more, even though he’s a spy. Yor is a clumsy character, yet she’s an assassin, which is as ridiculous as the plot of the show. She becomes a wonderful mother figure to Anya, and keeps Loid in check too, teaching him how to treat Anya in a nice way. Now, everyone’s favourite walking meme, Anya, is obviously cute, and gives me nostalgia of being a kid. She’s curious about things, and always wants to help the people she likes. On top of that, she can read minds, which makes for excellent comedy at times.

The side characters are also fun to watch. Franky is a ridiculous helper to Loid, and pulls off some fun costumes. Yuri has a bit of a sister complex, but it almost made for a kiss between Loid and Yor, and who doesn’t want that? Damian is a tsundere to the highest degree, but I love the dynamic between him and Anya, and of course, we all love Anya’s smug face!

ENJOYMENT: 14.3/15

Great for Saturday mornings, and I really enjoyed it. I admit, I lost a little interest in the middle of the series, but the over the top comedy and character interactions was fun.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 17.3/20

The spy theme was executed pretty well, with solid world building. The comedic elements are a bit repetitive at times, a lot of times with the comedy focusing on Anya’s “shock” faces. There hasn’t been a lot of action yet, but we’ve some engaging action scenes, and I’d love to see more of those next cour.

OVERALL: 87.6/100

A wholesome family show that everyone should watch, and will likely enjoy. It doesn’t try to be overly ambitious, and that’s fine. It’s just pure fun, and while it’s not a masterpiece, it’s just gives me such nostalgia to those Saturday morning cartoons, and this is a prime Saturday morning cartoon indeed. Looking forward the next cour two in the Fall!"
21202,"Konosuba is a show for when you wanna turn your brain off and stare at anime girls doing.... wait... What were they doing? What is even the point of this show!? The 30 that I gave the show is solely because of the somewhat interesting antagonists and the decent animation and art style.
I despise this show for 4 reasons:

Reason 1 : Plot.
What plot? There is no plot! The closest thing to an overarching storyline is ""Defeat the Devil King"". If this is the plot, why does the entire anime seem like a get-out-of-debt simulator? There's not a single major plot point in all 26 episodes. The only minor plot points I remember are the mildly interesting villains: headless dude, the masked dude, the poison dude and the thief teaching Kazuma to steal panties


Reason 2 : Comedy.
Episode 1 was the only episode that actually made me laugh. Every single joke since then seemed lame and repetitive. The most any joke got out of me was a snort. Idk how else to describe it but for a comedy anime, it's just BAD.


Reason 3 : Characters.
I can confidently say that there's not a single interesting character in the entire series. It feels like the only purpose of each character is to perform one repetitive joke, ie. Aqua: debt, Megumin: Explosions, Darkness: Horny masochist, Kazuma: panty stealing. There's close to no character development and none of them have much personality. 

You know how Naruto fans all hate/hated Sakura? Now imagine your entire anime is based around a terrorist Sakura, a masochistic Sakura, a broke Sakura and one of those useless toads Naruto always summons. That's Konosuba.
There's also so many forgettable side characters like thicc Lich, the dude with the magic sword and most importantly, the thief who taught Kazuma how to steal panties.


Reason 4 (final reason) : Target demographic. In itself this isn't a bad thing, but it feels like this show is so confused about who it's targeting that it ends up not targeting any demographic at all. So, tbh Konosuba feels like it was made for children. The plot is overly simple, the humour is dry and repetitive and there's no emotional points/gore/deaths. There's nothing wrong with that. There's lot's of fun kid-friendly shows. So, why all the sex jokes/ fanservice/ inappropriate stuff? There's so many random in-your-face sex jokes. WHY? They could've embraced either side... They could remove all the random innapropriateness or they could add an interesting plot/add emotional points and it would be so much better.

In the end, I'm not telling you not to watch the show. Watch the beginning, and if you like it then continue watching, otherwise drop it. The show is definitely enjoyable and light-hearted. It's just that the comedy isn't tasteful or subtle enough to appeal to me. From a technical, critical standpoint it's a failure but the enjoyment factor isn't completely lost."
20623,"This review will contain spoilers!

The first I time I watched Parasyte a very long time ago, I was not in the right place for judgment or appreciation. I was still wet behind the ears and didn't understand the full picture of what Parasyte is trying to convey to us. To the noobie me, it was a full-on action anime with a war between humans and this sentinel organism from outer space. I did understand it was trying to tell more, but I was unable to put it into words and feel a sense of security in what I am saying. But rewatching once again, made me realize Parasyte is whole more than meets the eye. It's a story that relies heavily on the philosophical aspect to tell both a deep and complex story. It asks questions that would make your brain hurts under normal circumstances. You know, things like what are humans, and what does it mean to be one? Who are the real devils, the parasites or the humans? When is it right to take another life? What really is right and wrong? 

These are some of the core questions that are brought up through our journey in Parasyte. It throws one into a deep state of thinking. It makes you whack your brain to a point to see an actual logical, satisfying, and fair answer can come to mind. Even if it does not, since of course, it's a rather heavy topic that not mere words and deep thought can give your resolution to. In Parasyte, we see such examples on display both with the actions of humans and the parasites themself. It explores these erudite issues in-depth and shows it to you in a way you can understand both sides, the parasites, and the humans. We see both of their evil and likewise the kind side that shooks you to your very core with emotions. Parasyte first stars Shinichi, who is just your average boy who doesn't excel at anything. He is rather timid, shy, and easily scared of bugs. One day by pure coincidence, he gets attacked by a snake-like alien creature who tries to take over his head but ultimately fails. But Shinichi loses his right hand to the snake, and the arm is no longer his own.

Parasyte uses both Shinichi and his companion Migi to explore all of the questions I've mentioned above and so much more. Migi starts out with somewhat a bland personality, lacking any emotions, empathy, and is only focused on his own survival. But since Shinichi is bounded to his life, they both must learn to live together. As Shinichi and Migi overcome multitudes of precarious situations, even close life-death calls, they start to develop a bond of friendship. At one point, Migi saves Shinichi from a certain death situation sacrificing 30% of his own being. When that happens, Shinichi slowly starts to lose his humanity. He can't even mourn for his losses and becomes emotionless unable to exhibit any kind of feelings. This is the result of Migi becoming a part of him. Since Migi already lacks those kinds of emotions, so it starts to affect Shinichi. The Migi, which is part of his heart anyway since the Migi on his hands, is beginning to develop an understanding of things and a sense of humanity.

While Shinichi loses himself as his mother is killed and gets driven by vengeance and anger to the point, it affects him negatively. Shinichi's path to ruin as he slowly loses himself is executed so brilliantly, and you learn to really understand him. He also knows both sides, the parasites and the humans, and where both are coming from. This was only possible through going hell and back and experiencing, witnessing many sides of both sides. When it comes to deep questions, Parasyte brings up. There is one in particular that never ceases to make me into a sobbing mess. I am talking about Reiko's growth going from a parasite to a human and then finally into a mother. That scene where she is getting gunned down as she walks to Shinichi as she is protecting her child is absolutely beautiful and very meaningful. Who are the real devils, humans or the parasites? In my case, this goes to the humans since they were fully aware of the child and still gunned Reiko down without batting an eye. It's such an awful, tragedic moment, but it runs deep with symbolism, and it makes it so much more impactful when you realize that's the moment Shinichi comes back from the abyss.

It's where he finally regains his humanity and can mourn for his mother. That whole scene doesn't only show the supposed enemies can be gentle too, but it also adds much-deserved respect to every mother out there. For those reasons alone, I have no qualms in saying I consider that episode, especially a masterpiece. Another proof of where the humans are the bad guys are during when they intervened in the conference building. At first, they used a sensible approach to differentiate humans from parasites. Before shit went to hell, and they gunned down anyone who was in their vicinity. It didn't matter if they were humans or not. They just wanted to completely destroy the parasites off the face of the earth without a damn trace. That's, of course, the logical course of actions, and I am not saying the humans are wrong to think that way. I am just saying surely there could be a different way? Just like humans, the parasites also have both the bad and the good guys when they get to mature to that level. The best example we saw by far was Reiko, Migi and of course Joe. Parasyte is honestly naive and children-like. They don't know what's right from wrong, like Migi said. 

They are just now coming into life and are just now tasting all forms of situations, emotions, actions, consequences, and so forth. Compared to humans, they are terrifyingly strong children who can easily kill you. I hope anyone gets what I am implying with this reasoning. It took Reiko a while before she became a genuinely good person. We remember how she had that funny time where she was going around laughing in a crazy voice? Now that's comedy gold. Just think if you saw a human with teeth of a head running around laughing in that kind of voice? Yeah, now that I think about it would be terrifying. She first realized these sensations when that dorky investigator slipped and fell in the restaurant. Afterward, she went on a lecture on the human psyche and experimented on her own time. This leads to a great change in her gradually over time. Then she started to also care about the child to the point, she sacrificed her life with not an ounce of hesitation. Reiko could've escaped since it clear she is among the strongest of her kind. But It makes the moment that more impactful.

Just like how, when a child is born first, don't know what's right or wrong. They learn that from their parents or through experience or realizing that there are consequences for their actions. For instance, when a child calls you some words, you rather not say. It's not untill much later when they are older that they realize how awful it is what they are saying. How much it hurts their parents and the people around them and so forth. There are many examples, but this should hopefully get the point across. So what does it mean to be humans? For me, that's to be happy, depressed, sad, angry. To love or hate someone. It's a connection like family or experience pain from an injury, stress from school-life not treating you well, and to put simply to live. It's more or less our entire being, the yin, and yang. This could also be said for the concept of life itself. Of course, people might have some different viewpoints, but here you have at least my.

Regardless of the things I have explained about, Parasyte tries to explore and show. There is more it adds beliefs to, like how fragile the humans are because of emotions and concern. But to cut to the chase, for me, that's an advantage since it means we can be flexible when it comes to feelings, and that once again makes us human and really alive. No humans are the same either, because of the concept of empathy and the broad topic of personality to mention some. As you can see, Parasyte has really made me question a lot of things, and thus it's been a genuine pleasure to experience it once again. It was on a whim, but I couldn't be happier to see all these things I couldn't see before and actually put words to the ideas it's trying to show and tell. Parasyte is arguably one of the few stories that I would say has the qualities of a masterpiece. It would not be wrong to call it that either since it has more than enough proved itself.

Sadly, Parasyte is not without flaws. First off, what was the point of Kana besides making Shinichi realize he can't feel emotions? And also, add fuel to the fire to make sure Shinichi gets thrown even further into the deep abyss? When his mom died, he only experienced anger and longed for vengeance and ultimately lost himself when he was forced to kill his mom, wearing the mask of the devil. It was not before Kana's death he got the time to realize he is not crying, even a lick. Anyway, for me, Kana was honestly a waste of potential. Sure, she is lovely and a sight for sore eyes. No doubt, my best girl of Parasyte. Still, you can't deny she set up for her own death and was way over her head. That said, it does not make the death any less impactful. I cried when Kana died, and I am still salty about how they handled her story. I saw potential in how Shinichi and Kana's relationship could grow since both had an understanding of the unknown in some way. Plus, Shinichi felt more secure about telling Kana of his secret friend than Satomi, who was all over the place.

When I first time saw Parasyte, I didn't even care about Satomi, and I was all about Kana, and honestly still am. But I can also understand where Satomi is coming from now. Regardless of what Shinichi went through, she had no idea. That was honestly her fault and our main male, who felt insecure about telling her the truth. There where multiple times where her behavior changed at the drop of a hat, from wanting to know to not wanting to know Shinichi's predicament. On top of that, there is that thing with the whole romance side plot. It was not as fleshed out as I liked, and it moved way too fast for my liking. In fact, Parasyte might be one of the best shows I have seen. But I won't deny the pacing did feel awkwardly timed at certain moments throughout the course. In other words, some things felt appropriately paced and executed like Shinichi's path to doom, before liberation and maturity. On the other end, there was not as much Shinichi and Migi interactions as one would like. It felt slightly thin and I would love to have seen it more of that. Now, don't get me wrong I still love the relationship between those two.

Migi is easily one of the best friends anyone could ask for, no doubt. I just want to tell you all my feelings on both the good and the not so good sides. Then there is the final villain, Gotoh, who started out with a rather complex, deep, frightening personality. Someone you wanted to learn more about. Then regressed back to a state of one-dimensional, boring, and mediocre villain who tried to kill Shinichi for being bested by a human. Now Reiko was a great example of how to write a villain character and then truly make you fall in love with her. Although, in the end, she became a good person. No, I am not trying to excuse her wrong decisions in the past. I am looking at the result and not the path she took to get from A to B. In that way, Gotoh also had the potential for greater things. It would make more sense to actually live up to her creator's values and beliefs in some way. Now Reiko learned to value human connection, understand what's right and wrong. What it means to be human. What it means to be a mother. 

So how about Gotoh instead of going that path could try to better the life of his kinds and indeed seem like a caring leader who wants a better future for his brethren? That would honestly make for a better story than what we ended up getting. It would put emphasis on what Parasyte is trying to showcase and deliver a more satisfying conclusion. This is just a basic scope of my idea, and I have more to go on, but it should tell you more than enough to know where I am coming from. That may be what they were going for actually, now that I think about. But, the author decided to sadly cut the story short, so that story direction didn't get across as profoundly as the other themes of Parasyte. Not to mention, the ending left more to be desired. I would love to have seen how the parasites stopped hunting humans for food and went on to fully live amongst the humans without spilling an unnecessary drop of blood. We still don't even know the full origin of them either, but that's probably intentional. Since the philosophical and character-driven aspect is the heart of Parasyte. The parasites are among others, just there to prove a point and to explore, assess, and justify the elaborate questions.

Let's discuss shortly the production of Parasyte, which is as you would expect from Madhouse top-notch. The animation is damn fluid, and the action scenes are depicted with the utmost intensity and emotions. It makes the experience even better with that gorgeous, and absolutely masterpiece of a soundtrack, which blesses our ears and the show to a greater height. All of the action scenes are so amazingly choreographed, are fast-paced, and gives you an adrenaline rush of excitement. Not to mention, those with dialogue. To put it into perspective, that beautiful last episode of Reiko was breathtakingly executed and direction. As a result of the passion, the staff put into the scenes they worked rigorously for, probably to the point of exhaustion to make sure to deliver an ultimate experience and burst of emotions. Art-style is beautifully drawn, and Madhouse can genuinely convey any forms of emotions without a hiccup to the viewers. There is also a ton of gore, and Parasyte is not for the faint of heart. Expect to see dismembered bodies, intestines in full view. It's very violent, bloody and is not afraid to show some horrifying and scary sights. Lastly, I just wanna say the OP is very catchy, addicting, and immensely bop inducing. While the ED is so soothing, beautiful, and it gives you a sense of comfort as the episodes come to an end.

Overall, I would like to say that Parasyte definitely is one of the few shows I can consider having the qualities of a masterpiece and not feel as insecure about it. It asks tons of difficult questions and adds support for them by showing and telling. Shinichi is a great example of how a real person might change in attitude as they experience hardships and more. Plus, he goes to show us how fickle, fragile, and even flexible the human race is who can change for the better or worse if given the time. I would honestly say Parasyte, for me, falls in the category of must-watch at one point in your life. It's truly a very memorable, meaningful, thought-provoking, exciting, heart-crushing, and a liberating journey you can't miss out on, or you'll be doing yourself a disservice. I highly suggest Parasyte to everyone and can't recommend it enough."
101348,"Vinland Saga is most definitely one of a kind story and one that really puts your intelligence to the test. It's one of the few I consider a masterpiece in the making as it might be easier to see those qualities more clear if you have read the manga. For now, let's discuss the anime, where studio Wit pulled out all the stops and served an incredibly amount of justice and created a fantastic adaptation. I would go as far as to even call it ""perfect."" I can imagine that even the manga readers would not have a problem with such a massive statement. It took everyone by storm when it first hit the screens and blew all the expectations out of the water for many. It's no doubt that Vinland Saga is an anime that will keep close to everyone's heart, and it's a prime example of a beautiful adaptation that exceeds the source material. Of course, let's not forget about Attack on Titan, which is another anime done by Wit studio and breathtakingly exceeds the manga in many ways.

I have to say this first Vinland Saga is among the most challenging stories to properly describe. There are multiple plot threads, and character that plays a massive role you have to take into account, and it's hard to connect everything together through words. But I'll try my best. I could start off by saying it's an intense and complex character study heavily focused on both Thorfinn and Askeladd. The story starts out simple and straightforward. Vinland Saga could take any number of directions. It's basically a slice of life of this nice and wholesome family in Island, who lives their day to the fullest. That is until one of the most influential and powerful viking groups come knocking to take their pal back with them to war. Our supposed main Thors was in the past, one of the strongest viking warriors to ever live. Until one day he up and left and built a wonderful family, and didn't want anything to do with iron and blood any more. But because of an iron rule, he is pulled back to the one thing he now hates, and ultimately dies at the hands of pirates.

His son Thorfinn, who had a sense of adventure and was this naive innocent guy previously. Now is set on killing Askeladd, the guy who more or less set up his dad to get killed cowardly. That's the story in a nutshell if you just look at the outer layer and not deeper into things. But not at all, there is so much more than meets the eye here. Vinland Saga is intricate, deep, and very philosophical, and there are multiple plot threads to take into account, as I have stated earlier. There are so many episodes that ask a tricky question. We had many brilliantly executed episodes that showcase the brutality in this period and are trying to convey something profound and heavy to the audience to boot. Our character is trying to either reach one of those things or stay stuck in the past with wars and pillaging, raping. The story is set in the 10-11th century when the vikings ran wild everywhere. And nations were conspiring to take over other lands by the use of warfare and death till one side achieves their goal entirely.

At this time, the previous residents would have forcefully been slaved to work, killed. Maybe even raped since there was no proper system at place to take care of such disgusting acts back then. I feel like Vinland Saga is trying to show us the dirty side of the world. While at the same time building to a better tomorrow through actions of the character. I think it's a realistic depiction of life, acceptance, and of course, growth. It's a story that makes much more sense the further you dive, to put into perspective. Vinland Saga is a massive puzzle piece, and while the first season answered some question through actions and subtlety, not everything might be entirely clear to some, So you might not know the full picture, as you first thought. Not to mention, this whole first season is merely a big prologue. It's about 50 chapters worth of content, the anime adapted, and yes, it sounds crazy. But that's actually the truth, believe or not.

Character is one of the key pillars of Vinland Saga, as you can see. They all feel real and important to the overall narrative. But there is one that stands above everyone. Askeladd is such a person, and without going into too many spoilers. He is easily one of the best-written antagonists you will ever see. There are so many things I could throw at you for hating him, but I have tried, and I can't help but appreciate him. Some might succeed, but I have a hard time believing you will hate him till the end. Yes, it's hard to hate such a savage cunning, witty and manipulative mad lad who has so freaking much personality and is an extremely well-written character. I could see Thorfinn not hitting off that well with many. He might come off as annoying at times since his dedication to revenge is extreme, and he might come off as linear and easy to a lot of people. It's not until toward the end, you see his potential of complexity, and once a season two arrives, it will be shown to everyone in full detail. Vinland Saga art-style, it's no doubt a piece of art and is stunning. I can't help but be mesmerized by the beauty and amount of details studio Wit puts into this adaptation.

I can't tell you the number of times I had to stop and take a screenshot of a stunning background since I just loved how bright and vividly it was depicted. Wit didn't fail to nail the mood, and each shot represents the vibe perfectly and elevates the emotions. That goes for the character details too, which looks and feels so real. The expressions are distinctive, and the level of detail is just as crazy as the background. There is gore here too, so don't expect heads and limbs flying are not to be fully censored. As for the visuals, the movements don't come off as stiff and feel fluid and dynamic. When it comes to the action scenes, it's nothing short of top-notch either. It will have your eyes glued to the screen, and you might even find yourself replaying a couple of scenes, because of just how immersive and impacting it feels. It was undoubtedly a blessing to have Wit studio adapt Vinland Saga, and they made it an unforgettable, fulfilling and an exhilarating experience without question.

Let's also add some love to the soundtrack, which nails every given setting and atmosphere to a teeth. Wit is fully able to utilize art, animation, and soundtrack together to create a sense of balance between them and really nail the emotions and scenery with the gorgeous background. I don't cry easily, and Vinland Saga made me shed tons of waterfall to the point my eyes almost got dry. As for the opening and ending song, every single track is the art of beauty and delightful to listen to. I honestly don't hate any of the tracks and was easily absorbed into the music and visuals. And both endings are beautiful and hits strong and are packed with emotions and lots of symbolism like the openings. Suffice to say, Wit Studio made Makoto cry tears of joy to see his masterwork handled so delicately and with so much care and passion.

What's negative about Vinland Saga? I am trying to wrap my brain around it, but I didn't see a thing I felt irked me to no end. There were short moments here and there where the art-style looked scruffy, but it was barely enough to cause a huge commotion. It's totally understandable Wit would have few mishaps here and there. Since they have been adapting with the utmost care and heart since the beginning. So all the animators must have felt exhausted by the end of an episode. It's more surprising they were able to deliver this kind of quality for a whole season. I have really nothing terrible to say about Vinland Saga. It's a solid adaptation in my eyes all around, and you would have to be really picky to find something terrible with it if you ask me. Maybe I could throw out the CGI was not the most pleasant whenever it was in use, but I hardly noticed, so it was never a problem for me personally.

Overall I highly recommend Vinland Saga, but I will say this too, it's sadly not for everyone. The more mature audience will enjoy it more, and it's a slow burner, so not everyone will fully appreciate it. It's also important to be aware of that Vinland Saga is profoundly character, philosophical, and historical driven story. So certainly not something you see every day and unquestionably one of a kind story. The best way to know for sure if you will enjoy it or not is to see the first few episodes and see what you think for yourself. Also, the story relies on your brain and Wit, and your interpretation might be different from many. It's not something you can fully grasp in the first watch easily. Anyway, we have more than enough content for a sequel, so let's cross our fingers in anticipation as we wait for one. The ending hints at one. I will say this much tho: its gonna be another unique experience compared to the first part. This was easily one of the best anime of 2019, if not the best, and I urge everyone to give it a shot at some point in your life. Vinland saga might possibly be a story that will stay you with for a lifetime, and it's an incredibly written one at that."
124080,"Horimiya is going to be one of the shows that I personally, will have a weird rating for. I'll explain why, but first, the show itself.

img500()


I think something that I appreciate about Horimiya is the fact that it gives a sense of realism. I absolutely love the characters (even though I wish we got proper progression for a lot of the side characters) and the interactions they have and the friendships they have honestly make me smile. The high school life in Horimiya reminds me of the old High School days of mine and it's honestly special to me. 
Obviously, our main duo, Hori and Miyamura, I thought the way their relationship progressed was very natural and easily a highlight of the show for me. Seeing each other for the way they first met and how there was basically a different side to themselves, something that they don't normally show at school, and seeing them interact in the early episodes, it felt natural to me and I appreciate that. Gotta say the same for Hori's family, especially the way they treat Miyamura. 

img500()


The side characters too, in my opinion, are great as well but this is where the show falls flat, especially in the second half. I think the side characters portrayal in the first half were great and seeing all them interact and be funny throughout the show was great to see too. I loved seeing the dynamic between everyone and the friendships were fun to watch. I wish, however, that we were given more screen time on almost all of them. In the second half, I didn't know how to feel regarding as more of the screen time was given to more of the side characters than our main duo. I honestly wished this was paced much better because it honestly did feel like they were throwing in certain chapters into an episode and hoped we would just ""get it"" or understand. It's not that I didn't feel for any of the side characters like Remi or Kono, it's just that I wish we were shown better progression for the side characters in order for me to fully understand their struggles and what they were going through. The pacing of the second half, with the more focus on the side characters and Hori and Miyamura feeling almost like side characters is where the show falls flat, I just wished we were shown more of the dynamic between every character in order for the viewers to fully appreciate what they were watching. If anything, it felt like the show had a lack of direction in the second half, if I had to add. There really should have been more screen time for more characters (meaning I wish we got more than 13 episodes). I hope that made sense.

Horimiya was a wonderful watch. With a great OST and visuals, I always looked forward to watching the show every Saturday for some fluff. I loved Hori and Miyamura's relationship and obviously the romance progression was great to watch, but I also especially loved Miyamura's character progression. The Miyamura in Episode 1 is a completely different one in Episode 13 and it shows. I absolutely loved his progression there. The show falls flat in the second half with pacing issues and a lack of direction but it ends on a great and positive note with some closure. It's definitely a recommend but I'm going to read the manga for the full experience. I do also think those who want a better coherent story is most likely not going to enjoy Horimiya as much as I did because I feel like there's a lot of content missing, especially with certain characters. I still honestly do recommend it. I'm going to miss this show and how realistic and natural it was. It's going to get a weird rating mostly because I feel like there was untapped potential and a sense of lack of direction in the second half. The first half definitely was the best part of the show. It does get a high rating because I just love how realistic it feels, especially in the High School environment. It's something I personally appreciate a lot.

112151,"Ahhhh, yes, it is finally here! Easily among the most anticipated releases of all time, Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train has finally hit theatres in Japan & is burgeoning into western markets here shortly.
- - -
Obviously, this movie is breaking all sorts of records if you have read the news within the past three months at all. In fact, it is now the undoubtedly the highest grossing movie of all-time in Japan & is likely to remain in that position for a very long time. Apparently, every citizen of Japan is rushing to theatres to finally see it like: 
img300()

The movie is a direct sequel to the events taking place in the animated TV series. If you aren't already familiar with the franchise in some capacity, watching this going in blind would be confusing. I wouldn't recommend that. However, that is unlikely to be the case because the TV series as well as the manga series is wildly popular. In fact, among the most popular franchises of all time already. 

To give some context to this review, I want to go ahead & state that I Am A Shounentard. With that being said, I have read & watched a ton of battle shounen series in my time. And, unfortunately, Demon Slayer does not particularly stand out among them. In fact, Demon Slayer is among the most generic, suffering from an over-reliance of genre tropes & gag comedy that makes the series a tonal mess. 
img300()

One second, they will be fighting for their lives to chop the big bad's head off; the next, the cast of characters will deliver some quirky one-liners. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but, it does undermine the plot elements to some extent as I am never sure when to take Demon Slayer seriously or not.

Regardless, Demon Slayer suffers the most from tropes in its character writing. The main cast of characters, quite frankly, suck. Tanjiro is the more serious mild-natured kind quiet one, Zenitsu is the never serious jokester & pervert, and Inosuke is the always emotional tough guy. These attributes alone pretty much summarize their entire character. And no character development takes place during the movie. 

At least the franchise understands its own strengths. That being said, rather than commiting runtime to actual character development, the movie would rather focus on big fight set pieces (which is a good thing). Ultimately, the fights & the animation is what makes Demon Slayer great, nothing else. 
img300()

Two main fights occur during the runtime of this film. The first of which is a fight between our main cast of three knuckleheads + Rengoku the Flame Hashira vs. Enmu. Enmu is a new big bad introduced during this arc & he has a wide variety of abilities. Foremost of which is a sleep inducement ability, which essentially makes anyone who meets his gaze fall asleep & enter a dream like state. This ability is seemingly overpowered; however, our main cast inevitably manage to combat this broken ability with a variety of methods. 
img300()

After Enmu's defeat, the next big fight set piece occurs. With Inosuke, Zenitsu, and Tanjiro all recieving injuries after the previous spat, they have to sit this one out. This is one quality where Demon Slayer seems to deviate from the tropes of battle shounen. Plot armor is not that strong in this series, seemingly anyone can die at anytime given the right circumstances. 

The next big fight is between Rengoku the Flame Hashira & another newly introduced big bad -- a member of the Upper Moons (for context, this refers to the stronger demons who have received more blood from Muzan). However, this fight is much more serious in nature & significantly better in relation to its predecessor. 
img300()

This fight is a showdown between the elite of the elite. The animation quality takes it up a notch with amazing flame particle effects emanating from the Flame Hashira himself. & it is just plain epic to put it simply. I think watching this fight would justify the time & monetary cost of watching this movie alone. 

The outcome of this battle becomes the catalyst for the next major arc to take place in the Demon Slayer franchise. Both parties become significantly wounded; however, a winner is ultimately declared in the end by proxy of actually surviving. And then, the movie ends. 

If I had to summarize my review of this film in simple ratings, I would do it as follows: 
1) Characters => 5/10 (they just aren't all that strong)
2) Story => 6/10 (just a simple continuation of the mainline series, nothing new here)
2) Fights => 9/10 (stakes are raised to the highest they have been all series) 
3) Animation => 9/10 (suffers from highs and lows; the highs are very very VERY high highs but it can be underwhelming in the less action-y moments of the film in an attempt to save budget i suppose)

If you put these altogether, I think the film is worth watching for people who are fans of shounen, like the mainline series, or just simply want to see what the hype is all about. I would recommend the film as a whole, just not to newcomers of the franchise. It has a very high production value with great animation & fight set pieces that I think most people can derive some enjoyment from.

Overall Rating => 7/10"
99423,"Caution: This review contains spoilers for this predictable show. I have specifically and very clearly marked the spoiler sections (there aren't as many as you think, only 3 paragraphs’ worth) so you can still easily read my review and do not need to worry. As for the fans of the show, enter at your own volition since you will not find this review to exalt it in any manner, so to those who consider FranXX a 10/10, keep your temper in and let's begin. If you're a regular reader, please carry on :)

FranXX was hyped a lot. And that's just the short of it, it had a huge marketing campaign and had a huge amount of anticipation with people calling it the “Next Evangelion” or a “Spiritual successor to Eva” and so on and so forth. The legendary Yabuki Kentarou was signed on doing the art for the manga adaptation for this unoriginal original and as a matter of fact, that's how I found out about the show in the first place and went in expecting the amazing show the marketing had me believe. Result? Well I can't surprise you since you might have seen the score I gave it. Yes. A mess. A terrible mess.

To begin with, the main part that is the reason fans gloss over this show, the characters. They are given little to no backstories and their roles to play are very less. Squad 13 mainly served as a bumbling group of teenagers (hmm… why teenagers in particular?) who don't know jackshit except for the so called “fact” that they must pilot the mechs known as FranXX and defeat these blue magma lover monsters called Klaxosaurs. Let that seep in. Why children? Most likely because they wanna appeal to the target audience of the show, teenagers. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be as fruitful as A-1 and Trigger thought it would because when you've got an idiotic group of teenagers who contribute nothing to character development, I don't think you end up with teenage viewers going crazy over a show. I mean, yes, teens in real life aren't always smart, but if given the chance, I'm sure they'd do something sensible when they need to, but we don't see such a thing at all. Why? All we see is random blushes and such stuff. I mean, these teens are acting like everyday teens, yes, that's fine but is this the premise to do so? A place where people are bombarded by the constant threat of Klaxosaurs? Kids are supposed to have fun yes, but not when you're literally guarding human lives from danger. 



To move away from the characters for a moment, we move to another problem with the show, its connection. And don't you dare justify it by telling me it's an episodic anime, because it sure as hell is not. In reality, it's just mixed up completely and had too many ideas to implement together and instead of choosing one idea to go with, they probably chose all and excellently failed at all of them. Why? Poor connection. To hold up a plot you need connection, FranXX didn't offer any of that at all. It just dragged on and didn't leave any mention of what happened before and most importantly WHY the situation happened before. What could possibly be the reason behind this? Simple. Bad direction. All it takes to destroy the whole hard work of a show is bad direction. In fact, about 90% of the issues with the anime can be traced back to bad direction. If the show had a good director I suppose the show would have a direction to follow, but this being FranXX, it had to follow all the directions it could and then ended up nowhere. In the first episode I had the show at a shocking 9 and if you look at it now it's fallen pretty spectacularly. This is because of the show's bad direction; events were unconnected and an irritated yours truly almost smashed his screen onto the floor . Random stuff happening here with no explanation, and then random stuff happening there without explanation, was this anime devoid of sense or something? Because I did not find any of it anywhere. And then we've got the problem that follows that the story was unexplained. Why did this happen? Why did that happen? How did this occur? Where did this issue first occur? There were many questions asked by fans, and the answer is that it was clear both studios didn't want quality, they wanted the $$$ And that's me trying to be positive, we got zilch as in reality but eh, gotta act positive. 

Needless to say, apart from a cliched mess of a story, it's disappointing in almost every other regard (read on for further explanation), serving as a reminder that it only takes one big mistake to spoil the whole effort put into an anime, or anything for that matter. Speaking of mistakes, we come to another part that had the cosplayers, fan artists and others crazy, the romance— particularly the romance between Zero Two and Hiro. First off, our two MCs. Zero Two was introduced as a waifu like character which immediately took the undeserving “deconstruction” tag which was ripped off from Eva (surprise surprise, FranXX ripped off a show) while giving us another useless MC who went by the self appointed name Hiro. Their romance was unexplained until way later into the series, an episode which even I liked, episode 13. They were largely unexplained for most of the anime’s run and it was only in the first episode of the second cour (episode 13) that tried to remedy this. Result? Thankfully good. Episode 13 was regarded as an excellent episode by even the harshest of critics since it explained a lot of the stuff between Hiro and Zero Two and obviously it was a flashback episode, yet despite being a flashback episode it was done well— surprising since this is FranXX. But the problem came afterwards; after that episode was done, we saw a lot of crap follow it in the form of the team getting “mad” at Zero Two for “hurting” Hiro for over dramatic effect and to make me sympathise with the characters. Why would you drag through 12 episodes just to see the one episode that seemed half decent and it goes back to its shitty formula? I loathed it even more.The episodes were cliched, unconnected messes with absolutely no relevance to the plot, just serving to pass time either to focus on Hiro or to make the fanboys go crazy over the fight scenes, which were nothing more than one hit kills and random dashes.

Moving on from there all we got were cheesy half hearted lines like “I wanna be with you forever” and all that teenage fantasy (severely paraphrased for ease of comprehensive analysis) and pointless romantic moments that don't have much to do with the plot. Why am I crushing the romance here even though I'm a romance fan? It's because FranXX deployed this romance at the wrong times, I can't even say I'm surprised anymore at this kind of problem. Then we go to the other cast, Ichigo is a character that served as a reminder about the stupidity of fanboys since her voice actor Kana Ichinose received death threats just because of her work as Ichigo. Anno would be proud. Ichigo’s character though wasn't fleshed out (to say nothing of the rest of the cast, especially Ikuno, Zorome and Miku) and her actions were basically “I'm jealous because I love him but can't reveal it to him because I'm shy” and that time when she DID do it, it was enough to even send non romance fans into a fit because it was done in a (dare I say it?) slutty way cause teenagers? I do not know. Then we come to the signature part which had many people divided as well, Kokoro. To delve into this horrible character we must enter minor spoiler territory so if you can't handle looking at a good character being turned into a whore please skip the marked spoiler section. 



Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers about this side character and want the relationship as a surprise. Spoilers begin: Kokoro was paired up with Futoshi who liked Kokoro a lot but suffered from the same problem as Ichigo. However, since he's male the fanboys didn't take or notice much issue, perhaps also because Futoshi wasn't made as a cockblocker character and instead was of the “I'll protect her” than a “I want him to love me instead”, only thing is that Kokoro turned out to “betray” Futoshi and instead go for an unlikely character who was largely ignored throughout the show, Mitsuru. She suddenly developed feelings for him and even kissed him for no concrete reason apart from taking the show into an extremely shitty direction because guess what? She wanted a baby. Why? Freakin’ teenagers… this is the worst way to relate to them. Then Kokoro went from a “I am not in love with Futoshi but he's a kind person” to an “I want Mitsuru’s @#$ inside me"". I'm not even joking. This LITERALLY happened. Why am I rambling on about this? Because that's definitely not how you make a show about teenagers because that's not at all representative of the majority. Anyway, then they suddenly want to get married (!?) and we see other crap follow as well without explanation or reason, they just wanna fill time at this rate. With what? Throwing in the notion that Kokoro is pregnant later on. Teenage pregnancy, a very common thing in teens nowadays amiright? Wrong. And you know what worse? The fact that the folks at FranXX.inc pulled the WORST cliche to go with this. Both of them are caught and are “brainwashed” and their memories are “stored” somewhere. If VIRM didn't want to let them regain their memories then why store them in the first place? Why not “delete” them into oblivion? Plot armour I say. Convenience too… this makes many viewers realise that the episode was just existing to pass time and fool the viewers into thinking their time into the episode was worth it?  Spoiler end

This brings us on to the next point, underused characters. Namely Miku, Zorome and Ikuno. Not to mention Goro but he got a little bit of a focus so I'll give him a brief look later. Miku and Zorome were shown as characters who had a rivalry-love which seemed fresh and interesting but that was pulled down along with the anime because they didn't focus on these two at all. What made them attracted to each other? Why are they paired up together? These questions were never answered and I was left hanging, which was disappointing since Miku apart from sharing the same hairstyle as the superstar with the same name (my profile picture character to those of you non-Vocaloid fans) she was one of the few characters who was believable as a teenager. Many people wouldn't notice that these two weren't given enough focus and that was sad because this fresh idea could be explored a lot more and I wouldn't be surprised if I found their rivalry-love better than the two main characters, and don't forget, I liked Miku as a character as well. 

Leaving us with the last two, Ikuno and Goro. Ikuno was mainly used as fodder for Mitsuru to frown upon so that he could get hooked to the resident slut Kokoro (I don't think I should call her that because she didn't like Futoshi but considered him kind but then I'm disappointed because like Miku, I liked Kokoro, only that love turned to hate since FranXX ruined her) and Ikuno was ignored for the rest of the anime, she wasn't given lines and that one “I want a baby” episode scene where she DID say something, it wasn't explained WHY she stepped forward and did her act. My guess is because since she didn't have any lines, the show didn't want to make her look like a dumbass so they forcefully gave her lines and that was all. Then we enter spoiler territory yet again because Ikuno was given that small 5 minute focus in a later episode. 



Minor Spoiler Begin: Since Ikuno wasn't given a love interest the folks at FranXX.inc thought it's a good idea to introduce some Yuri at the worst possible time and in the worst possible way, as such, the result was never spoken of again, which pretty much explains how the “affair” went. Needless to say, this was a last ditch effort to save her character and it served as the final nail in the coffin for Ikuno. Minor Spoiler End 

We then come to the last character, Goro. Apart from being mildly explored, he served as the third wheel-ish character who was later shown as being in love with Ichigo unsurprisingly, unfortunately he as mentioned wasn't explored much and so was thrown into the sidelines to focus on our main characters, yet another character thrown aside who had a lot of potential to do great things in this mess of an anime. I haven't spoken of any “villains” yet, as this important role was destroyed by the Iotas, who were, like every other thing in the anime, unexplained, unwanted and irrelevant. They served as somewhat of a “backstory” to Zero Two despite not going into detail at all. 

As mentioned above there was no proper backstory to Squad 13. Some people said it's because sci-fi shows “don't need backstories”. This is plain wrong because if you don't have backstories of your character, there won't be any depth to them (see the word depth again and imagine, if there's no backstory, there's no depth, which means the characters are shallow) and when the characters simply don't develop at all during the course of the anime, you end up with flat characters who fall on their face to the plot. Why am I saying this? Hiro and the others didn't change at all mentally from the first episode to the last. Some might say Hiro’s infatuation with 02 makes him a “developed character” but his rejection of his other members in Squad 13 proves that wrong. Others say that “characterisation is excused in a sci-fi anime”. At first it seemed as a joke to me but when people seriously started talking about this as a defense I got concerned and felt I needed to clarify this. Take arguably the best sci-fi show as an example to that statement: Steins;Gate. It definitely has development throughout the series. How? Okabe starts to realise he can't do anything, and tries even harder, Makise realises she can't do things alone, Mayuri does more tuturus because people around her are sad, or to move from the joke, Mayuri realises that she needs Okabe and he needs her, this is what development in a sci-fi is. FranXX, on the other hand, didn't have any development to the show, its characters, or anything. It felt more like characters felt less real each time they appeared, and I'm not talking about them being realistic and human-like since that's not what an anime’s main target is everytime, I'm talking about them being acceptable as a character which wasn't at all seen. No characterisation is only excused in slice of life anime since we're understandably looking at the lives of the characters and so there's no plot and therefore no development. FranXX isn't a slice of life, it's (terribly weak) progression proved that.



Moving back to the MC of our wonderful series, Hiro. I hadn't given him enough attention and will do so now. From the start he was unexplained. Why was he a prodigy? What was he doing before meeting Zero Two? What made him so special? To stand out from the rest of the cast, you need distinctive qualities that set you apart from other characters, Hiro had none of that. He was plain and boring. Many may point out that him being in love with 02 would mean that it makes him different from other MCs but that's wrong because apart from his “love” for 02, nothing else was brought into his character. Although towards the end it was shown that he had become selfish and cared about 02 more than his squad who cared about him, it still isn't the kind of development that makes you go “Oh, that changed my view of him positively” and if you read that line again you'll probably understand why too. Then we come to the point that he named everyone else, which was revealed early on. This surprisingly is a good thing I saw. He named Ichigo and named other parasites as well which gave it a child-like feeling (perhaps the only successful child-like/teenage feeling that was executed properly throughout the anime, bear in mind this flashback was 2 minutes long) although it wasn't explained at all I still felt an iota of warmth. And nothing else I suppose.

Going back to the other “villains”, the Iotas. Since they came in at random times and with random half baked reasons, unsurprisingly they served as yet another thing that was meant to be loathed in the anime. Another irritating thing is how they suddenly became buddy-buddy with Hiro and team in the final arc. I suppose now that FranXX has exhausted whatever little “creativity” they had, they wanted to end with a shounen-esque “everyone bands together to fight the enemy”? I mean, not complaining about the trope but was there any sensible stuff going on beforehand? Speaking of insane stuff going on beforehand, FranXX was said to have been in a post apocalyptic world all of a sudden which we were given hints of in the beach episode for about 20 seconds and then later shown in “detail” (I don't even know why I'm so generously awarding that word when it's meaning wasn't followed at all) in episode 19, which to FranXX’s favour, was a decent episode. But until then for the first 18 episodes, it remained largely unexplained and I don't think I can award a show a point for revealing something so important when it's finished about 80% of it's run. Not a good practice and it returns more harm than good which by now is definitely not what I need to calm myself down. Oh youth. But then wait! Youth reminds me that I should yet again cover another important part about the “juvenile” aspect of this show. 

Spoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) for the final arc below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers for the final arc. If you're okay with them, then please continue :)

Spoiler for last arc begin: The most frustrating part of FranXX is by far the last arc. After pointless teenage melodrama, the FranXX team thought of what “ideas” can be added to “save” the anime and they did what every laughable show tries to do as a last ditch effort. To take the battle into (wait for it) SPAAAAAACEEEEEE. Yes. FranXX pulled THAT trope. What an insult to Star Wars and Star Trek. Anyway back to this show, the sudden shift in tones (first a teenage melodrama, then a clone war, then a space war? Is this a tutorial on how NOT to make Star Wars ripoffs?) and extremely convenient and unexplained reveals (more on that in a bit) coming out of nowhere? I don't think that makes for a coherent plot at all. Add to that another desperate added shounen trope where the enemy suddenly becomes your friend??? And he sacrifices his life for you just a while after you rescue him??? The Klaxosaur Princess was set as the antagonist at around the third quarter of the show and she suddenly joined Hiro’s side and sacrificed her life for him? What happened to her people, the Klaxosaurs? What happened to saving the world? And then suddenly VIRM puts themselves as the villains despite the show trying to establish the Klaxosaurs as the villains and then the aforementioned Klaxosaur Princess as an antagonist? And then their boss is a Power Rangers ripoff??? What even was that last arc?! The industry can do without more Dadolf Scmitlers you know! We've seen enough of this trope! Like when they're losing Papa and the others suddenly give the order to destroy Earth? Nanja sorya??? And then if you thought all this stupidity wasn't enough, we suddenly see YET ANOTHER problem with the show surface, Plot armour. If I hadn't explained this before, FranXX suffered from yet another plot hole in the form of plot armour. The Iotas lost a few of their members but Hiro and team were left unscathed, the only “injury” being Ikuno’s hair being turned white… Throughout the course of the show Squad 13 was met with life or death situations but I was confused since no one died. It can't be a life or death situation if everyone survives, or at least when you have so many life or death situations and no one dies even once I think that's authentically bullshit. Why fill it to the brim with Deus Ex Machina crap then? In the last 3 episodes we saw Hiro and team suddenly band together and go to space, but then the pathetic dialogue in the previous episodes of the anime became even worse, when they're in space they're going “We're really in space huh?” And Mitsuru’s reason for staying being “I wanna stay because I want to”? Even the dialogues took a huge hit and fell even further… Add to that the pointless Mobile Suit Gundam I ripoff battle except FranXX’s was much worse because everyone survived??? Not to mention Zero Two eating Hiro through her teleport to Hiro fro Earth directly in front of Hiro and she eats him and takes him to the dream world only to play hard to get? If you're not understanding at all then you have common sense, because no sensible person could understand WHAT happened and WHY. Let's not add to that horrible reasons to horrible dialogues such as bringing up love when your Squadmate is suffering? And then Hiro and Zero Two immediately go leave the Solar System and the others can't tag along because “it's not possible”? This is the limit of cliches but the studios broke it long long ago. And I want to skip over that last episode since that was the only (remotely) decent (?) part of this arc, but the means done to achieve it wasn't and I spoke enough on that... Spoiler end



FranXX tries to show us that adults are somewhat tyrants and displays the children’s “struggle” to gaining “independence” even though they're perfectly fine with their lives with no issues. But you know what they say, if you've got no issues, you make them, and that's EXACTLY what FranXX stayed true to. Trying to show us that our teenage cast is “growing” by acting “mature” with examples as “ wanting to have babies” and “doing the kitty” (don't search up on that last one) both of which are related and were attempted by Kokoro and Mitsuru. Yet again you ask. Why? I do not know why the show did it. You can't even tell anymore who they're trying to make the show relatable for. Then we have to look at the teenage drama as well that follows (that I covered above). 

Spoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) about a range of questions on things that were unanswered throughout the course of the anime below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers on these questions. If you're okay with them, then as expected, read on.

Spoiler questions begin: FranXX as mentioned tried very very hard to be edgy by leaving out some so-called “mystery” feel by not answering the most crucial questions many had throughout the course of the anime. Although episode 13 answered the questions many people had in the first half, there was no such plausible explanation for the second half’s stupidity. What makes me say that? We got weak explanations or no explanations. For example why was the enemy VIRM all along? What was their purpose? Why does Hiro not care about the rest of Squad 13 who he's lived with all his life and why is he so attached to Zero Two despite the above problem? Why are the problems for the characters happening? Who is to blame and why? Despite this being answered (VIRM) there was no proper explanation as to WHY the villains did it? What was their purpose? Why is Ichigo the leader of the group? Why is 02 not explained properly? How does she looks human and how did it happen (also why does she have pink hair when she was a clone of one with white or blue hair)? How are the rejected people treated? What happens to them? What about their memories? Although their memories as mentioned were stored in some place there's no explanation as to why they're stored. Why am I asking that question? When VIRM doesn't want their puppets to regain their memory, why store their memory? And how is the memory stored anyway? Why are teens chosen to pilot the FranXX? Don't tell me it's because their sex organs are most prominent because the teenage years is not the age when this is so. Why are pregnant girls not able to pilot the FranXX? How did the Iotas suddenly be able to join Hiro in the last arc? Weren't they broken or something? Why do Hiro’s group care and still chase Hiro despite him having rejected them for his “one true love” Zero Two? What was the bullcrap about them going to space and space being the important stuff? Like, what was that cop out explanation about VIRM and the enemies being the aliens? Who and what was the Klaxosaur Princess? Who were the Klaxosaurs? No detailed explanations were given. To cover the villains one last time, VIRM. We look again at the Dadolf Scmitler trope that FranXX.inc deployed. To viewers of Grancrest Senki who aren't familiar with the Dadolf Scmitler trope, VIRM is basically the Mage Academy, for the first 20 Episodes we were focused on only one villain but suddenly that villain changes in around the 20th episode and they tell us the real villains were someone else all along? (Surprising how both shows deploy the same cliche in the same episode number. Coincidence? I think not), Why is this bad? This is bad because it makes the viewer question if the time they spent on the first 20 episodes even worth it. I mean, if you really HAD to do this, why do it so late? And instead, why not just make an OVA of the last 6-8 episodes and treat it as the same thing? I'm sure it would get a higher score from me and other disgruntled people if they did this instead because our time was wasted… Spoiler questions end



With all that's said, eagle eyed readers might have noticed that I haven't trashed the art or the music. That's because it isn't shit. And continue to find out. Since it was a collaboration project with A-1 and Trigger (and later Cloverworks because budget issues?) many expected the art to look amazing and it did actually. They tried to make a world that looked beautiful and mostly succeeded in doing that but you can't award points to a show for “looking good” as with what the “mainstream” gaming critics like IGN often do (“CoD a 9/10 because it looks good?” Have you even seen what they're doing now ripping off Fortnite?) so though the art looked good thanks to the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery from time to time, it was in vain as the show couldn't manage to utilise it well into its plot. Another thing that the show did good was the sound. Even though I've been (rightfully) trashing the show left and right, I have to give credit where it's due, FranXX’s usage of synth tracks are rarely seen in anime and obviously serve for something really good in terms of listening especially when you're using headphones (and not streaming the show). Then we move onto the OP/EDs selection, I felt that the show went lazy and just changed the OP a bit and passed it off as an OP 2, but the EDs were great. If only FranXX used those EDs more in the second half and don't abruptly end the episode I'd have a positive opinion of the show. But I'm guilty of singing “Torikago” from the show so gotta give a point to that I guess? But oh wait, they underused all the EDs anyway.

Overall, FranXX is a mess which was over hyped and tried it's best to stay relevant by throwing in useless storylines all of which were riddled by plot holes and Deus ex machinas which were unconnected and not to mention completely unrelated events and random crap here and there (from teenage drama to Star Wars to Power Rangers? MASAKA???), to remain positive, towards the end, I only ever found the two caretakers Hachi and Nana (especially Nana) interesting and likeable since they had an aura of mystery and the 30 seconds they appeared in their few episodes were all great. Miku and Goro too were characters I pretty much liked but weren't explored well since they were thrown aside for Hiro and Zero Two unfortunately. If the show had good direction, I'm sure it would have turned out to be one of my favourite anime of all time and for many other disillusioned fans-turned-critics as well. FranXX sadly will always serve as a reminder to how one big mistake in the form of bad directing can jeopardize the whole premise of a show.

1575,"Code Geass is a difficult series to review, simply because all of its defining features are things which some consider strengths and others weaknesses. Perhaps this is why there's such a rift in the fanbase, and it's one of those series which everyone seems to either love or hate. SO, I'm going to step out of my usual reviewing template and go over what exactly Code Geass is, and you can decide for yourself whether these are positive qualities or negative ones.

Code Geass is over the top. The characters are over the top, the setting is over the top, the dialogue is over the top, the performances are over the top, the music is over the top, and the battles are over the top... everything is over the top. If it's not over the top at any given moment, something's wrong--you've probably hit your pause button by accident or something. There's no such thing as a non-dynamic entry in this series, or a conflict that doesn't conclude with an epic twist turning the tables grossly in one side's favor in a wild display of military tact. Some might call this hammy. I call it thespian. And man oh man, I do love me some thespianism.

Code Geass is powerful... which is not entirely separate from its over-the-topness. Characters live (sometimes die), breathe, and interact, each with their own lives, goals, values, and motivations--and more than often, these wills clash. Everyone is out to change the world for the better, and each in their own unique way, leading the viewer to a good bit of philosophising. This also creates some damn powerful scenes liable to pull a tear or two unless you really find yourself detached from the characters. Some people might find this overbearing. I, myself, love really powerful and over-the-top series (like Death Note), and this more than qualifies.

Code Geass is moody. At times it wants to be a political drama series, and at times it wants to be a school comedy series, like jumping between Gundam and Ouran High School Host Club. I think this is what turns a lot of people off--some just don't like their peas and mashed potatoes touching, I suppose. The political drama aspects are much more prominent than the ""school hijinx"" aspects, which only occupy one or two scenes per episode with an occasional filler-esque episode thrown in (though, truthfully, there's no legitimate filler in Code Geass--good news for those who dislike filler), and the contrast makes sense in terms of the plot, given that the main character is the leader of a terrorist faction leading an undercover life as a student. Because of this, and because of the fact that I enjoy both drama series and school comedy series, I have no problem with this stark contrast. Others might.

Finally, Code Geass is pretty. This series is kind of the poster child of the ""new wave"" of animation, with its angular jaws, bright colors, pretty boy character designs, and shiny... well, everything. I'm a pretty hip old codger myself, but many seem to hold a very bitter resentment for this modern style of animation, so if it's something that really eats at you, you're probably not going to be able to sit through the entirety of Code Geass. If you're like me and don't really care one way or the other what kind of style a series employs as long as it looks good overall and is reasonably unique in its own right (which Geass is, with its exceptionally wiry and ""idealized"" character designs and well-constructed mecha frames), then this shouldn't be a problem. I think the designs add to the thespian style of the show, myself, looking at how medieval artwork often idealized the human form.

If you're a thespian with a love for emotional character interactions, an interest in all genres of anime, and a tolerance for different art styles, like me (or, if you enjoyed both Death Note and Gundam 00), then stop reading this and go watch this series right now--nowhere else will you find entries more dynamic, scripts more powerful, and plot twists less expected. If not? Well, maybe this show isn't for you, but it's worth giving a chance anyway. Code Geass is my personal favorite series of all time, with--in my opinion--the most powerful ending of all time, and while that's not until the second season, the first still ends on a pretty damn powerful note... albeit a cliffhanger. For that reason, I'd suggest waiting to start the series until you have both seasons available to you so you can go the whole distance. Once you do, though, you (hopefully) won't regret it."
9919,"Ao no Exorcist is a 25 episode anime about a set of twins, Rin Okumura and Yukio Okumura, both raised by their adoptive father Shirou Fujimoto and raised in a monastery. After Rin gets into a fight and learns about his powers Shirou tells him the truth about his past and how he is the kin of Satan. According to Shirou Rin is the only one with the power of Satan as Yukio, his twin brother, was not strong enough. After a tragic incident causing Rin to leave the monastery and go to his brothers school, True Cross Academy. Here Rin Okumura starts the grueling process of becoming an exorcist. 

In my opinion Ao no Exorcist was a well made show, the plot did a good job of keeping watchers intrigued and the characters were nicely developed. During the beginning of the show we are shown how Rin is made to be a drop-out who can't keep a job, while his brother is a smart student going to a prestigious high school. This was a good way to develop these two characters and set a path for the series to follow. However even though Rin was supposed to be this tough character is sometimes got out of hand. As Rin would barely listen to others, often run into battles on his own, and for most of the series wasn't able to control his flames. Though some might find him a little annoying, I have to say this added more depth to him as a person and gave the watcher a better look at him and how he thinks. In the beginning of the series we are shown how hard it is for Rin to make and keep friends, so when he opens up to his cram school classmates and forms a bond with them, that also added to his character.  I feel like this was a well made anime and personally couldn't find any problems with the characters. 
The plot was also very well made as it clearly stuck to Rin's original goal of ""kicking Satan's ass"". It showed us how he started from a hot tempered 15 year old who fought someone new almost everyday to a 15 year old who used his head in situations and could at least try to control his emotions. The plot was never lacking in the action department either as their was always a fight here or there and they weren't meaningless, but a fight that built up to the season finale or looked into the characters themselves. Overall it was a great plot and awesome characters. 
Animation in this series was another thing worth noting, while it first debuted in 2011 the animation was stunning.  The characters animation was well done and so where fight scenes as well as when Rin uses his blue flames. Most of the fights kept up with the characters and you could see them actually hitting each other and moving. So for that I'd have to say the animation was also really good. 
The last thing I would like to say about this show is the soundtrack, I had a really nice time listening to the background music and the OP and ED were straight bangers, but yes, I do recommend this anime. Especially if you are looking for an action/demon genre or if you were looking for something like Tokyo Ghoul. 

Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed this review and I can't wait to write another. Let me know if you have an anime you would like me to review.

An anime that you might recognize because of its iconic OP or unique setting, Death Parade was one that I was looking forward to watching for a while. My first impression were pretty well met, and the first thing that I had noticed was its unique atmosphere. Right off the bat, Death Parade had managed to establish a tone of air that grabbed my attention. Soon afterwards I realized that I was in for something dark and special. For the most part, it was pretty episodic with the events that unfolded as the anime progressed. While there was a somewhat vague goal in mind going on behind the scenes, there didn’t seem to be any REAL storyline or message in the beginning of Death Parade. I had enjoyed the various events that took place though because of the psychological awareness that us viewers had of the participants. You were able to see what they were thinking, feel what they were feeling, and what made them tick on the inside. This is where the art/animation shined because of the stunningly realistic and dramatic facial expressions that were featured. Another thing that stood out were the unique designs that had fit the environment almost perfectly. While Death Parade did have its dark tones, it still had much more to offer in terms of entertainment. Both the character interactions as well as the occasional comedy were enough to lighten the mood a bit and give viewers a break from the intense moments that were soon too appear. While this anime did have an episodic style in the beginning that didn’t seem to have much in terms of a storyline, it soon turned into something MUCH deeper than I was ever expecting to see. And now it’s an anime that has become one of my favorites that I’d highly recommend to any who are in to either dark or philosophical genres. Let’s get on with the scoring:

Art and Animation: 9.2/10
This anime had some really good art/animation to offer in every element that it featured. From the surrounding environment, dynamic sequences, moody color palette, and unique character designs, every element worked in unison to contribute to the overall atmosphere of Death Parade. Despite all of these positive elements, I have to admit that this type of style has to be down your alley in order for you to fully enjoy it. It brings to the table an “ominous” feel that i haven’t experienced too often with other anime. My eyes never felt strained or distracted by poor animation, so be rest assured that this anime delivers from a technical standpoint.

Storyline and Character Progression: 9.4/10
I felt quite conflicted while scoring this section because of a few reasons. The main thing that i must admit was how long it took to build up the story. For while the story in the end was AMAZING beyond words, it took until the last few episodes where it all blossomed into one powerful message. In the beginning the anime was very episodic and occasionally hinted at a storyline developing in the background. While this style of anime might appeal to some, an episodic “feel” undermines many events in an anime as irrelevant. The unique thing that i appreciated was how the beginning used these episodes to slowly and secretly add to the main message behind the events. Near reaching the end of the storyline, it all came together in such an unexpected way. In ONE episode my opinion of Death Parade changed dramatically for the better to the point where it brought tears to my eyes. It truly was a breathtaking and “wow” moment where it seemed like the whole world stood still in this moment, i couldn’t believe what i was watching. I’m not being dramatic either, i truly felt like this was a special moment in my anime career without a doubt. Overall, the story was phenomenal despite the slower and unclear beginning. This anime is definitely geared less to a general audience, but aimed towards one more specific in tastes. As for the characters, this too was executed VERY well. From the very beginning, i felt like i was watching ordinary humans with sincere feelings and thoughts. It was quite an art to see how they interacted with such natural fluidity and thought process. It was as if we were diving into the inner thoughts and desires of each person to see what made them as a person. What made them happy, what made them sad, what made them scared, or what pushed them to insanity. All of these thoughts and actions were carefully observed by the main characters, and they too were still figuring out why humans made the decisions they did. This anime showed that while humans seemed simple, the emotions they felt were beyond comprehension. Being able to feel what they felt and see what they saw, it was still a challenge to deduct WHY these humans acted in such a manner. And in the end, our main characters came to a beautiful realization that suddenly blossomed into something truly spectacular. With each passing moment, they came to terms with their emotions and accepted what seemed to be fate. I felt connected with them at this point, and the emotions experienced became my own. I was fully immersed into the anime at this point, and i soon realized how well executed the character interactions and dialogue were. This was by far the strongest part of Death Parade, and i enjoyed every single minute of it. The only downside i felt with this anime was the insignificance of the supporting characters. I didn’t really end up caring or connecting with them, and one girl in specific was just annoying and unneeded for me. So while the main characters were developed VERY well, i felt like the supporting roles were somewhat overlooked or neglected.

Soundtrack and Audio: 8.9/10
What can i say? The OP is one that I’m sure many of us have seen and heard because of how iconic it is. Its upbeat, the animation is dynamic, and i never grew tired of listening to it. The rest of the soundtrack didn’t feature much, but was spectacular when it was showcased. It contributed both to the mood and atmosphere of the moment to amplify it even further. The piano piece specifically was the highlight of it all, as this was the moment I was moved to tears. I had no complaints with the voice actors, since most of them executed their roles very well in conveying sincere emotion. Sounds effects too were of decent quality and didn’t negatively affect my immersion, so no big complaints at all here.

My final thoughts? A slower paced, episodical beginning that suddenly grew in meaning and significance towards the end in order to blossom into a powerful lesson. This is one of the few anime I’ve seen where the ending FAR surpasses its beginning. Truly an emotional and intense experience that I won’t soon forget, and one that I’d recommend to anyone looking for something more mature, psychological, and with a touch of darkness. This is why i believe Death Parade deserves the score of 9.1/10. For its unique environment, memorable soundtrack, and truly beautiful lesson, this is an anime i wouldn’t hesitate to recommend. Thanks so much for reading this far, and I’ll see you in the next one! <3

Streaming Platform: Funimation"
269,"Bleach was a show I had disregarded for the longest time, finding it boring. To my surprise, I unexpectedly found myself returning to it and actually enjoying it. It was one of the few shows that introduced me to anime during my early days. However, back in 2008/2009, there were only a limited number of dubbed episodes available, and streaming services weren't as accessible as they are today. Consequently, I put the show off entirely and didn't consider reading the manga either. When the anime concluded in 2012 with little fanfare, I didn't pay much attention. I had only made it so far as the Soul Society arc and had no idea what had happened since. Days turned into years until 2015 when I decided to give Bleach another chance.

As I revisited the show, I scoured the internet to watch the openings, hoping to rekindle that sense of nostalgia. It wasn't until I came across Ranbu no Melody (Opening 13) that my interest truly piqued. I felt compelled to return to the show, if only to experience that opening in its episode. But I didn't just want to watch Bleach; I was determined to dedicate my time and effort to fully immerse myself in it. Was it worth it? Well, to some extent. Bleach follows a standard Shonen plot, with Ichigo, an ordinary high school student, gaining supernatural powers and realizing his duty to protect everyone and everything around him. Along the way, he faces increasingly powerful foes, grows stronger, and confronts challenging adversaries. Bleach strikes a fine balance between comedy and action, often eliciting unexpected laughter from me.

Bleach is separated into larger arcs, that are followed up by smaller ones.

THE SOUL SOCIETY
-Human Realm
-Soul Society

ARRANCAR
-Human Real
-Hueco Mundo
-Fake Karakura Town

The first season, known as ""The Substitute,"" is set in our world and follows Ichigo's journey into becoming a Soul Reaper. The arc concludes with Ichigo's mission to rescue his friend Rukia, from whom he received his powers illegitimately. This leads to the Soul Society arc, which revolves around the rescue mission for Rukia. While it's widely regarded as the pinnacle of the show by many, it's not necessarily the peak of Bleach for me. Despite the consistent quality of the show, the Soul Society arc stands out because it introduces us to new enemies and a fresh storyline. The arc benefits from its stable pacing and the novelty of exploring a new aspect of the universe. It's a captivating twist of events as Ichigo confronts a series of intriguing antagonists, particularly within the unique setting of the Soul Society.

The Soul Society arc shows us lots, but often explanations are so contrived. The writer Tite Kubo has a knack for his stylistic approach. What's often cool to the eye, is never fully translated well when it comes to dialogue. One moment you might understand a concept about the world, and then the next it's confusing you. The more glaring issue is the placement of the arc because it's as if this was written to be the finale of the entire series. In reality, this isn't the case. The Soul Society arc has it's a fair share of problems, partly because of the way it was adapted. The action fit perfectly in the manga, and it resonated with me. The anime adapted it but drew out scenes to an annoyingly boring degree, partly due to its syndicated run on television. The worst part of it all was the included recaps in the middle of fights. Regardless of how epic the fight was in the manga, the Bleach anime likes to dump exposition in order to fill time for their televised viewing. The transition to the Hueco Mundo arc in the manga was terrible as well, but it happened and this was not some easy fix. But where Bleach lacked in pacing, it made up for in strong sequences. The Hueco Mundo arc comes into play right after in the anime and is adapted so well in the beginning. The pacing happens so fast, and things carry on at a reasonably good pace. It was a breath of fresh air for me. Fights didn't take more than a few episodes to conclude, and it's a real shame the rest of Bleach didn't have that noticeably better pacing when it wasn't waiting on manga chapters. It closely followed the manga without losing anything in translation. 

Now, let's delve into the issue of filler content. Skipping it can make the difference between experiencing ""good"" Bleach and settling for ""okay"" Bleach. Often, filler episodes don't significantly impact the main storyline; they're treated as separate entities. However, in the Bleach anime, this isn't always the case. Filler characters sometimes find their way into crucial plot points, detracting from the significance of certain scenes.

My main gripe arose when a particular character revealed themselves to be a Soul Reaper during a pivotal moment. The reaction of the filler characters present dampened the impact of the reveal. Having read the manga alongside watching the show, I was eagerly anticipating these moments. But seeing these filler characters shoehorned into the main plot was disappointing. While I could overlook it, it added to the list of issues I had with the Bleach anime. The decision to integrate them into one of the battles further exacerbated the problem. I would have preferred if they were entirely forgotten rather than wasting screen time on their inclusion, regardless of continuity.

Some may dismiss this as nitpicking, but for me, it was distracting and detracted from the immersion. Referencing an arc I hadn't seen prior only compounded the frustration, especially knowing these characters exist in the main story.

Moving on, the Hueco Mundo arc introduces visually striking antagonists like Ulquiorra and Grimmjow. While the setting is captivating, the arc overstays its welcome. The repetitive pattern of fights, exposition, and plot progression becomes tiresome to watch. I had hoped the anime would address the pacing issues from the manga, but unfortunately, it falls short in this regard. It's a missed opportunity, considering how evident these pacing problems were in the original material.

Conversely, the Fullbringer arc, though often labeled as the most filler-like, diverges significantly from the typical Bleach formula. Despite being canon, it offers a refreshing departure from the usual narrative structure. Exploring emotionally heavy themes, it provides insights into Ichigo's character, even as his ultimate goal remains unclear. While some may find fault with the development of Fullbringer characters and their relevance to Bleach's world, I found the arc enjoyable for its compelling moments and thematic depth.

Bleach truly shines in its characters and their distinct designs. The diverse cast of twenty-plus characters each leaves a memorable impression, except perhaps for Don Kanoji, who's a bit hit or miss. The fantastic character interactions and conflicts in the Bleach anime make it worth watching. Now that both the anime and manga have concluded, let's delve deeper into some aspects of Bleach.

Should You Skip the Fillers?
Yes, you should skip them. But there's one thing you should do: finish Bleach and catch up on the manga. If you want more, you can come back to the filler episodes and entertain yourself there without having it interfere with the main plot.

Should I Read the Manga Instead?
I'd say yes if you don't have the time. But if you come to love the Bleach manga, then watch the show. The anime has great openings, and the emotional segments are portrayed to a better degree since it has more cinematic flair. The manga is good, but it suffers from pacing issues, like in the Hueco Mundo arc, which consists mainly of fights for several volumes. I honestly couldn't imagine reading this arc during a chapter release in Shonen Jump. Good lord, there's a whole lot of nothing for entire volumes.

Then Does the Manga Surpass the Anime?
Only marginally, by 0.5 of a star, because of its more faithful execution of the main story, which is a given. The manga lacks filler, making it a breeze to get through the dry arcs. Hopefully, they can do some story fixes with the new adaptation of the Thousand-Year Blood War, but I won't hold my breath.

Is the Show Itself Worth Watching Then?
Bleach is a blast; it's fun, regardless of the smaller problems. It's one of the preferred former ""Big Three"" that I was so glad to be watching. The show helps to illustrate the awesome action sequences and some of the emotional moments.

What Are the Best Arcs of Bleach Then?

Thousand-Year Blood War, but I'm willing to debate that after the atrocious ending.
Soul Society is about as equal as the Hueco Mundo (for me at least).
Fullbringer, but again, I'm also willing to debate this one. It can be interchanged depending on how I feel.
I Can't Complete It, Isn't It Like 300+ Episodes?
As I said, you can skip the fillers, thus reducing the show's length and making it more digestible. Believe it or not, the actual show is comprised of 49% filler, so don't feel bad about skipping. But if you seriously don't have the time, yes, read the manga; it's good. But come back to the show to see the scenes animated. Seriously, the show does improve some of those parts because it has the music and visuals to really bring the scenes to life. So don't avoid the anime entirely. If there's one thing perfect about Bleach, it's the openings. There are no bad ones.

Closing Thoughts
Now that's over with, I can conclude with my thoughts. Bleach is a great show, but the problems lie in two places: the filler and the source material. A certain female gets stabbed, not once, but numerous times through the chest. Yet, she somehow survives every single time that happens. It wasn't two standard parts either; this happens at very dramatic parts in which you're supposed to feel emotionally invested. When characters are resurrected by Kubo, it's hard to feel like there are stakes. If you want an emotional buildup, just write the characters' deaths properly and be done with it. Don't cater to the fanbase's popularity; it never works, and this is a clear example of fan-pandering that's kept certain characters alive. Bleach has some horribly bad ""ass-pull"" moments that become more apparent the further along you go. The stakes seem to lower with every new arc, as every ""good guy"" seems to survive regardless of how they died. All too often, people who should die, just don't, and it's ironically more painful keeping them alive. There's always that sense that they'll just return in the next arc, which leads to some underwhelming tension. This is more the fault of Kubo, who just couldn't be bothered to make a story that shakes up the formula. The final manga arc more than makes up for this to a point, but it feels like petty wish-fulfillment than a genuine attempt to tell a good high-stakes story. There are still many moments in which I felt compelled to put Bleach down and never return again, and finishing it just broke me mentally. I had invested hours upon hours of reading, watching, and fanboying over Bleach only for Kubo to tarnish all my respect for the series within the span of one chapter.

The newest arc, despite feeling great at the beginning, fell back into the Bleach formula. Good guy faces off with a bad guy who shows up, bad guy gets killed but reveals his true power, and then we see the hero's new Bankai; it's the same tired story structure that stretches itself over an entire arc, AGAIN. I will say this, recalling previous characters from past arcs was nice, if a bit fanservicey. Using surviving antagonists was cool too; I just wish Kubo would've used them in an Avengers-style final battle. I could write a whole review of the manga, but I thought it would be more appropriate to put here in my anime review. Bleach is returning, so I'll probably be watching it to see what direction they take it, but I'm past the point of caring about how it's handled the characters. Bleach is worth watching as the character dynamics feel fully realized in an animated format. It's just a shame that Kubo can't seem to write meaningful story arcs because there are some great scenarios that get mishandled that keep it from being anything special."
199,"It almost feels unnecessary for me to review this movie. Everybody knows about it. Everybody (who knows what they’re talking about) knows it’s a masterpiece. Is there really anything else I can add to the discussion surrounding this movie? No, but I still wanna talk about it anyway because I love this movie & actually have yet to review a Studio Ghibli movie. But first a little history. I originally watched Spirited Away for the first time back in 2018 a few months after I had just gotten into anime proper & knew who Hayao Miyazaki was. More importantly though, I knew the reputation this movie had going into. I watched it….. & I liked it. I’ll be honest I wasn’t overly impressed with it or saw why it garnered its reputation, but I enjoyed the film overall. Though I did watch it the same day I watched Akira for the first time, which at the time, I thought was a completely incomprehensible piece of shit. That stance has changed since then but the point is, I would’ve thought anything was good coming off Akira the exact same day I watched it. Going forward in life I just kinda moved on & didn’t think about Spirted Away too much. But in 2019 as I realized I was running out of Studio Ghibli movies to watch (as in I was close to seeing all of them). I went on a sort of Ghibli binge & started to not only watch the ones I missed, but even rewatched some of my favorites/ones I wanted to get a new opinion on, & thus brings us back to Spirted Away. I rewatched it….. & I fucking loved it. Whatever prevented me from really seeing Spirited Away as a masterpiece back then no longer applied, I was enthralled with movie & for a week I couldn’t take my mind off of it. I know this introduction was rather lengthy but I honestly felt this was necessary because I wanted to apply some groundwork as to why this is now my second favorite, & at times my favorite Miyazaki movie of all time. Spoilers inbound btw

I think what I love most about Spirited Away is the narrative, but more so the narrative structure. I love coming of age stories & Spirited Away is one of the best in my honest opinion. Chihiro does start out as an unlikable brat, but what do you expect? She’s only 10, has to move away to a different town from all her friends, & then gets thrusted into this fantasy world that she knows nothing about, & on top on top of that, is filled with all these weird fantasy creatures that nobody knows about. But throughout the movie we get to see Chihiro adapt to this environment. We see her overcome these impossible odds. We get to see her grow up. It’s simplicity executed to perfection & what makes this story even better is the storyboarding. If there’s one thing Hayao Miyazaki is a master at it’s crafting/mapping settings. I won’t bore you with excessive details like how Chihrio exactly got from outside the bath house to Yubaba’s room. But I feel like if Yubaba’s bath house was a real place that I could visit I would know the layout exactly & wouldn’t have to consult anybody thanks to Miyazaki’s storyboarding. The world just builds together & flows so fluently that I was never lost, I knew exactly where I was at all times. But even better is the pacing. This movie is just right, it knows exactly how long it needs to stay somewhere, it knows exactly when to transition into the next scene, & it knows how to keep me engaged & never question how much longer I have left in the movie. This movie is 2 hours long but I was never bored because of how excently paced the movie was. What else needs to be addressed is the world building. I more or less alluded to it when talking about the storyboarding but can we take a moment to appreciate how meticulously crafted this world is? From the pig farms, the market where Chihiro’s parents turn into pigs, the aforementioned bathhouse, Yubaba’s office & her baby’s room. The train station that takes Chirio & No Face to Zeniba’s hut in the swamp. I remember everything about this world precisely because of the excellent worldbuilding. Miyazaki knows just how long he needs to keep us in these environments as to make them memorable. Hell, even the small town that Chirhio’s family is moving to at the beginning of the movie I can tell you about how the family even ends up in the Spirit world in the first place. I won’t pad with the details of course (this review is already pretty lengthy as it is, I’m 2 pages in & I’m still talking about the story/world for fucks sake). I don’t know if I’ve said peace with this segment yet or not but Spirited Away is a very dense, layered world with a lot of meat to chew on & for that I think it’s super commendable & deserves respect.

Phew, now that I’m done with that mouthful, I guess I should talk about the characters, which are also excellent. Honestly, none of them outside of Chihiro & Haku really get development. But they don’t need to, as most of them serve a purpose in helping Chirhio find her way in this world & keep her identity as so she doesn’t get trapped & can’t go back to her world. All of them are not only characterized extremely well, but they’re also memorable and have easily identifiable character traits. Out of all the characters in this movie, my two favorites are Rin & Zeniba. I like them the most because they’re guiding figures for Chihrio in this strange world. Rin is the tough love but caring type & is like a sister figure for Chihiro. It kinda saddens me how Rin has long since lost her identity & is destined to forever stay in the spirit world working for Yubaba, but I also like to think of that as Rin’s motivation for even helping Chihiro in the first place, she knows Chihiro really doesn’t belong in the spirit world & wants to do whatever she can to help her keep afloat in this strange world & make it back to her world safely. Zenida is Yubaba’s nicer sister that ends up helping Chihiro by revealing one of Yubaba’s secrets that will help Chihiro get back to her world. She’s a sweet & loving granny figure even preferring that Chihiro call her such. She’s honestly such a sweet old woman, I almost think it would be worth going through what Chihiro went though in this movie just so I could go to her swamp & have a conversation with her. But I can’t forget Haku, the guy who even helps Chihiro realize what kind of situation she’s in to begin with. He’s heroic, loyal to his friends, & caring, but he’s also not afraid to stand up to authority going against Yubaba directly at several points in the movie. It’s actually revealed near the end of the movie that Haku is the spirit of the Kohaku river, a river that Chirio almost drowned in as a child. It’s hinted throughout the movie that Chihiro & Haku have a stronger connection than it originally seems & when this is revealed, it hits hard. Even the minor characters in this movie such as Kamajii, the human spider who’s the heart of the bathhouse as he operates the mechanisms this bathhouse needs to even run in the first place. The three heads of Yubaba who have a really funny scene in the movie where their disguise getting revealed by Yubaba results in them hopping out the room making “hup hup hup” sounds. The way this scene is directed & the way they exit the room inparticular with the same expression they had on their faces earlier just makes me laugh everytime I think about it. I’d of course be remiss if I didn’t talk about Yubaba. Yubaba, isn’t exactly my favorite Ghibli villain, I don’t think she’s as layered as Kushana from the Nausicaa movie. Or in a somewhat unique position for an antagonist like Fujimoto from Ponyo (as in he’s not really a bad guy more so an overprotective father who tries his best). But I do think she is written well & isn’t just a blank face evil villain. She’s not a nice person but I at least understand her motivations & where she’s coming from. The reason she has to operate her bathhouse on such a constant schedule is because spirts often come to be cleansed of their wrongdoings or what have-you so that they can then pass on & leave the spirt world in peace. Her bathhouse prevents Chaos from spreading & destroying the world essentially. She’s also a mother who tries her best to provide for her son too. She’s not exactly the most morally correct person but she’s not supposed to be. She’s supposed to be Chihiro’s greatest obstacle on he journey of both self discovery (at 10) and finding her way back home. I think I’ve covered about as much as I can with this segment. The characters in Spirited Away are excellent. Easily my favorite cast out of any Studio Ghibli just because of how memorable all of them are. 

I honestly really don’t know how I’m gonna talk about the art & animation because I mean what is there to really say? It’s Studio Ghibli. We all know their animation is the best in the business, we all know the background art is extremely detailed, we all know the character designs have that charm with them, we all know about this stuff. I don’t think you really need me to repeat what others have said (as if I haven’t been doing that throughout this review). But alright, if you want me to explain why Spirited Away’s art and animation is phenomenal, just watch either one clip of the movie, or look at an image on google. Those two things will say more about this aspect than I ever could. I will however talk about the voice acting, which is excellent. Chihiro despite being a brat at the beginning of a movie has a somewhat soft-spoken demeanor to start off & I really like that. The rest of the cast all bring their A game & there isn’t one dull performance to be found throughout this movie. Even no faces moans just leave off this feeling that I can’t really describe but it’s there god-damnit. The music is of-course, spectacular. Shocker I know, but it’s so good. Joe Hisaishi doesn’t miss with his orchestration, his pianos, anything really. This man is so damn good at what he does & the music matches the atmosphere of this music so perfectly I couldn’t imagine anybody else doing it.

To end it off. Spirited Away I think I can safely call my favorite Miyazaki/Ghibli movie. I just get so much out of it. I haven’t watched it since 2019 but as you can tell from this review, I still think about it so much. It’s a movie about self discovery, about life, about growing up. To quote Miyazaki “I would like to make a film to tell children its good to be alive.” Spirited Away is a movie that means a lot to me & should not be dismissed. It needs to be watched by everyone. This isn’t just a good kids movie, it’s a good fucking movie no matter who you are & it does in fact hold up. I don’t know how I’m supposed to end this exactly. But Miyazaki is a mastermind, this movie is a masterpiece. Uh yeah, I’m leaving lol."
30,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is closer to being the classic of anime than anything else in the medium. The amount of debate that follows Evangelion is absurd, from the controversial ending of the TV series, Asuka vs. Rei (clearly Asuka is better), to the craziness of End of Evangelion, discussion follows. There have been so many essays written about certain characters or episodes that it's mind boggling. Additionally, the sheer number of shows that were influenced by Evangelion is almost to the point of incomprehension. No one can deny that Hideaki Anno has created probably the most influential and, perhaps, the most important anime of all time. (WARNING: There may be some lighter spoilers in the second to last paragraph, where I discuss some of the complaints with Evangelion, feel free to skip that one if you haven't seen the show yet)

Evangelion just did so many things right. It didn't overload you with information at the beginning, it just slowly and carefully fed you information with each episode, not overwhelming you with info dumps, like many shows do these days. I won't say that they never info dump you, but when they do, it's usually something that the watcher has a slight understanding of anyway, making it more digestible. Piggybacking off that point, it doesn't bog the watcher down with characters either. Shinji, Misato, and Rei are clearly the focus of the first 7 episodes and it doesn't deviate much from that. Then, Asuka makes her appearance (And the show gets 10000% better) and the focus shifts. Evangelion is kind of clever that way with its characters, sidelining even Shinji to develop whoever they're focusing on.

Of course, the soundtrack is phenomenal. A Cruel Angel's Thesis is one of the best openings out there, even two decades later. Fly Me To The Moon is a great ending, with all its different versions, keeping it unique throughout 26 episodes. The regular soundtrack is good too, though, I don't have too much to say regarding that. Artistically, you'd never be able to tell that Evangelion was made in 1995. It's just so beautiful and fluidly animated that it's comparable to many of the more recent anime. The color palette is something to be commented on too. The neon (heh) colors used to illustrate the Eva's is beautiful, adding a pop of color to a show that can be extremely heavy at times.

A couple of things to address, however, are two complaints I see fairly often. Those would be the TV ending and Shinji's whining being annoying. Not to be contrarian or anything, but I really liked the TV ending. In my opinion, it suited the message that Evangelion was trying to get across the whole time. The message that you can't close yourself off from people, push them away, and expect them to treat you with respect and kindness. We see Shinji and Asuka struggling with the same problems in opposite ways throughout the entire show: connecting with others. In fact, that's kind of the overarching theme of Evangelion, illustrated by their struggles with the Hedgehog's Dilemma. I just think that Shinji reaching the conclusion that he did was a beautiful capstone to that struggle, closing his character arc in a satisfying manner. Speaking of his character arc, many people complain that Shinji's whining is unbearable. I have one simple statement to make concerning that complaint: He's 14 with the weight of the world thrust onto his shoulders. Of course he's going to buckle under that weight, would you have been able to handle that kind of pressure at 14? It's kind of a double edged sword too. If he had been too capable of handling the burden, then people would complain about him like they do Kirito from Sword Art Online, like that he's a Gary Stu who can do no wrong (Which I disagree with, by the way). But I digress.

As a conclusion, Evangelion is phenomenal. Sure, you could debate certain aspects of its story or narrative, but the fact remains that it's objectively really good. I don't like it when people tell others that you have to watch a show, but in Evangelion's case, it may be the exception. It's simply too good and its legacy too great to pass up."
14719,"[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Season 1 contains Part 1 and 2. Keeping that in mind I shall first talk about Part 1.

Part 1 of JoJo, my least favourite part and sole reason I didn't give this a 100/100. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but compared to Part 2+ it is somewhat lacklustre. Though that being said it is important to watch Part 1 as it introduces us to the Joestars and the Dio.

The Joestar family has a strong connection to ""Justice"" and ""Gentlemanliness"", this is important since through out the series and especially this part we get to see our hero, Jonathan Joestar, fight the evil that has been activated by Dio.
To summarize Part 1:
The story focuses on Jonathan Joestar, a gentleman and the symbol of good. He lost his mother in an accident and got robbed helped by the Brando family. After few years and the death of Dario (Dio's father), Dio is sent to the Joestar abode where he tries his best to take down JoJo and get rich quick.... until a day that changed everything.
JoJo discovers that a Stone Mask they have in their mansion activates with blood, curious he decides to study it. That is the point in which Dio tries to poison JoJo's father, JoJo ventures to London where he meets best girl Speedwagon.
During JoJo's journey Dio decides to take a peak at his belongings including the notes on the Mask, curious he takes the mask and tests it out on some strangers on the streets, he soon notices them turning into vampires, this is the most pivotal moment of the WHOLE series, ever since the show gets its famous Bizarre twist. Jonathan meets Zeppeli and trains with Hamon to defeat the Vampires and now evil vampire Dio. (Yes I skipped a LOT but stay with me, I still gotta do Part 2 xd)


Moving on to Part 2, we are introduced to a new Joestar, Joseph Joestar is the main character of this one.
He is much more crazy and wacky than Jonathan but still has his iconic Good Nature just like Jonathan did. This part is the one that has dragged me deeper and deeper into the series.
To summarize Part 2:
Joseph Joestar goes about his life unbeknownst to him he posses the power of Hamon.
Joseph gets dragged into the bizarre world when get is told about Speedwagons ""death"" and when Straizo attacks him.
Ever since that points JoJo has been on the hunt for Speedwagon. He soon finds out he is alive in a Nazi bunker with this ""Pillar Man"". These humanoid creatures have incredible power and could easily wipe the whole human race off the planet. There is more than 1 and they have been taking a nap for 2000 years but are soon waking up. Ever since then JoJo has been on a hunt for the Pillar Men because of both bravery and bad life decisions. There was an issue... JoJo did not have the power to defeat all of the Pillar men therefore he had to train, his master being ""Lisa Lisa"". He only had a month to train due to a challenge he set up with the Pillar Men, he has one month to train and win a battle with them or else rings inside him would break and kill him. This motivated JoJo quite a bit. (I won't go into more detail, I think ya get the gist)



[CHARACTERS:]()
Part 1 of JoJo introduces us to many good characters and one of the best villains in the series.

Jonathan Joestar, the main character, he is a very Justice oriented Gentleman. He tries his hardest to bring peace and get along with everyone.
But ever since Dio showed up and turned himself into a Vampire JoJo has been hard at work to defeat him and all the evil he's managed to bring upon this cursed land.

Dio Brando, the main villain of the show, Dio did not have a good childhood. His father was an asshole and did not care for Dio. Because of that reason Dio has been an evil little soul who just wants easy money. Dio has shown us that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants, he has done many disgusting things to piss off JoJo, like for example shove JoJo's dog into a furnace and let him burn.

Speedwagon, best girl. Speedwagon does not really have any kind of purpose in the first part of JoJo, he's just there to be the narrator. Though that being said he has shown deep respect towards the Joestar family and became the number one best girl because of that.

Lastly I shall be talking about Zeppeli, the one who taught JoJo the way of Hamon. He is a much more chaotic character compared to JoJo but still can keep his calm. He is very well versed in Hamon and too wants the Vampires and Stone Masks destroyed.

These characters compared to the rest of the series aren't that good, apart from Speedwagon, but they do serve an important role like I mentioned earlier. They show us just how Bizarre this show is and also show us the way of the Joestars. Without this part the viewers would be left confused as to what the ulterior motives of the Joestar family is.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
In this section of the already long enough review I won't be talking individually about the parts but instead comparing them and giving some insight on how it is.

Part 1's art style and animation is the reason, in my opinion, that people turn away from JoJo. It feels clunky and looks a bit bulky. I personally did not have an issue with it when I first watched the show but looking back on it I get where people are coming from. In Part 2 the animation looks much more fluid and the fights are much more intricate, the art style too got a little upgrade. Going from mainly dark to more light colour pallete.
Both parts still do have the Super Muscly guys but Part 2 lessens that down by a bit, so although my muscle mass does not increase as much now when watching JoJo I do get some visually appealing fights with Hamon. The details, too, have improved quite a bit between the two parts.




[MUSIC:]()
I shall be doing the same here as I did with the Art/Animation section.

The OST of Part 1 is quiet and much more ""Classical"" (I suppose that description will do). This fits perfectly with the olden year theme that is going on especially when we get to the villages and castles that Dio has plundered.
The OST for Part 2 is a bit louder and more ""Modern"". Especially the track ""Awaken"" the theme of the Pillar Men. This song in particular is the pure defenition of Part 2.

Both of the OPs that play are very good. The songs and animation present are outstanding and to this day I still listen to them.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a series which manages to suck nearly anyone who watches it. Yes there are people who dislike this show but compared to the sheer amount of people who love this show they are quite small. I also keep hearing more and more people talking in real life about this show which indicated that it has hit the mainstream audience, say what you will about that but I personally think that this is great since it opens up more people to this cult fanbase of JoJo which is always great. Remember though, no Part skipping."
98314,"You know, a bad show, to me, is not simply a matter of the quantity or size of the flaws you can find in it, however it is that you decide to measure such an arbitrary idea, but what kind of flaws it has. I can deal with some plot holes, for once (I mean, even the almighty FMA has 2 big ones at the end) as long as the work can properly contextualize them and not make me care. Members of the cast being inconsistent, though, make it tougher to stomach. I’m also not someone who asks for absolute realism, but simply verisimilitude and consistency. Disregard all of those and the work starts to go sour for me. The worst offenses, though, are when the work becomes morally bankrupt, when it asks me to sympathize and side with people who are clearly contemptible. Kakegurui is one of those shows.
 
Story and Characters
 
Well come to Hyakkao Academy, the land of insane teenage gambling, horrendous abuses of power and blatantly criminal acts of bodily harm. The school is supposed to be a place for the children of the filthy rich, but most definitely the filthy, where the future elite of Japan is meant to be prepared for a future where they’ll lead the businesses of their families. In this institution, gambling is not simply a pass-time students can engage for their own enjoyment, but a core part of the social-structure of the school. Since the current student council president took over, she instituted a system where students who stack too much debt become “cattle”, considered second class among their classmates and have to remain subservient to the students with more money. Obviously, they also become primary target for bullying. For the viewer who shares that pesky desire to have the elements in the story making sense, this plot point will immediately raise a number of eyebrows, so let’s go bit by bit.
 
First, how is this system even allowed to exist? None of the students here are of legal age, so they should never be allowed to gamble outrageous amounts of money from their parents net worth. Is this a version of Japan where legal restrictions for underage gambling don’t exist? If that’s the case, what about the restrictions for underage driving, drinking and sex? None of these are even mentioned, so I suppose the gambling premise is entirely based on “don’t think about it, bro”. Now, you might at this point throw at me my previous statement about realism vs. verisimilitude, but let's make it clear: that goes for simple stuff, like my tsunderes being a bit more violent than what the real world would tolerate or children being a bit more mature than normal, it doesn’t apply for a universe where an entire legal system seems to operate backwards.
 
Following the fact that the existence of this scenario is a contradiction in itself, why would anyone enroll their children in a school like this one? These students are supposed to be future business leaders, people with enormous responsibilities in their hands, so a cast system that allows them to be bullied, humiliated and sometimes even physically harmed by their classmates goes completely opposite to the goal their education is supposed to provide, that of shaping them into capable, educated and strong-willed adults. I’m not sure any parent would allow their children to frequent a place like this if such practices are not only allowed, but incentivized. Then there’s the money issue: the students make their bets with money from their families, which means that they are stocking up on massive debts their parents will have to pay. At long-term, this set up would make the cost of such education extremely expensive, making this school a lot more trouble than is worth. The list of absurdities doesn’t stop there, but let’s get to know the cast before we can dive head first into more nonsense!
Jabami Yumeko is the main culprit of the story. She generally keeps a playful and polite demeanor, but shifts to being intensely obsessive when it’s time to gamble. I’m pretty sure she is supposed to be a sociopath! Not a realistic depiction of a sociopath, though, but what fiction believes a sociopath to be like. Truth be told, Yumeko is no more than a Mary Sue. It may seem like a stretch to claim this, since general misconception is that this kind of character is also supposed to be virtuous (or at least framed as such by the narrative, even when the audience can clearly see that the opposite is truth), but she does have the basic traits of a Mary Sue:  she clearly has complete disregard for how much money she bets, the supply of money or her disposal is not even hinted at in the anime, so in how much danger she’s is unclear, at no point displays any signs of being the least bit worried, constantly displaying the face of someone who’s always on top, even though her behavior is so needlessly risky. Ironically, at one point she even drops this gem: “To realize one’s ambitions, risks must be taken”. Funny, since she seems to have no ambition besides having a gambling playground for herself.
 
Besides being nice to the already shitty-characters from the main cast and keeping a constant sweety-kitty-diabetes façade when not gambling, is there any reason for Yumeko to be seem as an actual force for good in this narrative? When it comes to motivations and general personality, she’s no less psychotic, abusive, deceiving, manipulative and sadistic than the members of the student council (or any other scumbag in this school), so what are the guaranties that once her main source of entertainment in the school is gone, or at least significantly diminished, she’ll bring any positive change to the status quo? And even if she does, do any of these characters actually deserve it? They’re all simplistic, poorly realized figures and most often just despicable people, despite the laughable attempts from the show on making them sympathetic by introducing last minute backstory.
 
Suzui Ryouta, the closest friend to Yumeko, is an inconsistent pussy. He strangely seems to have no problem talking to multiple attractive girls at school, but from the first moment Yumeko enters the scene, becomes strangely flustered when first interacting with her. Besides that, his role is essentially to tell the audience how risky her situation is when she makes a crazy bet and to be mesmerized when she pulls off a victory out of some strategy the audience has no knowledge off.
 
Momobami Kirari is the student council president, or Seitokaichou in Japanese, responsible for the creation of the cast system in place in Hyakkao Academy. She sees her fellow schoolmates as pets she can control and play with, as well as manipulate to gain power, although the goals she wants to achieve with such power are not explained in the story. Through an outrageous ass-pull in episode 11 (not a Deus ex Machina, stop using this term wrong) she proves to also be willing to backstab her own fellow student council members, which leads me to question how would anyone ever trust and help this bitch again, when she can betray them on a whim.
 
Other members of the student council that matter are:
 
-          Ikishima Midari, who’s completely insane for life-threatening thrills and CARRIES A GUN TO THE SCHOOL! Seriously, how is this ever allowed? Why would anyone accept be put into a school that looks more like an asylum for demented shitbags?
-          Yomozuki Runa, the loli dressed in a bunny hoodie who helps Seitokaichou on her schemes, gleefully plotting against the other members;
-          Kaede Manyuda, the treasurer of the student council, very ambitious and arrogant, quick to dismiss the students he doesn’t consider worthy enough of battling him. By all accounts, he’s the least awful creature in the cast;
-          Sumeragi Itsuki, another crazy bitch, who likes to collect nails from other students, which she rips off whenever they lose to her in gamble;

So, besides allowing its students to be bullied and made into servants, potentially putting them in emotional distress that can severely affect their learning, this schools also allows bodily harm to be inflicted on them, as well as bets that involve possible death. Not crazy enough for you? The institution is also equipped with special sealed rooms, for when Ikishima feels the need to “arrest other students” for her games. Let me spell this out again: this crazy cunt KIDNAPS people and locks them into special cells where she can bet on deadly games with them, using a FIREARM! Do you see why this setting is so hard to buy into?
 
As soon as Yumeko arrives at the institution, her one and only goal is to gamble with every strong opponent she can find, climbing the ladder until she can get the opportunity to challenge Seitokaichou, so the bulk of the narrative is focused on the multiple games she engages in with other members, occasionally crushing their spirit by revealing the manner they cheat, before beating them. Not always successful, though, as early on she manages to lose a serious bet, although it’s implied that was only possible through cheating, and becomes a pet. Interestingly enough, as soon as a previously successful character suddenly becomes a pet, it seems their winning record is instantly forgotten by the scumbag token extras, who immediately shift to bully mode. If you’re like me and has near zero suspension of disbelief for stories where everyone is an asshole, you’ll have a hard time with this one.
 
As Yumeko uses her status as a pet to attract and challenge other student council members, she finally reaches the top members, challenging first Manyuda and ultimately the president. This is the point where the anime turns simply from rage-inducing bad to morally bankrupt filth! Through a seriously logically questionable trick played with the help of Sumeragi, who has an old grudge with Manyuda, they lead him into betting such a high amount of money, that the loss of that game would put him indefinitely subservient to the student council president and destroy his influence in the council, as well as potentially compromising his future and relationship with his father. Yes, it’s that serious! So, of course, he loses and the defeat is followed by Yumeko and Sumeragi gleefully explaining how they manage to reach their ridiculously contrived victory, with the final blow being delivered by the president, by telling him “You’re fired”, making him snap and pass out. In the follow up, Yumeko and Sumeragi discuss what just happens and the way their dialogue is frame tries to imply they had the moral high-ground, somehow. That last bit, to me, is the most infuriating part.
 
Seriously, what exactly was Manyuda’s crime that was apparently so much more despicable in relation to the other students? Seitokaichou introduced a cast system that locks students into the role of cattle, where they remain subservient and bullied by other students, Sumeragi, who now we’re supposed to root for, used to rip people’s nails off, which basically amounts to torture, and Midari makes bets with people’s lives; Am I really supposed to believe that this guy is so much more deserving of having his livelihood and future sadistically crushed because he underestimates his fellow students? When did arrogance become the worst of crimes? I call this idea bullshit and this anime a hypocritical piece of toxic waste.
 
By the way, the ending is a complete cop-out too.
 
Presentation
 
So, do you like variety of facial expression for your characters to help flesh them out as credible, or at least likeable human beings? Tough luck, baby, here it’s ahegao up the ass for you!
 
For those not aware of what I mean, “ahegao” is the term in Japanese for the orgasm face, which despite the definition is not relegated exclusively for porn, but also used in comedic fashion to convey when the character goes through emotional ecstasy. You might have noticed by now that Kakegurui is quite the fan of quantity over quality, and it’ll sure run that trope into the ground whenever it’s needed to convey that the fuck-sticks it passes for humans in the story are going through anything that might be classified as excitement. IT’L ALL THE BLOODY TIME! Whenever someone pull off some maneuver to outsmart or cheat their opponent in a gamble or even when it’s simply to explain the “genius” plan, they will pull off insane orgasm faces and laugh like maniacs. Of course, the biggest offender here has to be Yumeko, because someone up in Valhalla hates me.
 
When it’s not ahegao, it’s contorted maniacal expressions every antagonist feels the need to break into when they feel superior and about to win on a game, or when they try to be threatening. It’s quite laughable, actually, when bunny-loli tries to pull one of these off, as if the show seriously thinks she is in any way the slightest bit scary. Seriously, any of the girls in the main cast can break her in half and this attempt from the show is just pathetic! Characters seem to break into such expressions almost to the same degree as the ahegao, as if to painfully remind you to not ever expect anyone here to have personality any deeper than a spit puddle, and that subtlety died and we buried its corpse when we allowed this disgrace to be written, published and animated. Along with the stupid story, the presentation here is another big problem for the anime, due exactly to the habits just mentioned.
 
Is the voice acting of any help? Not really, although not as egregious as the horrendous faces, no character really demands anything more than two different modes of acting, so it’s nothing to write home either.
 
Personal Ramblings
 
It genuinely felt like this anime was specifically crafted with the perfect combination of traits that can make my blood boil. From the sickening emphasis on the disgusting faces, to Yumeko’s insufferable kind and innocent demeanor, along with the inconsistent, impossible to buy into setting and the fact everyone here is a douchebag, this whole show was intensively infuriating to watch.
 
I swear, I’m not really that hard of a person to please, and it’s not like I can’t enjoy a story where characters are also morally bankrupt or just outright evil. I mean, two of my favorites are Shiki and Black Lagoon, and I don’t think you can say the main characters in those shows are safely good people, what I ask is simply that the show frames that exactly as it is, not as if the horrible people on screen are supposed to be likeable or admired in any way. I am fascinated and genuinely find likability in well written morally ambiguous or evil characters, and I admire characters who display the responsibility and strength of morals I wish I had in my personality, but when the moral center of your story is a selfish, manipulative sociopath who can’t be trusted to have anyone’s well-being in mind, I say you got your priorities kind of backwards!
 
Now, if you excuse me, I’ll look for something trashy to wash away this memory."
97668,"Mild Spoilers for One Punch Man Second Season

The second season of One Punch Man is a miserable fall from grace, with a quadruple whammy of circumstances contextualizing the gravity of the show’s failures. It’s a sequel to one of the most well-animated mainstream anime of all time, released over 3 years later. On top of that, this franchise’s counterpart, Mob Psycho 100, got adapted for a second season that practically pushed the boundaries of current TV anime 3 months before this season came out. Combined with the awful feel and presentation of this new season, that set of circumstances becomes the world’s nastiest measuring stick. Sadly, the inability to live up to any decent set of expectations isn’t unexpected when you look at all the writing on the wall. The stiff and barely animated trailers, the off artwork, and the fact that production switched over to J.C. Staff all should have told you this was doomed to fail. The worst part is I can’t even blame the people involved, as they simply didn’t have the time, physical capacity, or resources to pull together an acceptable product. It’s a cruel joke, and a herculean task for director Chikara Sakurai and team to be burdened with.

This isn’t to say that that this season would have been great if Madhouse or the original team took over. Boogiepop 2019 was animated by the same team and studio as One Punch Man Season 1 and it didn’t look that good. It was plagued with terrible artwork and redesigns, and a sheer lack of the atmosphere that both its source material and the 2000 anime bathed in, thanks to the removal of the rustic color palette for a generic one. Madhouse also animated the Overlord anime trilogy, which is littered with repulsive CGI and artwork that I’m not a fan of. The two shows they produced this season are a powerpoint presentation baseball anime and a show no one likes that apparently also suffers from hideous CGI, so it’s safe to say there’s no way they’d fix this on a visual level. Maybe the color palette wouldn’t be so unpleasant but that’s about it. Hell, I’m not even sure that studio could fix how drab this season feels, since everything feels so floaty, awkward, and self-serious. The jokes, the excessive monologuing, the terrible attempts at emotional beats, and the mind-shattering attempts at retroactively downplaying the threat of the first season’s climax are all downright surreal.

When it comes to the jokes, there’s none of the exaggeration or punchy energy to them that was present in season 1, and the lack of comedic facial expressions only adds to how limp and awkward the delivery is this season. The deadpan humor is also weakened by the stumbling, borderline lifeless presentation. I can honestly count on one hand the number of times I even chuckled in any given episode, barring maybe episode 3. On top of that, despite Saitama still one-punching overconfident bad guys in this season --i.e the main gimmick/punchline of the first season-- we don’t get to see him OHKO anyone on-screen even once until the finale. Perhaps they thought saving it up for a grand climax was a good idea, but all things considered, it’s just not worth it.

Getting back to the other issues at hand, one of the strangest criticisms I’ve ever had to lay out is that moments that seem to have happened simultaneously like the encounter between Genos and Speed-o’-Sound Sonic and the encounter between Saitama and Fubuki in episode 2 turn out to not happen simultaneously. This isn’t the first time that time becomes a liability in the show but detailing the other instance in the second half would get into some head scratching spoilers. Another strange issue is how some episodes just end abruptly, as if they had no idea where and how to stop an episode. For a more traditional complaint, the pacing in this show is abysmal. Once the main arc of the season kicks in around episode 3, the pacing slows down to a crawl for several episodes before blitzing through everything in episode 7. The weirdest part about this is how apparently this adaptation has been burning through chapters like Sonic speeds through stages, making the sense of fatigue and whiplash all the more dizzying. No matter what, things just happen with no time to really establish anything or allow the audience to breathe and let things sink in. This, along with lifeless direction and lackluster character writing, makes it so there’s almost never any weight or impact to the big and intense moments that permeate the bulk of the season, adding to the vicious cycle of everything and nothing happening as events simply cycle through one another for no apparent reason. It’s issues like this that remind me why even in season 1, OPM was never good at being a serious narrative, let alone shuffling between parody and serious shounen.

That said, the overarching narrative of this season isn’t necessarily bad on its own. In theory, showing how the hero organization is now yet another corporation that cares more about the safety of its executives than those who work for them, and how it, Suiryu, and Garou are all foils to the heroic traits Saitama values and finds fun in, are good ideas. On top of that, the narrative genuinely gets interesting towards the last leg of the show. It’s just that everything gets tremendously bogged down by terrible presentation, hollow characterization (which we’ll get to), and a sense that vital moments are actively missing from otherwise solid character arcs and plotlines. Even worse, this season’s bloated, badly paced, and watered-down arc is all setup for a third season, so all of that arc fatigue meant nothing.

Speaking of nothing, there’s the gigantic cast of characters for this season. The characters all feel stale, including Saitama, the most entertaining character from the first season. He’s no longer this disgruntled guy who wants some respect for the hard work he put into his fun superhero craft, nor is he someone constantly wishing to fight someone strong because he hates how he can just one-shot everyone. The first scene of episode 1 tries to pretend that he still deals with the former issue, but make it past that and you’ll see that’s not the case. As for the latter problem, it’s no longer this drive that’s been eating away at him due to how disappointed he is all the time. Instead, he just casually wants stronger opponents, so he enters a tournament of martial artists, where he meets a foil of his now watered-down need to fight strong opponents. They don’t justify any of this either, so it creates this disconnect between season 1 Saitama and season 2 Saitama. They try diving back into the issue in episode 9, but they should have further demonstrated how empty he was feeling beforehand, as this episode cements that he’s not just bored, he’s practically lost and depressed. It feels like prior to tackling this issue, they wanted to give Saitama a flat arc, where people grow around him. They didn’t do a good job, for reasons mentioned prior. Another reason this doesn’t work is that the rest of the characters are incredibly one-note and eager to monologue about their baggage at the drop of a hat. Several of these monologues are intrusive and redundant as well, so the sheer abundance of them becomes grating, especially early on when they’re at their most prevalent. You know it’s bad when the one-off heroes and villains have more personality and presence to them than important side characters like King and Fubuki. Secondary and tertiary characters were never one of season 1’s strengths, but this is just lousy! 

We do at least have a somewhat entertaining villain, that being Garou. However, when everything around him is so dull and when the action and presentation is as bad as it is, his intimidation and fun factor are somewhat diminished. Additionally, despite him actively going out of his way to kill both heroes and villains in his first scene and siding with the monsters who kill heroes and everyone else alike, he doesn’t kill anyone in subsequent fights. They don’t even try to justify this inconsistency. He does have some decent scenes and he does work as a warped foil of everything Saitama stands for, so despite the glaring inconsistency mentioned earlier, he’s still the best character in this show full of lifeless side characters for whatever that’s worth. On top of that, his arc to become stronger is probably the only compelling piece of writing in the show. He’s not the only foil for Saitama, as Suiryu from the god-awful tournament arc is like a more selfish, less dangerous version of him. His main difference is that he wants an easy life with his strength, and we actually see a decent arc come from him halfway into the series. The show gets to a point where I sometimes almost root for him and Garou because almost everyone else in this show is so unlikable. Practically everyone in this show is either a blank sheet or a total prick, sometimes both! Apart from a few side characters in episode 11, the only notable exception is Metal Bat, and that’s literally because of one scene at a sushi bar with like two funny jokes. Yes, they wanna show that heroes aren’t all morally sound because Garou has to have a point, but that doesn’t mean we need Saitama’s foils to be the only ones with any layered writing behind them. One last issue regarding characters is that even the world around them has none of the vibrancy and personality than in season 1. None of the one-offs are as funny or vivid as the disgruntled alien crew from the end of season 1. What a shame.

Another positive aspect of the first season was the music. The OP was a thrill ride and the admittedly overplayed OST was filled with incredibly memorable tracks that accentuated the hype and emotionally satisfying feel the show aimed for. None of these return for this second season (barring that one time they remixed one of the OG season’s tracks in episode 5), and in their place lies a bunch of boring background tracks (save for one or two of them) and a mediocre opening that doesn’t even remotely capture any of the excitement or aggressiveness it shoots for. The visuals are somehow even more lifeless in the OP than in the show too, which almost never happens. The ED is also grating to listen to thanks to the vocals, and it’s even worse than season 1’s lackluster ED. The part that stings the most is that the composer for this season was Makoto Miyazaki, the same guy who did the last season’s music. What happened?

Above all else, this show’s most controversial aspect is its visuals. By the standards of season one, the standards of the manga, the standards of both seasons of the franchise’s counterpart Mob Psycho 100, the standards of an action anime, and even anime in general, the visuals of One Punch Man Season 2 are terrible. There’s about as little animation as your current non-action seasonal or a long-running slideshow like Yugioh Duel Monsters, and almost no visual flair to compensate, with loads of panning shots, and badly edited quick cuts which make some of the fight scenes simultaneously as unstimulating as the rest of the show, and more incomprehensible than the most badly edited fight scenes from SAO and Fate/Apocrypha. Episode 7’s fights are the worst by far, with constant character model mishaps, extreme usage of bad, looping ghosting afterimages to simulate characters attacking rapidly, frame rate-killing camera movements, and CGI objects that also kill the frame rate. Even the best fights are barely above your average Fairy Tail GIF-fests, and your average fight in this show is just that but undetailed and incomplete. There are occasional, freakish drawing mishaps even outside of the fight scenes, such as the sequence where Saitama’s head is shaped like a lightbulb during a camera rotation in episode 1, or the entirety of Saitama’s conversation with King in episode 9. That alone is inexcusable, especially when this anime is 90% panning shots filled with stock assets as is! It’s even worse here where the artwork tends to be incredibly rough and badly drawn, especially with the characters’ faces and the close-up shots with inconsistent outlining, especially in episode 1. Practically every episode has a unique, outstandingly awful visual blunder to notice, and the few well-animated cuts in the show, primarily towards the final third of the series, can’t make up for that.

The strange charcoal coloring of Genos’s metal frame doesn’t even feel like it fits with the rest of the drawing of the character, and not only is it inconsistent with his season 1 frame, it constantly changes from scene to scene in the first two episodes with no rhyme or reason. As of episode 3, it seems like they’ve settled on what he should look like again before changing it one more time in another repair late into the second half, but that should have been done in the character design phase, not after production of certain episodes has ended. You can’t use the excuse of him getting all those repairs and new parts since he did the same in season 1 while looking consistent. The show doesn’t justify this itself, so neither should you. Back to the issue of charcoal-esque metal feeling out of place on the characters they’re attached to, as it applies to another returning character, Speed-o’-Sound Sonic, and other pieces of metal like Metal Bat’s...bat. This raises another issue with the show as a whole: the coloring in this season feels off. This season has a darker and more off-putting color palette than before, and along with some of the colors they used, it makes the show generally awkward and strangely bleak to look at. Even if the show somehow was animated beautifully, the color palette alone makes this show aesthetically displeasing to me. It’s a shame considering how good the returning character designs are, since now they just look off, regardless of if they’re on-model or not. Still, along with the interiors and entire buildings comprised of terrible CG assets, all of these issues make it so there can almost never be a scene that genuinely feels great to look at. Even the incredibly few moments of fluid animation suffer from most of these issues.

This isn’t even a question of failing to live up to the stellar animation quality and overall visuals of the first season; this is a case of visuals that are just plain bad. It doesn’t take an animation snob to look at this and go “wow this looks wrong” or “this feels off”. No one should be grateful that a studio forced a bunch of overworked, under-scheduled staff members --including a director with almost no prior directorial experience-- to make this show. It’s not a gift, it’s a product, and a badly produced one at that. The production is so bad that the proofreader for this review had an absolute ball with the visuals, often pointing out several awful aspects and moments even I didn’t even notice. Sure, it’s no Berserk 2016/17 or Hand Shakers franchise, but that doesn’t mean we should bend over backwards just because this is a continuation of a show most of us like. As much as it hurts to say, I’m glad that this hate train started simply because it shows that even despite the pushback against this movement, we can still put our foot down on what is and isn’t an acceptable product. It shouldn’t take 3 episodes for us to see a fight with acceptable animation quality or a single cool shot, nor should it take until episode 9 for them to even attempt any interesting techniques. It also shouldn’t need up to 5 animation directors working on an episode like with episodes 2 (or 15 in the case of episode 8). That just proves this show was poorly managed, badly scheduled, and doomed to fail. 

This really is the anime equivalent to Anthem and Mass Effect: Andromeda, isn’t it?

The second season of One Punch Man is the end product of mismanagement and production issues emblematic of the dismal state of the industry. This show was practically destined to fail when given to a studio that’s been spreading their teams thin through 2-5+ projects a season and having well-documented scheduling issues for the past 3 years. I can’t imagine what the team must have gone through, trying their damndest to live up to the show’s monumental expectations with such little time, staffing, or resources. It’s crushing to think that when OPM 1 came out 3 years ago, people jumped on the hype train, and now with season 2, people are jumping on the hate train. Hell, as someone who only kind of liked season 1, that’s the main reason I watched this season. While the first season functioned as the fun blockbuster anime it wanted to be, this second season was unable to truly be what it wanted to be. Honestly, it’s more depressing than hateful, and it didn’t have to be this way. That’s the anime industry for you, where blood, sweat, and tears are soaked up by cash that get put into the next season’s 5 isekai shows. One Punch Man 2 is a casualty of the industry we’re encouraged to support, and the worst part is people are ok with this.

1,"Introduction:
Let me start by saying that there’s a lot to like about Cowboy Bebop. The animation and designs are sublime, the soundtrack is fantastic, the action is great, and when all three come together the show can occasionally become a jaw-dropping audiovisual masterpiece, especially in the 5th episode. However, I feel like I am the only person in the world who doesn't LOVE this series. To me, it was a slow-paced, episodic mess that felt like a chore to watch sometimes. It isn’t trash, but it definitely isn’t the masterpiece people claim it is either. 

Plot:
The episodes that contributed to the main plot of the series were few and far between. It felt like I was watching fillers most of the time which would have been fine if the fillers were actually interesting, but unfortunately, most of them aren’t. However, there were a few episodes that really drew me in, only to be shattered by disappointment when the next episode focused on something entirely unrelated. It felt like a slap in the face after being mesmerized by something cool.

The character backstories were so lackluster. If they had used all those filler episodes to fill in some of the blanks about the pasts of each of the main characters, it might have become a great series. Instead, we got a bits and pieces of information here and there and that was pretty much it. I wanted to know more about Jet during his police force days, or about the things Faye remembered when she regained her memories, or how Ed managed to survive by herself for so long before meeting the Bebop crew. Instead, we got tons of throwaway episodes about Spike getting his ship repaired, Ed playing chess, and the crew getting high off of space mushrooms, which held no relevance to the main story-line whatsoever.

The biggest example of filler would have to be the Toys in the Attic episode. Some blob monster goes around making the entire crew sick and it is up to Spike to stop it. Most of the crew spent the entire episode unconscious and Spike spent most of it shooting at the creature, so you can’t even excuse it as simple character development. It was nothing but an utter waste of my time.

It's because of this that the quality of the episodes vary dramatically. For an episodic show that only has about five episodes that build an overall story, that's saying a lot. You have some of the best and worst episodes of the series coming out back to back, and that really threw me off.

Characters:
Like I said before, character depth definitely isn’t one of this show’s strengths, due to the lack of time the writers spent trying to actually develop them and flesh out their backstories. They were boring, so I never ended up feeling any sort of attachment to any member of the cast. 

img800()

Spike and Jet are the only remotely decent characters, but that really isn’t saying much in all honesty. They’re both badass bounty hunters with seemingly tragic backstories, but the show didn’t spend nearly enough time revisiting their past lives. Instead, the show focused more on their jobs in present day and that’s a huge shame in my opinion.

img800()

Faye exhibits many of the worst characteristics that can be written about a female character. She's bossy, greedy, obsessed with her looks, and is only a hindrance to the group for most of the show. She constantly needs to be rescued or tracked down, and now that I think about it, I don’t think she ever did anything useful in the entirety of the show. She mostly served as a fan-service character for the audience to drool over and nothing more.

img800()

Edward did nothing but annoy me for the entire show. She was an utterly pointless character that hardly receives any development beyond her introductory episode. She merely existed to provide some more wholesome humor to Cowboy Bebop, but it had the exact opposite effect on me. Not to mention, I still don’t know why anybody would name their daughter Edward in the first place.

img800()

The main villain Vicious is especially bad. He has zero personality aside from his desire for more power, and even though the show goes a bit into his backstory, it never establishes his motivation and reasoning for his behavior in present day. At the end of the show, Vicious is little more than an evil guy in a black coat with enough fighting skill to make Spike struggle to land a bullet in him, aside from the obvious fact that Vicious becomes a representation of the syndicate Spike ran away from. As a result, the five episodes that involve him never left me feeling all that amazed, as the show intends them to be.

Conclusion:
All in all, the show is still pretty good. Although the writing is clearly lacking most of the time, the animation, music, and voice acting are phenomenal for the entire series. It’s not the best anime has to offer by any means, but I could definitely see this being a solid gateway show for people new to the medium."
20594,"Sword Art Online is a controversial anime, and while it is heavily flawed (especially the Alfeim arc), it has certain appeal and has plenty of entertainment value, as long as expectations are managed. Unfortunately, none of the positives from the first season of Sword Art Online transfer to the second season.

Where the first season of Sword Art Online failed, the second season manages to exacerbate the failures, and where the first season succeeded, the second season does not succeed. For the sake of brevity and simplicity, the season can be divided into three arcs, all of which are completely and utterly unrelated except for their title (more on that later); Death Gun, Excalibur, and Mother's Rosario. Death Gun as an arc is ""okay"" for those that enjoyed the first season, but the rest of the show lacks anything positive, entertaining, or interesting, unless the watcher is a very, very dedicated fan.

The Death Gun arc is by a unspeakably large margin the best part of the season, with a sense of urgency, danger and simple mystery that goes well with the first season. To put the arc into simple terms, a VRMMO game called Gun Gale Online has a problem, people are dying by a player's hand in the game. In real life. But no worries, this arc is ended with a grand total of  three player deaths with an unsatisfying and predictable ending with Kirito basically forgetting the events two episodes later. Be that as it may, seeing Kirito be Kirito again is fun, even if it is quite bland, and we see plenty of character development for him as a person post the events of season one and the psychological issues that come with what happened. Sinon's character is also decent if cookie cutter, with a conflict and a goal of resolution. Does that resolution come? Partially, and she as a character is almost entirely forgotten the minute the arc ends. 

The Excalibur arc has no place outside of a 2 OVA side story series. It can be summed up as such: A part of Alfeim has a nice shiny sword, here's some lore about the game, and here's some lazy fight scenes. Some nice feel-good scenes with Kirito, Asuna and Yui to transition into mother's rosario. Done. The entirety of the arc is insultingly simple and boring. Some nice art of the Alfeim landscape isn't enough to tame the boredom that is produced by any watcher other than the most die-hard fans of Sword Art Online as a franchise. 

Mother's Rosario is based around Asuna (or a character that looks like Asuna with the same name, that is) making a friend followed by a needlessly depressing ending to the season. Add in some frustrating and angering exposition with Asuna's mother and the other inconsequential characters doing nothing on the sidelines. 

Each arc could potentially be completed in two episodes, maybe three, each. Instead, we are greeted with 24 episodes of almost entirely pointless story telling that contains shells of Sword Art Online characters. Elaborating on the point about the arcs being unrelated, that goes for the season and season one as well. For almost the entire season, it's almost like Kirito and Asuna don't even know each other, saying nothing about them supposedly being in love. Every other character is along for the ride of whatever poorly written short story has been shoved into the mouth of the viewer. The characters featured in Sword Art Online II are nothing more than drawings with the same names and appearances of the characters from season one. Any of the character and depth they had before is almost entirely missing spare for Kirito in the Death Gun arc. 

This dry, flavorless cake is topped by a cherry of recycled music, perfectly average art, and a obvious and painful lack of love, effort, and soul put into the production of the anime. Sword Art Online II is an unfortunate victim to almost every single thing that can be done wrong in an anime, and short of helplessly obsessed fans of the first season, provides very little entertainment value past the lackluster at best first arc, because everything that follows is boring to the point of being inflammatory and frustrating.


Covering the dub:

The dub is just as bad as it was in the first season, with the same extreme over enthusiasm as the first season. Somehow though this season manages to be worse, especially accounting for the lack of emotion in the characters as a whole. Best watched subbed."
105310,"Let me preface by saying that this review will just be a wall of text for now, as I am at my internship and am not going to look for anime screenshots on here. I will also say that this review is a mix of subjective opinions, and ""objective"" opinions. Objective being the story quality and such, they're not really objective but I have no other way to differentiate them.

Scroll down for a TL;DR.

I'm not going to talk about the premise here, I like jumping into anime blind so for others who want to do so as well, this is just for you ;).

It's a very simple story, and very obviously shounen. Mostly consisting of fighting and getting better, really nothing special. The world is pretty interesting though, with fire departments all being completely different and having their own secrets. Like always though, the villains' motives are dumb as hell, and just there to be villains. It's realy nothing special and that's good, I don't care, it's a battle-shounen.


This show is full of characters, and especially the 8th fire department has a great dynamic. Shinra and Arthur are both dumb as hell, and I love dumb characters so their rivalry antics are extremely fun to watch. The other characters in the squad are cool too, although Maki's one and only joke is very stupid. Aside from the 8th department, the other departments also have fun characters, like Hibana. She has big tits.

(best guy is Benimaru, love him and his squad)


This is where Fire Force really shines, the fight scene animations are top notch and shine all the way through, in every single one. Just watch the first episode and be amazed. Shinra's jet-fucking-engine feet look incredible and all explosions look beautiful too. 

The reason the animation does not get a 10/10 is because of the scenes outside of combat. This is where it's very obviously the Shaft people animating/directing it. (If you didn't know, many people from Shaft moved to David Productions, and worked on Fire Force.) You've got this awkward conversations where there's just a static image of them far away, blank faces and weird close ups straight out of the monogatari series. There's a lot of talking, so you'll see this a lot. I don't particularly mind, as I love Shaft, but it is still awkward and can be at least decreased to a degree.

Yes! The sound! It's good. it's good sound. The voice actors deliver their lines well, I really have nothing to complain about.  
Shinra's fire sound are just jet engine how cool is that? Fucking cool. It's fucking cool.

The music is awesome too, it's got this orchestral feel to it and an awesome leitmotif that keeps coming back and I fucking love leitmotifs. It's hype, the OST is hype. Thank you. Goodbye.


Good shit, I definitely recommend watching it. The battles are fun and cool, the animation is fluid, the soundtrack is fun, the voice actors are good, the world is interesting, the story is not. Thank you for reading this shitty review!"
6547,"so this isnt going to be a typical review, (mostly because i suck at writing reviews) a lot of people have commented on the lack of episodes and the effect that had on over half of the characters being totally under developed due to time constraints (couldn't agree more), nor is this going to be a comment on the music in the show (which was very good) or the animation quality (again very good animation) im not even going to go into the story all that much

SPOILERS 

while all these are important features to an anime and some aspects including length of the show stopped this from being a 10/10, this isn't what i want to spend time talking about, because for me these things were not what made Angel Beats one of the best anime i have ever seen

This show is one of the rare anime i have seen that got an actual emotional response from me (mainly because i watch comedies) it made me continually hit the next episode button causing me to stay up til 6.30 this morning (something my boss didnt appreciate at all) 

i have only really been into anime for a little over 12 months now but have been watching anime films and shows for over 20 years as a very casual viewer and have about 150 shows under my belt, most in the last 12 months (not that i have become addicted or anything). I mention this because i missed all the hype about the show so the only thing i knew after i read the synopsis was the show was about a guy who wakes up to find out out he is dead from a girl with a big gun. this brief synopsis led me to believe this was going to be an action comedy all be it a very good one from the rating of 9th most popular anime of all time 

Shockingly what i got instead was a heartbreaking story about loss and regret, pain, powerless and above all love and redemption disguised as a comedy action 

i probably wouldn't have watched this if id have known what this show was actually about.(opting to stay in my planned queue for the rest of eternity)  Ive never seen Clanned/after story and am avoiding it like the plague. i dont like shows like this. i watch anime for escapism, not to sit there thinking about my own personal regrets or times when i was powerless in my life or the times when life was just utterly unfair (i play poker so that's quite often) 

i think the character that stood out most for me was Yui a young girl that was kind of on the outside of the main group who wanted to be a singer, a wrestler, hit a home run and fall in love and be married. she seemed to be a mirror of the show, full of life, fun but with a truly deep and touching aspect to her, My heart broke when Hinatoa confessed his love for her

overall this show was beautiful looking, great well written characters, funny, charming, far too short and i am so glad i didnt know anything about it before watching it, well worth watching if you have not seen it 

if i was to recommend something else similar it would be hinamatsuri, more comedy and less dark but still hits you in the feels more than once"
99263,"Modern anime seems to be cursed with Isekai after Isekai. From Sword Art Online to Knights and Magic, it has had more than its share of controversial ( Especially SAO) or just downright terrible anime. Innovation is often left to very basic changes in the structure of the show that cause it to stand out. Konosuba, for example, is a comedy anime first and an Isekai second, it stars a deadpan, dry, and despondent protagonist with a cast of female characters with such clear comedic and ridiculous flaws that any sort of generic, unnuanced harem forming is entirely out of the question. Overlord and Youjo Senki both follow an evil or at least amoral protagonist. Re:Zero brings interesting and formulated mechanics to the world it takes place in. No Game No Life at least gives the watcher and interesting concept and fun visuals to take in. Shield Hero attempts all of these in the most lazy, half-hearted ways possible and accomplishes nothing at all.

Firstly, the show is technically poor. The use of badly made CGI rivals the early episodes of romance anime Tsuki ga Kirei, and otherwise the art and animation is just uninteresting or downright unappealing. The world's visuals lack and flair and character, instead being conformed to the most boring, uninviting and generic fantasy setting that it can possibly be. Of course, what's a modern anime without cute girls? Shield hero has them, and has plenty of them, but clearly all of the attention in character design was set of them, as basically every male save for a disgusting fat nobleman that wouldn't be out of place in a gross hentai and a shopkeep with darker skin has the exact same facial design and proportions.  The fight animation is serviceable but suffers from Light Novel syndrome, or way too many times where everyone stands around and does absolutely nothing for so long that it causes the viewer's mind to wander from the boring and often needless dialogue. Monogatari this is not. Show, don't tell. 

But technical inspiration and quality is the least of Shield Hero's concerns. The plot is rife with ass-pulls, jolly conveniences and lack of actually giving a shit on the creator's part. The amount of times a character pulls through impossible odds due to sheer willpower is staggering, and rivals the absolutely ridiculous times it happened in SAO. At least in SAO it made a certain degree of sense, especially with the implications that are brought forth in Alicization (Which absolutely does not excuse the decisions made in SAO's embarrassingly bad direction). Shield Hero makes no attempt to atone for its lazy and embarrassingly trope-laiden writing. 

The most unfortunate part of the anime's poor performance is that it had a very strong start. A young man who seems to have it made as a hero in a fantasy world is thrown to the dogs with nothing. He finds companionship in an unlikely place, and starts to move forward. Everything goes downhill from the moment Filo is introduced. Shield Hero goes from an intense, suspenseful story to a waifubait harem anime with a basic, poor plot coming along for the trip, populated by characters with the depth of a kiddie pool.

Shield Hero is a great representation of what not to do when creating an anime."

Let’s get this out of the way, Mob Psycho 100 was already an amazing show and there’s lots of reasons why season 2 is several steps above season 1 from the spectacular visuals and animation, to the structure and pacing of the plot itself, to the charming sense of humor and emotional heft and of course the character development that our main characters go through as well, but none of that gets to the heart of what elevated Mob Psycho 100 season 2 from a great show to a masterpiece.

More than any of that, it’s Mob Psycho 100’s humanism and thoughtfulness that makes it stand out from the rest. It’s celebration of human connection, both good and bad, and how each and every encounter you have with different people can mould you as a person is a central theme that is prevalent in almost all aspects of the series. Episode 1 sets the theme of this season perfectly starting off with a little short story that amounts to Mob realising he needs to put in the effort to understand other peoples and his own feelings to help him grow as a person which sets off his character development.




The humanity of this show shines most clearly when it’s focused on our protagonist and his Master, which at first seemed unbalanced because Reigen appeared to be purely taking advantage of his student. When Mob’s growth causes a shift in their relationship and cracks start to appear because of insecurities, it is a humbling moment to see Reigen forced to reevaluate that Mob has grown up and it spurs a change in him as we see him taking an active role in Mobs life to give him the help and advice he needs as he tackles adolescence. Acknowledging that their bond is meaningful and dear to both of them and that their meeting gave them both a purpose in life is the essence of what this show is about, creating connections that will guide you to better yourself.



This theme about the community and people you surround yourself with and how they will affect your life would not be complete without talking about the Body Improvement Club, their unrelenting positive vibes and goodness is the driving force behind most of Mobs character development this season. Their involvement in the show which once seemed to be a simple gag ended up being the reason for Mob proactive attitude and bringing Mob courage in some of the toughest fights of his life. Perhaps one of the biggest examples of the change the right environment can bring you is seen through Dimple as he slowly takes on the role of a protector and worries over Mob. To a lesser, but no less important, extent Mob’s family and their encouragement to help him achieve his goals is what keeps him grounded as his battles reach absurd heights. These are the people Mob remembers when he’s about to lose all hope or lose himself to his psychic powers.



Considering the overarching theme of the season and how its lovingly crafted into every single aspect of this show, it is no surprise that the main villains of this season are characters who are the antithesis of human connection. Their philosophies clash with Mob’s of course like any shonen until they fight it out but that’s not nearly as important as how the fights change Mob as a person. Growing through the foes you face is hardly a novel concept, it feels refreshing though because Mobs growth isn’t related to his powers, but to become a better person for the ones he loves. It is through communicating with these awful characters that Mob comes to the understanding that there are some truly terrible people out there. When Mob accepts this fact, he’s quick to throw away his pacifism and fight them with all his strength. Despite most of the show advocating for self improvement, Mob Psycho 100 displays nuance and maturity by showcasing not everyone will be 100% susceptible to change and that sometimes you might end up being changed instead. The final battle is less a clash of strength and beliefs and more a showcase of Mob applying every lesson that he learnt through the course of the season from both good and bad people.


img1000()

“I wanted it to be something that feels kind. When I came up with the concept, I was thinking something along the lines of ‘kindness’ or ‘the connections between people’” - ONE

At its core, Mob Psycho 100 is not a story about an insanely over-powered person, but about a kid learning what it means to grow up. It’s about appreciating your family and friends for all that they do for you all cause they want to see you achieve your full potential. It’s about learning from your hardships, and even from the people you dislike. It’s about empathising with others and giving everyone a fair chance in life. It’s about being good-willed and offering the world some kindness in your every day life because the little moments matter the most. It’s about the human condition."

Tokyo Revengers: The anime where middle school delinquents have more power than anyone else in the world. Tokyo revengers got to be one of the dumbest anime I have watched this year. The main problems I had with Tokyo Revengers is that it is a bad time travel anime set in a world where adults seem to not exist, the story is also really predictable and to top it all off the main character is really unlikeable. 

TIME TRAVEL IN TOKYO REVENGERS IS ASS

Time travel films in a nutshell:
Something bad happens -> main character goes back in time to fix that bad event -> fixing that bad event causes more bad events to happen -> Now you just accept that the past can’t be fixed or you’re just stuck in loop of bad events. Well, Tokyo revengers follow the same formula. Tokyo revengers is your typical time travel anime with a time travel system that is unexplained and is concealed for literally the entire anime. Time travel plays a major role in this anime yet we don’t know much about it, other than Takewimpy shaking hands with Naoto allows Takewimpy to go back 12 years to the past or 12 years to the future. Why Naoto? Why not anyone else? Why does it have to be a handshake?  Why 12 years? These are questioned that is never asked by Takebitchy or Naoto. I see this as lazy writing by the author Wakui, Ken. The time travels could’ve been explained a little more for people who have never seen a time travel film. But all the other people like myself who have seen time travel films we can just theorize about how it works even if the mangaka doesn’t straight up tell us. I also find it stupid how even after Takemitchy makes changes to the past nothing changes for him in the future up until the very last ep of season 1. If Takemitchy became a loser because he got bullied by a bunch of 3rd years why didn't the future change after he met Mikey and had a better school experience than the first time? 

TAKEMITCHY IS A TERRIBLE PROTAGONIST FOR THIS ANIME

img600(

I usually love watching shounen anime even if it’s a very generic shounen anime, but Tokyo revengers is one of those anime’s I just couldn’t enjoy because of how aggravating the characters were. Mainly because of how much of a crybaby, feeble, pussy, Takebitchy was. I see Takemitchy as more of a side character than a main character I have never in my life seen a more useless main character than Takemitchy. Tokyo revenger is a gang anime and Takemitchy the main character in a gang anime doesn’t know how to fight or even defend himself. Im not saying every shounen main character needs to be overpowered but at least make it so Takemitchy can defend himself. 24 episodes into this anime and Takemitchy hasn’t gotten any character developments physically. Mentally Takemitchy has become more confident but that’s about all the character development he’s gotten over the span of 24 episodes. Literally every scene with a conflict between Takemitchy and any other character Takemitchy will start using talk no jutsu instead of throwing hands. I find it hilarious how Takemitchy constantly says “ I WILL BE THE HEAD OF TOMAN” yet this idiot can’t even defend himself, how is he gonna become head of toman? By talking his way to very tipitty top? It’s really pathetic seeing the main character whose only purpose in the anime is to get his ass beat and somehow talk his way out of situations.

BAD WORLD BUILDING

Like I said earlier Tokyo Revengers seems like it's set in a world where adults don't seem to exist. Every gang is filled with teenagers in middle school and these kids can do whatever the fuck they want because there's never any adults around to stop them. There was a scene in the anime where Mikey goes into Takemitchy's school, beats up like 5 kids, and walks into Takemitchy's classroom and not a single teacher was there to stop him. No teachers, no security guards, not a single adult anywhere. The only time I see adults interfering with these gang activities in this anime is when gang fights are over and the cops pull up. To most people, this might not be a problem but to me I just find Tokyo Revengers to be extremely dumb because of moments like this. 
youtube(https://youtu.be/NjmH1dkrk)

OTHER THINGS I DIDNT LIKE

Mikey's plot armor - There was a segment in the anime where Mikey got hit by a metal rod like 5 times in a row and Mikey somehow survives. There was another moment where mikey's brother got hit on the head by a metal rod once and he died. I mean it's pretty obvious Mikey is the Levi of this show, this man has insane plot armor.

Characters being over emotional - Every character in this anime resorts to violence, there's never a moment where characters talk things out it always end with a fight or a threat. Like when Mikey threatened to kill Takemitchy if he didn't bring baji back from Valhalla. I guess this was supposed to be a badass moment for Mikey but i just found weird how he threatened to kill his own friend, his own gang member if he doesn't do something that is very difficult to do.

Final Thoughts

Overall I found Tokyo Revengers to be extremely dumb and unenjoyable, at times I was confused by who their target audience was, one moment they are talking about pah chin's girlfriend getting raped and next moment they are making poop jokes. Personally I believe Tokyo Revengers could've been much better if it had a better main character and a time travel system that wasn't concealed."
142329,"First review! Totally gonna get lost under the sea of demon slayer reviews from fanboys and haters alike now that s2 is over but oh well. I love this show a lot, but I recognize that there are a lot of problems with it that can get in the way of others enjoying it. Here I'll try to break down this season, compare it to the previous one, and talk about why I really enjoyed it as best I can with my amateur writing skills. 

Characters: Better! 

One of the weaker elements in the first season was the characters, and while this season doesn't change the game entirely in that department it does get a bit better. Zenitsu and Inosuke are actually cool more consistently and less annoying overall. Tanjiro is still just as pure and kindhearted. The Rengoku arc was wrapped up nicely and we get some closure with his asshat of a Dad which is nice, and probably the best you're gonna get from Demon Slayer in terms of character writing. 

Uzui Tengen, the new Hashira introduced, is great. He's cool, full of personality and loads of fun to watch on-screen. I didn't have much of an attachment to Rengoku, and Tengen completely blows him out of the water in terms of enjoyability. His interactions and dynamic with his three(! what a chad) wives are fun and cute and I'm glad they didn't shoehorn in a half-assed, predictable and boring ""polygamy bad >:("" storyline.

The wives themselves are pretty one-note but they're entertaining enough to watch. The demons are cool but not because of the character writing, the obligatory human backstory given at the end was pretty generic and boring and didn't do much for me. 

Demon Slayer's characters were never gonna win any awards and I totally get finding them totally boring or unenjoyable, but I personally think they do the job perfectly fine and are quite fun to watch. 

A big part of the show that seems to be one of the biggest reasons people don't like it is, of course, the childish humor. It was there in season one, it was there in Mugen Train, and its here in Entertainment District. Sometimes its funny, most of the time its obnoxious, but I'd still rather it be here than not. 

As a comparison, another show that, like Demon Slayer, has meh writing but good animation made by ufotable is Katsugeki Touken Ranbu. But I love Demon Slayer and dropped Katsugeki after two episodes, and one is the biggest thing in Japan while the other is practically unheard of. Why? Because Katsugeki was boring as shit. Demon Slayer at least has personality. It has style and flair. Sure, its a divisive personality that not everyone's gonna love, but it at least has one. I'd rather a show have some childish moments backed by great animation than just a load of boring uninspired nothing backed with great animation; at least its not boring. 

But I guess that brings me to another issue with this season specifically, that it can't decide whether its target audience is 8 year olds or 16 year olds. Childish humor can be somewhat charming in a cringy, goofy way. Big titty thick thighed ninja wives with a lot of exposed skin and a sexy prostitute demon can be enjoyable in a guilty-pleasure sort of way. But if you're flipping between the two every 5 minutes than it becomes a little jarring. 

Like as I'm watching the first half of it I imagine a Japanese family watching this season, with middle aged salaryman parents and 2 kids, one in high school and one in elementary school and it switches back and forth between half naked women fighting and Zenitsu crying his eyes out after getting bullied by Inosuke and it just seems like no one in this family is having a good time. Taking darker, sexier and more adult themes and wrapping it in eight-year old jokes just feels a bit weird. Thankfully that problem goes away near the second half as the show becomes a 2 hour long rollercoaster of a fight scene stretched over several episodes

Animation: Even Better
Fights in General: Less Good


Despite ufotable somehow managing to step up their animation game even more, the fights other than the climax felt less impactful and realistic. The animation is consistently flashier and more dynamic, and while sometimes CG models stand out as a bit strange looking for the most part they look flawless. The biggest problem with this season's fights is the power scaling. Tanjiro's HInokami Kagura that he uses only once in the biggest moments of season one and Mugen Train he now uses again, and again, and again, 

and again, 

and I get that that's demonstrating how much stronger he's getting over time but it just doesn't feel as impactful anymore. He keeps getting his ass beat to the point where he should've died already but nope, don't worry he can just set his heart ablaze and pull another Hinokami out of his ass again, but this time even stronger! This isn't even the worst offender: 

!Nezuko just becomes stupid strong out of nowhere, Inosuke fucking dislocates all his joints at one point and moves his internal organs around to dodge a fatal wound, Tengen pulls a Jotaro Kujo and stops his own heart with sheer fucking will to trick the enemy!

and yeah its goofy as hell that they can get every bone in their body shattered and fix it by ""Recovery Breathing!"" 

The Climax

Up until now, this review has been largely negative, but I still enjoyed the show immensely. Even without the unbelievable moments this show brings, even if it wasn't blessed by ufotable's godlike grace it would still be an enjoyable 7, maybe 8/10 from me because there's still good fun to be had here. 

But the reason I keep coming back to this show, why Demon Slayer will always be one of my favorites, is that one moment. After entire episodes of action, twists and turns and shocks and hype, all just a prelude to that one moment, where everything leading up to it, the music, the rising tension, the entirety of ufotable's Unlimited Budget Works, all of it comes together into the one, incredible, breathtaking moment, and 

leaves you in awe.

Season one had episode 19. Mugen Train didn't have that moment for me. The entire time I was watching this season, through all the rest of the hype and rediculous animation, I was waiting for that one moment to come. 

And then episode 10 hits, and everything was worth it. 

The final fight was just as incredible as Episode 19, but for completely different reasons. Episode 19 is a beautiful, elegant and serene 2-person dance accompanied by soft, intimate music. The visuals are bright with broad strokes of fire over a background of darkness, and watching it felt like looking at an oil painting in motion. Episode 10 of Entertainment District is a raging, chaotic, messy brawl filled with screaming, explosions, blinding fast attacks, and bright, sharp slashes of clanging blades with a dark, moody and extravagant symphony roaring over the action. This isn't a vibrant renaissance oil painting, it's a crazy dude with paintbrushes throwing paint onto a canvas as hard as he can.  And it's gorgeous.

Everything about Episode 10 just worked. It's one of those episodes I can go back months from now and rewatch again and again and again, my jaw dropping onto the floor just as hard each time. It's moments like this that make me go, ""Holy Fuck I love anime so god damn much."" Because months and years in the future, when I look back on Demon Slayer, it's not the weak writing I remember or the plot holes or Zenitsu and Inosuke being annoying. It's moments like this. It's Season One Episode 19 and Entertainment District Arc Episode 10, the moments that are immortal. 

Some people resentfully say that these moments are wasted on what they see as an otherwise unremarkable show, and would be much better utilized in some other show with higher quality writing or characters. While I won't dispute that claim, I will say that I for one am perfectly content with the fact we got these moments at all.

Conclusion

Despite being the biggest thing in Japan, the highest grossing anime film of all time, and one of the most popular anime internationally, Demon Slayer is not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to friends who don't watch anime. I hold no grudge against anyone who can't forgive its flaws or hates the characters or thinks it's overrated garbage because yeah, it totally makes sense why you would think that. But I for one had a great time watching everything this show has to offer and I'm excited to see more. Even if it means waiting another 2 fucking years."
10620,"There are anime that people say that you have to ‘turn off your brain’ to watch. While I’m not a fan of the term, Mirai Nikki is the ultimate example of the ‘turn off your brain’ anime. The anime is edgy, not at all coherent, and most of all, fun and exciting to watch. If you tune in expecting to watch a gripping thriller, or just something good, Mirai Nikki isn’t for you. But if you’re watching because you want something silly to watch, Mirai Nikki is right up your alley.

img1000(/revision/latest?cb=20120128011750)

Mirai Nikki is a battle royale anime themed around ‘future diaries'. Each contestant in the battle-royale has a diary that can tell certain parts of the future. The main character, Yukiteru Amano, has a ‘Random Diary’, which tells him random events in the future. Yuno Gasai, his stalker and ‘protector’, has a diary that tells the future of Yukiteru. As with any battle royale game, the winner is the last person alive, the prize of winning being becoming a god.

I have many complaints about Mirai Nikki. With any anime that has time-manipulation as a plot point, plot holes are abundant. Mirai Nikki has more of them than the eye can see. It also has an ending that seems to be going on forever. Seriously, it’s so long. I can’t help but think the ending was inspired by Evangelion. It wouldn’t be the only thing that makes it similar to Evangelion. Yukiteiru is very similar personality-wise to Shinji. Akise Aru, a side character, is similar personality-wise to Kaworu. He even looks like him as well! If they wanted to have this anime viewed similarly as Evangelion, then they failed completely. Mirai Nikki is a popular anime, with it being the 25th most popular anime on Anilist, but there’s nothing worth remembering about it except for Yuno herself. She’s the most popular ‘yandere’ character that I can think of, so at least they did something, even if that’s not what they were going for.

img1000(

Speaking of Yuno, the most disgusting thing about this anime is the fact that it often conforms to the belief that she is the ‘only one there’ for Yukiteiru. While I know this is the modus operandi for most controlling people, the fact that the anime seems to go along with this is genuinely disturbing. While it’s not always this way, it happens enough to be to have to write this. The second most disgusting thing is that the characters never change their outfit.

With all of that being said, the one reason for watching Mirai Nikki is because it’s fun. The sheer insanity of it is worth the watch itself. You’ll probably find it bad, but it isn’t the type of bad that will piss you off or detract you from finishing it (most likely). It’s the same type of ‘bad’ that you get from action movies with little plot. Mirai Nikki is a perfect anime to have a watch party with, it’ll surely entertain everyone watching. And honestly, isn’t entertainment what you want from an anime? Well, the entertainment that Mirai Nikki may provide you is more of the ‘laughing at’ type of entertainment, but the point some-what stands. Mirai Nikki may be a lot of things, but boring isn’t one of them.

img1000()

Mirai Nikki is probably one of the dumbest anime that I’ve ever watched. That’s saying something considered all of the dumb anime out there. What Mirai Nikki has that others don’t is entertainment value. You’re bound to be entertained with all of the crazy and stupid twists and turn this anime has out there to offer. Is it good? No. Does it have a million plot holes? Yes. Is it fun to watch? Also yes."

This year in anime was already off to a slow start in Winter, and the growing pandemic forced plenty of big names to get dropped from Spring’s lineup. Yet against all odds, Love is War (LiW) still hit our screens, even though its freshman outing premiered just a year ago. And the show has continuously cracked me up ever since! LiW S2 is a brilliant sequel, on-par with its entertaining predecessor and with no signs of slowing down. I highly recommend you check out the first season if you haven’t already, it’s a stellar watch on its own right. With that, let’s take a good look at what you can expect from the Student Council’s second outing.

img1000()

The initial setup of two intelligent individuals vying for the other’s confession was a fascinating hook. However, I always felt the show really found its footing when it gradually dropped that pretense and had our “smart” leads devolve into lovesick idiots. You’ll be relieved to hear that S2 doesn’t lose this momentum, as it wastes no time in welcoming us back to the OTT hijinks that made the first season so special. This sequel intends to do a lot more than play the same Death Note mind games in the Student Council Room though. If anything, the Prez and his crew are forced to leave their precious room behind! That’s right; Kaguya, Shirogane, Chika and Ishigami have come to the end of their term in the Council.

by bringing Shuchi’in Academy to life. The show’s signature brand of comedy goes a long way to make this change work, as do LiW’s diverse ensemble of secondary characters. Fresh new faces and recurring pals (Kei Shirogane and Best Girl Ai Hayasaka are showstoppers in every scene they’re in) get more opportunities to play off our main four, with sketches that feel fresh while not straying far from its winning formula. Another distinct highlight of this season is the looming presence of its arcs. These overarching plotlines, while mostly inconsequential on their own right, add doses of excitement and raise personal stakes for our central characters.

img1000()

We gotta talk about the main couple’s love battle, and boy do things get taken up a notch! Best Girl Kaguya and “KAICHŌ!” Shirogane continue to be overwhelmed by their feelings for one another, escalating to the point where our once confident masterminds now struggle to maintain composure in the most basic of interactions. Our respectable President throws his calm and collected nature out the window, and the impenetrable Ice Queen is more vulnerable than ever. S2 continues to pile on the tension built up from the prior season’s ending, having me on strings as I anticipate a devastating checkmate.

the biggest surprises from this season come from how the show dives deeper into its side characters. Sharing the spotlight with our main ship is Yuu Ishigami and newcomer Miko Iino (full thoughts on her below in the spoiler-free “Stray Ramblings” section^). Both of these unique individuals get their times to shine, and I can’t wait to find out what’s in store for those two in the future. Now, if you’re waiting to hear about Best Girl (it’s the third time and counting, I know) Chika… well, there are no words that can adequately capture her awesomeness, is there? As the agent of chaos for most of our sketches in S1, Chika largely takes a step back from that role now that the other cast members are stepping up. But don’t fret just yet, Fujiwara fans; our favorite secretary is still a big part of some sketches and an ever-flowing fountain of memes.

img1000()

Now all these ambitious ideas sound all fine and dandy, but you may ask if the end result is any good.

LiW S2 deftly manages to deliver arguably more laughs than its first season while refusing to hold back on more emotional beats. It may be surprising to hear that Director Shinichi Omata is also the man behind the well-crafted Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu Duology! Although the two shows could not be further apart in tone, he demonstrates his storytelling prowess by absolutely nailing LiW’s comic timing, dramatic tension and cathartic payoffs. Visual presentation in S2 is especially noteworthy, as the animators continue push the envelope with visually-striking art styles and fun references. A keen eye can find several moments where the art and animation drop off, but those didn’t bother us back in S1! LiW more than makes up for any concessions in this department expertly and is a model example for how other shows should manage their art direction. Yet another highlight is every member of the cast delivering god-tier voice acting performances. Aoi Koga brings her A-game in each episode, and let’s not forget Yumiri Hanamori for making “HEY, HEY” Hayasaka the meme of Spring 2020. Speaking of the memes, just wow. S2 is a treasure trove of memorable, hilarious bits.


img1000()

LiW pretty much checks all the good stuff in my book. The only gripe I have with S2 is that the OP & ED are inferior to last seasons, but that’s just nitpicking by my standards. I’m thrilled that I have been able to enjoy Kaguya to the extent that I have, it has been a highlight for the week whenever I put it on the telly.

Due to the formulaic nature of the show, there’s a chance that future seasons don’t meet the standards of the show we’ve come to love. It’s gonna be a tall order to ask the show to keep the laughs coming as frequently while providing enough progression in the main ship to keep me invested. That being said, the team behind LiW have given me plenty of reasons to back their play for at least a while longer^^. S2 is as sharp as the series has ever been, and I keenly await what’s next in store for the Student Council.

img1000()

Love Is War Season 2 has been a blast from start to finish. I can think of few shows that have had me return to my childlike self (kinda like Sick Kaguya), as if I was 7 again and getting up bright and early for Sunday cartoons. 2020 has been a pretty bleak time for a lot of people, myself included. Yet, LiW has shone through the cracks and brightened my days throughout its run. Packing laughs galore and cathartic character beats, S2 is as fun a ride as its predecessor, and I intently anticipate its return. Not just for the outcome of that love battle, but also for the joy of having a Sunday cartoon to look forward to once more. TODAY’S BATTLE RESULT: 9/10

-	^Miko Iino is a pretty cool addition to the cast. A first year introduced in the Election Arc, she’s an upstanding student who holds herself and those around her to a high code of conduct. Her role in the show is one that’ll take time to get used to, for both the audience and the rest of the Council. Thankfully the show doesn’t make her out to be a major character we’re forced to like, as in the case of someone like Chloe in The Fairy Oddparents. Instead, her arc speaks for itself and it leaves a positive impression. Once that’s done, she complements the sketches well, playing the straight man occasionally for some good laughs. Miko really is the odd one out in our crew, mostly because everyone else is so distinctly zany! I like how her righteous work ethic makes even the Prez look sloppy by comparison. Again, she’s not an intrusive inclusion to LiW, but I’m pretty curious with how she’ll be incorporated in future sketches and if she’ll bring a more distinct flavor of humor to the table. Looking forward to it!

-	^^That, and I saw a couple of spoilers that give me hope for what’s to come. Taking one for the team ;)
-	We all knew something big was coming when Ep 7 dropped the end credits with 5 mins to go. Massive props to the team for overhauling its art style and committing so hard to the bit! It’s not the best joke the show pulled off, but I definitely respect the grind.

This must be the will of Steins Gate...!

-	Speaking of stellar episodes, holy shit no. 11 was heavy. This was the biggest demonstration of those dramatic touches I was talking about. I’m pleasantly surprised people responded so well to the episode, even though it deviated the furthest from the comedic stuff. I certainly loved it to bits myself!
-	Guys, we gotta stay safe while Covid is still about. So whenever you're outside, be sure to:

Practice social distancing, and...

img1000()

Put on a mask at all times.

-	BEST GIRL: My weak heart tells me Kaguya, my 3-IQ brain tells me Chika, my chin-chin tells me Hayasaka. But deep down you and I both know that Ishigami, introvert extraordinaire and Champion of Boxer Briefs, is Best Girl of the season. Ishigami FTW

101280,"A good isekai which sadly turns into a chore later on :v

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken (Which I will be reffering to as ""Slime"") is a show which started off strong. The characters seemed interesting, the way the world was building built around us was also something quite impressive. I remember being incredibly impressed when I realised that the whole first episode was basically just in a cave talking to a Tsundere Dragon. It felt like so much has happened.

To summarise the plot: A lonely loser dies. Turns into a slime in another world. Gains powers. Makes a village. Gains more powers. Helps everyone due to his OP powers.

Though sadly watching this show turned more into a chore. This is due to the fact that we can always predict what happens at every encounter.
Everytime an enemy appears we KNOW that at first Rimuru's friends/allies WILL try to defeat the monster themselves, fail, and then Rimuru will step in and either eat them or turn them into allies. Every time.

Later on we see a diversion from this formula but its a bit too late. Rimuru tries to save the kids that Shizue taught. This arc was more character building and led up to a set up for a Season 2. What seems to be an Evil Spirit goes into one of the kids. Most likely Rimuru will have to deal with that later on.





[CHARACTERS:]()
Slime has many interesting and cool characters.
A lot of them just appear to advance the plot and build up the world more while others serve as punching bags for enemies.

Rimuru is the main, a 37 year old loser who died and appeared in this world as a slime. He gained many powers throughout the series and now is the most OP character in the whole entirity of that Universe. Rimuru tries his best to be as diplomatic as possible but when the need arises he does pull off some OP moves and eats the enemy. He also has a ""Great Sage"" in his mind which helps him analyze situations and materials.

As mentioned before there are also characters which just serve a purpose of being punching bags. Which basically consists of every other character that is allied with Rimuru. As I mentioned before, everyone tries to defeat an enemy but fails ""forcing"" Rimuru to step in and win. There are too many characters to individualy talk about.



[ART/ANIMATION:]()
Slime's Animation is quite dandy, not bad but also nothing too good. The combat scenes felt smooth and fluid which made the viewing experience a little bit more enjoyable which is always a positive! The art style, too, is quite good. At time can be a bit too simplistic but can also deliver with great detailed and colourful scenes.

As shown in the Gif below, this is the kind of quality we can see from a lot of the combat found in this series. Well choreographed scenes with juicy details.

Not gonna lie...I forgot the OST for Slime.

So lets move on to OPs and EDs.
They don't sound bad, they sound quite decent. They deliver quite a large amount of Hype when watching the series which is nice in my opinion.
The same idea applies to the EDs, I liked the OPs more since they delivered much more Hype to the series but both were decent (as mentioned before).

THIS REVIEW THING IS GOING TO BE FULL SPOILERS BECAUSE I'M BREAKING THIS THING DOWN ENTIRELY. MY SCORE FOR IT IS A 5 OUT OF 100, AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A... I WOULD GO AS FAR AND CALL CHARLOTTE AN ESSENTIAL ""BAD SHOW."" BUT A DISCLAIMER: YOU MAY POSSIBLY BE CAPABLE OF GENUINELY ENJOYING IT IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE ENTIRE SHOW. EVEN AS NEGATIVE AS I OFTEN AM, I ADMITTEDLY CAN IN FACT SEE A GENUINELY ENJOYABLE SHOW IN THIS. 

SOMEWHERE.

Charlotte is anime from 2015 and the studio behind it is [PA Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/PAWorks). But the man (the [Junji Nishimura](https://anilist.co/staff/101837/JunjiNishimura) to this [Glasslip](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip), if you will) at the heart of Charlotte is none other than [Jun Maeda](https://anilist.co/staff/97347/JunMaeda). Jun Maeda is a co-founder of [Key](https://anilist.co/staff/97885/Key) and the original creator of [Angel Beats!](https://anilist.co/anime/6547/AngelBeats). Angel Beats! apparently is/was super and massively popular.

[I personally have not watched it, though.](https://anilist.co/activity/11122539)

It's probably safe to assume that if it hadn't been massively popular, then obviously, Jun Maeda wouldn't have been able to get Charlotte made. Because apparently Jun Maeda had the idea for Charlotte somewhere deep within the dark recesses of his reptilian mind even before Angel Beats! happened. 

Did he have the entire story in his head at that point? Did he change his mind on stuff? Or was it just a bunch of nonsense that he was throwing at the wall and seeing what stuck? Even now, I honestly just don't know. Writing this review is partially an attempt in figuring it out. Because... like alright, let me start with trying to just accurately describe what this show even is.

Charlotte is a comedy/drama series about teenagers developing strange and mysterious superhuman abilities and all the woe that comes from just having these abilities or foolishly abusing them. But the thing with Charlotte is that over the span of its thirteen episodes, there are numerous different shows that happen that could be pulled from Charlotte and expanded into an entire series themselves. Several of which simply just do not work at all.

Show #1: Protagonist is antagonist, and is abusing his power to become king of the school.
Show #2: Slice of life with the school council going on about their business while occasionally dealing with other ability users.
Show #3: Comedy. Just... the comedy is almost found throughout the entire thing.
Show #4: Ro...romance. Because... there is a male protagonist and a female protagonist... and... romance!
Show #5: I mean since the entire thing is superhuman abilities, of course action would be throughout the entire show but, it gets fucking ridiculous towards the end.
Show #6: Tragedy. I'm sad, so I'm gonna go off and just beat the shit out of thugs and fuck around because I'm depressed because something very bad happened.
Show #7: !...Time... travel... because... because why not. Because why the fuck NOT.! 
Show #8: Evil scientists are going to capture us and use for our abilities and dissect us!
Show #9: ""I'm going to travel the world and fix this problem!""
Show #10: ""Feels""/Self-sacrifice. 

...Now maybe you see the dilemma. This is not just one show review. This is ten show reviews. Because I'm going to go through every single one of these and everything that is wrong with them. However, there actually is one or two of these ten different shows, that I really really enjoyed and wish were larger parts of the show. Some of the other stuff in the other ones could have worked and been cool, but they were either done very quickly or very weirdly.

Let's start, with the beginning.




img440()

The first show of Charlotte is centered around our main male protagonist, Yuu Otosaka. He's our protagonist, but in the very first episode, he is doing things that a protagonist shouldn't be doing! He possesses the ability to take over other people, literally anybody he wants to take over and can see in his sight of vision, he can just take them over for five seconds.

img440()

He has no idea why he has this ability, and to his knowledge, he's the only person in the world with an ability such as this. Since he can basically become anybody he wants and he has no reason to believe there'll be any consequences as a result of his selfish actions, he starts rampantly abusing this power. He cheats at tests, he makes himself the most popular student of his school, and he gets the most popular girl to fall in love with him after saving her after using his ability to put her in a life or death situation.

img440()

So like right away, the main character is a purposely unlikable sack of shit. And even when the other characters this show is centered around show up who also possess abilities appear to stop the shenanigans Yuu is getting into for his own good... he doesn't really ever satisfyingly redeem himself? He immediately goes from completely unlikable but interesting to completely and utterly generic in the transition from episode one to episode two.

Like right after his shenanigans are put an end to, he goes home and it's revealed that he has a loving little sister. You know what I wouldn't have thought Yuu was given what we're shown of him and his personality up to this point? A good big brother. No, part of the purpose of why his sister even exists is because the show itself has already established Yuu as unlikable, but he's still the protagonist of the series.

So what's the quickest way to help ease that transition? Throw in the little sister character. 

img440()

But you know, this episode is basically entirely worthless. Because the next episodes aren't even really about Yuu redeeming himself... really, basically the only purpose episode 1 has is that the main female character repeatedly says to Yuu later on:

""Well, you've come a long way since being a scumbag who cheats on tests.""

But then there's an episode later on where Yuu does a whole fuckload of shit way, way, WAY WORSE THAN ANYTHING HE DID IN EPISODE ONE.

img440()

Over the course of the entire show, he goes from unlikable, to still kind of unlikable but he's supposed to be trying to become better, to completely fucking insane, back to kind of unlikable, and then literally insane. And the most fucked up thing is that the only times I liked his character at all throughout all thirteen episodes was when he was absolutely fucked up and purposely unlikable. 

The show's trying to get you to want to root for Yuu trying to redeem himself, but I was genuinely upset when the show itself finally had enough of Yuu's behavior, and had the main heroine step in to stop Yuu from SNORTING COCAINE. 

img440()

I was honestly way more interested where the show was gonna go if Yuu had crossed that line than the main heroine forcibly dragging the show back onto the rails where it belongs.



So the student council of this school that shelters ability students show up and put a stop to Yuu's shit, and our main heroine, Nao Tomori, basically more or less forces Yuu to join the student council and help out with finding new ability users and reining them in, basically what the student council did with Yuu himself in episode 1.

This entire section of the show is almost completely worthless, and was probably the toughest section of Charlotte for me to slog through. To be fair there are various things established and there is actually at least sort of a purpose for these episodes that comes back later but...

 

It's just a whole lot of nothing. Like there's even an episode where basically to get an ability user to come out of hiding, they were forced to go camping at a specific spot for an extended period of time and... I immediately was transported back into the world of Glasslip. I'm watching all of these characters I really just do not like at all on a camping trip. Why am I watching this? Why is this still going on?

Thinking about it now actually, there was a part in one of these episodes where like a bunch of the other female students of the school show up and take Nao away, and then literally beat her up outside, and then that's never brought up or elaborated on ever again. 

 

So you're just left thinking, well, what was the point of that? Nao is actually viciously assaulted or just punched directly in the face three times through the entire series, and almost every single time it happened, I sort of laughed. The first one especially because it came so out of nowhere. 

img440()

Like why would you stop and wait until you could suckerpunch one out of the three people chasing you? There's still two other people chasing you.

And then when you get to a certain episode about halfway through the show, the show just rubs the fact that there was almost no point to the preceding episodes, and that the rest of the show was going to go into a completely and drastically different direction now on the drop of a fucking dime.

It's fucking absurd that the sole thing that fucking actually heralds this moment of complete change for this series is that the sister's jar of pizza sauce is almost empty. Which... brings me... to the next Charlotte Review.

img440()




Stop with the comedy. STOP IT.

img440()

I could probably count the times where I actually thought it was funny on one hand. But even if all of the jokes and the comedy parts actually landed 100% of the time, this show would still be the tonal disaster it ends up being. You can't mix drama and comedy. It's oil and water. They do not go together. Especially if you're constantly switching from one to the other. Am I supposed to be seriously invested in this scene? Or am I supposed to be laughing because it's just gonna immediately swerve right back into comedy?

img440()

I think the ultimate moment with the comedy stuff that I think actually kind of worked but it is actually kind of blatant, was when Yuu has isolated himself at home because he's depressed and in mourning, but then here comes the student council members knocking on his door. ""Let us in! We're doing whacky comedy things! We wish to cheer you up because we're the happy comedy part of this show!""

And Yuu's just like...

""Dude. My sister JUST fucking died. Let me eat ramen in peace, you sacks of shit.""

 

That's of course not a verbatim quote, because if he actually told them that, I would rate this show a lot higher than I am. But no seriously, this show is a fucking tonal disaster from the very first episode.

Actually, I guess the best and greatest joke of the entirety of Charlotte is of course the final appearance of the pizza sauce. But we're not there yet. We have to work up to the pizza sauce. Because while it's laughable and hilarious (in a bad way) in the early episodes, the ultimate purpose of the pizza sauce actually sent me into a wheezing and uncontrollable fit of laughter.

...The more I think about it, Charlotte's the best comedy series of all of anime! It's just that all of the actually funny stuff comes from when the show's trying to be serious.

img440()




img440()

Another laughable aspect of Charlotte. Okay, so, you watch the opening of Charlotte and there is a part in the opening where like both Nao and Yuu are falling through the sky, and they're like moving towards each other midfall in an attempt to catch each other.

And the moment you see that in the opening, you go oh. So they're gonna end up together. The show fucking does that thing where both Nao and Yuu say they supposedly dislike each other and they don't get along, but they really do get along, and the other characters mention wow you guys get along, are you dating???

 

Look, I will fully admit I am not the biggest fan of the romance genre. There is probably like a handful of romance series that I can even remember, let alone say I actually enjoyed. But despite my cold dead heart, I am actually not against romance in things. It can be pretty good. It can also be pretty bad. It can also feel completely shoehorned in there and completely worthless, useless, and undeserved.

 

Like why do Nao and Yuu get together in the end? The correct answer is they are the main male and female characters, and the show needs them to be together in the end. Like I guess you could argue she fell in love with Yuu after he did the self-sacrifice thing, but that was entirely her idea she floated out to him with no intention of him actually going off and doing it, but then he does... and before he does, he RANDOMLY confesses that he loves her.

Then she basically laughs at him and goes:

""Um. Do you remember the entirety of any of the last episodes? We don't get along together!""

img440()

I mean Yuu does at one point sort of cures Nao's brother of his insanity, and at one point Nao helps Yuu drag himself out of a descending spiral into depression and insanity, but both of those events due to some circumstances which I will soon get into, ARE ESSENTIALLY RETCONNED FROM THE SHOW.

Yuu retains memories of Nao helping him out, but I don't think he actually bothers to help Nao's brother again after the retcon. As a matter of fact, that whole plotline happens directly as a result of a series of events that happens after Yuu's spiral into depression, and after the retcon, the show gives no reason to believe that Yuu made any of what happened before happen again.

All as a result of Jun Maeda being a hack or him just not feeling like covering that detail. Because it's not like Yuu's later self-sacrifice thing would help out Nao's brother in any way. It's what he does before the retcon that helps curse his insanity and--oh fuck everything.

EDITING TGG: Actually, in the credits of the very final episode, Nao's brother is shown smiling contently in his hospital bed with an autograph of the band's singer in his arms, so apparently he actually was cured of his insanity but... the series of events that leads up to when he's cured of his insanity is still retconned, so I don't know if this is just a plot hole or Jun Maeda was just considering that to still be canon even after he retcons it in a later episode. Additionally, I don't care enough to fucking tear my hair out to try and figure the finer details of this disaster out.

img440()

Also, I'm sorry, perhaps I haven't delved far enough into the romance sphere to be an authority on the subject, but it's probably safe to say that you completely failed at creating an effective and well made romance when the ""confession scene"" is just then the characters discussing why it totally makes sense and is totally deserved for them to be in romance with each other.

Yuu: ""I love you because another version of you stopped me from doing cocaine in another timeline which I entirely abandoned.""

Nao: ""Um, yeah. I'll reciprocate on your feelings if you travel the entire globe before you reach adulthood and take in all of these mind destroying superhuman abilities and SUCCESSFULLY return intact and alive.""

Did Nao even want expect him to come back???




There's a part towards the end of the show where like the other characters have no other choice but to rely on Yuu and basically they send him to deal with a bunch of random foreigners who have taken several of the ability users hostage. This is after when the truth about Yuu's ability is revealed. Whenever Yuu takes over an ability user, he in fact takes their ability from them and gains it for himself. Additionally, Yuu has gained the power of retconning at this point.

img440()

So the other characters are like... well shit, man. Yuu's the most powerful ability user on the entire planet! What could possibly go wrong!

img440()

Apparently everything. There is an episode before this where Yuu fucking snaps and becomes a wonderfully violent psychopath who is just brutally beating the shit out of people while also taking other people over, but despite the fact while Yuu still has clear memories of that, he is just completely fucking helpless when the show actually needs him to be an action hero the most.

He tries to take over the random foreigners, but neither of them have weapons. So then he uses telikinesis to like throw shit at them, but then a random ability user girl just jumps out from nowhere and slashes at one of Yuu's eyes. Apparently the retcon power requires both eyes to use. 

img440()

Oh... how convenient, because if he just possessed the retcon powers, then he could just essentially erase all of these events and prevent everything from going horribly wrong. It'd be sort of hard to have any possible dramatic tension on the table after introducing a convenient retcon ability into the mix, so just make that character unable to use it anymore.

Also, when he was rolling around on the floor screaming in pain after the small girl cut his eye, I was just thinking to myself that now he knows what all those random thugs he brutally fucked up before felt. Violence isn't quite as fun when you're on the receiving end, is it, you complete jackass???

img440()

But no like, Yuu is unable to shake this small girl off of his back and for some reason does not take her over, THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON AND IN FACT AN ABILITY USER. So basically, Yuu got fucked up, is entirely powerless, and his retcon ability has been removed.

What does he do then? He gets really worked up, and that triggers one of the ability's he's obtained at this point, and that ability is basically causing the entire area around him to explode and fall apart, potentially killing everyone including himself. 

img440()

Also, the foreigners somehow knew that he wouldn't be able to use the time travel ability if he lost an eye and was aware of the ""IMMEDIATE DEATH"" ability Yuu possesses and will trigger if he's worked up enough... and their plan was just to have small girl stab and cut at him, which is what causes him to freak the fuck out and trigger the collapse ability.

Not to mention he actually almost straight up triggered the ability before this when his brother was just simply telling him the plan back at their facility. He could have killed his sister (again), his brother, and all of his friends right there and then. Good job, Yuu. You really are a worthwhile and GREAT AND USEFUL PROTAGONIST. He's just completely worthless whenever he ISN'T insane.

But then the show cuts to the other characters who sent Yuu into this situation in the first place, and they had told Yuu that they would be right behind him and backing him up just in case things went wrong. However, there is a HUGE distance between where they're at and where the ongoing scene's happening and they're like...

 

""Oh shit, Yuu's making everything explode! WHY ISN'T HE USING THE CONVENIENT RETCON ABILITY THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY MAKE HIM GO COMPLETELY BLIND IF HE KEPT RELYING ON IT?""

And then in another fucking unintended hilarious moment, they fucking comically run to the scene.  But they're so far away, as if they didn't anticipate this at all. Why wouldn't they assume the foreigners would at least have an idea of how to disable the retcon ability if they made it clear to them that they were in fact even aware of it in the first place? And I'm not even going into the foreigners' safeguard against the retcon ability and everything that's wrong with it because my head would explode.

 

This random guy that the viewers didn't even previously know? We will kill his family if you travel into the past. But when you travel into the past you're essentially abandoning this entire timeline so who even cares about this version of this guy's family???

No, fuck that. We're moving onto my favorite show out of all of Charlotte.




Okay so like halfway through the show, the sister says she's feeling sick and the pizza sauce jar is almost empty, so a completely random and out of nowhere series of events happen and it turns out the Yuu's important sister who is an actual character you should care about, possesses an ability of her own. The ability is to make the entire area around her explode and fall apart (WOW WHAT A USEFUL AND CONVENIENT ABILITY), and it causes her death when a completely random yandere shows up with a box cutter and wants to cut her and see some pizza sauce.

img440()

The sister dies and Yuu proceeds to completely rescind into his own asshole. You thought he was unlikable in episode 1? His reaction to his sister dying is basically just saying fuck the entire world, I'm just gonna eat a bunch of ramen our uncle (that never appears or is ever mentioned again) sent us in the very first episode and watch TV. 

img440()

But when apparently the secret society of scientists who hunt and capture ability users come knocking (now that I think about it, it was most likely just people from the school since that's just what Yuu himself says), Yuu's like fuck it and decides to leave, but before he does, he takes over one of the guys there to capture him and force him to leap off the ledge of the building.

 

We hear the impact of the fall, we hear his pained screams, if he survived that fall, his legs are most likely broken, and the entire rest of his life has permanently been changed. And there were two other people there. With what we've been shown of Yuu's ability, he could have just taken one of them over and had the other one knock the other two out and then have the one he was controlling knock himself out. Actually, he leaves the third one perfectly fine. 

There was absolutely no reason for Yuu to force him to jump off and have his legs get broken unless Yuu had completely stopped giving a fuck. And sure enough, I was completely unaware that they were just getting started.

Yuu just wanders around aimlessly eating pizza and other snacks and he like starts to frequent an arcade with a zombie shooting game and he's just screaming DIE! DIE! as he's playing this game and he just sounds and looks like a fucking complete psychopath, and then when thugs are playing the zombie shooting game and won't let him play, he just fucking provokes the thugs and then fucks them up.

img440()

The protagonist Charlotte needs, but doesn't deserve: Insane Yuu.

Then from there on out, it's just a fucking descent into horrific violence and Yuu stabs a guy twice in the same leg, and at one point, he's about to stab a thing through a guy's eye permanently blinding him. And I was just... I didn't know how we got here from Yusarin's magical spells, but for once in the entire show, I was fully on board for Jun Maeda's wild ride.

 

On the top: Charlotte. On the bottom: Also Charlotte.

No other series has actually had me rooting for the protagonist to start snorting cocaine. But then Nao just appears and kicks it out of Yuu's hand 

oh by the way, Nao's ability is she can turn invisible

and reveals that she had been there the entire time. Wait, the ENTIRE time? 

img440()

So all of that horrific violence and bloodlust Yuu was reveling in, Nao had no problem with that, but oh no... if Yuu snorts a bit of cocaine, he's gonna stop being a human entirely.

...HE STABBED SOMEONE IN THE LEG TWICE AND WAS LAUGHING ABOUT IT. Is this Jun Maeda's personal reptilian morals? Horrific violence is okay, but drugs? They're no good!

Jun Maeda was probably on cocaine when he wrote this fucking series' script jesus christ

...Wait, oh my GOD. I was gonna actually move onto the next section without actually addressing the pizza sauce! Okay so, the way that Nao sparks a renewed will to live in Yuu is... 

img440()

The pizza sauce. 

The fucking meme pizza sauce that is brought up time and time again throughout the earlier episodes, actually has a serious plot purpose. YUU IS AT HIS LOWEST POINT, BUT HE IS THEN BROUGHT BACK BY THE PIZZA SAUCE AND...

img440()

This is why I'm just so set on the Jun Maeda being a reptile theory. Yuu just eats a pizza sauce omelet, cries a little bit, and he's back to normal. Dead sister aside, stabbing and breaking people's legs aside, Yuu is back to normal and we're just gonna pretend that 90% of this episode never even happened and then it'll just be retconned because go fuck yourself.

You know, as much as it set me off when I originally watched it, I wouldn't even be against the pizza sauce omelet being the trigger  for Yuu's redemption... if it was just set up better. 

img440()

Like the pizza sauce is just this weird dumb and recurring joke. Why did you put pizza sauce in this when it obviously doesn't belong? Why can't you just cook normal food? Why couldn't it have just been a more normal ingredient that only the sister put in stuff, rather than this comical pizza sauce that I just... I just absolutely cannot take seriously. 

To conclude on episode seven, this actually contains almost the sole instance throughout the entire show where I could actually sympathize with Yuu. It very much feels like his sister JUST died and these characters are coming in when he's just trying to mourn and hassling him. Not so much the other student council people, but his ""girlfriend"" from episode one that randomly comes back for some reason (?) and then proceeds to call him mentally ill??? Which I guess is probably kind of true but like why you would straight up tell a person in mourning that they're mentally ill to their face and...

 

But then of course Yuu's ""mourning"" just transitions into horrific violence and while I was still on board, I was on board for probably the wrong reasons at that point.




So if you looked at the spoiler tag for this one at the start of the review, you already knew or I guess could have just assumed, but the ""retcon ability"" Yuu obtains is essentially TIME TRAVEL.

...The time travel stuff just comes so completely out of nowhere that it's why I recommended just going off and watching Charlotte for yourself. There was no fucking reason for this show to have time travel, and yes, I know it's sort of kind of set up from the very beginning. Jun Maeda is a fucking hack. The only thing the time travel contributes to anything is that Yuu saves the sister and essentially retcons THE MOST INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING PART OF THE ENTIRE SHOW (see previous section).

 

But like the twist is actually genuinely effective and certainly I didn't fucking expect that this show would head in this direction. And like that entire flashback portion of that episode with Yuu and his sister and forgotten older brother being captives... like if that had actually been the show...

...

img440()

...Why wasn't that the actual show? No, why wasn't that the actual fucking show? The science facility and the ability users secretly plotting and trying to form a resistance... 

But it's basically just fodder to lead into... this series also has time travel and the Yuu in this flashback is actually a different Yuu but actual Yuu for some reason gains the memory of this other timeline's Yuu after going to a concert and hearing a band's brand new song which he had previously heard in the other timeline.

...There was no fucking reason this series also had to have time travel beyond Jun Maeda being a hack and also why not. This is basically solidified when again, the small girl slashes at Yuu's eye therefore disabling the time travel ability he took from his older brother. Then later on, he gets the ability to heal and he briefly considers healing his now blind eye and going back in the past to save Winnie the Pooh from dying which is entirely his fault and he can probably do now since I guess apparently he takes the abilities he's stolen with him to the past somehow, but then he decides not to.



 

...You know, Yuu saving his sister... that's basically the same exact situation, except he's personally responsible for Pooh's death because Yuu is a horrible failure. So he's basically saying he shouldn't have saved his sister either, and that his brother shouldn't have did any time traveling to save the ability users. 

Or Yuu is just saying this because at this point, it's the final episode, and Jun Maeda is completely out of time. Pooh has to be forgotten. We can't go back for Pooh!

img440()

...Did I even mention one of the character's nicknames is POOH? AS IN WINNIE THE POOH? AS IN WINNIE THE FUCKING POOH? See, his last name is Kumagami, and ""Kuma"" means bear, and Winnie the Pooh is a bear. So Yuu's big brother calls him Pooh.

...I was so waiting for him to scream out ""POOH!"" when they came to him after he was brutally impaled as a result of how much of a failure Yuu is. I would have probably literally died with laughter. But of course, he didn't. 

img440()

Also, it's supposed to be just another one of the comedy bits, but I couldn't even remember Pooh's actual real name without looking it up.

...I can't provide a better example of Charlotte being a tonal nightmare beyond the character who is nicknamed after Winnie the Pooh getting goddamned impaled. And out of the two deaths throughout the entire show, it's the only one that matters because it's purposely not undone via time travel. Also this is by far probably the visually goriest moment out of all of Charlotte and there was absolutely no reason for it beyond attempting to emotionally suckerpunch you with this character you probably don't even care too much about's death. I mean, they didn't even bother to show the little sister's death back when she died! Why Pooh? Why did we have to see Pooh impaled?

img440()

To be honest, I actually liked Pooh a lot more when he was just some weird guy we couldn't see's face that for some reason is dripping every single time he comes into the student council. But then the show explains why he was dripping all of those times and it was just... him throwing a glass of water into his face to hide his identity from people who... have never met him? What? Why. So his ability is completely irrelevant to the dripping...

 

Couldn't he have just told them where the ability users were vocally while not having to soak himself every single time he shows up? There had to have been another and easier way to hide his face--oh just... it doesn't matter.  




It's fucking bizzare to me that Jun Maeda actually included an explanation for the origin of the superhuman abilities. I was fully prepared to get Glasslip'd again but thinking about it, I'm not sure if actually including an explanation is actually better or not.

Because first of all, it basically comes out of nowhere almost at the very end of the show, but to Jun Maeda's credit, he sort of actually sets it up early on? 

 

But then like episode 11 is just outright named Charlotte and there's not a character named Charlotte throughout the entirety of Charlotte. Then a scientist man just straight up starts exposition'ing to Yuu and his REVIVED VIA TIME TRAVEL little sister about the comet named Charlotte.

   

Basically Charlotte is a comet that passes over Earth at the earliest every seventy five years or so and it leaves particles, and people who are exposed to the particles, eventually develop superhuman abilities. Completely random abilities that can literally be anything you can think of. Telikinesis, time travel, freezing powers, fire power, healing, invisibility, being able to take other people's powers and possess people, and being able to sense other people who also have abilities, and so much more.

The show even goes as far to basically state Charlotte the comet was in fact the cause of witch trials in Europe, and the pro-ability user scientists have developed a vaccine to prevent the development of superhuman abilities for those who don't already possess them and...

Everything about this is just so fucking wrong, and the show is basically trying to barrel through all of this information as quickly as possible before the viewer tries to connect the various dots they've presented to us only to fail horribly. Because like right after this random exposition dump about Charlotte, it just goes right into them playing mahjong but my head was still back in the comet stuff.

 

Like... they've developed a vaccine for... particles of a comet, that passes over Earth... only once every seventy five years. How exactly did they develop this vaccine? I mean they do actually have a fragment from probably the comet itself in their possession but. How exactly do they intend on vaccinating the people of the world with this anti-comet vaccine? How are they even sure it'll fucking work? How are they going to proceed with these global vaccinations when I thought there's a group of scientists hunting for the ability users and wouldn't they directly be opposed to the idea of preventing future ability users from being created? 

If it was just the comet, you could just let it pass. I'm not going to be an asshole and go ""well how the fuck does the particles of a comet give people abilities anywhere from telikinesis to goddamned time travel?"" because really, it doesn't matter how. Magic! Whatever! 

But the moment the idea of a vaccine is introduced, it becomes different. Because you assume the vaccine is going to be an important plot device that matters. Ultimately how they get the powers in the first place... it would have been passable if it was just magical comet particles.

However, then Yuu himself asks his older brother a question along the lines of ""can't they create a vaccine to remove already developed existing abilities?"" and his older brother just fires back that it takes time to create a new vaccine and they can't because they just finished this one. But how are you even sure this one works? There's no way of testing or finding out because assumingly, Charlotte has already passed and it supposedly takes centuries to make it back again.

   

If they had instead started with a vaccine to remove already existing abilities, they could at least test it and have a very easy way to know if it works or not. ""Can you still breathe fire? No? Then we've completed the vaccine."" 

...Usually, I'm on the side of ""well, you SHOULD explain this thing"" but Jun Maeda should have just left it at ""magical comet"" and moved on. Because right after all this exposition about Charlotte and the vaccine, the show moves right into the action section of the show, and thus we don't get any further answers.

But that leaves us with the question of... well, the vaccine should stop any future magical comet particles, but what happens with the current ability users that have already gotten their abilities?




Let's talk about the final episode now, which... again... could have been an entire and much better series on its own. Actually, this is without a doubt the most blatant one. Yuu travels the entire fucking globe in a single episode and we're shown his adventures throughout numerous countries until the show says ""oh shit we're running out of time, WE JUST HAVE TO START CHECKING OFF COUNTRIES NOW.""

 

Jun Maeda has essentially written himself into a fucking corner because he's a complete hack fraud. The action section where Yuu attempts to save his friends is over, but it's left basically everyone either completely fucked up or depressed because Winnie the Pooh is fucking dead, and like nothing is resolved at all.

So here comes main girl Nao and she just casually floats the idea of Yuu travelling the entire world and stealing every single ability of every single ability user that is living on the entire planet Earth. She basically says it's probably a terrible idea because if Yuu consumes all of the abilities, he'll probably basically entirely lose it and go completely fucking insane.

 

""Protagonist, you have to do this thing that may end up leading you to genociding the entire world.""

But then Yuu basically fucking says you know what, I'll fucking do it why not also I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A FEMALE AND I AM A MALE Yuu in fact takes the time to confess to Nao because he has developed a deep and true love for her, and Nao's all like REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN I JUST WATCHED AS YOU BEAT PEOPLE'S FACES IN AND STABBED THEM IN THE LEG IN THE OTHER TIMELINE I'll accept your confession of love if you manage to make it back after having absorbed all of the abilities of everyone on the entire planet before you lose your ability when your adolescence ends (that's when the abilities naturally go away).

img440()

...You know, this episode is actually the perfect note for Charlotte to go out on. By this point, actually, FAR BEFORE this point, I was just fucking shell shocked and in disbelief that this show could go any further than it already had. But no yeah. They also had to do the self-sacrifice thing.

Only one episode left but Yuu is gonna go on this journey around the world and consume every single ability and... like assuming... there is like seven billion total people living on planet Earth. How many ability users were created by the last time the Charlotte comet passed by? A couple of million? A couple of hundred thousand? Nao herself in the final episode says it was at least ""tens of thousands"" of them. He apparently has to at least go to literally every single fucking country and I don't care if he picked up on every single ability that would make this journey more and more convenient... it would take a massive amount of time to pull off this endeavor.

   

Oh, I picked up an ability that allows me to not have to sleep anymore. Oh, I picked up an ability that allows me to speak in literally any fucking language I want. Oh, I picked up an ability where I can tell where ability users are just by looking at a paper map. Oh, I picked up an ability to see where people who have been exposed to the Charlotte comet and will in the future develop abilities, and also an ability to force them to develop their abilities immediately, so I can consume them and not have to return to this country in however many years.

Basically, once more, Yuu is fucking sliding into his ""unlikable"" or ""insane"" personality, and like if he goes to sleep, he just wanders off in his sleep and starts fucking shit up. But the show doesn't have time to develop or expend any time on any of this. The show is just rushing itself as fast as it possibly can to get Yuu back to Nao so the show can just fucking end, to the point where LIKE THE MOMENT AFTER YUU OBTAINS THE VERY FINAL ABILITY, HIS BROTHER IMMEDIATELY SHOWS UP IN A HELICOPTER AS SOMEONE ELSE IS ABOUT TO KILL HIM BUT...

 

HIS BROTHER HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE YUU WAS, AND HE JUST IMMEDIATELY AND CONVENIENTLY SHOWS UP VIA HELICOPTER AND SAVES YUU.

...Couldn't he have just died? I mean yes, it'd be a downer ending, but it would have been neater than... well...




img440()

The note the show ends on is... Yuu makes it back to Nao and he has essentially removed all abilities from everyone who had them and everyone who would have developed them, and the vaccine is a thing just in case that pesky old Charlotte comes passing by Earth again with its pesky particles.

There's supposed to be like impact in Yuu and Nao's reunion and especially when Nao realizes that Yuu has lost all memory of her as a result of his ridiculous globe trotting journey. But as I've expressed previously, the romance between Yuu and Nao is just so fucking laughable and undeveloped. The show really wants you to care, but you honestly shouldn't. It is completely undeserved.

img440()

""Your flash cards that you created for me were the only thing I couldn't part with because even as I was being driven insane by this plan that you yourself told me about, I still remembered that these cards were something you gave to me, and I love the flash cards because I love you and you created the flash cards.""

Like every single time this series tries to fucking manipulate your emotions one way, it just completely fucking fails or is just laughable. Like even when Nao starts crying and welcomes Yuu back I was just like... ""why is she crying?""

img440()

She basically verbatim asked if Yuu was joking when he first confessed his love to her, but no, I'm supposed to be ""feeling emotions"" because they are together and they are the romance together because they are the main male and female characters of the show. But there was no fucking development or depth to their relationship. You can do the whole ""everybody else tells us that we get along, but we don't think we get along"" but there has to be development.

You can't fucking slap some sentimental flash cards down on the table with a side of self-sacrifice and say ""okay now they love each other.""

...Now that I think about it, I'm actually not sure what emotion the ending is actually trying to manipulate you into feeling. Happiness that the plot has finally been resolved and Yuu is back with Nao or like the bittersweet thing because Yuu is now basically kind of a shell of himself because he doesn't fucking remember anything.

img440()




...There's probably tons and tons of more details that I was gonna bring up but forgot or missed or maybe I edited those in, but my overall conclusion and opinion on Charlotte is that it's completely fucking batshit insane. It's absolutely fucking horrible, the show did not need time travel and bringing it in only made it even more of a mess, it's a tonal nightmare, the characters are either unlikable, boring, or joke characters, it's like ten shows in one, and all the serious moments are fucking hilarious and all of the comical moments are almost entirely dumb and unfunny.

I give Charlotte a 5 out of a 100 and while if you've read this far into the review, I've basically spoiled the entire show for you if you didn't heed my warning at the start and just went and watched it yourself, I still would absolutely recommend watching Charlotte. At several moments, Charlotte actually had me thinking that this was TOO perfect. That Jun Maeda knew what he was doing, and was making something completely fucking horrible and wrong on purpose.

Now, that I've finished it, I'm still honestly not really too sure. It feels genuine, but just... dropping time travel like in almost the very last part of a show? Nobody can be this brilliant!

It's a fucking horrible masterpiece. I give it a 100 out of 100 on the pizza sauce grading scale.

So... you weren't even actually attempting to escape the compound? You were just trying to make sense of Experiment C-4?

""Yes.""

And... what you came up with was just... bashing your own head into varying objects over and over again?

""...Yes. Look, I know it sounds stupid, but if you just watch it yourself, you'll know what I was going through! Nothing made sense! Like PA Works makes fine looking shows, but what drugs were Jun Maeda on???""

Oh no, you're not going to fool me. I saw firsthand what happened with the last researcher who  risked firsthand exposure to the works themselves. Look, next time, just ask, and we'll provide you with a proper head bashing area. The Head Researcher was furious over the fact that you almost escaped.

""...Wait, I almost escaped?""

Yes. Thank goodness after the thousandth intern you bashed your skull into, you finally passed out and we could capture you.

""...I apparently almost successfully escaped this secret compound run by a group of secret super scientists that kidnap people all over the globe for use in their experiments without even purposefully trying to escape?""

...It's rather hurtful when you word it that way.

...In the past and in a dimly lit room at P.A. Works.

Jun Maeda: ""Okay, so... the idea is teenagers who gain supernatural powers that try and hide from an organization of adult scientists who wish to capture them, study their abilities, and then eventually dissect them.""

[Yoshiyuki Asai](https://anilist.co/staff/120921/YoshiyukiAsai) (the director): ""That sounds pretty good. Pretty original.""

Jun Maeda: ""But that's just the start. Firstly, we start the show out with the protagonist being a complete asshole manipulator, and then the rest of the show is this character attempting to gain redemption.""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""Okay, okay... you haven't lost me... this seems like it could be a very goo--""

Jun Maeda: ""NO. I'm not done yet! We have to slather the entire thing in slapstick comedy from beginning to end! We can't just have tragic and emotionally effective events! No, it needs slapstick comedy to lighten things up a bit.""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""Um... that seems a little...""

Jun Maeda: ""We'll have an idol character who occasionally becomes possessed by her dead delinquent sister, we'll have a yandere character, we'll have a pizza sauce little sister, we'll have slice of life, we'll have action, we'll have tragedy, we'll have drama.""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""This... this is getting a bit out of cont--""

Jun Maeda: ""AND THEN, THEN IT WILL BE A TIME TRAVEL SHOW, BECAUSE ONE OF THE ABILITY USERS HAS THE ABILITY TO TIME TRAVEL. But of course things will get a bit too crazy, so we have to take away the time travel after a little bit of time travel. But it is absolutely important and required to get AT LEAST SOME time travel in there.""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""I... nobody's going to be able to make sense of this!""

Jun Maeda: ""AND THEN, THE MAIN CHARACTER, I WANT TO SEE STABBING PEOPLE AND MAKING THEM BREAK THEIR OWN LEGS. WE NEED AN ENTIRE EPISODE THAT IS JUST ONE COMPLETE DESCENT INTO VIOLENCE AND MADNESS BECAUSE THAT IS HOW YOU MOURN THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE.""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""Mr. Maeda, you're scaring me. Please stop.""

Jun Maeda: ""Oh yeah, and the ultimate point of the show is the romance between the two main characters.""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""What? Why?""

Jun Maeda: ""Because romance sells! Okay, that's Charlotte. What do you think!""

Yoshiyuki Asai: ""Uh... sounds... sounds great. I just... I just need to get drunk real quick and then we can start."""
18679,"There’s an old saying, that ‘clothes make the man.’ At Honnouji Academy, however, clothes make more than just the man… They make the warrior, they make the authority, and they separate the powerful from the weak. You see, at this school, classes are more than just those things you struggle to stay awake through while fantasizing about the dreamy classmate a few seats over… They’re the things you’re bound by, as part of an ironclad caste system. Depending on your level in that caste system, you may or may not be given a Goku uniform, which are special school uniforms that amplify the natural abilities and club-related interests of their respective wearers. The more powerful the uniform, the more stars you’re granted, from one to three… With the very top position occupied by the stone-faced, cold-hearted Satsuki Kiryuin, the Student Council President who runs the school as if it’s her own personal dictatorship. She lords over her school, which itself lords over the town, with no living being opposing her rule.

Enter Ryuko Matoi, a teenage nomad with a chip on her shoulder and one half of a giant pair of scissors by her side, looking for answers regarding the mysterious death of her father and taking no prisoners in her quest for those answers. With a unique sentient Goku uniform named Senketsu by her side, a hyperactive best friend giving her a place to stay, and a shady teacher constantly trying to convince her to get naked(for surprisingly non-rapey reasons), will this loudmouthed punk have what it takes to raze Satsuki’s rubric regime, or is she facing a literal uphill battle that she can’t possibly win?

For those of you who haven’t read my April reviews, I like to describe Studio Gainax’s animation quality as being ‘inconsistent.’ Considering how abundant this problem is, I would expect the same from any animation studio that could ever spin off from Gainax… And yet, Studio Trigger has proven me wrong. Trigger was founded by two of Gainax’s former members, Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko Ohtsuka, as they left the company in 2011. Yes, this studio is only four years old, with only a few titles under their belt, and yet they produced one of the most unique visual wonders of that time period.

I have never seen an anime that looked quite like Kill La Kill before. It seems to take the fast paced frenetic action of Gurren Lagann and combine it with the smooth, western character and art design of Panty and Stocking, effectively taking the best aspects of both shows while cancelling out the ugly shortcuts that originally plagued them. This makes it look more like a Looney Toons project than anything you’d naturally expect from the anime medium. Only, you know, with boobs instead of rabbits. It completely avoids the awkward frame rate drops that normally occur whenever the action speeds up in a Gainax show, and which is normally my biggest complaint about their animation, managing to look smooth even through it’s more demanding shots.

Of course, whether it’s able to do this because they have a relatively high budget or because they’re extremely good at managing an average budget, I honestly can’t tell. It uses a lot of your classic moneysaving shortcuts, such as items and people moving as though they’ve just been cut out of the screen via photoshop, but they’re used so deliberately and so stylistically that it’s difficult to tell whether or not it was ever done out of necessity. Even when the characters have been reduced to frozen talking heads, there will almost always be something else moving on screen, whether it’s the clouds in the background, someone’s hair in the wind, or even just the design on their uniform. This is a really good line to blur, and it keeps up really well with the breakneck pace of the series.

Of course, the outstanding art direction and exquisitely detailed backgrounds don’t hurt, either. There was a lot of great care taken with the visual aspect of this series, from the memorable character designs that tell you volumes about the students and soldiers they correspond to before you even hear them speaking, to the CG art that somehow looks natural, even when it shares screen time with the two-dimensional aesthetic of the characters. The soundtrack is surprisingly subtle, being one of the only aspects of Kill La Kill that comes even close to that word. I don’t even really want to call it background music, as it’s never wasted on scenes that don’t need it… It’s more like support music, used to amplify the effectiveness of action scenes and emotional climaxes, or just as tonally appropriate themes for the central characters. The two most memorable tracks… Aside from the awesome opening and closing themes… are the chilling theme music that heralds the terrifying villain Nui Harime, and the blood pumping Before My Body is Dry, which kicks in with the scream “Don’t lose your way” every time Ryuko turns the tide in battle. And as for the canon in-story music? You know your soundtrack is going to be awesome when one of your primary villains uses a marching band for a weapon.

If I had seen the English dub by this time last year, it would have instantly had a guaranteed spot on my “Favorite Anime Dubs” post, and for pretty much the same reasons that Toradora made it in. Hell, this dub is so perfect that the two shows probably would have tied for second place, which isn’t surprising since they were released by the same company at around the same time. Fledgling voice actor Erica Mendez, who got her start only a few years ago by playing the voice of Rainbow Dash in several Brony videos, proves her mettle as the tough, gravelly voiced Ryuko, having no trouble navigating this probably throat-destroyingly intense role through all of it’s complexity. Christine Marie Cabanos shows us once again how awesome she can be when used properly, keeping up admirably in her role as the fast-talking Looney Toon Mako.

It’s difficult to pick a standout performance in a dub where everyone is so perfect in general, but if I had to choose a favorite, there are two that come to mind, and they’re both supplied by veteran voice actors with some serious clout in their resumes. The first one is Carrie Keranen, who’s probably most well known for playing Casca in Berserk, and in Kill La Kill, she plays the duplicitous school dictator Lady Satsuki. Her voice is very strong and powerful throughout the series, making for some rousing speeches, with a sense of restraint at other times that hides the duality of her character. The other one is Stephanie Sheh, who is known for regularly getting typecast as high-pitched girly-girl characters, and then stunning the crap out of people whenever she breaks away from that mewling moe mold. She has a lot more talent than people give her credit for, and it’s never been more apparent than in her portrayal of Nui Harime, who doesn’t come into the series until an Earth-shattering reveal at the halfway point. Her voice is sweet, high pitched, and overly-affectionate, yet Sheh’s performance is still dripping with malice and cruelty below the surface. Over-all, the dub is just as good as the sub, so you should be able to watch either track without complaint.

If you’re watching Kill La Kill for the first time, it is perfectly understandable to go through a case of some sensory overload. This series hits the ground running, assaulting you with it’s ridiculous premise, it’s complicated plot, slapstick, stylized violence and constant, gratuitous, unapologetic fan service from both genders. It can become confusing very early on, and what’s worse, it might even lose your interest by the end of disk one. It’s a lot to take in, and it doesn’t bother easing you into it, so you’re going to have to really trust me when I tell you that everything about it… Yes, literally everything… Makes perfect sense by the end, in either an on-the-surface or metaphorical way.

The main plot, for example, may seem like a random collection of excuses to see the cast as close to naked as Japanese TV standards will allow, what with the skin-baring Kamui uniforms, the instant stripping of anybody who’s defeated in battle, and a violent clash of philosophies about whether or not clothing is necessary or evil. As we uncover more of this bizarre world’s backstory, and the plot twists begin to unravel before us, you’ll find that the entire scenario is surprisingly believable, as ridiculous as it all might be. I won’t go into too much details… Spoilers and all, you know… But what I will do is compare it to Gurren Lagann, who’s second half seemed to rely on the idea that if the world’s population reaches a certain number, the moon will crash into it, despite no attempt at explaining why or how this stipulation came to be. Kill La Kill is a lot more thorough than that, and doesn’t rely on the stupidity of the audience to sell it’s ideas.

Which doesn’t explain the weird nature of Ryuko’s powers. Her weapon is an article of clothing that leaves virtually nothing to the imagination, while stealing blood from it’s host and magical threads from it’s defeated enemies. Believe it or not, this isn’t just some random battle outfit that was deliberately designed to be as pervy as possible… Although that kind of thing is hardly uncommon in any medium, so I can’t blame you for thinking it. It’s much more than that. I can explain this, and the good news is that it’s not a spoiler!

As I mentioned earlier, Trigger is an apple that fell from the tree of Studio Gainax. Gainax has a long history of exploring the theme of growing up, in terms of coming of age and puberty. The problem with that is that, if all the drills in Gurren Lagann didn’t tip you off, they tend to focus on the male side of this. What Trigger did with Kill La Kill, possibly intentionally, was infuse it with a FEMALE puberty metaphor. In the first half of the series alone, you’ve got her developing her powers by making an occasional blood exchange (Getting her period), collecting fibers (Growing the pewbz) and becoming comfortable with her body. The metaphor even goes as far as to suggest that after losing too much blood, she can turn into an uncontrollable rage monster, and all this complicated symbolism about her budding sexuality only feeds into Kill La Kill’s deeper metaphors.

Yes, you heard me right, there are deeper metaphors in Kill La Kill. I’ve heard a lot of reviewers say that it doesn’t have any real depth, but that it’s okay, because it doesn’t need depth, which I respectfully disagree with. As any anime fan who prefers the original FMA series over Brotherhood will tell you, even when depth isn’t necessary, it’s still highly appreciated and can elevate a good show into a great show. With Kill La Kill, you just have to know what you’re looking for, and once you start to notice it, a bunch of light bulbs WILL start going off in your head as you start to piece it together. To give you as unspoilery a taste as I can, Kill La Kill has a lot to say about the subject of conformity.

Now, when you hear the word conformity, your mind will almost certainly give you an image of a fifties style American family… Two parents, two children, a dog, a white picket fence, and the smiling mother doing all the chores for her smarmy bucktoothed son. Basically, the kind of world that Pleasantville deconstructed. But the truth is that conformity in Japan is much more involved than it ever was here. Not only is it far more widespread, but it’s still a major part of their culture to this day. From what I’ve heard from a few people I know who’ve traveled there, conformity in Japan is so bad that when businessman go out for a job-related meal, everybody will order the exact same thing that their boss ordered in an attempt to impress him. It’s that bad.

In Kill La Kill, all you need to keep in mind is that clothing… Specifically school uniforms, and especially the Goku uniforms… Represent conformity to traditional values. Nudity, or even the simple act of wearing your own street clothes, represents individuality and self expression. As proof of this, Satsuki’s kamui is referred to several times as her ‘wedding dress,’ despite the fact that she is at no point in the story given anything close to a love interest. This is because marriage is also a huge part of Japanese conformity… It’s extremely difficult to get a job if you’re single, and if you’re a woman, you lose a huge chunk of your individual rights the moment you say “I do.” On top of this, the main villain of the series is at one point shown crucified, in an obvious reference to Christianity… Not because she’s a martyr, but because she represents morality and the very same repressive traditional values that the series is cautioning us against.

But even if you ignore all that, Kill La Kill is still notable for it’s progressive representation of gender roles. Not only is the fanservice split between both genders, but the male characters have little to no effect on the ambitions and arcs of the female stars. They have no love interests to comment on them not being ladylike(Are you taking notes, Type Moon?), nor are any of them fighting or striving for somebody’s affection, or being saved by a stronger male when the going gets too tough. This is rarer than you might think, as even Sailor Moon and Misaka Mikoto need a man by their side at some point or another. It’s also not uncommon for female characters to be designed so that you’ll root for them to survive rather than to succeed(Or, in video games, you wind up playing them for the sake of protecting them). With Ryuko, you root for her for the same reasons that you root for Goku or Yusuke… Because she’s awesome, she kicks ass, and you want to see her tear down the school and put it’s authority in it’s place.

Even her ultra-revealing battle outfit has some nuance to it. In the beginning, it’s an incredibly awkward and embarrassing look for her, and this hampers her ability to fight the much more convicted Satsuki. The audience at this point will presumably have the same reaction her male onlookers have, ranging from ‘that’s hot’ too ‘that’s sick and shameful.’ But as she becomes more comfortable with it, a strange thing happens… People around her gradually begin to forget about the skin she’s showing, and focus on the fact that she’s one of the toughest and most intimidating fighters they’ve ever seen. The eroticism also wears off for the viewer, for as Ryuko develops as a character, you’ll stop seeing her Kamui as an exploitation of nubile underaged flesh, and you’ll start seeing it the same way you see the outfits of heroes like Superman, Batman and Ironman… When the costume comes on, the gloves come off, and you’re excited to know that somebody’s about to get their shit kicked in. Throw in an adorable pooch and a few cautionary tales about not forgetting where you’re from, and you’ve got a recipe for a Killer of a good time.

Kill La Kill is available from Aniplex of America. They knew they had a bankable title on their hands, and they’ve priced it as such. It was released stateside as five individual discs, ranging in price for thirty dollars per DVD to sixty dollars per Blu-ray, to eighty dollars per Blu-Ray/DVD special edition combo pack. That’s a hefty price, so if you’re able to find a good deal, take it. I personally considered it a steal when I got the whole series on DVD for eighty, but for those of you who’s pockets aren’t that deep, it’s available for legal streaming on Netflix, Hulu, and Crunchyroll.

I’ve criticized certain titles in the past for having depth, but being too inaccessible to casual viewers who won’t be willing or able to understand it. With Kill La Kill, this really isn’t an issue. The depth in it enhances the story, but never holds it back. Even if you’re watching it with your brain turned off, it’s still a big, loud, over-the-top action series with great production values, a lot of heart and a lot of great characters. It succeeds at almost everything it tries to do, and it just gets better and better every time I watch it. That’s not to say it’s perfect, of course…  The pacing can sometimes be way too fast, and the first few episodes can be incredibly abrasive for some viewers.  Hell, my first time through, I didn’t even really get into it until episode five, but once it had me, I never wanted it to let me go.  I give Kill La Kill a 9/10."

Bungou Stray Dogs (BSD) is an adaption of the 2012 manga series of the same name, being written by Kafka Asagiri and illustrated by Sango Harukawa. This 12-episode run is the first season of the current three seasons out at the time of this review, and my review will strictly be on the first season.
img720()

BSD is about an 18-year-old orphan named Atsushi Nakajima joining the Armed Detective Agency, basically a bunch of detectives with a bunch of superpowers called gifts. Excepts its more a less a gang war than actual detective work, which isn’t bad, just something to take note of. 

Gifts have a more or less typical concept, similar to My Hero Academia or any other super power based anime, there’s nothing too unique about it, this isn’t really a bad thing, but the concept isn’t really ground-breaking or anything, though the idea of a detective agency with superpowers still sounds interesting enough to get me on board.

Anyway it’s time to get to my actual opinion. I think Bungou Stray Dogs is interesting, what I mean by that is it has a lot of potential but falls flat a lot in the first half of season 1. Granted they are just getting their footing and they need time to get into the flow of things, but I just felt that the first few episodes felt disjointed. I wasn’t really intrigued and nothing really kept my attention. Even the set up for later episodes felt kind of flat. A clear example is in one episode they hype up a character saying they’re super strong and such, but the MC who can’t even remain conscious while using his gift is able to have a fair fight with him? Granted they did display his power to an extreme before hand on people who either didn’t have gifts, or fighting abilities, but to me its just felt kind of cliché for the MC to just come with the whole I cant die here yet kind of vibe. But once again this episode did build up a lot of lore the following later half. Which I would say turns around at episode 7, this is where I feel like the story picks up, it’s the first episode I felt fully invested in the characters and the stakes were felt, especially one of the key lessons in the episode, you can’t save everyone, or even anyone at some points, they’re detectives not heroes. That theme plays out a few times throughout the season, it gives the series a more realistic feel and I feel like that really works for it.

This is helped by the characters. The characters are very well done, they have distinct personalities, motives and ideals, when they clash its interesting and when their challenged its even better, I think its well done even in early episodes which is always good, especially since the plot is heavily character driven, and for the second half of the season, the plots very good in my opinion, it all fit well together and the fight in episode 10 particular, felt very satisfying, though I feel like the antagonists motives in that episode came out of nowhere, but that might just be me.
img720()

The series is accompanied by an amazing OST in my opinion, especially the OP and ED, the OP having a hype start to the episode and the ED having a more sentimental ending. The art style has a lot of saturated colours and refined line work that really looks nice, I really like what BONES have done, but BONES being BONES of course its going to be good.
img720()

Overall it has a bit of a disjointed start which feels pretty mediocre, but it flicks a switch half way and becomes quite a satisfying show"

""WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR SHOW OR SERIES LOOK SMARTER OR DEEPER THAN IT IS, PLEASE, WE HAVE TO INCLUDE A FRIEDRICE QUOTE. OTHERWISE, THEY WON'T GET HOW UNBELIEVABLY DEEP WE'RE BEING.""

If you start a work of fiction with a Nietzsche quote without even having read the Nietzsche work the quote is actually from, then you're a hack. [Like this person.](https://anilist.co/user/TheGrumblingGoblin/)



Whoops!

All jokes and self-depreciation aside, I don't even really know where to begin with this one. I honestly don't. This adaptation of I'm assuming an [equally terrible novel series](https://anilist.co/manga/94970/YoukosoJitsuryokuShijouShuginoKyoushitsue) is brought to us by [Lerche](https://anilist.co/studio/456/Lerche).  Who brought us things such as [Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace) and [Kino 2017](https://anilist.co/anime/98448/KinonoTabitheBeautifulWorldtheAnimatedSeries)... and Classroom of Elite is even directed by the [same guy who directed Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/staff/101909/SeijiKishi) (actually, it's listed as having [two directors](https://anilist.co/staff/118960/HiroyukiHashimoto)).

...Which is kind of surprising, because at least Ranpo Kitan had a clearer and more logical plot, and things actually happened. But again, Classroom of Elite is an adaptation of a series of novels so whatever.

...I honestly have no fucking clue what genre I'd even call it. Looking at its Anilist page, it's under comedy, romance, and drama. Comedy...? No? Romance? Definitely no. Drama? Fuckin'... they WISH.

I felt like most of the time this show had me [at knifepoint screaming at me like an insane person.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0a6EZ5v8) You have to care! YOU HAVE TO CARE! THIS IS DRAMATIC, THESE EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE IMPORTANT AND YOU MUST FIND THEM IMPORTANT. Please care that this idiotic and completely and almost comically unlikable punk is about to get expelled from school!

img440()

But... but I don't. I just don't give a flying fuck about this character. Or any of the other characters, for that matter. There is nothing to cheer these characters on for, there are no stakes, and nothing that happens is interesting or entertaining in any way. As a matter of fact, it's honestly almost shocking how over the top this show is while simultaneously being full of nothing. But I'll get into that. There's gonna be a whole fucking section of this review that discusses that.

If you care about getting spoiled on this series, then I guess... this is the point where I warn you about that but... why would you care? Nobody cares. Like thinking about it now that I've completed it, there is absolutely nothing about this series I'm interested in. Like the ""plot"" or the point of the series was very much unresolved but there's just nothing? Why ever make a season two for this? Why even read the original series after watching the anime?

Like you should actually want the viewer to be interested in seeing a continuation of the story whether it be through a possible season two or just getting them to look at the original. This show even ends like on a ""OH SHIT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED"" type of note but...

img440()

NOTHING OF NOTE HAPPENED IN ALL TWELVE EPISODES. YOU [GLASSLIP](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip)'D ME, YOU ABSOLUTE SHITHEELS.




At least this section will be quick, because there's only one character that matters or is worth even discussing to any length beyond like a sentence or two.

img300()

You have Main Girl, she is a loner and will repeatedly state that she is a loner and prefers being a loner despite showing signs that hint otherwise. Oh, and her only motivation is that she wants her brother's approval. That's it.

img300()

You have Other Girl 1, she is super nice to everyone and wishes to be friends with everyone on the planet and there is definitely nothing at all wrong with her in any way shape or form despite the fact that she was placed in the worst class of the school.

img300()

You have Other Girl 2, she is shy girl but she has a different side to her that she keeps secret and her purpose in this show is to almost be raped by a creepy mall employee and then she shows at a trial a couple of photos I guess and then after that she's a character from that point on.

img300()

You have Delinquent Failure. He is a delinquent failure who gets into fights and arguments and he wishes to play the basketball but if he gets expelled he can no longer play the basketball but despite this he doesn't care about studying and keeping his position in school secure so he can play the basketball that he so dearly loves and he is a REAL FULL FLEDGED CHARACTER THAT YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT.

img440()

You have the Teacher. She is harsh and at one point calls the failure class garbage, but then eventually at some point she apparently cares about or wants to get her class to the top of the garbage pyramid. It just sort of happens. She seemed like she could have cared less before then, but whatever, who needs clear motivations for characters anyways???

img440()

Then we have the main male character, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji. I'm saying it right now, but Ayanokouji is the only character in this entire show, in this entire series that is worth anything at all. It was actually somewhat interesting or entertaining at how ridiculously far they took it. This character is absolutely completely emotionless the entire way through, and does not care about ANYTHING. And even at the end of the show when Main Girl !actually finally changes and starts showing emotions! for once, Ayanokouji is just staring at her and !she eventually gets tuned out by Ayanokouji's inner monologue about how he just does not give a fuck about anyone and all other human beings are just tools to be used. This was actually my favorite moment and one of the few scenes I actually liked out of the entire fucking show.! Like wow, I have to give them credit. They, or rather the original author I guess, set out to create one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen, and for at least what they adapted, they didn't flip flop on it.

Ayanokouji's facial expression is basically entirely the same throughout all twelve episodes. He's never angry, he's never sad, he's never surprised, he never laughs, he is simply Ayanokouji. 

He has absolutely no problem from having someone smear mud into Main Girl's hair so she has to bathe to purposely intensify her sickness or even committing arson. Fuck it, who cares. He just wants to have an ordinary high school life but simultaneously he's going to win at all costs. Win at what, you may ask? I don't know man. The universe.

Ayanokouji will win against the entire universe because he is perfect and flawless in every single way.



But TGG, isn't being an emotionless husk that wants to only be perceived as an average guy by everyone else Ayanokouji's fla--




It's impossible not to make the comparison now that I've realized both shows aired in the exact same season (Summer 2017). Classroom of the Elite and [Kakegurui](https://anilist.co/anime/98314/Kakegurui) are both shows that are very over the top about schools that for a multitude of reasons, would never ever exist in real life. But there is a very key difference between these two shows. I mean hell, Kakegurui even has a never losing protagonist, just like Classroom of the Elite.



I didn't watch Classroom of the Elite while it was airing because I was too busy watching Kakegurui.

In Kakegurui, horrible things can happen as a result of the gambles. At the very least, you may go into debt and be forced to essentially be a boot licking slave to one of the other students or you may have the rest of your life beyond graduation basically decided by another. It's very, very over the top, but it is rightfully and for that matter enjoyably over the top.

What are the stakes in Classroom of the Elite? You may not have a perfect choice of whatever college or job you wish to end up at. Oh. So why is everything presented so fucking dramatically and over the top? Like very early on, the show establishes that the monthly money given to students is determined by merit, and the bottom class which the show is focused on, Class D, very quickly ends up dropping down to earning zero points because they're all failures.

I was under the assumption that the points would matter. But the show makes a point of showing that the stores at least offer a couple of free items to students who have ran out of or wasted their points. Even later in the show, it's shown that there essentially is a free menu for the cafeteria. 



After all, it IS still a school. It wouldn't be realistic if the school was allowing students to starve as a result of their own poor choices or just generally because they're failures.

Meanwhile, in Kakegurui:

img440()

Like honestly. It's treated so goddamned dramatically when the Delinquent Failure is about to be expelled as a result of failing the exam that he refused time and time again to study for but. Like the moment Ayanokouji got up and followed the Teacher out of the classroom, I immediately went: ""Oh okay, so the delinquent isn't going to be expelled."" And of course, he wasn't.

img440()

But like the way they save him from getting expelled is by selling the Teacher their points because the first thing she told them about this school was that anything could be bought. But... but the [points DON'T MATTER](https://youtu.be/9KAGwNtI26w?t=18s) AND NOTHING WAS FORCING HER TO SELL THEM THE TEST POINT. And Ayanokouji and Main Girl selling the Teacher their money points for the single test point Delinquent Failure needs so he isn't expelled doesn't matter either. In fact, it's like after that the points just completely cease mattering entirely. How is the majority of Class D faring as a result of having wasted most of their points and most likely getting no or very little points in the next month? Who cares!

img440()

Like when Other Girl 1 is suddenly revealed to be hiding a super dark personality beneath her smiley and friendly facade? That doesn't matter. Because even after that when she's alone with Ayanokouji, she just talks in the ""nice girl"" persona except for like two times when she actually drops it again. What was the point of threatening him that she'd blackmail him with rape if he ever told anyone else? He basically didn't even care upon discovering it in the first place.



Or what about Other Girl 2. Her initial role or purpose in the show is basically to have been the witness to Delinquent Failure's innocence when some other students from Class C provoked a fight with him but... her testimony barely influences the result at all. And like they show like one of her modeling pictures off of her camera's SD card but... she didn't have to keep that photo on there when they would use it to show the actual relevant pictures. 

Then after that, she just almost gets raped by the creepy weird mall employee guy. But hey, Ayanokouji saves her. And then... and then she's just a character. A part of the main cast. Whatever!

Then like in the final arc of the show, where the school has all four classes go and stay at this deserted island for a week, there is like a fight scene between Main Girl and one of the other girls from one of the other classes and it... it literally came out of nowhere. But violence isn't allowed! But theft isn't allowed! The other character just outright says the rules don't matter as long as nobody sees. Oh... so... none of that mattered at all. Okay.

img()

Wait, isn't Other Girl 1's whole thing that she'll tell everyone that Ayanokouji raped her, but nobody was around to see nor was she recording her forcing him to grope her. But then in this instance, the show says it doesn't matter if nobody sees--oh just... nevermind. Fuck it!

But like there was also an incident where somebody stole a girl's underwear and it causes a schism between the boys and the girls of Class D and like the boyfriend/leader character is all like, I'll accept possession of the stolen underwear because she's my girlfriend I guess and that'll lessen the impact? But I don't think they ever actually reveal that he's in possession of the missing underwear because that's when Ayanokouji says fuck this, I'm just going to set our SURVIVAL MANUAL ON FIRE BECAUSE REASONS AND I'M MANIPULATING A VERY CONVOLUTED SERIES OF EVENTS FROM BEHIND THE SCENES.

The show ends with Class D, almost entirely as a result of Ayanokouji's capability of manipulation, beating all three other classes. And while they weren't purposely attacking Class B because they have an alliance with them, Ayanokouji's manipulations factored in Class B getting fucked over as well, just not directly by Class D.

img440()

So... Ayanokouji is basically perfect, and no other student is even close to matching him. There maybe actually is one, but in the context of what they adapted, she is on the screen maybe like three or four times and is purposely absent from the final arc of the show. And I'm sure in the novels, Ayanokouji just beats her anyways.

And the show ends like it's ending on this grandiose note of a cliffhanger like... like you're supposed to be interested in seeing Class D continuing to rise against the higher classes to become the Classroom of the Elite. But... you just don't. Like I said at the start of this review, there's absolutely no motivation to ever actually want to see a continuation of this series. Whereas comparatively, I'm totally down for [Kakegurui 2](https://anilist.co/anime/100876/Kakegurui2) because while that protagonist also basically never loses, the show actually manages to be entertaining.

Which is something this show repeatedly time and time again fails at.




I shouldn't even be wasting the time but I should at least address it.

The Delinquent Failure should not have had four episodes revolving around him. Especially considering after that, he's essentially just nothing but a supporting character. And one of the most minor ones, at that. Like Other Girl 1 keeps going on and on about how Main Girl should not want Deliqnuent Guy to be expelled but...

img440()

Main Girl was completely right? He's a fucking failure and none of them should have went anywhere near as far as they did to save him from getting expelled. If he wanted to play basketball and him playing basketball depended on him staying in the school, then maybe his brain should have worked and he would have realized that perhaps actually studying on his own volition would be a good idea.

But even then after he is essentially dragged into caring about it and after they get the old test questions, he STILL fails. And then after that whole ordeal, they right away start up a new arc where Class C tries to frame Delinquent Failure for assaulting three people and the punishment is... BEING SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL! And then when the student council president gets involved, he's like...

img440()

""I'M PUTTING EXPULSION ON THE TABLE.""

I could probably do an entire breakdown of all of the terrible logic or just everything just generally horribly wrong in that trial scene, but I just do NOT care.

Who... who fucking cares? Again, that image of the show screaming and armed with a knife comes to mind because like... it really seems like they want the viewer to care. But I can't even comprehend caring about anything that happens in this series. How can I when like...

img440()

The very first episode ends with the shocking reveal that things aren't exactly like they seem at this school. The classes compete and if you're garbage, you don't get points that are essentially money but also simultaneously don't matter, and their Teacher outright tells them all this and that they're garbage which I should note is very, very true.



But immediately, the second episode just opens with them in pool class. And for several minutes, they're just doing pool class things, but eventually like a switch was flipped, and then they start like having a strategy meeting and going over what their Teacher revealed to them in the prior episode. ""Gosh, who knew there was gonna be a darker turn to this school!""



And the entirety of episode seven is just outright a pool episode. Which I mostly just skimmed through because at the time, I just was not having any of that shit. But the show sure showed me, because then the entirety of episode eight is just a boat vacation. Granted, the boat trip at least leads into the deserted island arc, but did the boat trip really need to be an entire episode? Or rather, did we need the pool episode when you could basically squeeze as much fan service (and they basically did) into a boat trip episode???

Did there need to be a blond guy character whose entire purpose was to be arrogant, annoying, and completely useless? Like he tags along with Ayanokouji and Other Girl 2 at some point in the Deserted Island arc and he's like swinging from trees and shit and then he gets too far ahead of them, and then the episode just ends with him going back to the boat therefore penalizing the entirety of Class D.

I'm so glad that was the contribution his entire character gave to the show.

img440()

Like I just don't understand it. You have this over the top concept and idea, but like... for twelve episodes, basically nothing happens. I mean, I'm willing to believe that the original novel series is probably more or less the exact same. But like... why. Why create a series where absolutely nothing happens? Like it's maybe one thing if you're just throwing a bunch of chickens and metaphors around. But Glasslip isn't a novel series. This is.

Based off of episode one, I imagined like the students were gonna have to start bartering or like trying to earn points. Then the whole angle of competing with the other classes was thrown out there, and I was like oh okay, then we're gonna go in that direction. But it's not like until the last five or so episodes of the show where they actually start competing with the other classes and even then, Ayanokouji just wins. He just wins.

img()




No stakes at all, basically no motivation at all, nothing of any note happens, and it's not entertaining. Classroom of the Elite? More like Classroom of the FAILURES! HA! Ha... ha...

I really wish I hadn't watched this show.

But uh yeah no, I give this show a 1.5 out of 10 or a 15 out of 100. 

I would never recommend anyone to seriously watch this show and I hope it doesn't get a second season because if it does I'll be forced to watch it because I actually genuinely like Ayanokouji for how absolutely absurdly unlikable he is. And even as far as masochism/watching bad shows for the sake of watching bad shows go, I'd say Glasslip is a way more interesting show in which also absolutely nothing of note happens.

So yeah, go watch [Glasslip](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip) instead. Or [Kakegurui](https://anilist.co/anime/98314/Kakegurui), I guess. Or anything.

Just not this.

20923,"(DISCLAIMER: I won't really go into any spoilers with this review, but I will be covering my thoughts on Food Wars through season 3, so it's not limited to season 1)
Food Wars is causing me to suffer through my worst bout of post-anime depression in a long time, maybe ever. It has been so long since I binged a series so hard. The last thing that comes to mind that was comparable was Oregairu last summer, and even Oregairu didn't smack me with as much depression once I finished binging it. The simple fact was that I enjoyed watching Food Wars that much. It was something magical to me even with its absurd premises and foodgasms. No, I don't think it's perfect, but did I enjoy it enough to give it a spot among my favorites? Yes. Yes, I did.

Technically speaking, Food Wars is no marvel in the world of anime. It's animation is solid, nothing spectacular; it's sound is pretty good, not like it needed to blow you away anyway. But musically speaking, Food Wars is great. The Openings and Endings do leave something to be desired beyond the season one's first cour, but they're passable. That being said, the true strength of Food Wars lies in its soundtrack. All the songs involving the battles are perfectly atmospheric, be it the intense cooking songs, or the satisfying victory theme. The character tracks deserve a special mention for their quality as well. They capture the specific character almost flawlessly, the regal theme for Erina being my personal favorite, but Hayama's Indian inspired theme and Ryo's rock theme are great examples too. The soundtrack really drives Food Wars above the rest in terms of hype levels. There are moments that have the potential to fall flat, but are instead elevated to epic levels because of the soundtrack alone. On top of those things alone, the voice acting in Food Wars is superb. Soma's voice actor without question deserves a mountain of praise for how dynamic he is with showcasing Soma's emotions. Not only that, but apparently Erina had a voice actor change in season 3 and I never even noticed, major props for that.

But why do I love Food Wars? It's really simple honestly, it's the characters. It's rare for an anime to make me love nearly every character. Personally, I think the best example of another show doing the same thing is Monogatari. But where Monogatari did it via its arcs dedicated to certain characters, Food Wars does it in a more ensemble way, leading to more shallow side characters, but extremely likable main characters. It helps that most of the main cast is fairly one dimensional, but it's a shounen, there's not a lot of extremely deep characters in shounen in the first place. Even if what I have just described sounds somewhat run-of-the-mill for a show, trust me when I say that it all comes together and works wonders. Who knows, maybe it just appeals to my love of ensemble casts with ecchi harem inspirations, but it just works for me. Maybe it doesn't with others, but to me, this is a perfect cast.

(I really felt like adding this section to my reviews, since characters are such an important factor in anime for me. I'm going to start putting this section in to my reviews from here on out to add a more personal touch!)
Favorite Character: Erina Nakiri
img()

Big surprise, I love the blonde tsundere. Honestly though, I was a hair away from putting Soma here instead. But in the end, I remembered how much I looked forward to Erina's scenes that I realized, even if Soma is my main man, he wasn't the character I loved the most. Soma was the one I cheered for throughout the entire series, experiencing his ups and downs with him and really growing to appreciate his character, despite his tropey clueless nature. But Erina was the character I instantly loved the moment she appeared on screen. I'm a huge sucker for the Soma x Erina ship, I kinda just want season 4 for more of their interactions if I'm being completely honest with myself. Speaking of ships since it's such a huge part of my anime experience, I really liked how Food Wars dealt with such topics, basically confirming that Soma and Erina were a thing in episode 2 ( or was it 1, I can't remember). I just really appreciated letting everyone know that this was the canon ship, keeping us away from the dark waters that could have been Megumi x Soma. Tangent aside, I also considered Alice and Ryo for this, but I figured that even though I really liked both of them, they couldn't hold a candle to Soma or Erina in my book.

With all the praise I've sung about Food Wars, I have to pause a bit and say that this is all personal preference. The ridiculousness of the food battles isn't for everyone. It could get old fast for those who think that it's over the top. All I would say to those people is, if the first episode doesn't appeal to you, you may as well stop, because you're going to get a lot of the same general thing from there on out. But I hope that my enthusiasm for Food Wars has shown and can maybe inspire you to watch it, because in my opinion, it's worth it.``"
108465,"The isekai genre has been a source of neverending torment for animanga fans for almost a decade now, with blatant, boring and offensive escapist garbage coming out in droves every single season. Few would defend this trend beyond a handful of exceptions that are deemed to be interesting enough to stand out from the crowd, ranging from comedies like Konosuba, Maou-sama or Hamefura, stories that use the setting to tell a legitimate story like Log Horizon or commentaries about escapism and finding self worth (though not a fan of the show) like Re:Zero. The isekai genre's history is long and complex, having roots in having been originally aimed at women (with stuff like Twelve Kingdoms and Inuyasha) before Sword Art Online's explosion in popularity gave birth to the current trend we see today of blatant pandering and unapologetic lazy writing that is devoid of any legitimate literary merit. Why create a fantasy setting when you can just copy and paste a basic RPG so your audience of teenagers who don't know better would just read it? Why give your main character any sort of personality worth analyzing when you can make him the blandest Gary Stu imaginable that is so perfect that women in the setting are begging for him to insert his chaste penis into them? Why bother writing a story with compelling characters when you can just list off a pack of tropes, implementing them in the blandest and most stereotypical way possible without a shred of originality?

Mushoku Tensei is frequently attributed as the godfather of the isekai genre in its modern state. Now, I do not know if this is true, but regardless I can confirm that this series is nothing but a stain upon anime in general, and a painful reminder of just how far the anime community is willing to overlook flaws in series that otherwise have great production values. More than anything, it is rather telling that a genre infamous for low quality shows would traces its origins to something as instinctively repulsive as this pile of trash.

There is precisely zero reason to care for any character in Mushoku Tensei, and the author of this work displays a hatred of things many would call common human decency to make the audience's reaction to the entire cast as hostile as humanly possible so long as you do not fall within the camp this show is clearly pandering to.

Pedophilia. Grooming. Sexual harassment. Sexual assault. Voyeurism. Adultery. Kidnapping. Abuse.

I had, have and always will be a supporter of tackling sensitive subjects in series irrespective of genre or demographic, but the extent to which this show decides to pander hard to the worst of the anime community and make its main character as repulsive as humanly possible is insane. Rudeus - a reincarnated, 34 year old man - is a pedophile and his values (which the show never genuinely questions as of right now in any meaningful way, who knows what happens in future seasons) make it impossible to like him or feel anything beyond disgust. Rudeus takes advantage of the fact he is in-setting a baby to constantly grope women, hide panties away and pray at them, listen in on his new parents having sex, watch his tutor masturbate to his parents having sex, monologue about grooming a child, allow a student of his to get kidnapped and roughened up to the point she has BROKEN TEETH AND IS COUGHING UP BLOOD ON THE FLOOR and the list goes on and on and on. Anyone who unironically sees likable traits in Rudeus should legitimately take a long, hard look at themselves and question where exactly they went wrong.

Perhaps the worst scene in the series - and the scene that ironically communicates everything wrong with the series in a handful of minutes - is when an antagonist walks up to Rudeus and offers to tie up his student in order to impregnate her in exchange for joining him. Rudeus declines before walking off, then monologuing in regret how he wishes he accepted the offer so he would have had a harem of hot maids. OK, maybe it's a joke, whatever, some jokes are pretty out there...then he goes back to his room, finds his student in his room, sexually assaults said student and almost actually rapes her before he gets kicked out of the room.

Are...are you seeing the problem with this shit? Why should I root for this guy? Why should ANYONE root for this guy?

The side cast vary wildly in quality, but those who are clearly designed to be sympathetic similarly exhibit unlikable traits, varying from getting groped non-stop by Rudeus if they're a woman to almost definitely being some kind of cheating if they're a man. This goes on and on, and even characters who don't have unlikable traits worship Rudeus (even if it's not technically their fault considering none of them are away this is some 40 something dude in the body of a child), completely destroying any and all possibility to take any of them seriously.

There are various things that I do think are worthy of merit in Mushoku Tensei. Rudeus has PTSD from a past where he was persecuted nonstop and bullied, and there's clear neatly written hints into that show leading to a neat climax where he finally leaves his home to visit the outside world. The production values - ranging from animation quality, character designs, backgrounds, soundtrack and sound design - are absolutely fantastic, and have me looking forward to Studio Bind's future works. Traces of a redemption story for not living life to the fullest do exist in this series, even if undermined by an awful main character for whom these attempts to evoke sympathy ring hollow for. Some side characters are occasionally likable and have alright ideas for character arcs - Roxy, Ruijerd and Sylphiette among them. I don't think what this show is trying to do is hard to make a great show out of, and great stuff has been made out of elements in this series, but what's instead here is a laughably broken pile of dirt, whose positive reception exhibits just how much anime fans are willing to forgive atrocious writing in favor of amazing production values.

Stay far, far, far away from this, unless you hatewatch stuff like I do. Find some friends or something to start a drinking game over this or something, I don't know, maybe the show'd be tolerable to watch then.

Now excuse me while I read The Faraway Paladin or something unironically good."
9989,"DISCLAIMER: Everything I write is based on my personal opinions/analyses and I don’t have anything against people who love this show. Since I provide explanations for pretty much all my points, I would suggest you read them before completely disagreeing with my statements.

The main reasons that anime is one of my favorite forms of entertainment is because many of these shows do not shy away from tackling heavier themes and issues. Although a multitude of anime with gloomier themes have successfully managed to be entertaining, thought-provoking and emotionally impactful, Anohana, on the other hand, is unfortunately not one of them. Out of all the heart-wrenching anime, Anohana seems to be a favorite among the general public, especially with those who resonate with the theme of coping with the loss of someone close to you. This makes sense since just by reading the synopsis, Anohana appears to be a bittersweet show about a group of friends dealing with and overcoming grief due to the death of their childhood friend. However, when you finish watching the show, it becomes quite clear that the show is only about traumatic events on an extremely artificial level, but the theme that gets explored by the majority of the main cast is actually coping with unrequited love instead. Due the addition of a completely different message, the show becomes so confused at its own identity that it tries to stitch both major themes together with forced melodrama and dragged out as well as terribly rushed story arcs, and as a result, it fails at portraying either themes in a realistic and impactful way.

This review will contain major SPOILERS so skip to the end if you just want to read a general summary of my thoughts on the show.

Story - 5/10
The story of Anohana is very simple, which is not a bad thing by any means, especially when it had the potential to be incredibly emotionally impactful. When they were children, a group of friends gradually drifted apart due to the death of someone in the group. Years later, the main character, Jinta Yadomi, sees the ghost of his dead childhood friend, Meiko Honma (most characters refer to her as Menma), during summer. Jinta, who initially believed the Menma he was seeing to be a hallucination caused by his stress, decides to send her to heaven by granting her a wish that she had when she was still alive. Through his attempts to grant this wish, Jinta slowly reconciles with the rest of his childhood friends and manages to fix many bonds that were once broken. Unfortunately, this major plot device that drives the whole story forward is only the main focus for the first three episodes and gets pushed aside for a completely different story about love triangles (I will discuss this in detail in the character section of the review).
I also want to quickly talk about a gripe I have with the story (that didn’t heavily impact the rating but is rather an annoyance I had) which is the plot hole of the inconsistency of Menma’s ghost. Since she is clearly able to lift objects and consume food, it never made any sense why it took Jinta so long to prove her existence to his friends. The show actually realizes this and tries to give it an explanation by making Matsuyuki say that Jinta just wanted to keep Menma for himself. This also doesn’t make any sense since a part of what Jinta has been trying to do throughout most of the show is to prove that she exists and Jinta felt nothing but happiness when everyone finally acknowledged her existence. This problem along with many others can be solved simply by making Menma an actual hallucination instead, even though it would make the plot more predictable (I will also explain this further in the character section).

Art - 9/10
The art design is absolutely incredible, everything from character designs to backgrounds are all beautifully drawn. The character designs definitely deserve some more praise since in my opinion these designs portrayed each character perfectly without being overly cliché. Although there were a lot of character tropes in the show, the characters never felt like a generic hikikomori or tsundere from a design standpoint despite the long black hair and the classic twin tails. The animation also felt smooth and all the characters were able to portray their emotions very well as a result. The score for the art is not any higher because in some scenes with more aggressive movements, the anatomy of the characters felt very unnatural.

Sound - 9/10
The sound design and its quality stands out a lot compared to the rest of the categories (with the exception of the art). The openings and endings of the are all well composed and memorable, none of them felt rushed and the tone of the songs perfectly conveyed the feelings of the show. I don’t claim to be an expert in music or sound design but, in my opinion, the soundtrack always managed to strengthen the story arcs and the character moments. The music alone made me feel emotional in overly dramatic scenes that would have otherwise been extremely cringe-worthy.

Character - 3/10
I have two major complaints about this show and a few other slightly less serious criticisms. The first significant problem I have with the show is ghost Menma’s entire character. To understand my criticism with this seemingly “crucial” character, it is important to remember the main point of the show is supposed to be about a group of characters dealing with and overcoming grief instead of a character dealing with her own death. It is not a stretch to say that Menma probably had more screen time than any of the main cast including Jinta. I don’t dislike Menma’s character, however, she eats up a large amount of the runtime for absolutely no reason. The show spends a lot of time following ghost Menma’s independent actions and emotions, especially in the first few episodes, without the involvement of the other characters. By taking focus away from the primary characters that the show tries to get the viewers’ to sympathize with, these characters only end up feeling like empty shells filled with artificial attempts at being relatable. But Menma’s appearances allow her to become a fully fleshed out character that the viewers can care for right? This is also not the case since, even if ignoring the fact that she didn’t have any proper development despite all her screen time, ghost Menma cannot have a proper emotional moment involving her death since she is already dead when the show started. In this case, it is more likely that the viewers would only feel bad for Menma (which is something that can be accomplished without a lot of screen time) instead of tearing up at a character dying after already having developed an emotional attachment with them. Only feeling bad for Menma would have been completely fine since the real emotional moments are supposed to be with the rest of the main cast who are dealing with a childhood tragedy, but this is again ruined by the lack of screen time these characters had to fully develop their stories. If the show really wanted to develop Menma, they could have made her story a lot more tragic and relatable by spending more time with her prior to her death instead, however this would again overshadow the main theme and development of all the other characters. Not only should Menma have less screen time, she should have been an actual hallucination since the fact that she is a real ghost completely eliminated everything intriguing about Jinta as a character. At the start of the show, Jinta blames his stress for ghost Menma appearing in his house which meant that Jinta was impacted enough by his childhood trauma to hallucinate about his dead friend. However as soon as it is revealed that ghost Menma is real, Jinta is no longer a broken teenager still stuck in the past, he is rather an irresponsible kid who uses his childhood tragedy as an excuse to be a hikikomori who doesn’t do anything but lay in his house all day. Of course people don’t have to experience hallucinations to deal with the loss of an important friend, however Jinta is around 15-16 years old in the story and, although not clear, Menma most likely died when he was around 10 years old. Since it has already been over 5 years since this tragedy, Jinta’s behaviors of self-isolation and hatred at the beginning of the show can only really be excused if he was emotionally scarred enough to have delusions of his childhood crush/friend to combat his own loneliness.

Even though it is always a good thing for a show to have a few different themes and messages, these secondary themes should never overshadow the primary messages of the series. However, the theme completely shifts to that of unrequited love in the second half of the show, which leads to my second and perhaps my biggest issue with this show. The problem is that when you look at the character arcs of nearly the entirety of the main cast, they are all about resolving their feelings of one-sided love and when you think about it a while longer, it becomes quite clear that these character arcs would have had literally the same outcome even if Menma did not die because besides Matsuyuki and maybe Jinta, Menma’s death barely impacted the other characters at all. Both Anjou and Tsurumi have the exact same boring character arc, they both need to get over the fact that they both love people who are in love with someone else. After they cried for the tenth time, they finally are able to deal with their feelings, however, their resolutions had absolutely nothing to do with Menma’s death. In fact, if Menma is still alive, the boys would have still been in love with her (perhaps even more so) and the girls would still need to go through the journey of overcoming unrequited love. Hisakawa (better known as Poppo) is the most useless character in the show, even though I liked his personality, Poppo exists only as a comedic relief who did not contribute anything to the overall plot or to other characters’ story arcs. The only development for poor Poppo is the show’s pathetic attempt at giving him a reason to cry in the last episode by making him reveal that he actually saw Menma die. This came out of absolutely nowhere and when the other characters practically ignored his comment and continued to cry, I almost burst out laughing while watching the complete absurdity of the scene.

I actually have a lot more to say about a few other things but since this review is becoming way too long I will only be giving a summary of my thoughts on two more things. The first thing is actually a positive opinion I have on the character of Matsuyuki. Even though he is not perfectly written, he is a good example of the potential this show had since this character is pretty much the only one who goes through actual character development that is related to the central theme of the show. Matsuyuki is the only character that is shown to be heavily impacted by the death of Menma. He is an extremely creepy character who cannot let go of the past and even dresses up like Menma, however, as the story progresses he starts to move on and learns something from his past mistakes. The second thing I want to discuss is the opposite of the previous point where I will talk about Menma’s mother (Irene Honma), who is the perfect example of what to avoid when writing a character. Irene is a grieving mother who becomes so traumatized by her daughter’s death that she becomes ignorant to those around her including her husband and son. However, the problem arises when she blames a bunch of kids for her own incompetence as a mother. She actually wishes that the kids (who were 10 years old at the time of Menma’s death) would also die because it is not fair for her daughter, the worst part of it is that she fails to even acknowledge any fault of her own even after the supposed “resolution” to her character arc. Irene is written as a flawed character, which is completely fine, however, she needs to be someone the viewers can also sympathize with to a certain degree in order for her character arc to be satisfying because she is not a villain. Since she has absolutely no redeeming factors as shown by the show, her character not only fails to portray grieving parents in a realistic way but also makes her story arc completely pointless.

Enjoyment - 5/10
It is no surprise that I didn’t enjoy this show. There were multiple times where I wanted to stop watching because I was so bored especially during the last few episodes. Since anything below a 5/10 in my rating system is a fail and Anohana was not entirely painful to watch, the show passes as just barely watchable for my entertainment purposes.

Summary
Anohana had so much potential to be great, but the end result is nothing but a gigantic disappointment. The best way to describe Anohana is that it is a show filled with poorly written character and story arcs, that strayed too far from the central theme, with some good ideas sprinkled in. When the show ended, the only thing that I felt was confusion about the point of the entire show and how a story about characters overcoming grief turned into characters crying together about completely different things. To be perfectly honest, the show probably deserves an even lower score than my rating, but the art and the music are so good that I actually felt bad giving it anything lower than a 60 percent. I would definitely not recommend anyone to watch Anohana unless you can closely relate to the story and characters or if you are a hardcore fan of romance and don't mind cheap melodrama."

Tokyo Ghoul is without a doubt one of the best series out there. The way it gives us the character development, story telling, world building and all just feels really really nice. It has been months since I watched the anime adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul and at that time, I was an anime-only. I jumped in the show without knowing what to expect, and I liked it. Then I watched the two other seasons and that was pretty much it, until I decided to read the manga to see how faithful the anime is to the source material, and MY GOD, I couldn't believe how BAD Tokyo Ghoul Root A is in terms of adapting the story and giving the audience what they need.

So first things first, this anime adaptation doesn't do the manga justice, at all. When we begin to watch the premiere of Root A, we jump right back where the first season left us, the aftermath of Kaneki's torture and the end of the battle between the CCG and Aogiri's Tree, alongside the ghouls from Anteiku. When Kaneki reunites with Tohka, he fights Ayato and... he apparently exchange some blows with him and that's it? No. This is wrong, wrong and wrong. In the manga, Kaneki proceeds to break literally HALF of Ayato's bones while even naming the bone he is breaking, like what? I didn't understand why this moment was taken off after I finished reading the first part of Tokyo Ghoul, and it just feels like Studio Clown didn't really care at that point. Then, after everything is done, Kaneki announces that he's going to join Aogiri's Tree, the same group that Jason was apart and Jason tortured him, so shouldn't he join the side with people that didn't want him to get abused? When I watched it at first, I thought that it was a little bit weird, but I didn't care that much, until I eventually read the manga and hear me out, it gets even crazier.

In the manga of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki says that he won't go back to Anteiku nor Aogiri but instead, he will create his own organization/camp to find what the hell happened to Rize, that girl that almost ate him alive in the beginning. What's even more funny is that he actually recruited some of his friends to help him in his cause, except for Tohka because he wanted her to stay at Anteiku with everyone else. At this point, Root A is a terrible adaptation and I don't think that it was a good idea to make Kaneki edgy as fck by making him join the people that captured him and rejecting all of his friends. From now on, everything was anime original and made no sense at all. It's just weird to see Kaneki as a bad guy when he was that cheerful person before getting tortured. Now, I know that his whole personality and ideology changed, but that's not a reason to become a bad guy because you want to protect your friends. Where is the logic in this type of mind set? His manga counterpart makes more sense because he isn't a bad guy nor a good guy, he's just the guy that does what he wants and what he wants is to find Rize. Now, I won't be explaining everything that Kaneki of Aogiri made in the manga since he only helped some ghouls evade and attacked Cochlea where he awakened his Kakuja, but just know that in the manga, the thing at Cochlea never happened and instead, it happened at Kanou's Lab. So, without further ado, I'm going to talk about the most frustrating parts of Root A, which is Hide's bad-written death and Kaneki vs Arima.

In the anime after Kaneki fought Amon Koutarou, one of my favorite characters by the way, he arrives at Anteiku where his bestie is waiting and tells him that he already knew he was a ghoul but that doesn't change their relationship. Then, I don't remember the events of the anime correctly, Hide dies. Yes, you heard me, he dies. His death was so anticlimactic and I don't understand why the writers killed him off in a totally not sad situation. Ok, I will admit that the acoustic version of unravel made it seem a little bit ""sad"" but that's it. Now if we compare this to the manga, it's a way way different story. In the manga, the wound that Amon gives to Kaneki isn't healing and he's literally about to die, when his best friend Hide appears and tells him: ""Heyo bro, just eat me and go fight Arima real quick"", which is why his face looks that way it did in :re. The thing is that Root A really screwed all of the anime-only's since when they watched :re, they didn't understand what was going on with everyone since they thought it would explain the aftermath of the events of Root A, but no. Everything just felt wacky and the anime should have included the fight between Arima and Kaneki so the anime watchers would understand why Kaneki has amnesia in :re.

Overall, Tokyo Ghoul Root A failed to deliver us a sequel for the first season and because of that, I decided to change my rating of it from 7 to 5."
20992,"This anime is by far one of the best I've watched, next to Kuroko no Basket and Big Windup, which hooked me up on sports anime in the first place. I first came across this anime on a top ten list on youtube; this 
anime being number one on that list. I figured I'd give it a try and see what it's about, but after one episode I fell in love with it and couldn't turn it off... That is until I got to season two episode nine.
Haikyuu is very energetic and fun to watch as well as it always keeps me on the edge of my seat and unable to tell who is going to win or lose the match in the end;  which is new to me because most of the others I've watched I could easily tell if they would win or lose. The characters are refreshing and funny to watch, especially the expressions. Even some of the quiet and normally indifferent characters turn out to be likeable after a while, such as the manager, Shimizu and Tsukishima the other spiker.  Though it would still be hinata and kageyama 
who are my favorite characters due to their clashing personalities and extreme rivalry/ friendship.
And while I usually don't like when the anime focuses on other characters for an episode or two, I found that I didn't mind it all here, in fact I rather enjoyed it. 
Lastly, and I think the most important thing, is the rivalries. Now I know every sports anime has this, however to me it feels like Haikyuu took it a step further.  The anime I watched had the traditional rivalry 
where the main characters or characters would keep training to get stronger just to surpass their rivals (and miracously after a couple of practice matches and training they would do so almost easily); however,  
with this anime  The rivalries were also friendships formed by the teams. Like even though they were on different teams the more developed teams still helped Karasuno develop their skills after practicing against them, as well as giving some of the teammates individual help to make them stronger as a player. Not to mention how when they weren't playing against each other they were shown actually hanging out with their rivals and being really friendly towards each other. 
This is defiantly one of those few anime that I hope will go on for a long time, and even then will still be sad to see it end. On my top ten anime to watch list this will no doubt be number one."
15809,"Devil is a Part-Timer is an Isekai that has wonderful charm and profound value, especially in today’s standard of what an Isekai is. It takes what it does best and just runs with it. For the countless few that have yet to see this hidden gem this is worth the pick up and more.

Dropping literal Satan in a McDonalds setting is arguably a very high risk in introducing the show. So how the heck does this work so well in the 13 episode season?! Comedy. Absolute and wonderful comedy. A hard worker that is as dense as a board, he interacts with the rest of the crew in such a upbeat and determined demeanour that it becomes natural to the viewer that this is just a manager managing a fast food chain. 



We get dropped in a very contrasting sequence in the beginning that has pitted demons and angels against one-another. It becomes increasingly obvious that a winner is imminent and the two mains of Satan and Alciel must retreat (portal to our world) to regroup and come back with a vengeance to take back their world. The concept is fantastically written. Demons (males) and angels (females) coexist in this alternate world as normal everyday people. Poor, desperate and contempt on facets of a higher purpose, the mains of Satan and Alciel just go about their lives with optimism and intent. What they don’t know is that from their past battle and reason for coming to our world, they’ve been followed by their enemy, Emilia. What makes this comedy gold is how Emilia gets stuck in such a similar situation that their worlds conveniently collide in comedic fashion, to the point of Emilia actually living with them.

Interactions with such polarizing characters can backfire quite easily, yet in Part-Timer the injection of comedic absurdity elevates the Isekai to fantastic results. Emilia is forced to work as a call centre agent. While Satan doesn’t mind that Emilia is here to kill her, his personality since coming to Japan has turned. He’s a much more open and caring individual which sets off some alarming bells to Emilia, who is essentially just there to kill him. This show of kindness really makes Emilia question what their previous battle was even about, why Satan being here has changed him, and when she does get back to her world, on how she'll even do so if she doesn't kill her archenemy.

Other characters in the show, Crestia, Chiho and Rika provide some balanced roles in their time with the demi-gods. Completely oblivious to the fact of what they are, feelings of friendship and comradry are seen here. These band of misfits have their moments and despite some filler episodes, their roles show strength. Battle sequences here are top notch. Fluid, dynamic and fantastically animated, both climax scenes as well as the hilarious ‘battle’ against Sentucky Fried Chicken is fantastic in its execution. 

Sadly, like with many obscure animes, the chance of a second season is almost zero here. This story definitely feels incomplete. Character development obviously stalls, characters we have yet to meet in the manga that are pivotal are ghosts. You’ve heard of this before. “Read the manga”. If you have any positive feelings after watching this, please do. It’s a fantastic anime that leaves a lot to be desired, yet the overall execution warrants a great sequel that unfortunately we'll never have.

If you are a fan of any Isekai, you have an obligation to try this show. Memorable characters that seem powerful but are rarely the case, glimmers of fantastic world-building hampered by the infamous second season hell hiatus, Devil is a Part-Timer is an original Isekai, and seeing how that weird sentence does not work in 2020, proves that this rarity is a lovely gem of a find.

131681,"Attack On Titan The Final Season Part 2 is way worse than I initially imagined. Jesus. I mean, I knew that the story was going to be bad and filled with plot conveniences and poorly written moments because I've read ahead in the manga after The Final Season Part 1. I also knew that the characters in AoT would continue to be shit (like they always have been) and mainly used as plot conveniences with a single and repeating character trait, rather than becoming actual fleshed-out characters who are supposed to be and behave like humans. But, at the very least I expected the animation to improve. Sadly it is still just as bad as it was in The Final Season Part 1, if not worse. While I never had high expectations for Attack On Titan, especially after Season 3 Part 2, I always thought it would at least be a visually stunning show to watch. This of course is no longer the case after The Final Season Part 1, since as we all know, MAPPA did one of the worst possible adaptations I've ever seen, with some absolutely horrendous CGI and, at times, little to no movement / animation with lots of grotesque looking and poorly drawn stills (I've included examples below, but we will get to that later). But... at the end of the day I could somewhat excuse that (emphasis on the word ""somewhat"", because personally something that looks this bad isn't excusable at all, but anyway) because the shitty animation in The Final Season Part 1 was probably due to time constraints, tight schedules, constant pressure from the producers, bad management, overworked employees etc. So when The Final Season Part 2 was announced for 2022 and after taking consideration that the studio would at the very least have more time on their hands work on this season and properly animate it, I expected a huge improvement in terms of visuals. Sadly when I started watching it, not only was I disappointed, but I was just plain shocked. 



The Final Season Part 2 not only managed to be only slightly better than an average PowerPoint presentation you see by a not so diligent student in high school, but at some points it also has even less ""movement"" and ""animation"" compared to The Final Season Part 1 (which already had almost non existent animation to begin with), with like 80% of each episode being still images with only a character's mouth moving up and down. This is what we call animation nowadays folks. There are even several (and I really do mean several) times where there is literally no animation and a single badly drawn still image just... hangs in there for 5-10 seconds with literally nothing happening at all animation-wise, apart from a random-ass narration from a character in the background. Hell, a lot of the time there isn't even any dialogue during those stills, directly implying that they were just hastily added in there as ""fillers"" just to be able to hit that 20 minute run time each episode needs to fulfill. It really seems like they couldn't find anything else to put (or they didn't have the time, or they didn't ever bother to add something of importance) and they just said ""fuck it, just fill the rest of the episode with a PowerPoint presentation made for free by my 12 year old nephew, I have seen The Promised Neverland S2, they did something similar, why shouldn't we?"". But I digress. Most of the art and the faces of characters keep looking as if they are ""melting"", like they were drawn in one of those ""guess the drawing"" games where you have like a minute to draw something and the other people have to guess what it is. While those who suffer the most from this are the faces of background characters, that doesn't necessarily exclude the faces of main characters at the front of the screen, making some stills from the anime look like someone spilled some water over the drawings and then decided it was okay to include them into the final product. Sadly this problem just keeps getting worse and worse with each episode and by the time I got to episode 10 the problem was so bad that I now genuinely struggle to think of another popular and generally well-liked anime with worse animation than Attack On Titan. This anime (or ""season/part"", whatever you want to call it) in general had an abysmal production in terms of art and animation and people who say that MAPPA did as good of a job as WIT ""but they have a different style"" are just objectively wrong. The only thing that's (barely) keeping this from falling below the 1/10 mark in my eyes was some RARE but genuinely good background art, the arguably great voice acting, a short but nicely animated/directed sequence in episode 11 and episode 3. But those episodes, which in general were kinda decent (?), let's say like a 4/10 in terms of quality were a welcome, but in general pretty insignificant surprise in an otherwise abysmally ugly looking written show.



Those screenshots were mainly taken from episodes 10 / 11, because it was at that point where I decided that I was going to make this review and I haven't started taking screenshots of the episodes yet because I had no reason to other than to laugh at them. Of course that doesn't mean that those are the only ones though, I have many more but I decided to spare your eyes from those abominations. And for those who are going to say ""oh you just took some zoomed-in screenshots and you think that's bad animation? Of course characters in the background are going to look a bit sketchy"" I'd like to tell you that these screenshots are not zoomed in, nor freeze-frames during intense action scenes (well, apart from that Armin face one, that was just way too hilarious not to include). Those images filled the whole screen and they were probably there for several seconds with little to no animation or a change in scenery or camera angles, making them inexcusable for... questionably one of the best, but arguably one of the most influential anime of all time.

Keep in mind btw that all those screenshots came from the last 3 episodes (this is around the time when I decided I'd make this review) and I caught ALL THOSE animation errors and/or badly drawn stills while watching on 2x speed. The amount of atrociously bad stills and animation errors in this sad excuse of an anime probably far exceeds what I can show you here (I will never forget, for example, that LITERALLY 50 SECONDS OF A STILL IMAGE OF A FOREST exist in the middle of episode 9 if I'm remembering right. Talk about being lazy).



I could also go on and on about the characters and how badly I believe they are written / developed, but that's mostly a problem that began from the very first season and carried throughout the series, so it's not necessarily this season's fault. Although one could argue that it actually is this season's fault for not trying (or trying but failing) to fix its characters and their issues. Eren continues to be an extremely edgy and predictable Lelouch copycat, Mikasa continues to be basically a simp for Eren throughout the series, with this being her one and only personality trait since season one (""wow she is such a great character and the best written female character ever :0""), Gabi still is one of the worst written and most annoying characters in anime history, with her presence in the anime being completely forced and unnecessary since the time she was introduced, her ""friendship"" (lmao I can't believe I'm saying this for a person she actively tried to fucking kill) with the blond haired chick who I fail to recall the name of is still one of the most braindead writing decisions I've seen in my life. Also because I keep hearing this, no, she never was a uniquely written character, that ""oh I used to hate the other side but now I kinda get them"" thing has been done to death, if you think that's original then you just haven't seen enough anime/shows/series), Armin continues to be that irrelevant ""friendship above all"" character each anime seems to need for some reason and like Mikasa this seems to be his only personality trait for the entire series, like a fucking robot that's programmed to only act that way, and lastly Reiner continues to be that lucky bastard who literally can't die for plot convenience purposes. Motherfucker could have a nuclear bomb dropped and explode on top of him and the show would still pull some bullshit reason on how he would, could and should, survive. Fans of the show will say that ""if you pay attention to the plot you would understand why him surviving makes sense"", but I'd argue that's mostly the plot ""bending"" itself and developing in a way to make Reiner live, instead of the opposite. Reiner is the literal personified definition of a plot convenience, but I digress... The rest of the character cast is either completely forgettable and irrelevant (that bold guy for example, Connie I believe was his name?) or just straight up extremely annoying and unlikable (Hange for example, like seriously who even likes her?), and the only 2 good characters in the show are either dead (Erwin, AoT's only great character imo) or... for-some-stupid-plot-armory-reason-not-dead-despite-having-a-fucking-explosion-go-off-right-in-front-of-them (Levi).



For similar reasons I won't go into detail about the story. What started off as a cool idea quickly turned into a plot armor/ plot hole shit-show around Season 3 Part 2 (since the whole Reiner getting his fucking head blown off but still surviving and Armin being burnt to a crisp, turning into charcoal but... still surviving enough time to be given the titan fluid...?) and The Final Season Part 2 is certainly no exception. Everything in this season feels like it was introduced as a way to fix some previously obvious plot holes (paths for example) only to make them even worse and create even more plot holes on the way, rather than actually being part of the story from the start and the whole thing ""coming together"" in a ""big and grandiose reveal"" or whatever. The whole attack on titan storyline as a whole has become more and more of a jumbled mess rather than a normal, coherent and well-written story and it gets worse and worse with each installment. Things happen only to shock us but then they are revealed to be not so important (Armin """"""""""dying"""""""""" again), huge battles happen with literally no casualties for our main boisss (Mikasa killing like... 1000 people in ep 11 without having a single scratch YAAAAS SLAY QUEEEN img20() ) because suddenly we are not watching humans battle each other, we are watching a God amongst men fighting pure mortals, throwing the viewers suspension of disbelief out the window for like the 11th time in this series, and blah blah blah you get the point... But then again, those are problems that AoT always had, especially from Season 3 Part 2, so I can't really pretend to suddenly care more about them in The Final Season Part 2.



I never really cared which anime is considered to be ""the best"" by the community, but Attack on Titan is by far the least deserving of that title. Not because I personally hate it and because I'm ""a mindless hater who hates popular stuff to get attention"" as some people will claim, but because it's an objectively bad show. Definitely animation-wise, although I could argue that it's also bad character-wise, as well as story-wise, because it has some objective problems with its writing in those aspects, like plot holes and non-sensical character motivations. But at the same time Attack On Titan is an action show, so I consider those problems to affect my enjoyment of the show way more than that of a normal action-loving viewer who just turns their brain off and just watches the show for how hot and cool Mikasa and Eren are. I don't care about such stuff, I'm here for the story and the animation. In my eyes, over the past few years and especially after MAPPA took over its production, Attack on Titan has become a genuinely bad show that is not only outclassed by literally every other critically acclaimed anime I can think of, but it has also become worse than most generic memed-to-shit isekai ""trash"" like sword art online (which at the very least had some minor improvements in terms of it's storytelling over the years, plus some amazing animation) and is comparable in terms of quality with shit like the ""milf isekai"" and the ""smartphone isekai"". Just like those anime are still milking the isekai cash cow that SAO created, Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 feels like a genuine cash grab to capitalize on a craze that it, itself created a decade ago, albeit with a different studio. A craze that was created by itself, way back in 2013. It has now become the lowest of the low when it comes to manga adaptations for profit. A blatant copy-paste of the (already kind of average looking) manga panels with little-to-no creative / artistic input and alterations to make it more suitable for an anime format. Taking the manga panels, coloring them and then making that into an anime is NOT a good and creative way of doing things and NOT a sign of ""a great and faithful adaptation"" as many people (falsely) claim, it is something even an amateur animator can do. A real masterpiece is when the anime adaptation elevates the original source material to new heights and makes things that were originally impossible in a manga format, possible through the medium of animation. Something that truly transcends the source material. A true masterpiece isn't merely ""faithful to the manga"". And The Final Season Part 2 is far from a good adaptation, let alone a masterpiece. MAPPA's version of Attack on Titan is for me one of the biggest failures I've seen in anime adaptations ever.



I know I will get a lot of hate for this review and I don't really care. I think it's stupid to be like ""well, what I believe about this show is vastly different from the general consensus, so I won't talk about it"" etc. I genuinely hate this show. I genuinely believe it is objectively subpar. I'm tired of pretending it's not just because the community thinks otherwise. I would even go as far as to say that I genuinely believe it sets an extremely bad precedent for every anime sequel that is set to air and come out after this one. It proves that hype itself is enough to carry a show to ""greatness"", not actual talent, work, creativity etc. Just take some already successful manga, colour its panels, turn that into the most creativity-starved anime, hire some great voice actors so that we seem legit and we're good to go. When The Way of the Househusband did exactly that everyone got mad, but when ""The best anime of all-time"" does it it's ""cool"" and ""MAPPA did a better job than WIT because it's a more faithful adaptation than that of WIT's"" or some other bullshit. I feel like concepts like ""creativity"", ""passion"" and ""innovation"" in the anime industry are dying and Attack on Titan is partially the reason why; if not, then it's definitely the reason this mindset and work ethic is becoming more and more prevalent. It should be common sense that overworked animators, directors (etc...) with extremely tight schedules can't make a solid product. Attack on Titan is probably the best (or worst, depending on how you see it) example of this that I've seen in my 5 years of anime-watching."

Have you ever felt like a character is not blessed with a situation where they can make the most of their talents? You feel like the character is super interesting and has potential but they're never satisfyingly used by the narrative. Well, that's how I used to feel, not towards a character but towards a story as a whole: Jujutsu Kaisen. 

What I felt was indifference: I perfectly understood why people liked it and it should've been a story I loved myself yet I felt like it didn't take any risks and I couldn't fully feel involved with its stakes concurrently.
In reality, it was simply due to my preferences and tastes but, after experiencing the Hidden Inventory & The Shibuya incident arc, I realized the root of all evil: Gojo. This little goofball plainly existing was one of my biggest hold back from  wholly being immersed in JJK.

His sealing is the best event that occured in the story and this is what I'm going to demonstrate in this review.





Hidden's Inventory Arc: THE DESACRALIZATION OF GOJO

Gojo is 'perfect'. He was born with the six-eyes which gives him access to high levels of understanding capacity and analyzation. Both as a sorcerer and as a human being, he 'stands above others'. His mere birth caused the world to change and blah blah blah. Point is, all these factors made him a problem narratively wise. The first obvious one would be that he's broken: his ability quite litteraly being infinity, he could easily overpower any antagonist in the series (in S1, keep in mind) which can undermine the stakes for the viewers. Another thing, which was my personnal issue, is that it made him appear flat as a character. It was always hinted that his conflict resided in his loneliness, his infinite barrier being a metaphor for the distance between him and other characters. And his will for the sorcerer 'society' to change without him simply having to kill everyone (geto vibes) added depht to his motives but... If I'm being honest, these were treated as sub-sub-plots. His main characterization throughout season 1 was him being cool and confident. I could also add to the list that he 'stole the show' but that's a little bit too silly, even for me.

The Hidden Inventory Arc made me realize that what could have been interpretated as 'flaws' was just something called 'build up'



Toji is an impressive antagonist. Despite his little screentime, he managed to become memorable due to his characterization made only possible by his opponent: He is the first character to ever beat Satoru. And boy, what a beating. I never thought I'd see Gojo arboring such panicked facial expressions. I like how Toji's insane speed was symbolized by the fact that we ourselves as viewers weren't ablet to see him. Not only did it add to his characterization but it also put us at 'the same level' as Gojo. For the first time, we were not viewers meant to simply be amazed by Gojo's powers and confidence but we were his equals, sharing his fears and distress. His terrible loss taught us that he wasn't invulnerable. (Later on, he improves his technique which pretty much makes him invulnerable but keep in mind that I'm talking about how it affected our perception him as viewers).

This fight also put in perspective the ideology of Gojo. We're reminded of his discourse with Geto in the first episode of the season. While Geto thought that it was the strong duty to protect the weak, Gojo was displeased with the idea of placing moral obligation on the concept of strenght. If you are strong, you are strong, if you are weak, you are weak. Only the weak would put restrictions and morals upon the strong to justify their own weakness and existence. Which makes sense because in a world ruled by the law of the strongest, the weaks have no right to live. Edgy, but that sums it up. That's the meaning behind that goofy braindestroyer quote ""Are you Gojo Satoru because you're the strongest or are you the strongest because you're Gojo Satoru"" that could also be phrased as ""Did you earn the title of the strongest or were you simply born as such?"" as well as ""Does being the strongest define you or are you the one typifying it?""... Well, you get the gist of it. The point of this quote is to question the nature of the cause of Gojo's identity and strenght. Innate or acquired? Inevitable or preventable?

How will a guy that made such bold statements about the strong and the weak react when he's put in a situation where he's outbested?



GOJO AS BUDDHA AND TOJI AS SUN WUKONG

This might be common knowledge at this point but Toji versus Gojo round 2 is a tribute to/inspired by the tale of Sun WuKong and Buddha. Sun WuKong is the chinese trickster god also known as Monkey King that inspired many characters such as Goku, Luffy, Mori-Jin etc. He represents human's unbreakable spirit against fatality. He became insanely powerful but his negative emotions such as his greed, anger and pride led him to challenge Buddha, the 'awakened'. Buddha made a bet with him. The Monkey King was to win and claim the Jade Emperor was he able to escape the palm of Buddha's hand. Sun Wukong jumped and flew to the end of the world. Seeing nothing but five pillars, the Monkey King thought he had finally reached the far reaches of the universe. He returned triumphantly to Buddha only to find out that the five pillars were Buddha's fingers and that he never even left his palm.

We can see many correlations with Jujutsu Kaisen. Firstly, similarly to Sun WuKong, Toji is himself a man who fought fatality. From the day he was born his fate was sealed and his value as a human was already decided, yet he refused his predestination and became the strongest Zen'in despite not having any cursed energy. He's ridiculously strong but three things led him to fight the awakened Gojo. One, his anger. The anger he felt when kid Gojo noticed him despite of all the things he had to go through to become invisible to the eyes of sorceres. Two, his ego. As he said it himself, he would've normally just made a run for it upon seeing the awakened Gojo. His job was done and he would've gained nothing by continuing the fight yet his pride didn not allow him to retreat. Three, his greed. His greedy will for getting back on the sorcerer world by killing their greatest asset, proving his worth, got the better of him. His sacrificed his 'true self' because of his negative emotions.

On the other hand, Gojo got rid of his negative emotions (/took complete control over it), becoming imprenetable and transcending his human nature, attaining a higher state of consciousness, making him almost omniscient, in peace with himself and the world surrounding him. As if he was at the center of the universe, unleashing the true power of his sixth eye, throughout heavens and earth, he alone became the honoured one. As he said himself, he no longer felt any sadness nor anger towards Riko's death, he was simply in a state where his omniscience made him perceive everything and nothing all at once. This is an obvious allegory to Buddha when he reached Nirvanna. It is a place of perfect peace and happiness, like heaven. It is a state of enlightenment, meaning a person's individual desires and suffering go away as well as any negative mental states. Gojo killing Toji wasn't an act of malice but simply the consequence of Toji's actions. Gojo simply followed the 'laws of the universe' rather than his mere will. Toji who tried to denied his determinism was nothing but a monkey in the hand of Gojo embodying determinism itself (in a positive light). And the pillars he mistook for his way to freedom were the pillars that'd encage him against this inevitable truth and his demise. This can get too theoretical so I'll leave it there but I think the scene was very much understandable anyways.



GOJO'S AND GETO'S DUALITY

While fighting Toji made Gojo realize his place in the universe, Geto's defeat against Toji and Rika's death caused him the greatest of existential crisis. 'Taking in a cursed spirit is like swallowing the liquid of a rag that has just absorbed vomit'. Geto sacrificed himself for 'regular' humans. He had to bear all sorts of disgusting things for their sake only to find himself surrounded by them being overjoyed over the death of a little girl. What was he fighting for? He reaches a non-turning point after having massacred an entire vilage, including his parents, because the villagers had plans to execute two little girls for attracting demons. In reality, these girls were just more sensible to seeing cursed spirit. Not only are 'regular' humans the technical cause of all cursed spirit but they also put the blame on the only humans capable of saving them. Geto started to hate humans or as he likes to call them 'monkeys' (he's not beating the allegations I'm afraid).

On the other hand, Gojo starts to developp a similar ideology to pre-Rika's death Geto. When the two of them confront each other and Geto breaks up with Gojo, the 'supremacy' of Gojo is once again questioned. Gojo could figuratevely see everything but the depression of his closest friend. This made me wonder, what does Gojo truly sees? What he wants to see. He believe he found his place in the universe but that's only as the one and only center of it. He knows that in a world without cursed spirit, the basis itself of his authority would be shaken off. Without the weak to protect, Gojo would have no identity as he was basically born to defeat curses.  The gojobeinggojobecausehe'sstrongandthegojobeingstrongbecausehe'sgojo really does come in play here. Gojo's strenght is only justifiable due to curses existing just as Geto's plan wouldn't seem that unreasonable if he was as powerful as Gojo. 

From a cool-factor merchant to a layered character (thats also a complex philosophical allegory for Buddha lmao), Gojo's 'departure' started from here. One could argue his awakening sacralizes him but to me, seeing him struggle and fail to understand his friend is more view-changing about Gojo than the awakening scene. We already saw him as some sort of superior existence in the story, knowing that he attained this power through an harsh defeat makes him more human to my eyes.



The Shibuya Incident Arc: A WORLD WITHOUT GOJO



I'm going to keep this section short and concise. Similarly to All Might in MHA, Gojo was the best thing that could happen to society as his precence alone was enough to dissuade bad things from happening and he is powerful enough to wipe the vast majority of dangerous cursed spirits. The downside is that the sorcerer society relied too much on him. The moment he's gone, Japan turns into an actual nightmare. He prevented nasty things from happening but he also prevented the growth of the rest of the cast. As long as there was Gojo around, sorcerers would never be pushed passed their limits which is essential to improve on their cursed energy handling. Although I think Gojo 'stealing the show' being a problem is easily refutable there's still a good case to be made about him preventing Yuji from taking the spotlight. His sealing allowed Yuji to grow as a character, figuratively, because his motives changed and he got huge developments and litteraly, because it allowed him to be part of some of the most iconic scenes of the story (WHERE YOU GO I GOOOO).

!Additional notes: I love the art direction of season 2 to death. I have an obsession with drawings that 'simplify' things while keeping the accuracy of the thing itself. If you compare some of the shots image to image with season 1, you might think season 1 is superior but you can't compare a still image to an actual animation. What I'm saying is that season 1 looked good and had insane wallpaper use potential but animation is motion, it's not meant to be watched as a frame but as an overall clip. Due to Mappa's horrendous management, the latest episodes weren't as polished as the earlier ones but I honestly do not care about the downgrades, this is cinema.
I particularly like Hidden's Inventory arc for turning JJK into Jujutsumonogatari. The art isn't just a tool to convey the story anymore. It's the story. 
img500(v)
I adore this scene because it puts so much emphasis on both characters. Despite having long bodies, Geto distorts his back (he's just like me) and keep himself low which serves as good characterization and Gojo is relatable af. As someone as tall Gojo I swear to you that I do not know what to do with my legs and my arms sometimes. You can feel he has to carry his own weight by the way he walks but he still keeps himself high which perfectly embodies him. Not only is it funny and nice from an art persepective but it's also realistical despite the exaggeration.
The anime did a great job in Yuji vs Choso. They found the perfect way to make Choso's power understandble through visuals alone and they pulled an Ufotable by adding numerous actions scenes into the fight while still being coherent with the source material. The tone of the anime as a whole is a success.!



You probably got it by now but Gojo is a sort of metaphor I used in order to talk about my appreciation for Jujutsu Kaisen, in S1 he had less depth but he had the potential to be great and this was basically my opinion of JJK. With Hidden's Inventory arc, the characterization of Gojo changed, making him much more intersting to me and this is also where I started to be fascinated by this story. I started to absolutely love JJK right when he got sealed the f#ck away (take it as you please lmao). Figuratively speaking, to me, Gojo being sealed is like the 'old' JJK being sealed away, the jjk with stakes that didn't work for me, the jjk that was a relatively safe story to let a new, fresh one appear. A tragedic story about grief, loss and despair mixed with the well known nekketsu shounen formula and a colorful cast that I love dearly."

The anime of My Hero Academia season 5 is over and already a few people are muttering about how the sixth season will be adapted. I personally believe that since the MVA arc was concluded in season 5, the sixth season will finally bring the entire Paranormal Liberation War arc.

What I'm sorry to say, is that this season has been a disappointment of an adaptation. I am a lover of the series, in fact I caught up with the manga and it is one of my favorites on the list, but although that, I have not been able to appreciate this season.

The first part of the series, which is the one dedicated to the joint training arc, was extended as long as possible, the episodes lasted a lot, half of them were summaries, and they felt like fillers. Then, I don't understand why, but bones decided to mix the Villain Academia arc with the Endeavor training arc, a fatal mistake, which after about 16 episodes of Joint Training arc, was left neglected. I can understand that it was important to develop all the characters in order to ensure a more solid future for the series, but to do that, they created something beyond boring, ended up developing too much unnecessary characters, and neglecting the MVA arc.

Long story short, what we saw was a my villain academia arc that has been badly adapted, overlooked, and in some parts skipped due to bad adaptation pacing.
We have been more than patient, and during the series I have done nothing but repeat to myself ""now comes the best"", when in reality nothing good has arrived, because when it really came it was either neglected or postponed.

What's positive about this season is, as always from bones, a beautiful and stunning animation that constantly pulls up the series, a great cast for the dub of the scenes, which I remember improving a lot of the part where Deku gets his Black whip, and listenable ost, leaving out the openings that are more based on personal tastes.

The only time this season really surprised me was when Shigaraki had his backstory and his awakening. It felt well adapted, no censoring, really good ost and dub, and as always, a great animation. Those two episodes really hit me, and were the best episode in this season. But that wasn't enough to fill the precedent mistakes.

Beyond that, the season has been a disappointment for many of BNHA's fans, a felt-rushed experience that actually ""ruined"" the manga, and certainly has given a critical hit to anyone who wasn't a fan of the series. Personally, I hope people who didn't like this season will take a look at season six as well, because if they adapt it how it needs to be, it will definitely be the peak of BNHA.

I highly recommend to those who want to see a better version of what happened this season to read the manga, because it is definetely more fluent and paced better than this."
97986,"I cannot say many anime have made me bawl like a  child but I am proud to say this one has. Made In Abyss was an emotional ride for me. Filled with moments that made me smile and uplift my soul and dreadful truths that sunk my heart into temporary but shocking depression. I don't believe in the inane three episode rule because it is completely subjective. An arbitrary limiter put on a show is stupid and if you want to stick to a show until the 300th episode to see if it gets any good that is entirely your prerogative. However, that rule is perfect for this show because the first three episodes work like an introduction to an epic and it is completely mesmerizing. It hooks you by showing you the world through the eyes of likable characters, specifically Riko and Regu. Riko is a young girl who wants to venture out into a deep pit that means certain death accompanied by her robot friend, Regu. Riko wants to travel deep into the abyss because of the possibility of meeting up with her Mother, a proud white whistle and her natural curiosity that is deeply rooted in her genuine character. Regu, curious about his origin he also delves into the abyss because he wants answers that only the deep dark pit can answer, and their very adorable relationship will keep you invested. Even the supporting characters that we will not see much of like Nat and the rest of the kids are well written. Their motivations are clear and they have depth and that is all I can really ask for.  The animation is top notch. It consistently reminds me of a Ghibli film. You are completely invested in the world because the artwork is great. From the landscapes that make up the city surrounding the abyss to the abyss itself, it is beautiful. The sense of danger is imminent and I can greatly I appreciate that aspect. This review is sort of half-assed but I just needed to get my brief opinions out there. I give this a 5/5 because it did everything well. Made In Abyss, in my eyes is a masterpiece."
20920,"The  plot of the show is very interesting and intriguing and there is much to be learned there but the anime keeps that all in the backburner for the course of the 12 episodes. Unfortunately this leads to poor world building in general. Normal answers about the world are left vague or unanswered which makes the environment seem small and uninteresting ! why the gods left, where exactly are they? why are all the gods in one area? is this city the only one in the world? ! 

The characters of the show are normal. The show features a harem-light aspect which means there are too many female characters and not enough time to develop any of them to a significant degree. What their motivations are, their intentions, their purposes. It's all left mostly to the imagination of the viewer as the cast more appropriately resembles a cast of generic tropes for your basic shipping needs. Some of them, such as Ain - the main love interest present no actual character traits. She is without expression, does nothing really interesting and the show only hints about some kind of depth but it leaves her overall bland. The MC on the other hand is very lovable and wholesome. The kind of idiotic blind trust that we'd all love to have.

Without a tangible or really interesting goal, it's hard to find the motivation to watch the show sometimes. Why does the protagonist do what he is doing? Why is the villain doing what they are doing? What is the end goal of going into dungeons to fight when it presents no threat to the people of the city? What do the gods get from all this? It's all up to you to decide. I hope the show can find a more linear setting to advance the plot and perhaps add a goal so we can truly feel the characters evolve and move with purpose.

The designs are cute. Nothing special. Mostly generic character designs. The soundtrack and songs were all enjoyable to watch but nothing special. The animation was quite fun to watch too, especially during action sequences but I'm not very nitpicky with these stuff.

- World Building: 5/10
- Central plot: 6/10
- Characters: 6/10 

Some semblance of a plot is there but it remains confused about its purpose and goal. Characters don't really see much development. There are some exceptions of very interesting characters that did receive some depth but mostly everyone sticks to their traits. 

The environment is quite bland and boring and the show gives no information about the backstory of the world, or it's rules, or anything really. Hopefully that changes in the next seasons because the show did seem like it wanted to explore that further but it's quite hard with only 12 episodes.

 There is a little bit to enjoy for everyone but since it tries to appeal to so many people, some stuff just isn't universal. The show has some troubling quotes - that is a man's duty to peep or that it's normal to kiss or touch women when they're asleep, and I know some people might get mad I'm mentioning this but that's just not cool. In general and to be included in this show with this kind of MC. It isn't major for me but it did knock off a few points. That being said, it's still a fun show - the characters are likeable, the idea is intriguing and it has plenty of chances to develop it's plot and characters more."
20832,"I started Overlord with a bit of pessimism as I wasn't convinced with the synopsis offered on any anime website. But, a friend of mine finally convinced me to take a closer look.  To be honest, I started the series with no expectations. The first episode wasn't too interesting, but I was ready to give it a chance as it was highly acclaimed both on MyAnimeList as well as here.

The second episode was when I noticed the awesome Intro music by OxT . I planned to stay with the series as it started to gain a foothold. The third episode finally delivered as it was packed to the brim with breath taking action sequences. After a very slow start during which I was having second thoughts, I was finally hooked to the anime in the third episode.

The best character in the entire series would certainly be Narbereal Gamma who single-handedly defeats two skeletal dragons with utmost ease. She was the shining light of the battle in the Dark Warrior Arc and would definitely be my MVP in the entire season. I can't wait to see more of her next season. I also found Nphirea Balear to be intriguing and expect him to play a major role in the upcoming season.

i felt that the character development of all the Guardians wasn't up to the mark as some of them didn't get much screen time (maybe that will change in the second season).  Some episodes felt a bit too hollow with nothing interesting except for the ending. Despite all these drawbacks, the story still acts as a strong point and I would gladly watch Season 2 which is going to be a lot better!"

Oh shit. I mixed the things up, I already reviewed this [show](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace). What was I supposed to be reviewing then??? It was a fairly nonsensical show that annoyed me to no end, had ridiculous gore, and had this supposedly serious plot that drove me up a fucking wall but I'm forgetting the name of it. To be honest, I could see why I mixed it up with that one... but what was the title???

img440()

Oh no. To punish my act of heresy the umbrellas have been sent out to strike me down via """"""""""""""unfortunate accident"""""""""""""". But before I am executed by the eldritch umbrella lords that reign in the dark realms, I shall make an effort to review that which shall not be named. The very first anime that I watched and ended up having an OVERWHELMINGLY negative opinion on all around. But also I wasn't aware of even what the show was before starting it and also as a horror fan, the impact it left on me was even worse as a result.

ANOTHER. That's the title. I don't know how I forgot it since I've been wanting to rag on review this show ever since I watched it a year ago. So much that I bought the novel (didn't read it) and rewatched it AGAIN (only partially) just to fully remember how much it's just so... incomprehensibly ANOTHER.









The more lighthearted and bluntly comical aspects of these reviews I do aside, a Ranpo Kitan comparison right out of the gate may seem pretty harsh or even over the top. There certainly may be some similarities, but they are still also apples and oranges. 

Ranpo Kitan is a very, VERY loose take on a [certain writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdogawaRanpo)'s works pushed to the absolute max limits of absurdity. No, of course I'm not going to write a completely serious and drawn out review of a show that just straight up starts out with a 14 year old girl turned serial killer because she wanted her serial killer teacher to kill her and then TURN HER INTO A CHAIR. NOT JUST ANY CHAIR, BUT HIS CHAIR. Because even if that show ends up developing a ""serious plot"" beyond that point, it's safe to assume that it's simply more absurdity, and yes it was.

ANOTHER on the other hand, is a firm adaptation of an actual novel by [Yukito Ayatsuji](https://anilist.co/staff/106882/YukitoAyatsuji) and is more than not, faithful and serious to the source material, brought to us by [P.A. Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/PAWorks) who also made [Glasslip](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip) (to be fair they also made [Shirobako](https://anilist.co/anime/20812/Shirobako) and [Uchouten Kazoku](https://anilist.co/anime/17909/UchoutenKazoku) which are GOOD). Therefore, while it's pretty absurd itself, I'm more inclined to criticize this show more seriously than I was with Ranpo Kitan which I guess is... something. But still while I may have watched shows that are technically worse than ANOTHER, I have not watched anything else that has made me so grumpy that I've been writing a review for it in my head for like over a year.

I guess this is my way of saying this review is going to be a fucking mess to both write as well as read because I'm going to address every single point I have about this goddamned show. Actually, let's do a table of contents just to be safe. Anime reviews shouldn't need those, but here we are.

Also, if you plan on watching this series no matter what, stop reading this review at this point. I believe any point to watching this show is outright ruined if you know what the show is/are spoiled. Outright spoilers will still be marked as always, but still.

Before we move away from the gore and really delve into the negativity that will be comprising this entire review, I really just need to take a moment and say I really genuinely do love the gore. As a matter of fact, I'd honestly love to see P.A. Works do a horror anime in the future. They really do have the gore down.

As weird as it may be though, my favorite death in the entirety of Another is literally completely bloodless. While explosions of blood are usually always fun, I really just love the one scene towards the end where another character who is completely out of their mind at that point, is chasing the main characters and to do so, she follows them out of a window. But in her crazed state of bloodlust, her foot just happens to slip on the windowsill and she falls. The impact of her hitting the ground looks and sounds great.

youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWlH13Ka3Dk)

I actually did watch this when I still primarily watched English dubs. I can't believe there's actually a comical ""OH MY GOD"" right after she lands. Holy shit.


No images are included for this section, because I believe they would be distracting. 

Anyways, the plot is pretty simple. It's about a ""cursed"" high school class. The students don't really know if it's truly cursed or not, but there's a very clear trend of students of the glass dying over the top gory accidental deaths. Apparently, to the extent it's essentially suicide if you just go down a flight of stairs a little bit too fast while also carrying an umbrella. But basically, years and years ago, there was a female student named Misaki in the class that died tragically but then one day one of the students said no, she's right there like always.

Then for some reason, the rest of the students and teacher basically start treating like she's there as well. To be fair, since this is a passed down story thing, obviously we, the audience, have no idea if it's actually bullshit or true. But apparently, this somehow started a tradition of a ghost or an undead person occasionally coming back in the class.

But then, the universe, or some invisible omniscient force doesn't like this one bit. This omniscient force, or, ""the Curse"", basically starts periodically causing anyone in the class or any family or friends of students of this ONE SPECIFIC CLASS of this school to die. Mind you, it's always in really gruesome or violent methods as well. Additionally, the school has gotten a new building, and it seems the ""ghost"" or ""Another"" has somehow transferred? Or it's link to the class itself? Like it's a different building, different actual room than the one that had the original Misaki person, but... it's haunted still? I don't think we're ever given answers as to if it's actually the original ghost of Misaki that's coming back as these non-existent fake students or... or... I don't know. I literally don't know.

Why am I even talking about the ""Another""? Let's talk about the ""Curse"". The ""Curse"" is apparently capable of disrupting or disabling phones, is essentially omniscient but is incapable of figuring out who it actually needs to kill (the ""Another"") beyond killing randomly, is capable of straight up possessing people... and I think this one might be on the ""Another"" and not the ""Curse"", I'm not too sure, but something is capable of completely altering people's memories. This is important. Be sure to mark it in the notes you should be taking to accompany the reading of this review. We'll be coming back to it later.

However, don't despair! There is in fact a way to combat the ""Curse""! I guess the class, after a couple of goes through this repeating cycle, they just started trying random things? But apparently,  APPARENTLY, ignoring a completely random student of the class... helps? Sort of? The past classes still ended up having more students die so I don't know why they thought this would help. When a new arrival shows up and joins the class and seems INCAPABLE of catching a hint and just keeps talking to the chosen student to be ignored... they just say fuck it and ignore him as well??? As if they expect that to work?

I really have no idea why this is a thing they decide to do in the first place or think it's going to work, but there's a lot more, and I just... let's move on.

I already essentially declared this entire review was going to spoil basically the entire basic  idea of the show so... the real solution that'll stop the ""Curse"" is basically just giving it what it wants. Finding the ""Another"" and killing them. But there's basically no real way of finding out who it is.

There's absolutely no established way any character can find out who it is. But hey, there just happens to be a student in the class with the last name Misaki (you know, the name of the ghost from the original class) and she just happens to be the one they all decide to ignore. That's convenient. I mean that's obviously just a red herring. Obviously, she can't be the ""Another"". That'd be too obvious.

!But she does have a hidden ability that would allow her to be able to tell right away if a person was the ""Another"" or not, if she wanted to. She has it the entire show. It's actually established that she has it the entire show. This is a thing that is true about this show and apparently the novel as well. MORE ABOUT THIS TO FOLLOW FURTHER DOWN.!

Now, I know what you're thinking. TGG, when are you going to get to talking about the plot? Okay yeah we get the omniscient curses and dead people returning as fake people, but what's the plot???

Slice of life about middle schoolers with vague supernatural/mystery elements, and also a lot of gore and death happens. That's really the heart of it, or what matters. The ""Curse"" is idiotic and I hate it for reasons I'll get into later in another section, the ""Another""... what the fuck was even its goal? It's not like they did anything nefarious really. It's the fucking ""Curse"" that's going around causing gruesome deaths.

It's not like the fake ghost person needed to be evil or antagonistic but... it would have been neat for it to be SOMETHING? Because... what it actually turns out to be is terrible. To the extent it has its own completely spoiler filled section.

But hey. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Plot aside, maybe the characters themselves are interesting or... entertaining in some way. There has to be something, right? THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING.




Uh. I may have bit off more than I could chew with this one. Describing Another's characters is... a challenge. Because there are a good portion of them that are completely forgettable, and the few ones that are still rattling around in my brain somewhere, I can't really say anything more than ""well, their name is blank and they're a middle schooler"".

Thinking about it, if I wanted to, I could probably rehash the joke I made when I reviewed Glasslip. But actually with Another, I think with the exception of one (you may already know which one I'm referring to!), I think there's even less memorable characters. Because at least with Glasslip, I could remember things to actually criticize about them. In any case...

img440()

Here's our main character. His name is Kouichi Sakakibara. He is a middle schooler, and is an apparent horror fan because he had one Stephen King book at one point. He's not ever shown actually really being a ""horror fan"" so you might wonder what is the purpose of that scene or even showing a Stephen King book. But I'm sorry to tell you that you haven't descended far down enough into this review to find out yet because yes, that is another dedicated section of this review. Oh... and, I guess he had like a health problem or whatever, and that's why he doesn't know everyone is ignoring one specific student to apparently fend off omniscient curses that are mad about the existence of ghosts.

img440()

Kubodera is apparently the name of the class' teacher that kills himsel--wait. Apparently he killed himself not because the ""Curse"" takes him over but because he realizes all the class' stupid moronic rule about ignoring a person doesn't stop the ""Curse"" and he just goes crazy??? Was that seriously what happened? I don't even remember the teacher being aware that the ""Curse"" was a thing. I seriously remember just fucking thinking that scene comes out of literally nowhere but maybe I was just so fucking numbed by that point that I missed or forgot scenes with the teacher... there was actually more stuff about the omniscient curse possessing people but now I'm kind of worried that with those as well I might have just forgotten scenes. !Or maybe the inn's caretakers really were just random serial killers coincidentally while the entire class fucking turns on itself and everyone starts murdering everyone.!

Though, that just underlines my point of... why purposely do it in front of your class which I guess he apparently cared about before going completely batshit insane? Because horror, I guess. To be fair, that scene was probably the best scene of Another (though as previously mentioned, it's not my favorite gore scene) in my opinion. 

img440()

But let's get back to the characters... enter, middle-schooler... uh... hold on. I truly do remember their names off the top of my head, I'm not simply opening character pages at random. Oh! Yukari Sakuragi! That's the umbrella girl! She's a middle schooler whose favorite hobby is being brutally killed via umbrellas!

...It feels like I'm just wasting time talking about these bit players in the grand presentation that is Another. Fuck it. Let's do it. Let's get to the real protagonist of Another.

img440()

OH! THERE HE IS. THE UMBRELLA ITSELF. WHAT A MAJESTIC AND WELL-FLESHED OUT CHARACTER. I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT EYEPATCH GIRL  (eyepatch girl is Misaki girl but not original Misaki girl that was a ghost, just coincidentally happens to share the same name as ghost) BUT I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT EYEPATCH GIRL BEYOND ALL OF THE CLICHES SHE IS MADE UP OF AS WELL AS HER DEUS EX EYEPATCH. WHICH, AND I KNOW, YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN SICK OF HEARING THIS IF YOU'RE STILL READING, BUT WILL BE COVERED IN A FOLLOWING SECTION OF THIS REVIEW.

It happens to be the very next one though.




Before we get into the true meat of this review and discuss the bulk of WHY I really dislike this show (aside from the plot and characters), I have to go a little bit into HOW I watched this show. There is an OVA for Another. It seems super irrelevant and detached from the actual plot and events of Another, but...

This is really where the true spoilers of this review begin. I really want to hammer this home. This'll be the last time, though.

img440()

Okay, imagine you watch a show and at one point, a character basically reveals that they are capable of this hugely massive ability that essentially solves the main mystery and conflict of the show. Sure, it's kind of bullshit, but then an OVA comes along afterward and it sort of expands on that and explains why that character keeps quiet about this ability.



You say well okay, that explains that. Or maybe you still (rightfully) think it's stupid, but now that the OVA is over, you're done. You're out.

Imagine... imagine someone watching that... BEFORE... the rest of the actual show. Because chronologically... it precedes it. In fact, it explains why that character is where they are in the very first episode and a lot about that character. But, while you know more about this character, you also know what they're capable of. Then when you learn more about what the actual plot/conflict of Another is, you just go...

...Why won't she just take the eyepatch off? I know watching the prequel OVA first was the wrong way to go about it, but since the OVA itself is an adaptation of a side novel, that means this is genuinely something the original author established. She has this ability literally the entire time. She could have seen who the ""Another"" was, THE ENTIRE TIME. ANY SCENE WHERE SHE IS TALKING TO THE PERSON WHO THE ""ANOTHER"" IS, IF SHE JUST WASN'T WEARING THE GODDAMNED EYEPATCH, SHE WOULD KNOW. IMMEDIATELY.

That whole reasoning of... well, she doesn't want to see when people die and etc due to that whole thing with her twin sister, SHOULD HAVE WENT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHEN SHE REALIZED THAT SHE COULD HAVE USED THIS ABILITY TO STOP THE ""CURSE"" WHICH IS WHAT IN FACT KILLED HER TWIN SISTER.

SHE COULD HAVE PREVENTED SO MANY DEATHS. BUT SHE DIDN'T. BECAUSE EYEPATCH. BECAUSE SHE'S THE EYEPATCH GIRL AND SHE NEEDS HER EYEPATCH TO LIVE.

img440()

Let's talk about this now. Stephen King is probably [my favorite author](), I've literally read every book the man has published up until like recently when he started like a trilogy of detective novels. I don't know how I possibly could have forgotten about this on the first time I went through the show, but this was like a punch to the face in attempting to rewatch Another for this review. Because...



Pet Sematary is one of the ""old King"" books, and is genuinely a creepy idea for a horror novel. Yes, it's the one where a guy buries things in a Pet Sematary that is haunted by Native Americans or whatever, but the story behind it is fucked. One day, one of Stephen King's toddler sons almost got hit by a truck in a street, and he proceeded to write Pet Sematary. Which is essentially... the character in the book DOESN'T manage to get his son out of the street before the truck comes. The father character is so fucked up by this that after having resurrected the family cat via Pet Sematary, he proceeds to do it again but with his son.

Point is, while there's a much simpler explanation (it's probably in the novel too, and the author was probably a fan because how could you possibly get a ""horror"" novel published without coming in contact with Stephen King material in some shape or form) why this is a thing, it's really silly at almost the very start of a ""horror"" show to immediately have a reference to Stephen King. Let alone one of his more famous novels (really, almost all of it is from before he quit the drugs and also before his accident in 2000). Because, it immediately gives the audience expectations.



""Stephen King??? I know that name! He's that guy who [wrote all of the horror novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StephenKingbibliography)! [The Shining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cb3ik6zP2I)! That book that ruined [clowns as a real occupation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVK72QH6hLk)! The [one about the haunted car]()! The [other one about the haunted car]()! If it's bringing Stephen King into this, it's gotta be good horror!""

But then it isn't, and apart from the occasional gore, it's ""omniscient curse"" this, ""hey we have to ignore this random girl to stop the omniscient curse"" that, and urgh.

Getting back to the omniscient curses, and while we're still on the subject of Stephen King... and... I believe the comparison is fair considering this series brought Stephen King into this itself, let's talk about Stephen King's IT.



I just want to briefly talk about this because it was sort of blowing my mind the more I thought about it. 

Another is about this small town and there's this omniscient thing that is brutally killing middle schoolers every couple of years or so and for the most part, it seems like the rest of the town outside of those connected to the class itself are completely blind to all these fucking HORRIBLE GRISLY BLOODY DEATHS that are happening to these bunch of middle schoolers. The actual plot of Another is a bunch of the students in the class try to combat and stop the curse that's brutally killing them one by one.

Stephen King's IT is about this small town and there's this omniscient entity that is brutally killing and eating people (IT's favorite meal is of course terrified children) and it does this like every twenty seven years, and IT is actively manipulating the entire town to ignore the mass amounts of missing children and death that just seems to roll around every twenty seven years, and in some instances, even makes other people in the town contribute to the violence.  The actual plot of IT is a bunch of kids try to stand up to IT and stop it for good while it is essentially omniscient and EATS CHILDREN.

While IT is an omniscient force that is essentially fucking with everything in this town, it's an actual character, has motivation, has a physical form, and is genuinely menacing. Another's ""omniscient curse"" is... is a faceless force that we never see, that's only causing random grisly deaths because of the existence of the ""Another"" and when the ""Another"" dies, it just fucks off until a new ""Another"" appears.

Sure, yeah. The gore's great and yes, you can't go wrong with seeing kids die in over the top and gruesome ways. Like come on, speaking realistically, WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS IN SUCH A PERFECT WAY THAT YOUR NECK IS TARGET #1 FOR THAT UMBRELLA? THAT SHIT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF INVISIBLE MURDER FORCE WASN'T ON THE SCENE.





This is where we get into some shit. I've made it apparent enough that I don't think the actual serious plot of Another works or is even really entertaining to watch. But I also don't even think it really works as a cheap silly horror that you just sit down to watch specifically to see kids/teems die.

Yes, that's right. Horror fans love seeing kids/teens [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JasonVoorhees) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANightmareonElmStreet) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheEvilDead) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beware!ChildrenatPlay) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SlaughterHigh) [DIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChoppingMall) [DIE]() [DIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheTexasChainSawMassacre) [DIE]() [DIE]()--ahem, excuse me. The ghosts that live inside my brain took control of the keyboard momentarily.

Anyways, let's just bite the bullet and finally talk about the [Final Destination series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinalDestination). 

img440()

I know this review is all over the place, as this is now the third thing I've brought in to compare to Another but... this is without a doubt the one that makes the most sense. Basically a character has a premonition or whatever before they and their friends die horrible deaths and uses that newly gained knowledge to avoid... that death.

But basically, they were actually fated to die then, so ""Death"" itself is essentially out for them. One by one, they start to die in ridiculous or over the top ways. This was literally years ago and I thankfully didn't watch all of them. It may or may not have been the one with the rollercoaster, I literally don't remember, but there was that one death where like after a convoluted series of events, a girl ends up trapped in an active tanning bed thing and [she dies from tanning bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaz73KCiKaM).

Though you know, these movies worked (for what they were and that was the Final Destination series so that was a low bar to begin with) because while there was a plot, it was dumb, silly, and obviously the characters dying in over the top ways was the entire point. Whereas Another has a bunch of nothing characters, this whole ghost story angle, and I think honestly the ""annoying"" outweighs all of the gore.

The fact that the main way to apparently combat this ""Curse"" just being ignoring a random student in the class is just... infuriating to me. Because since nobody but this one person can see or interact with this person, obviously the first conclusion you go to is ""well, she's probably a ghost"" but nope, they're just ignoring her to somehow combat some weird omniscient curse that's causing everyone to die somehow but then later they just accuse her of being the ""Another"" anyways.

At least in Final Destination, they don't pull any punches and straight up say it's Death itself.

But hey, what do you know. There's another similarity between Another and Final Destination. There are videos on Youtube of all of the deaths in both.

I'm definitely not making the suggestion to just watch the ""deaths"" video and just leave it at that. That's definitely not what's happening here.

youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H87bqxAAymc) 
youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYPY7Lq63kw)

It's almost like THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE. GIVE ME GRISLY SCENES OF TEENAGERS DYING BRUTAL AND HORRIBLE DEATHS AND HOLD THE HELPING OF A SERIOUS PLOT, PLEASE. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO INCLUDE ONE, MAYBE MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.

GOD. 



Here we go. Here we fucking go.

img440()

Okay, let's start with ""Eyepatch Girl."" She is literally a walking mass of cliches. She is a quiet loner girl and literally the entire reason why ""Main Guy"" gets wrapped up in all of this ""Another"" nonsense is because the show seems to continually push him towards ""Eyepatch Girl.""

Why is she wearing an eyepatch? Why is she so quiet? Why is she usually always alone? Why does nobody talk to her? Why is she wearing an eyepatch? Why did she show up randomly at the morgue level of the hospital holding a doll? Why is she wearing an eyepatch? Why aren't both of her eyes the same color? Why does she live in a building that's just full of weird spooky dolls? Why does she share the name of the original ""Another"" ghost from the story? Is she related to the original Misaki ghost? Why is she wearing an eyepatch? WHY IS SHE WEARING AN EYEPATCH? Oh... the eyepatch is because she lost one of her real eyes and had [a doll's eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUuH4TEmgLo) put in as a replacement and that somehow gives her the ability to see who is alive and who isn't and who is going to die and etc?

Well, why the fuck does putting a doll's eye in your empty eye socket give you that ability? Actually, how does it even work as an actual eye? If she was just a ghost person, there'd be no questions. But since she's purposely such a weird character, THERE ARE VARIOUS QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ABOUT HER AND BASICALLY NONE OF THEM END UP BEING ANSWERED. To be fair, some of them are answered in the prequel OVA solely about ""Eyepatch Girl"" but I didn't find that satisfying at all.

The entire purpose of that prequel OVA/prequel novel honestly seems to be just to cover that huge fucking flaw of her suddenly just knowing who the ""Another"" is because she decided to take off her eyepatch in the actual main series. Like okay yeah, she had a twin sister who !previous to the start of the actual series died as a result of the ""Curse"".! But what relevancy does that twin sister play for anything? It explains why ""Eyepatch"" was in the morgue level in the very first episode, and why she was creeped out about her eye ability thing, but I've already went into why that should have just given her motivation to try and actually stop the ""Curse"" by finding the ""Another.""

img440()

Also, you know why she lives in like a doll shop? Because dolls are creepy and creepy is horror  of course, don't you know. The doll shop and the dolls just felt so fucking out of place that I just can't get over it. Okay yes, dolls and mannequins are frequently used in horror, I understand. But... what fucking relevance does any of it play? None really. Like, if they had just said that ""Eyepatch Girl"" was just born with her ability thing and it wasn't from a doll's eye, nothing would be changed. At all. In fact, her just being born with it would be easier to wrap my head around than... why did they decide to just put a doll's eye as a replacement after a four year old loses their eye? Who made that decision? Why did they make that decision?

I've been talking too much about the plot and character stuff. Let's briefly talk about a couple of the more horror-y scenes of Another (apart from the gore because you KNOW horror ABSOLUTELY has to have gore in it for it to be horror) and why they are ALSO terrible.

youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh48D2q4H7w)
youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPtcJBb9KU)

Both of those are probably among my favorite scenes of Another (of which there aren't many) and... they both end exactly the same way. The ""Main Guy"" is just having a nightmare. Oh. So, what you're really telling me here, is none of that mattered at all because it was just dreams. ""Wow, some creepy stuff is finally happening!""

No, it's all just a dream. Good. Great. Wonderful. Fantastic.

img300()

Then, there's that whole thing with the tape that is what reveals to the students that the only way to beat the omniscient curse is to find out who the ""Another"" is and kill them. Everything about this tape is really... it really just gets my goat. The characters who find and listen to it realize what sort of reaction the class is going to have if they're told that murder is the solution to stop everyone from dying, so they correctly decide that telling everyone this information is probably not a great idea given the absolute fear everyone's going into. Yet... they don't hide the tape somewhere reasonably hard for them to find? Actually, they straight up take it to the inn place where the entire end of the show happens and that's when the show just completely collapses into craziness and gore.

To be fair, it's to show ""Eyepatch"" and ""Main Guy"" but... why just leave it lying around where others can find it?

img440()

Because one of the other students finds the tape, listens to it, and goes oh SHIT. THE QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE SURE NOT EVERYONE DIES IS MURDER. AND THAT JUST STARTS THE BALL ROLLING, PEOPLE START KILLING EACH OTHER, THE INN BECOMES ON FIRE, ONE OF THE INNKEEPERS JUST FUCKING GOES CRAZY AND STARTS KILLING PEOPLE TOO. It's all... it's all just nonsense from there on out.

We're not done with the tape though. First of all, I need to explain that I am okay with cliche or campy horror tropes. As long as they're done appropriately (in a fun way and in something that is purposely of the ""fun horror"" category), I'm fine with them. But when characters in this more or less played straight show decide to... like all they do is basically transfer the tape's message to a CD, and then they put that CD in a locker in their classroom just like the last class did. 

...Like are you kidding me? WHEN YOU, THE NEXT CLASS, FINALLY NEEDED THE TAPE, IT WAS STILL IN THE OLD AND ABANDONED BUILDING. WHY ARE YOU JUST TAKING IT ON FAITH THAT NOBODY'S GONNA FIND THE TAPE OR MESS WITH THAT LOCKER OR THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET A NEW NEW BUILDING? ADDITIONALLY, WHY NOT ADD LIKE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS OR MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND? IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GRUMPY THAT ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD SO YOU WANT THE NEXT CLASS TO GO THROUGH THE SAME EXACT SHIT. THIS IS THE FINAL EPISODE'S POST CREDITS SCENE, THIS IS LITERALLY THE FINAL NOTE THE SHOW GOES OUT ON.

WHY DID NOT ALL THE CHARACTERS DIE. THIS SHOW WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT IF ALL OF THEM HAD DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 




Everybody seems to be dying brutal and bloody deaths and we don't seem to be making much progress if any at all towards stopping it.

""LET'S GO TO THE FUCKING BEACH. BEACH EPISODE! LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

img440()

Are you kidding me? I perfectly understand the purpose of why this is a thing. Basically just to demonstrate, even if you do leave the town, there's no escaping omniscient curses because yes, there is a death this episode. But this is like episode eight. Isn't it a little bit late to be pulling these shenanigans? I don't know maybe, it's better in the nov--

img440()

OH SHIT. IN THE NOVEL THEY DON'T JUST DECIDE RANDOMLY TO GO TO THE BEACH? OH SHIT. THIS ONE ISN'T ON YUKITO AYATSUJI, THIS IS ALL P.A. WORKS' DOING. I'm just surprised they didn't decide to [go hiking instead](). You could have one of the students get mauled to death by a bear or something. It's because of the ""Curse"" that one of the students had his face ripped off by a bear!

To be fair, this is one of the episodes I enjoyed the most because the twist and the idea is just so goofy. ""Sure yeah, you can do a beach episode, but you still have to have someone die horribly.""

Actually. [Here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tu7rFtEZ-M) Here's two scenes from Another that both simultaneously exist that I slammed together with shitty video editing.

My overall point with this is really, I consistently did not know what Another wanted from me. If it wanted to be seen as this serious thing about this ghost story thing or if it wanted to be seen as an anime version of Final Destination. I just could not wrap my head around it the entire time I was watching it and as time passed once the final episode ended, like a rumbling storm of growing discontent my opinions of this show worsened more and more as I continued to think about it.

Was I supposed to be scared? Was I supposed to be laughing? Was I supposed to be [cringing from all of the crazy gore]()? Was I supposed to [care about these character]()s or think they were deep in any way shape or form? Even now, I still really don't know. From skimming the novel, it seems like a serious enough novel this guy wrote. Like at no point watching this show did I feel like... like it was intentionally bad, like Ranpo Kitan. But whereas Another is originally a novel a person actually wrote and thought out, Ranpo Kitan was just a bunch of ideas ripped straight from a deceased famous mystery writer and done completely over the top and in a horrible way.

I don't know. Almost the entire time, I was just bored and mildly grumpy whenever gore wasn't happening. Mind you, it's not like I wanted even more of it. There was plenty considering the later end of the show just delves into complete over the top schlock. That's also about when I ended up feeling a completely different emotion.

img440()

Genuine anger.

Next section is ENTIRELY on the ending of the show.


Context: [M. Night Shyamalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.NightShyamalan) made [that one movie with the twist ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheSixthSense) and basically ever since then, he's made [horrible shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.NightShyamalan#Filmography) and basically they almost all have twist endings.

Throughout the rest of the show, the negativity I had towards it was only like a low rumbling in the pit of my stomach. After all, I started the show with absolutely no knowledge of it. Didn't know about all the gore, didn't know about the umbrella, didn't know the concept, etc. The entire way through, I was trying my hardest to give it a chance. But then the whole stretch with the inn or whatever it was happened.

That ending is absolutely the most garbage thing about this series. 

Okay, first of all. The entire show you're led to believe that the ""Another"" is a student, and at this point, the students have mostly completely flipped their shit and are going crazy trying to kill ""Eyepatch"" because they believe that she's the ""Another"" and are dying due to the fire that starts somehow or being murdered by one of the innkeepers who just coincidentally decides to go insane (I really can't believe that the ""curse"" really had NOTHING to do with that. They just ""go crazy"" and that's it.) while all this is happening.

But guess what? It's a fucking teacher. It wasn't even the teacher of the actual cursed class because he already committed suicide at this point. So basically all of that conflict among the students apparently was for absolutely nothing. Not to even mention the fact that there's no possible way that the viewer could ever actually figure out who the ""Another"" is, there's absolutely no clues or anything. Like, the ""Another"" is perfectly nice to the characters and doesn't do anything nefarious at all throughout the entire show.

Not to mention that apparently when an ""Another"" appears, it can completely alter the memories of other people. So it turns out that the ""Another"" is actually ""Main Guy's"" aunt, and his memories were altered to include memories of his fake dead aunt so he'd think that yeah she's totally an actual living person. There are various problems with this.



Number one. The entire purpose of the ""Another"" turning out to be his aunt all along had to be either just to try and have a shocking twist ending, or to try and get an emotional reaction from the viewer. Like oh no, now ""Main Guy"" is going to put a pickaxe through his ""Fake Aunt"" who is the ""Another.""

Number two. Since the memories are fake, while ""Main Guy"" is being emotional, the viewer has no fucking reason to care about this at all. THE MEMORIES ARE FAKE. SHE IS THE ""ANOTHER"" AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE DEATHS ARE TOTALLY ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF THE ""CURSE"" (""oh no, I chased my classmates out of a window with a knife and I accidentally slipped, fell, and died. DAMN YOU, CURSE!"") IS BY KILLING HER. MAKE HER DIE FOR THE SECOND TIME SO THE SHOW CAN END.

img440()

Number three. The presentation of the ""Another"" is... baffling. ""Main Guy"" comes out and there's his aunt under a thing, unable to get out, struggling, and she looks like an undead. This... this is what the entire show has been leading up to! AND HE JUST PICKS UP A THING AND PUTS IT THROUGH THE BACK OF HER SKULL.

Number four. After she dies, everybody else but ""Eyepatch"" and ""Main Guy"" completely forget about her, but still remember the ""Curse"" and all of the deaths that happen and primarily most of the deaths throughout the ""inn arc"" happened resulting from the chaos that initially sparked by the class going mostly crazy about wanting to kill ""Eyepatch"" because they thought she was the ""Another."" But ""Eyepatch"" wasn't killed, so why did the students ever believe that ""the Curse"" had really ended. Did they just believe ""Eyepatch"" and ""Main Guy""'s word? But they were literally just trying to kill ""Eyepatch"" not even that long ago and ""Main Guy"" is clearly Team Eyepatch so why would they trust...

They obviously didn't forget about ""the Curse"" because if they had, then why would the two other students have went to the trouble to putting back the tape that has the instructions of how to stop ""the Curse""???

img440()

I just... it's just a fucking mess. Not to even mention that, they literally didn't even fully stop ""the Curse"". Therefore, there IS going to be a new cursed class down the line. But the students of THIS cursed class are basically like... ""well most of us are dead at this point, let's just try and move on and maybe the next cursed class will be able to stop it entirely or at least before almost the entire class is dead.""

This has to be one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Or at the very least, it's one of the ones that have genuinely upset me the most. You know what I was waiting for? I was waiting for ""Main Guy"" to wake up in his bed AGAIN and go ""OH SHIT THAT WAS A FUCKED UP DREAM.""

That would have been the only way to top what the actual ending is. It was all a goddamned dream, FIN.



You know, there's another reason why I opened this review with a comparison to Ranpo Kitan. The Ranpo Kitan review I did, if I had actually bothered to go into all of the problems I had with its ""plot"", that review would have looked like this one. Instead, it was so incomprehensible that I couldn't bring myself to believe that anyone who worked on it even partially believed that it would be taken seriously or well received. But since Another is more serious and less batshit insane, it actually bothers me more?

Sure yes, Ranpo Edogawa's grave was danced on, and then a[ completely different series](https://anilist.co/anime/21832/TRICKSTEREdogawaRampoShounenTanteidanyori) came back for a second helping and danced on it again. But with Ranpo Kitan, I could at least laugh at it.

Before we get to the score, I'm just gonna really quickly gather a recap of all of my major points in a nice bullet list form. Because if any TGG review ever needed a summary, it's this one.

- The gore is genuinely great. To the point it's literally the only strong point of the entire show.

- While explosions of blood are nice, you can also do a completely bloodless death with it still having the sort of impact you want from a show/series like this.

- The plot is needlessly complicated and done in an annoying way. Basically boils down to people won't stop dying in horrifically gory ways a la Final Destination, but it has to be this whole fucking thing. The curse will get you before you can leave town, the curse will cause calls to cut out when convenient, ignoring a random person can somehow combat the curse (except when it doesn't), the ""Another"" can alter memories, etc.

- Basically no interesting characters at all, and the single one that's even remotely close is infuriating. Even for a cheap/cheesy horror thing where the entire point is you're there to see characters die, this is pretty fucking bad.

- The most infuriating thing about the plot is made even worse because there's an entire prequel OVA/side novel that seems like its entire purpose is to rub salt into the wound.

- Stephen King's name should never have been brought up. Period. Even if this was a good horror, why even do it? It's not necessary. And if the ""horror fan"" aspect of ""Main Guy""'s character actually would have gone somewhere, you didn't need to specifically throw Stephen King's name out there because he's the horror author that LITERALLY EVERYONE IN THE UNIVERSE knows.

- Cheap horror does not work if there is a primarily serious tone to it. Look, eventually, all I'm saying is, Jason eventually started beating campers in [a sleeping bag against a tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF629C5WRqU) and also [he went to space](). Fun fact, apparently both of those are [the same fucking movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JasonX).

- Final Destination is better than Another.

- ""Eyepatch Girl"" is a walking cocktail mix of cliches. There are a whole bunch of other horror cliches, but let's stop with the dream sequences that literally only happen to include ""spooky"" scenes. Let's please stop that.

- Inconsistent tone, and the beach episode.

- At this point, twist endings are more trouble than they're worth. Because the odds your twist ending ends up being fucking dumb or out of nowhere are RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. But hey, Another's was memorable and frustrating enough to cause me to write a 8,000+ word review of it over a year later.

Okay, with all of that being said, I give this a show a 10 out of 10 for all of the gore and the eyepatch girl who is legitimately my most favorite anime character of all time. Goodbye! That's the end! This is the last review I'm ever writing! It's the end, it's the end forever. These reviews are never coming back, it's the end, it's over.

""Gee, I think I might have actually went overboard with this one. Over 8,000 words... that's ridiculous. It's actually a seventh of the cumulative amount of words I've spent on all of my previous reviews added up together. But I feel like I'm forgetting something...""

There is a sudden scratching noise from the direction of the window.

""That's weird. What's that fucking noise? Who's scratching on my window? Hello? Even though it's a really strange and illogical decision, I'm going to open my window and poke my head out to investigate this random scratching noise. I will also take my laptop with me and continue to type all of this out to essentially record this interaction even though it is entirely inappropriate and foolish to do so.""

There are horrible and brutal noises of disemboweling. Then, there is nothing but silence.

...[Why don't you head to the store and buy an umbrella?](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-06-15/horror-light-novel-another-2-planned-for-fall-launch/.75314)




""Woah, fuck! That sure was a fucked up dream! Dreams of Mary Poppins disemboweling me...? Giving Another a positive score...? I need to go see my therapist! At least that part about Another 2 isn't real because there's nothing beyond that one article about it so I'm just going to believe that it doesn't exist. Oh wait, but I need to finish that review! Just gotta throw my score on it... and... done!""



""Alright. That's finally over. Now, I'll just walk downstairs and depart my domicile and start my day.""

""Oh... but it's supposed to rain today. I'll just grab my umbrella first..."""
131573,"SPOILER-FREE

For starters, this movie is very watchable as a newbie to the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. It was adapted from the prequel to the primary series, so while it doesn’t flesh out the world as well as the main series does, you can watch it without any prior knowledge of the world and still understand it just fine.

Now, onto the review.

Jujutsu Kaisen 0 had stunning animation, incredible music, and amazing characters. It’s a shame it was only an hour and forty-five minutes, but they made every moment matter.

I thought the characters were great. I loved the look into the second-years from the main series when they were first-years, and of course I loved Yuuta. His development and relationship with Rika was clever and unique, and I enjoyed how the ending of the movie worked out for them. I also liked the further exploration of Inumaki’s character in how he related and reacted to Yuuta. The development here really builds the deeper you get into the story as a whole. Also, Maki was mega-hot in this movie.

The animation was amazing. I can’t think of any particular scenes that made me think oh, clearly the budget went somewhere else, although the shots of Gojo’s eyes did make me think this. this is where the budget went. The fight scenes were animated incredibly as well. Of course you can’t compare it to the quality of ufotable, but MAPPA really did do a great job with the animation. The CGI was good, the fighting was good, the curses and characters were good. No complaints here from me.

And then the music! Great music. King Gnu makes banger music. The OST was fantastic too. The right song played in the right moment, and the music really complemented what was going on during the movie.

Then, of course, there’s the plot itself. Honestly I don't have much to say where the story is concerned (well, not without spoilers, anyways). I wouldn’t call it anything incredible, but it’s far from being a trash plot. I like how it works into the main story, and the concept as a whole was very interesting and enjoyable. It definitely got me wanting to get back into Jujutsu Kaisen.

The anime original scenes were very enjoyable too. After recently rereading the manga, I can confirm that there were very few anime-only scenes; they added some extra pizzazz to the fights of course, and they also gave cameos to characters from season 1 that didn't appear in the manga. There is an additional end credits scene that was not included in the manga, but I think that's about it.

As for some other negatives, I did think the pacing was a little off, but not so much that I didn't enjoy the movie. The manga (a mere four chapters and 200 pages) had some poor pacing, and this movie was a very faithful adaptation. However, even if it was anime original, I do think that an extra thirty minutes or so could’ve made the movie just that much better. It really felt like a short movie, especially in comparison to recent American movies that have been closer to three hours. 

Overall, this was a great movie. I’m not quite as awed as I was after leaving the theater from the Mugen Train movie, but it’s certainly better than any My Hero Academia movie they’ve made so far. Many individual aspects I found amazing, like the characters, animation, music, and story, despite the pacing feeling a little off in a few places. But, even though the fights were amazing, it simply wasn’t as enjoyable for me as season 1 was. However, I do think it’s fair if you liked the movie more; it was a very solid movie with several incredible aspects. The big-screen experience is one you won't want to miss for this movie. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is definitely worth the watch, regardless of how much you already know about the series."
6702,"I'm not going to talk about the Fairy Tail anime as a whole. I'm not going to go into an absurd level of detail regarding the fight scenes. There is poor animation for the first half, and although it improves over time I'd never say it reaches the territory of being ""great animation"". Many people coming here likely have seen or otherwise considered watching Nux Taku (an anime youtuber that sort of founds himself upon memes)'s video on Fairy Tail. There are many fantastic points in that video, but there is one key takeaway to be gained. 

The protagonist of Fairy Tail, isn't Lucy, nor is it Natsu.

The protagonist of Fairy Tail is the Fairy Tail guild itself.

img()

Before we continue... I am not going to try to say that everyone ""should"" or ""will"" like Fairy Tail. But find out for yourself whether you are one of the many that do. 

Characters are flawed, but they are written that way because none of them are meant to become the next Hokage. Nobody is going to become the king of the pirates. There aren't dragonballs to collect here. Each character has their own little goal which seems mundane in the grand scheme of the world and the plot. But those characters evolve and progress together as the guild of Fairy Tail. You aren't watching to see Natsu find his father. You're watching to see the guild evolve as a family, together. 

Hiro Mashima has written a pretty poor power scaling system for Fairy Tail. Inconsistent fight endings, powers being stopped by things that should be obliterated by them, the power of friendship, etc. There's also ""plot armor"" in the form of !master Makarov repeatedly ""dying""!

But is that really a bad thing? Sure, it is for a show like the other shonen series I mentioned previously. Though who's to speak to the end that power scaling needs to be perfect in Fairy Tail? Who's to say that this flaw isn't intentional to further the beauty of the series. 

Mashima is 100% capable of a fluent and comprehensive power scaling system. Power systems in rave master for the most part and so far in Edens Zero are both very balanced. In Fairy Tail it can be inconsistent and ignored sometimes. But I think he does that absolutely intentionally. For lack of better terminology... I think that Mashima tries to intentionally break that power scaling system because the emotional impact of those scenes is much more important and much more powerful than any magic spell or punch.

Surely, if you have heard of Fairy Tail, you've heard of the combined hate from one side, and the sheer passion and love from the opposite. That love isn't unfounded. All of these big fight scenes end in a predictable finish. But what's not predictable is the growth of the characters by the end of it. They might not change drastically as people over such a short time, but that's not the point - they change TOGETHER, as ""Fairy Tail"". 

Much of the meaning and depth behind the characters in Fairy Tail isn't explicitly stated to you, though I think that makes it all-the-more fascinating to dive into analysis of. The following information is just going to be me analyzing 2 characters - Gray and Lucy - according to what is revealed within the first 20 episodes of the anime. Bare in mind that spoilers will exist for those first 20 episodes here, and you may not recognize some names if you have yet to see them. I will mark when this section starts and ends to help if you are still here and reading my ramblings!

CHARACTER ANALYSIS BEGINS

Gray

I won't reference the direct setting or episode, as I still want to keep this as spoiler free as possible. I'll just dive into this analysis with my information. 

Ur turned herself to ice as a sacrifice in hopes of allowing Lyon to live a free and happy life for himself. She wanted Gray to never tell him so that her sacrifice wasn't meaningless. But as Lyon reverted to dedicating himself to trying to overcome her instead, Ur's sacrifice was inevitably meaningless and pointless. Gray had been constantly blaming himself for that sacrifice for over a decade. He was depressed and wanted to die, but bottled up those emotions just like so many people do in the real world. He says a powerful like that I didn't catch the first time around in his fight vs Lyon, which was, ""I have been ready to die for the last 10 years.""

He is stopped from sacrificing himself here by Natsu, which is representative of the fact that he finally has a support group. Now that he's with fairy tail, he doesn't only have friends, but for the first time since childhood, he has a family there to care for him. Continuously through the anime, for the most part, there are writing nods to this when Gray attempts to use Iced Shell. Attempts at suicide or self harm aren't once and done, they require continued support and help from friends and family. Between how sad the story of Ur and Lyon's lives are, and how cleverly hidden Gray's emotions had been, I think it's incredibly well handled. 

Furthermore, since Gray's iced shell on Lyon would have been revered via Lyon's moon drip ceremony on the island... This was also representative of Gray's family helping him avoid meeting the same fate as Ur. Not just helping make sure that Gray didn't end his life, but about the fact that Gray's sacrifice would have been meaningless just like the loss of his teacher, Ur.

img()

Lucy

Early in... When it's revealed that Lucy comes from a very wealthy and well-off family. She was coddled and treated like a princess by those around her and was stuck in that life despite how glamorous it sounds to the outside. She felt trapped. So when she spoke of her desires in the first episode of joining a guild... Recall that she did do super lovey and dreamy and excitedly. That's because it's a genuine dream. To escape her mundane and confined life in hopes of feeling like she is truly ""living"". A sense of adventure, finding like-minded people, making friends, being able to finally be a real teenage girl and not just a token of her family. She didn't explain her heritage to the guild as she joined because she didn't want to be attached to that. That's why she's hopeless at the start. Because she has absolutely no experience. She wants to fit in so she acts like she's a big shot, but she knows she isn't and she knows that she isn't helpful in the slightest. She constantly works to improve herself so that she can not only feel proud of herself, but also so she can be of use to those around her. The anime doesn't specifically tell you some things in the dialogue in this exposition, but the information is there. She's not weak or useless just as a character flaw in the beginning. Lucy shows growth in strength both emotionally and in terms of performance. She's a dynamic character that I love. Only through Fairy Tail and her new life that she developed for herself was she able to reflect upon her old family life and see her parents and sibling(s) in another light. Lucy is just a beautiful and tragic character in my opinion.

In that episode I'm referring to what seems like just a normal saving moment of Natsu jumping out of a tower in hopes of her guildmate catching her is actually much more. It's Lucy finally feeling comfortable enough with the people around her to take a literal and metaphorical absolute leap of faith. To put all of her devoted trust into someone, literally entrusting them with her life. Something she didn't feel capable of with her real family, but was with her new one at fairy tail.

Every character in the Fairy Tail guild is suffering in their own ways. Anyone is welcome, because everyone has their own problems. It's none of their business to pry into your past and into your darkest moments. But when Lucy breaks down crying and can't say anything other than ""I love Fairy Tail"" I found it extremely beautiful. Because that was after a really symbolic moment of her finally realizing she found people that truly care about her and that she can trust. She doesn't feel alone or trapped any more, she just feels like she can be ""her"". That's all that matters.

END CHARACTER ANALYSIS

img()

Almost everyone in fairy tail is orphaned or distanced from their family. Some of them LOSE that family over the course of the show and the ever-changing story. Though YOU are also written to be a member of fairy tail. Mashima did a great job of that. While you aren't a member of Luffy's straw hat crew, you ARE a member of the Fairy Tail guild... The fairy tail family. They don't call Makarov gramps just because he's old, either. They call him Gramps because that's exactly what he is to them. He is their family, their role model, their parental figure, their grandfather.

Fairy Tail is really quite a beautiful series. Flawed, but there is depth and beauty even to those flaws. While many might not understand those flaws, others might not know how to look for them, and others might not care enough to try... there's a strong community behind the series that passionately loves the series for all that it is and represents. Not even all Fairy Tail fans recognize some of the hidden depth and meaning behind the characters and the series as a whole. But hey, just like the members of Fairy Tail, we all have our flaws.

We are Fairy Tail.

Final Notes:

If I were to give a word of advise to anyone interested in watching... don't approach Fairy Tail as a battle shounen. You may end up disappointed. Approach Fairy Tail as an experiment; as something ""special"".

My 90/100 is a personal rating based on my scale rather than one based on direct comparison to similar anime. I'm unwaivering on the idea that Fairy Tail really is something special, though.

Oh, and it's great seeing characters in a shonen anime find relationships and start to fall in love with eachother. Many ships are fulfilled here, and those that aren't are still being progressed and worked on for the fans in Fairy Tail 100 Years Quest.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss the series! I have so much more that I'd love to talk about regarding the depth of some of these characters, and I find it fascinating to explore the stories and nuances behind each member of our guild. I have much more to share."
21699,"[DISCLAIMER: THIS REVIEW COVERS THE MAJORITY OF KONOSUBA (EXCEPT FOR THE MOVIE), NOT JUST SEASON 2]

Isekai as a whole has always been a weird genre. While I do think it actually has the potential to be interesting on paper, a lot of shows were sadly overwhelmed by dry theatrics such as harem, overpowered MC, and directly following the goal of defeating the demon lord. Thankfully, this was barely the case for Konosuba, the kind of isekai that disobeys the basic rules with its own utility.



STORY: 88%
img420()

First of all, the concept behind it. The concept of it is to defeat the demon king. Sounds basic? Like a lot of isekais, yes. Can it ruin the progression and scriptwriting? Well... not even close. Konosuba overcomes the simplistic concept by turning the show into a parody. The show doesn't even progress but in a way that makes it very fun to watch with the characters dicking around instead of progressing their levels. While the story is very funny and charming, it has a little bit of qualms such as the panty-stealing scenes; while I still find it funny, it was sometimes admittedly uncomfortable to look at.



CHARACTERS: 93%
img420()

The characters are easily my favorite part of the show, with each having their own characteristics and personalities.

Kazuma Satou, the MC of the show, is a NEET who has bad luck and believes that all genders are equal.

Aqua is a goddess who has her potential to be a great goddess with her water and light powers but decides to focus mostly on alcohol.

Megumin is an archwizard who has an obsession on explosive magic, is actually manipulative, and likes piggybank rides.

Darkness is a masochist who gets embarrassed everytime.

To be honest, I don't really find them completely useless. Sure, they're pretty weak but there are aspects where their strengths shine. Aqua can still revive Kazuma. Megumin's explosion, while still extremely limited, still packs a punch. The main cast are overall lovable dicks with their fun dynamics. Very satisfying to see them shame on each other but, at the same time, still loving each other. The main cast aren't the only thing keeping the show amazing in the first place, we also got a few side characters shining as well.

Yunyun is a friendly lady who has zero chances on gaining a friend. Her interactions and rivalry with Megumin were very refreshing and funny seeing those two arguing against each other. Yunyun introduces, Megumin, while knowing her before, pretends that she doesn't know. Play games with each other and surprise or not surprise, Megumin will always win.

Beldia is an armored headless horseman who wants to live in a quiet life. Destroy his castle and you know you messed up, even if he's not that much of a threat. His complains easily makes him a funniest character in the entire series (I'll thank Patrick Seitz for the voice acting.)

Wiz is a friendly shopkeeper who is probably the only sane character in the show alongside with Yunyun.

Hans is... well... Hans.

The characters are very charming and brought a large impact to the story whether you like them or hate them.



ART: 84%
img420()

The art style is nice, creative, and colorful even though it looks a little generic.

Though, what's very impressive is how DEEN animates Megumin's explosion. And let me tell you, it beautiful. It's very hard to describe how outstanding the explosion magic was. All I can say is is that they spent their dedication on such an entertaining magic scene.

Character designs are nice, with Megumin's being one of my personal favorite aesthetics in fiction.



SOUND: 92%
img420()

I like both the opening and ending. They're catchy and energetic.

OST is very welcome as they reflect each event quite nicely.

Though, what hits hard is the voice acting. The voice acting in both sub and dub are well-scripted and provide tons of personality of each character. (Although, I personally prefer the dub a little more as it feel a little more faithful to the characters' idiocity.)



ENJOYMENT: 95%
img420()

At first, I thought this was going to be yet another generic isekai judging from the premise but after watching it and having experiences with it, Konosuba is easily one of the best shows out there. It's funny, cute, deep, and it doesn't force you through MMORPG bs. If you're looking for a different isekai, I highly suggest you give it a try.



PERSONAL RANK: 9/10 (S+ Tier)"
3588,"Halloween and Anime together at last, Soul Eater is one of my favourite anime.

Produced by Bones, who brought us Ouran High School Host Club, Darker than BLACK, and Wolf's Rain. Soul Eater is adapted from the manga by Ookubo Atsushi. It is of personal importance to mention the manga for the animer is a very close adaptation of the latter. In a nutshell, the story follows three students Meisters and their respective Demon Weapon partners, as they embark on a journey to combat evil, and yet grow up with each other at the same time.  

Story (9/10) The plot follows a general plot-line really, with the Meisters and Demon Weapons going to school, equipping themselves with combat skills, so as to fight the forces of evil in the context of the show. Throughout however, we are treated to comedy and mere innocence from the characters - for they are really just kids trying to grow up - so Soul Eater as a show generally turns out to be quite the light-hearted pick. Nevertheless, there are episodes which tug at the strings of the heart, where the emotions of the characters really reach out to you, and also episodes which are pure comedy, where you inevitably laugh at the zaniness of the world. 

Music (10/10) Produced by Iwasaki Taku, of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann anime. Responsible for tracks in the latter, like Libera me from Hell and FIGHT THE POWER, he delivers as well in Soul Eater. The music fits the mood perfectly, fighting and comedy scenes are complimented by their music, and I really believe he does a good job here. 

Art (8.5/10) One of Soul Eater's strongest selling point. Bones did really well animating the fight scenes in the manga, and the colours are so rich and beautiful, that every episode is a joy to behold. The drawing of the characters are good but these are pretty normal, I must say. It is the sketches of the environment, and the animation that really stands out. Soul Eater was the anime which spoiled me in terms of fight scenes. 

Characters (10/10) Another strong selling point and you will find yourself liking some of them more than the others. The Protagonists are interesting and fun to watch, we have ranging from the slick yet ridiculously symmetry compulsive and the son of Death, Death the Kid, to a goofy kid who wants to be the strongest but cares for his friends, Black Star, and we have a bright pigtail girl likes to give Maka Chops to her dad, Maka Albarn. Soul Eater provides characters which are strong enough to carry the series on their own backs. Even the Antagonists are interesting, you cannot help but like them. Powerful, and pretty witches make up the cast of the latter and it is quite fun to watch the inner dynamics where they manipulate each other for their own benefits. 

Nevertheless, Soul Eater is a great show for all its strengths in animation and music. Its light-hearted tone throughout is also ideal for those who seek to enjoy the anime after a tough day at work or school. There is no need to think too much about plot implications (apologies if you are a sucker for these), Soul Eater allows you to just sit back and gawk at the wonders of the supernatural. Definitely a show worth your time."
21698,"SPOILERS FROM HAIKYUU THIRD SEASON AHEAD

Haikyuu is a masterpiece, yeah, i have said it, and i will never regret it.
If you want to know why, i would recommend you to continue reading this review until the end.


After the end of the legendary confront between Karasuno and Aoba Johsai, Haikyuu needs to deliever to their viewers something as monumental as last match, and dear god, they have done it. While the rivalry isn't as strong compared with the last team, Haikyuu builds weight by showing characters past and their motivations to win, and stay in the court even more.
img220()


Haikyuu's cast of characters is among one of the best i have ever seen. While they are all likeable in a certein way, they also have some depth, and develops with the pass of the episodes.

1. Tsukishima: i can't talk about character development without mentioning Tsukishima, the MVP of the match. He was being incredibly well developed until this point, where he finally starts to view volleyball in a different and more positive way, and accepts that he loves the sport.
img220()

2. Almost every other member of Karasuno: It is truly amazing how every character got some good screen time in this season, Tanaka and the third years using their maximum effort to reach the nationals, Hinata and Kageyama trying to prove their points to Ushijima, Yamaguchi becoming even more brave and Nishinoya surpassing his limits like never.
img220()
3. The antagonists: Ushijima, Washijou and Satori are all great characters. Washijou establish a amazing parallel wiith Hinata. Ushijima and Satori builds an interesting competition against Hinata and Tsukishima.
img220()


Astonishing animation. Probalby the best work from Productions IG.

img220()


Absolute incredible soundtrack and sound effects, it's just impossible to not be hyped with the music. My personal favorite is 'The battle of concepts'.
img220()


I really could not get my eyes of the screen. Every second of this season was engaging in some way, either it being with badass scenes or with emocional moments. Something that i would like to point out, is that the direction and characters personality fits perfectally this match, it doesn't get to serious or to playfull, it's the perfect balance between ton and atmosphere, which is incredible in my eyes, since the pacing was perfect for a match that lasted 10 episodes.
img220()


This anime is truly special for me, and this season is a miraculous experience i would say. I hope you enjoyed reading this review, have a nice day!

14813,"This review is meant for all three seasons!!

When it comes to most RomCom's out there, they usually have the same generic-cliche trope. The girl liking the boy for no reason, just for plot and drama, instead of focusing on the relationship and real life. Our faces end up get shoved with unnecessary fanservice, not natural just for flashing some delicate parts. Sure, we can't deny we like to see some racy elements now and then. But it's only eye-candy with no relation to the story, nor does it add any nuance to the cast. No, it only serves as a way to ruin the flow of the storytelling, if anything. This is frequently dished out in most RomCom to keep the viewers interested, but for the wrong reasons. I don't mind fanservice but make it has some purpose if you're gonna flaunt it like that in our faces regularly. Or try to not flex it almost all the damn time.

If it's not useless and forced fanservice, it's creating drama by letting the characters move based on set decisions. This means acting in the way the situations tells you to over feeling genuine. Not to mention, you can't forget pouring on the waifus to attract more audience. But instead of fleshing them out, they get used to the same thing repeatedly with the typical set of personalities but nothing more. Such as being a tsundere, a shy girl, onee-san type, perhaps even an imouto type. Why not? It just adds more content to deal with you're not going to go anywhere with or is even not remotely contributing to characters. Either it gets stale quickly or goes to plant the seeds for the show's ruin since nothing gets solved, and everything ends up becoming a mess.

That's where Oregairu comes in, one of the best RomCom out there and for clear and feasible reasons. Not only does Oregairu avoid most of the issues the romance genre tends to have. The one with forced-fanservice, not letting the character develop beyond their pre-established traits. It has excellent use of dialogue that's sharp-witty and is very refreshing. If you know about Monogatari by the brilliant Nisiosin. In that case, you can see the similarities in Oregairu with how the characters speak to each other. It's intriguing and striking, with a big dash of maturity. It does not waste much of its dialogue. It got tons of nuance in there and depth that can mean a lot more than you might give it credit for. Instead of giving us dialogue, that's easy to interpret. Oregairu does things straightforward but does not convey the words directly but with a sense of vagueness. Like saying ""I love you"" or something similar gets across by using the environment, the characters' traits, emotions, or a personal link to a moment or thing, they could have from the past. It's hard to really put it into words, so I hope you understood the gist of what I am trying to get across.

Majority of the mature audience will get more out of Oregairu. Teens are more likely to enjoy it for its delightful comedy and quirky-dorky characters. But someone who has experienced life over many years is more liable to see the true appeal of Oregairu and appreciate it. As the dialogue for someone too young could be overwhelming and complicated. It's not like you will perceive every word perfectly, but it will make you comprehend things more easily. Even adults could have problems, and that's a given. Oregairu is written as such. I had to watch scenes, even an episode, several times to make sure I understood it, but the dialogue is damn entertaining. So I didn't mind that. There are, as a result, various ways to interpret the conversations. Among the many reasons, Oregairu is the only RomCom. I have seen to this day. I would label a gem without feeling dubious about it. It's not flawless, but it's the closest thing to perfection I have found in the RomCom genre.

Let's talk briefly about our cast—Hikigaya Hachiman, our male protagonist, a bit of an oddball but in a good way. Hachiman is an isolated boy who tends to like spending time alone over being with others. He is pragmatic to a fault and gets as such worried over the most minor things. Hachiman sees the world in a very quirky but fascinating way through his trademark dead-fish eyes. One of the things he says is that he believes ""youth"" itself is just an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites."" Suffices to say he is a unique one but, at the same, totally relatable on a personal level. Oregairu doesn't just show us the exterior, but even the inner workings of our characters' minds and how they think. Hachiman's inner monologuing is one of the wittiest things you will ever encounter, both valuable and engaging. It's filled with enthusiasm. How he thinks about others, situations, and so forth gives you different perspectives to chew on.

Not only does this in an ingenious way, flesh him out, but it shows how similar we are to Hachiman deep down where no one can read or hear what we are thinking. He is written in a way to not make you cheer him on because you can love him, hate him, or completely feel neutral. It just makes sense. Hachiman is someone that reflects back your inner feelings and viewpoints. Issues that are common amongst many teens and adults even. Things like how does it truly feel being alone? What happens when you try to open up to people? Why are you afraid to talk with others. Why are you secluding yourself from others in the first place? What is your trauma and scars of the past, the reason you act in such a way? These and more everyday issues are answered through Hachiman's interactions and views on the world and its people. Making his development so damn fantastic. It's executed extraordinarily well. Hachiman is, no doubt, one of my all-time favorite characters.

In fact, many characters in Oregairu that have affected each other in either a negative or positive way. That is to say, the side cast also influences the more crucial roles. Nothing much feels wasted with Oregairu's writing or execution. Yukino and Yui are a prime example of how you do two characters with trope we've seen before stunningly. Yukino is on the surface your everyday serious and passionate about her studies kind of girl. She's intelligent and got that cool beauty vibe going. But a reminder, that's just on the surface on the inside. She has all kinds of problems she must overcome. That's not even counting her situation with family, which is a delicate topic that might spoil major parts about her character. So gonna stop here. Then there is Yui, who is your everyday innocent, bubbly kind of girl. She is so easy to talk with and overflows with charm and is always so positive that she spreads a burst of sunshine and happiness wherever she treads. That's not even considering her iconic way to greet someone—Yahallo. Which gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside and is so damn adorable top it all off.

Again, that's if we look at the surface. As we progress, we see how vulnerable weak-willed our adorable cinnamon truly is. At last, there's Iroha, she is another compelling and loved character in Oregairu. She is the very bold, decisive sort of girl. Who loves to reject Hachiman over and over for strangest reasons. But It never seems to get old. Because she throws a banger rapping number whenever she does her thing. On top, the rejections seem to get mellower from going to ""Nah, impossible"" to ""Try again next time."" Implying Iroha is gradually growing feelings for Hachiman and slowly starting to open herself up. It goes to show the dialogue can have valuable information without you knowing. So, it's highly recommended to rewatch Oregairu to appreciate it all the more. Iroha is cheeky, very endearing, and foxy and is just as much fun as the other love interests. Everyone is unique and complicated. It's hard to explain the characters are merely a few sentences. You really must dig deep for that.

Despite my previous points, I wanna discuss one more character, which gives you an idea of how imouto or little sisters should be portrayed. It's normal for imouto anime to be ecchi and not be a good role model for how a sibling pair acts in reality. There are many innuendoes, which often is offensive to the point it's laughably bad and unrealistic. It doesn't feel sincere and might, at times, feel forced. Komachi is a prime example of how an imouto relationship in fiction should be more like. The banter between her and Hachiman always fills me with so much joy and is hilarious. It's wholesome, pleasant, charming, and stuffed with tons of witty and astute remarks that one never gets bored out of. Komachi and Hachiman have the kind of relationship where they can be endearing toward one another or be savage and roaste each other. Komachi's sassiness is so damn endearing and is put in a single line just incredibly funny and engaging. It's kind of like how real siblings are at the core. They do love each other, but more than that, they enjoy teasing, making fun, and pranking one another without letting up. I find their relationship so adorable, wholesome, even a bit unique and amusing, but not excessive or offensive in the slightest.

It's true most times you put on a different identity for your friends, the teachers, parents, relatives, on the internet, and even your siblings. To go from someone shy and afraid to speak out plainly to become a person who doesn't care about saying whatever is on his mind. This just makes this excellent quote by Hachiman resonate with me so profoundly: ""We all have our own personal images that's dictated by others, one that's always off the mark. We wish to remain faithful to ourselves, but who gets to decide who we are as a people? When our image never goes hand-in-hand with reality, where can we find something genuine? Where can we find ourselves?"". That's another thing to look forward to in Oregairu. And that's outstanding amounts of sharp and intense dialogue that can really make you think. The following quote essentially tells me we have a different mask for everyone dictated based on their being. If someone is more soft-spoken, you are careful to not overwhelm them with a coarser language. But if someone uses a rougher language and writing style, you tend to match, so you are on the same wavelength. There can be many reasons, but one that comes to mind is to not give wrong impressions.

Now looking at everything discussed, there is one more thing that makes the characters of Oregairu stand out more than many others. And that's ""flaws."" I don't mean those who come out nowhere but the ones that have always been there somehow. If you use the idea of ""show and tell,"" than Oregairu is definitely more of the former. You'd have to read between the lines and comprehend the hazy but informative dialogue as you see fit. That gives you more options to think around, and it provides you a chance to play detective and crack the code by not giving you straight answers. What makes sense to you? How would you explain the character's actions or even Oregairu from a more metaphorical perspective? Calling it even a highly advanced RomCom does not constitute much justice. I have my take on it, but others might differ. The following just made sense to me.

Oregairu encapsulates the pain of moving forward and to continue living through both the good and the bad. The pain you experience by protecting others, only by hurting yourself in the process. Nobody can comprehend the pain of your own struggles and worries, even if you clearly tell it to someone. The pain of being genuine, it's the cold-hard true. Often, the truth hurts more than you could imagine. That's life in a nutshell, and Oregairu gets that across stunningly well. Life is pain. But it's harder to live a life that's becoming and worthwhile than just dying. Pain is what we started Oregairu with, and that's where we went. Not everyone got all their wishes fulfilled, and it was painful to see these other best girls lose. But that's life. Oregairu makes you commend and admire everyone who goes on with their life. At the same time, their pain bears over their shoulders, responsibilities, and other conflicts. This is literally an everyday thing for us humans, even if it's unique for everyone. Whether it be work, school, homework to do, bills to pay, financial needs, time-constraint, or other actualities. The fact is we are all tacking and handling our pain daily to make sure it hurts less and less. As a result, we are all slaves in our own life. Looking at it like that, we are totally so damn awesome not to go nuts and keep to our routines. Even if we stray more times than we are willing to admit and waste it by procrastination or other matters that should not be prioritized. Pain is also there to remind us that joy and fun should be savored properly, not taken for granted.

About the art-style of Oregairu, it's improved in every way since the first season. At the time, the visuals where wonky, and the art was only decent at best. It still didn't nail the atmosphere of Oregairu across the board. We got a far more polished and refined version when the sequel came out. Everyone looked so much more expressive. Not to mention, the background looked absolutely stunning and harmonized so fittingly with the mood of the given situation. Season two accentuates Hachiman's eye on ""Deadeyes"" more vividly, and the whole cast looks mature for one. But there is a cute feeling to the style. Season one did have a slightly more lighthearted vibe, so the first style worked, but it's good. It was changed for the later parts since everything is so different and challenging. We are far away from simpler times. I want to lightly touch upon the sound for Oregairu. It got many top-notch openings and ending songs that exude nostalgia and emotions. Opening from the first season to the last was sung by Nagi Yanagi, and her tunes were never disappointed. There is no bad opening song or ending songs in Oregairu. Ending are sung usually by both the lovely Yui and Yukino's angelic voice actresses, which is another blessing to your ears. That's not even counting how many incredible insert songs we got. As for voice acting in Oregairu as implied, it's incredibly energetic, varied, and got tons of subtle tone shift, making the experience more genuine and intense.

Crazy how much I have discussed Oregairu, but barely touched upon the romance topic and how it's handled. But I can assure you it's beautifully depicted and tastefully grown over time. None of the females starts out liking Hachiman from the getgo. We did have some shaky parts in the final season, but for me, the conclusion made it worthwhile. Not to mention, a love confession did happen in Oregairu-style, and it's one of the most satisfying and adorable things I have seen. It carried so much weight and value since both parties expressed far many words than a simple ""I love You"" ever could. It's no doubt my favorite love confession, and I wonder if anything will ever beat it for me. Everything to the atmosphere, setting, dialogue, and background was simply flawless. Closing it off with a beautiful song made the impact far more incredible and sincerer. I've discussed Oregairu strengths in great detail. 

Here comes the time to touch upon its flaws, what could've been better, and what needed work. I am not a light novel reader as of yet, so this is my anime-only viewpoint. Oregairu for me is more than solid, and it's concluded. You can't say about many RomCom nowadays since they seem to always draw the short end and get hanging after one horrible or barley decent cour. Sadly the last season did have some inconsistencies and segments that didn't mesh or flow naturally. Above all, it was heavily rushed, but it didn't ruin the story entirely and its direction. From an adaptation standpoint, season two was the strongest. Despite also being rushed, it felt well-balanced all-around. Season one was great as well. I didn't feel like things moved too fast or otherwise. Season three is where most got problems for being a bit inconsistent and moving things too quickly. All said and done, there were many solid episodes, the best one being the 11 and 12th arguably. I am surely biased when it comes to Oregairu, but I don't see any point in not praising it to such high heavens. It was such a perfect ending that gave us a proper resolution to the romance and the relationship. I wanna note that Oregairu got a strong side cast when it comes to interactions, but they are not very fleshed out. They only get brought to our attention to progress the main story forward; otherwise, we often don't hear from them.

I am gonna confess there are many characters I personally would adore to have a more prominent role. I got such a sweet spot for Yumiko Miura for one. She is such a cute tsundere that got more to her than meets the eye. Saki Kawasaki was supposed to be another love interest for Hachiman. Yet, she never felt a part of the game, and only got some moments here and there. Haruno and Hayama were fascinating, but their ending left some things to be desired. While many others just ended up taking space for literally nothing in the end. Oregairu is one of the few RomCom's out there, after which a rewatch might offer a more powerful but incredibly rewarding effect. No way you can get everything at first glance since the dialogue is high-level. Not to mention, not giving straight answers and using exact words mean they could have several interpretations. Various answers could be the correct one. Just make sense of your logic, and you can get possibly away with your explanation of the situation. Oregairu truly is an incredible story with an intense and rich set of characters. No one should miss it out for anything. It gets a big fat must watch from me. If you're bored of the generic and cliche RomCom with the same elements repeated over and over.

Give Oregairu a shot, since it's more than likely you will end up loving it like many others. Most who don't like it are those who have not seen or read it. I've said it many times. But Oregairu is not so easy and has many layers to talk about. At times it can be a quality comedy. Other times, you might find yourself dealing with politics and internal school issues. Our primary setting is in a service club that helps out students with any request they might ask. This serves as another way to flesh out our cast and give us an interesting perspective on things we might've thought about but never revealed in the open. Oregairu cast is reflective of their issues and worries. They are always evolving meticulously. Oregairu is a damn fantastic RomCom. A masterpiece I loved with all my heart, and I recommend to everyone with every single fiber of my being."
21170,"Well, if season one was good, this was just phenomenal. This fits the very definition of masterpiece. An ingeniously told story about the meaning of life, determination, and potential. Although it started off goofy, wacky and above all else comedic, it gradually evolved into a show that was so much more than a fun way to kill time.

Koro-sensei’s backstory was incredibly powerful. There had been some hints to it in the first season, but I definitely did not expect it to have the depth it did. My entire perspective of him changed – my understanding of his motivations, his personality, his struggles, his efforts in becoming who he did – suffice to say he’s now one of my favourite characters. I’d even say he’s a contender for first place. 

But it wasn’t just Koro-sensei who was developed. Nagisa, Asano, Itona and Isogai all got their own place in the spotlight (Isogai’s episode in particular was a great showcase of his abilities as a leader). In fact, every character in class 3-E got their own time to shine. The sense of camaraderie from the first season reached its pinnacle here; by the end of the series you could clearly see how much the entire class cared for each other. They started out as a bunch of oddballs, by the end they had become a cohesive (and deadly) unit.  I couldn’t help getting drawn in to their struggles and celebrating their triumphs. I loved each and every character by the end. Even the bad guys; that’s how well they were depicted.

One who especially deserves mention, though, is Kayano. I mentioned in my season one review that I had really been expecting more from a character who was so heavily featured in all the opening themes and treated as an MC, when in reality she was hardly shown at all. Boy did I eat my words in season 2. Now I see why she was so important, and just how cleverly the anime was put together. Kayano really was a major focal point of the show – even though we only see it in season 2, it underlay the entire anime. I can’t go into more detail than this because it would cause major spoilers, so if you’re curious you’ll have to go watch it yourself."
101347,"Dororo is an anime from 2019 and it is an adaptation of the [manga of the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/31658/Dororo/) by [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka). Fifty years ago was the [original anime adaptation](https://anilist.co/anime/5760/Dororo) of Dororo. But of course, I'm here to talk about the new 2019 anime.

The 2019 anime by [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/MAPPA) most certainly is an adaptation of the original manga. But I would definitely refer to it more as a reimagining than a straight adaptation. In so that while the original was plenty dark already, this anime really focuses on being a dark and gritty action series.

img440()

It's weird to talk about this as again, a lot of the really dark elements of Dororo 2019 are of course ripped straight from the original. As all forms of Dororo of course start out the same exact way.

A lord by the name of Daigo Kagemitsu sacrifices the body of his first born son to demons. He chucks a mere baby to the demons for their blessing upon him and his land. And aforementioned baby loses all of his body parts.

img440()

His arms, his legs, his eyes, his skin... nearly everything. Leaving naught but a misshapen creature merely clinging to life. Then after being found and saved by a wandering medicine seller, this cursed and abandoned child is eventually fitted with prosthetic limbs and body parts. Then when the demons come knocking, Hyakkimaru is fitted with blades in his prosthetic limbs, enabling him to combat the demons and spirits that hound him.

And thus, he begins his journey of killing demons to reclaim his many lost body parts.

 

...After everything I’ve just described, I think you could agree that doing this series in a darker way essentially writes itself. You dim down a lot of the comedy and/or light hearted moments that were present in the manga and give the demons a more gritty appearance, and you’re basically there.



Additionally, Hyakkimaru’s character is completely different in the 2019 version. As he doesn’t even get his voice back until Dororo is already traveling with him. Even then, he is still much quieter. So much so that rather than his pesky sidekick, Dororo is essentially his handler so to speak. As Hyakkimaru is solely focused on finding more demons to kill to get his body parts back than actually interacting with others. Not that he could at all at the start. No eyes, no voice, no ears, no nose, can't feel anything because obviously he has no skin...

 

The 2019 anime really makes use of this element. Because in the manga as well as the original anime, Hyakkimaru basically could still communicate and see. Even when he didn't have his actual voice, he could speak telepathically. Taking that away and really focusing on all the different prosthetic pieces that composes of Hyakkimaru's body immediately results in a completely different character. Additionally, Dororo 2019 actually gives us a look at how Hyakkimaru sees the world.

img440()

Except for the auras of other living beings, Hyakkimaru vision is pretty much complete darkness. The auras of demons are of course red, which enables Hyakkimaru to be capable of telling what is a target and what isn't. 

img440()

Due to various plot circumstances, Hyakkimaru actually ends up turning his blades towards humans and kills several of them at a point. This causes his aura to pick up a tinge of red. That adds a whole new layer implicating that through these violent battles against demonkind as well as humanity, Hyakkimaru actually is risking his humanity. While I feel this element of this adaptation could have been utilized a bit more overall, I did like all of those moments where we saw Hyakkimaru or the elderly monk’s vision of the auras.

img440()

But after so much ominous foreshadowing about Hyakkimaru potentially losing his humanity, I kind of shrugged after a while. Okay yes, obviously, killing humans is bad. But there’s no shortage of samurai that are just complete assholes in Dororo. Maybe it IS a bit demonic to think that yeah okay they deserved to die. But they certainly didn't do themselves any favors... 

Additionally, that brings me to another element of this version of Dororo…

img440()

Daigo Kagemitsu and his land are way more expanded on in the 2019 version, as well as the actual effects of his deal with the demons. This also goes for his second son, Tahomaru. My appreciation for this anime only grew even further when I went back and watched the 1969 version which of course, focuses much more on Hyakkimaru and Dororo wandering around and battling different monsters.

Daigo's villain level is even dialed back a bit. Certainly, he's still selfish and did a horrible thing to Hyakkimaru, but part of his motivation in Dororo 2019 was improving his land for his people as it was repeatedly wracked by war and droughts. Daigo in 1969 was completely irredeemable.

Because you know, they could have just done the ""monster a week"" thing again exactly. I mean hell, they do do that. But I loved the expanding on Hyakkimaru's family and showing us the land of Daigo worsening as more and more demons are killed by Hyakkimaru.

img440()

It doesn't necessarily work 100% of the time... 

!Did get a little frustrated when various characters implied that Hyakkimaru was being the selfish one by continually snatching back his body parts. Eventually, the show justified these moments as a character rightfully finally pointed out that the tranquility and prosperity their land enjoyed was literally brought about by sacrificing the body of an infant child to a swarm of demons.!

...but I'm of the opinion that if you're going to remake something... then at least do it in a different way. Unless of course if the original itself was bad, then yeah, do the exact same thing but try and actually fix it in the process if you can. This was of course not the case with Dororo 1969. Leading to two pretty different adaptations of the same manga that I enjoyed about the same, but admittedly, I enjoyed each for different reasons.

Like it's hard to think of the last action series I watched and thought ""wow that's so fucking cool"" more than when I saw this mute, pale, and emotionless Hyakkimaru pull his prosthetic arms off to reveal swords and just dive off a bridge to fuck up a sludge demon.



...This probably goes without saying, but I do definitely like the remake version of Hyakkimaru more than the original. The ""more realistic approach"" of Dororo 2019 really makes Hyakkimaru more... I don't want to use the word frightening but...

As I mentioned before, even in the original manga Hyakkimaru can basically still more or less talk. Admittedly, he's not actually really talking but still. This version, by the time we join him on his journey, he still doesn't even have a real face.

img440()

Seeing Hyakkimaru's exposed and skinless face rightfully causes Dororo a bit more of a fright than the original Hyakkimaru simply popping out his fake eyeballs.

img440()




img440()

Dororo 2019 is personally one of my favorite series to come out of this year. But at the same time, it's more than that. It's proof that a remake or a new adaptation of a previously adapted series doesn't have to be a soulless attempt at... well, a remake. You can take the material and go in a different direction with it. Put a different spin on it.

And also simultaneously adapt stuff that the original couldn't because the manga wasn't finished at the time.

img440()

If done well and with the effort put into it, it can actually function and stand on its own as another yet separate adaptation of the manga. Even when I did bring up Dororo 1969 in this review, it was not to Dororo 2019's detriment. As a matter of fact, as I've more or less stated at this point, I enjoyed parts of Dororo 2019 more than I did Dororo 1969.

But of course, it was because of Dororo 2019 that I went back and watched Dororo 1969. Admittedly at first, I just wanted to compare the two. But I gradually found that they don't really need to be compared. They both have their own flaws, but they're both different and respectable enough adaptations of the original Osamu Tezuka manga.

Except how dare you have Nota show up just to get bullied.

img440()

Nota wasn't even in the original ma

Dororo 2019 is a darker and more modern (obviously) take that has a much heavier emphasis on the action of the series and I loved it to bits. Even if approaching the end there was a point where I felt they needed to rein it back in a little bit when

!Tahomaru and his servants literally got the demons to allow them to use Hyakkimaru's own arms and eyes in their final battle against him. I think that was the schlockiest the series ever managed to get. Mind you, I still loved it.!

...But yeah, I love Dororo 2019. And Dororo 1969. And the original manga, though I still shamefully haven't finished reading the whole thing at the time of this review.

Dororo 2019 is a 9.5 out of 10 for me."
2001,"Hello, my name is TheRoundChestnut, and you're probably here because you either watched the show and want to be certain on your thoughts of  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, or you're unsure to watch this show. 
I feel as if the other reviews for this anime were not clear as to why they liked it and were too hung up on their enthusiasm to share their thoughts. 
But I am not saying I am better than the other reviews, but simply giving more to what is already given. 
(Kinda like a chef explaining his own dish compared to the customer's take on it)

As I was watching this anime, I critically analyzed points, topics, and themes to talk about for this review. 
Keep in mind there are no number based ratings for my reviews since numbers tend to give certain connotations and assumptions pertaining to something. (Like how 7 is a better sounding number than 6)
Also as for spoilers, I will only spoil only the first episode of this anime because it will justify what I am talking about, so if you did not watch it or forgot, then I strongly encourage you to watch the first episode before indulging in this review. 

img400()

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is probably the most enthusiastic and over the top animes I have ever seen. 
Ever since the first episode, this show knew where it was headed. At the beginning of episode 1, there was the opening scene of Simon in his Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann heading into a battle. In an interview with the director Imaishi Hiroyuki, he said that he thought opening scene was going to be the highest they can go in terms of climax, but in the end they went going beyond that. With its super combining with mechs, shouting super moves, and even looking at the wonderful character designs. this show proves that characters and mechs can be well designed and established. 
(Not going to lie. I was too sitting on the edge of my seat on every single episode, and shouting the cool quotes shouted by the characters.)

This show knows what its doing in terms of story and character development. Simon, the main character, is the one of those wimpy and weak characters from the beginning, but is developed into one of the most over the top characters due to his relations with Kamina. He becomes aware of his drive and compassion for his fellow allies along the way. This is the part where Gurren Lagann succeeded the most during its run, is its development of its characters and their motivation to fight and live. Everyone in Simon's team unite into one, almost like a drill, which is this show's main symbolism.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zjo573zlk)


img350()

The drill in Gurren Lagann is embodied everywhere throughout the show. Heck, actually its probably safe to say that the whole show is a drill. The story starts with Simon and Kamina underground and its their dream to get out and explore, kind of similar to how a drill is centered around one point and then expands outwards. Same with their influence on other, who join them. And same with their fighting spirit, the more spirit they have the more power, which all derives from the one point: their heart. (I don't think I need to expand on this aspect since its pretty obvious throughout the show.)

img350()

Another aspect of this show which shines is the animation and its pacing. The main scenes of this anime are fighting robots and over the top cuts of the characters fighting, but how these are implemented are done so nicely that its directly impacts its pacing of the show. The fighting scenes are quick and fast, which equates to how fighting in reality are. But when characters are talking or on their downtime, its slow and andante and allows the viewers to have breathing and relax room until the next time they fight, much like how the characters in the show are. This direct influence on mental state on the viewer is important for keeping their attention, because if this show was all nonstop mech fighting, the viewers will be tired too. This show utilizes is nonfighting scenes dedicated to character development and exposition. And not to mention its wonderful soundtrack that complements the atmosphere of the scene. 
Despite being a 2006 anime, this anime even surpasses most animes in 2016. Almost everything is hand drawn, and not some crappy CG for everything (!Ajin!). Probably all of the CGI were used for the backgrounds and space scenes in the later episodes, and I know for sure, CG, one way or another, takes away the fresh sense of Japanese anime, and starts becoming a digital animation. (Please leave that to Disney)

img350()

In conclusion, this show does a fantastic job in their execution of animating a mech genre with characters that actually drive the story (instead of characters being there for plot convenience), very nice and hype fighting, and lovable characters and their quotes. 
Although there are minor flaws that falters this anime a little when dwelling deep into its structure and logic, it still is a fun, wacky, and over the top anime that everyone loves.
And I will rate things with a ""should you watch"" or ""pls dont"" (much like how Demolition D+ does) 
And I say ""YES"" completely."
13601,"This is a futuristic anime that is based around a System called ""SYBIL"" that is the sole authoritative body in the city.   Scanners are set up in order to measure one's ""Psycho Pass"" which determines how much of a ""criminal"" you are.  The anime's main characters are a division in the police squad that deals with these ""criminals.""

The anime is based around this system.  Those who want to save it... Those who want to destroy it... Those who want to find out the truth about it...  This mysterious thriller is honestly an amazing masterpiece of art.  There are so many elements that make this anime amazing.  From the ideas, to the execution, to the truth behind it all, every piece of this anime leaves you wanting more.  Everything is executed greatly, even though there were sometimes that things may have seemed confusing, in the end it all makes sense, and doesn't leave you questioning anything (well maybe a few questions, but it ended well).

I am a guy who NEEDS long anime.  If it's not at least 50 or so + eps I'm not really into it.  This anime, of 26 or so eps really left me thinking ""I would be happy if this was it....""  That's how satisfied I was by this anime.  However, a second season is out, and it was great too, but the first part was definitely the best!

This anime also had a lot of unique aspects.  The entire idea is genius, and the execution of the idea was very well done, and very well thought out.  It also makes you think what if this is how we lived?  It really draws you in with how it's all set up, and how the lives of the people are controlled by this system.  The main character was decently-unique and the progression was interesting with her, especially with her confrontations with the enemy.

I highly recommend this anime, it's definitely one of the best anime that I've seen and definitely one of the better anime out there.

There is a lot I can say, but I don't want to spoil this for people.  However if you like technology, futuristic shows, sci-fi, suspense, thrillers, and action this is your anime.  It's so unique, and so well done i cannot put into words about it.  Just watch :)

Let me know if there is any questions about this review."
132405,"Spoilers ahead.

I began reading the Bisque Doll manga before I even knew there was going to be an anime, and believe me when I say that I was thoroughly enjoying this story in the manga. I was interested in seeing the adaptation so I started watching week to week with the best intentions in mind. However, with each passing week, this anime helped point out to me just how flawed the story actually was.

Before I start to air my grievances though, let me pay some compliments to the show. I really believe that the essence which attracted me to the manga in the first place is still present here in droves. This is above all else, an easy to enjoy, wholesome, and extremely pretty slice of life anime, and sometimes that’s all you really need to be satisfied. 

Unfortunately, as soon as you start peeling away these enjoyable surface layers of sexy gyarus and cosplay culture you might be left as disappointed as I was. I’ll start with my dislike towards the main character duo and how empty they feel, this is probably my biggest issue with the story so far. 

img100%()

Wakana Gojo is as devoid of personality as the hina dolls he makes (or doesn’t make). He seems to be a character built with only stereotype in mind, from the way he looks to the way he acts. There is absolutely zero legitimate reason for him being shy and insecure in the way that he is other than to fit him in the loser archetype that makes for an easy self-insert in this style of story. With the exception of one minor incident during his childhood, at no point does anyone else judge or berate Gojo for his interest in making hina dolls. His insecure behavior is inconsistent and unjustified, every character which learns of his passion is supportive or even respectful towards it. 

img100%()

He constantly proclaims his dream of becoming a hina doll kashirashi even though at no point in the story is he shown pursuing this goal, Gojo completely abandons his passion in favor of creating cosplays. There is no emotional arc to this either, its simply an on/off switch, he even acknowledges the fact that he hasn’t been practicing the trade in a long time but then continues neglecting it.

I have less of a bone to pick with Marin, she’s a much more enjoyable character than Gojo but she kickstarts the events of the story in very dishonest ways. At the start of the anime, she tells Gojo that he’s being used, that he shouldn’t mindlessly do what others tell him to and that he should speak his mind, but then immediately after this, the message is abandoned when Marin herself asks Gojo to craft her cosplay. The worst part isn’t proving the message false, it’s rewarding Gojo for the behavior that Marin denounces, he is placed under immense stress by dealing with exams, his injured grandpa, taking care of the shop and working on the cosplay under an insane deadline, and in the end, this ends up being played as the correct course of action. 

img100%()

The romance is also completely one-sided. Marin overtly shows the audience that she is in love with Gojo but their relationship has barely progressed since the first episode. Gojo’s insecurity stops him from seeing Marin in the same way she sees him, and despite her attempts at casually spending more time together, the amorous feeling is never reciprocated to the same extent. 

img100%()

This would be my second biggest issue with the story. Failing to use cosplay as a means to explore the relationship between two people in any meaningful way. The story lays down a perfectly good foundation on which to analyze the budding romance between Gojo and Marin, however I feel that this is set aside in favor of otaku culture and general SoL shenanigans. There might be nothing wrong with this approach on the surface, but in my opinion, this leaves the story in a place where this very provocative hobby is not backed up by an authentic evolution of their relationship, and how the feelings they have for each other are affected by indulging in their passions.

To end this review, I’d like to reiterate that this is a fun show. Despite my criticisms I still enjoyed watching Bisque Doll on the week to week. If you’re unaffected by my complaints and just want to enjoy a calming anime with some indulgent cosplays throw into the mix then more power to you. I don’t hate this anime; I just wish it was better."
2904,"I don't really like considering the two seasons of Code Geass as two separate series, but for the purpose of this site, I suppose I have to. R2 is, of course, a direct continuation of the story from Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, taking place after only a short time leap and neatly wrapping up the cliffhanger ending on which the first season left off (and early on, too--no waiting for payoff). That said, while this season could feasibly be picked up on by itself (episode 1 of this season was actually the first I ever saw, which confused me greatly for a while), the big picture isn't going to make a whole lot of sense of anyone who hasn't seen the first season.

Now, since I employed an alternate review structure in my season 1 review, let's see if I can make my traditional format work for this one.



 Writing... hasn't faltered at all since season 1. In fact, towards the very end of the series, the story is stronger and more original than ever before. As stated in my previous review, I believe that Code Geass has what is likely the single most powerful ending of all time--for me, at the very least; I can say no wrong about it. The battles are even more explosive, entries more dynamic, and interactions more dramatic than ever before--something which, if you saw season 1, shouldn't seem possible. Characters all act with their own drives and motivations, each wearing his or her own mask in trying to change the world around them, and the end result is a bittersweet (but enthralling to watch) insight on human relations.

In all, I like to think of R2 as an ""amplified"" version of the first season--the politics are more intricate and engaging, and the drama more... well, dramatic. However, the school scenes did not escape this amplification--they're wackier and more invasive than ever. Which, again, doesn't bother me--I have no problem having a couple school comedy scenes intermingling with my epic political drama. If you are one of those people who found the school segments hard to stomach in season 1, though, know that you'll only find more of them in season 2. Though I'd like to think that if you made it all the way through the first season, you'll have a hard time not continuing the series. That's my hope, anyway.

 Art hasn't changed--it's just as angular, shiny, and bishonen as ever. If you like shiny, pretty things then you'll enjoy some very fluid animation and an interesting and unique art style. If not... well, the show's going to be jarring for you, to say the least. It's essentially the battle between old Slayers and new Slayers.

 Sound also doesn't really vary between the two seasons. All the original voice actors make reprisals, and new characters are all performed appropriately. As far as English goes, I'd say the poorly-cast voice roles are exclusive to season 1 characters--that is, none of the new characters introduced in R2 are poorly voiced (though some of those from season 1 are still around). I cannot myself speak for the Japanese dub. The soundtrack is the same one used in the first season, with a couple of new insert songs sprinkled in here and there, and it still works.



Code Geass is still my personal favorite series of all time, and between the two, I actually think season 2 is the stronger one, because... that ending. That goddamn ending. Beautiful. Anyway, despite the series matching all of my loves and interests flawlessly, it's not something for everyone, as the fiercely split opinions on the show will no doubt tell you. Watch the first episode or two of either season and you'll know what to expect from the whole show--many series take a little while to hit their stride and give you a good feel for the overall show, but Code Geass is not one of those series. It hits the ground sprinting and doesn't lose momentum--an incredibly enjoyable ride for yours truly, and I hope one for you, as well."
12189,"""I don't care if no one likes me. I wasn't created in this world to entertain everyone."" -Oreki Houtaro

It’s been a while since I’ve had such a lighthearted and chill anime like this one. The overall storyline was composed of a number of mysteries that a group of friends had to solve, but the real beauty in this anime was how they went about doing it. With meaningful and natural character interaction coupled with the masterful animation of Kyoto Animations, Hyouka presents us with a drama/mystery anime with just a touch of romance to add a bit of charm to it. While it may feel repetitive to some, I felt that most of the mysteries were interesting enough to keep me entertained. This was mainly because of my curiosity (no pun intended) in Oreki’s growth as a person. It was such a joy to watch Oreki grow and develop through the anime as he was affected by his friends, and ultimately allowing him to figure out what he truly is like on the inside. While the ending may not of satisfied some of you, I believe that’s because you were more focused on the romance instead of the actual plot. This anime wasn’t about romance, it was about Oreki. It was about Oreki coming out of his comfort zone and doing things he normally never would have done alone, all with the help and encouragement of his close friends. So without further ado, here’s my review!

Art and Animation: 9.4/10
- There’s no denying the fact that this anime had such amazing results when it came down to the art and animation. I really enjoyed all of the various character designs, and they really resonated with their personalities. The abundance of vibrant colors and breathtaking moments weren’t overused, which retained its impact when it counted most. I especially enjoyed the beginning and end of this anime, where we got a taste of what true animation looks like in all its beauty. There were only a few minor moments where the animation wasn’t as consistent as the rest of the time, but nothing major at all.

Storyline and Character Progression: 8.9/10
- When it came down to storyline, this anime could easily be a hit or miss for newcomers. Without a real story or objective to aim for, some may find the overdramatic mystery cases to be stale after a little while. Still, these mysteries had an amount of depth to them that couldn’t be ignored. They couldn’t be solved with some simple theories, but rather, careful deduction was needed to even get close to the truth. I also really enjoyed the small bits of comedy here and there that made me crack up a bit. There were even a good amount of moments with romantic tension that helped keep things interesting if the mysteries weren’t enough for you. The real beauty in this anime though is in the character development. The one that experiences the most development is our main protagonist Oreki Houtaro. It was definitely a joy to watch him grow throughout the entire anime as he was slowly affected by his friends various personalities and dispositions. While I did enjoy the other characters when their moment to shine arrived, none matured nearly as much as Oreki.

Soundtrack and Audio: 9.1/10
- The OPs in this anime were some of the most unique and beautiful I’ve ever seen. They were so well animated, and you could tell that a lot of care and effort were put into producing them. As far as musicality went, the first OP was my favorite of the two. Whenever music was used, it was very light and in moderation. In terms of audio, I found all the voice actors very pleasing to listen to. They all had really fit their characters and were able to express sincere emotion when the moment called for it. There were just a few minor characters that felt out of place when conversing, which took a little bit away from the environment and immersion.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed this anime for sure. From the various mysteries the group of friends found themselves solving, to the hilarious little moments they enjoyed, Hyouka was truly a beautiful anime to watch. My advice? Don’t focus or expect any serious romance from this one. It’s mainly a mystery/drama that’s geared towards character development, but the romance is light and used in a way that doesn’t take away from the main focus. This anime definitely deserves the score of 9.1/10 for its beautiful animation, surprising soundtrack, and engaging character development. Thanks so much for @Agasayan for recommending me this truly entertaining watch, see y’all in the next one!

Disclaimer: Looking back on this review, my wording and vocabulary are god-awful. Innumerable occurrences of editing daily, albeit I believe it's time to leave it how it is. Anyways, bear with me on this one. Thanks.

Re:Zero is one of those few anime sequels nowadays that introduces unique combinations of many compelling concepts, philosophical human ideologies, realistic emotions,  extensive world-building, scarily good horror, that all takes place in a world with fantasy elements. It's had these moments that genuinely gave me goosebumps with its overall presentation of a psychological-driven reality, while also adding in bits and pieces of nostalgic, emotional, and heartwarming moments through the eyes, of our main protagonist, Subaru, and with many more in-depth, important, and fleshed-out characters. In other words, Re:Zero is a rarity among Isekai that proves it can be taken seriously.

Through progression of time, Subaru has been in a state of cold isolation, depression, and suicide, while always recklessly preserving through destiny and fate itself, all for the sake of those he cherishes. However, this season of Re:Zero isn't mainly about a tragic hero attempting to save his loved ones.


 After being sent into Echidna's Windows XP background, Subaru seems to be more familiar with his position in reality. He's already experienced death itself, suffering, and despair while also experiencing the feeling of accomplishment, happiness, and affection for Emilia and Rem. Subaru's power, ""Return by Death"", seems to have been a blessing or a miracle to him. Being able to change one's destiny and future is what led him to save his loved ones from a cursed reality... But did he ever save himself?

Subaru is a fine example of how to write a flawed character. Even though his ideology is very similar to that of a shounen protagonist, wanting to save and protect those he cares about, his experiences with many introduced characters like Echidna have shaped him into who he has become. 

 This season is more focused on the Sanctuary's trial, or Echidna's trial's, Subaru, in a way, is very similar to Echidna, being greedy and selfish. She's manipulative, like Satella. However, it's still a fact that she ""shares'"" the burden with Subaru. But in reality, the story presents that Subaru was being selfish and greedy for many different reasons. Echidna, being the witch of greed, is essentially greedy for her own entire existence, being thirsty  for knowledge of the vast world, which leads to how manipulative she can be. Subaru's standpoint includes how he was greedy to save others, not himself, but from the fact that he was lost, confused, scared, and clouded by his power, ""Return by Death"" led to his own judgment of constantly dying, suffering, and sacrificing himself, not knowing how much personal turmoil had taken over his own existence.

 Subaru is progressing in three different aspects this season:

He's starting to develop and grow as a human being.

He's going down the route of essentially losing his humanity.

He's gradually applying self-worth.

 While Subaru was able to have endurance against reality, was he able to accept himself first, rather than others? Can Subaru trust those who have changed his life? Was he able to accept the reality forced onto him?

While all these questions flooded my head, I can still say that Subaru has a good sense of determination in his heart. He has genuine intentions and motivations while at the same time, maintaining his realistic persona and questionable decision-making. But also Subaru has his fair share of flaws as a character. He's overconfident at many things he tries to do, which is rather a given and logical for having a power like ""Return by Death."" Even his ""special power"" is considered weak, yet he is an immortal being. But most of all, Subaru's character isn't written in a way that makes you want to inherently feel sympathetic for him, but rather to express that... he's finally tired and lost in a horrid reality.

He's been doubtful of himself because of the regret that had flooded his heart, but he's been able to overcome his misgivings.This season wanted to emphasize that he hasn't yet fully overcome his obstacles before him. Subaru has been isolated and chained away by what seems to be unbreakable barriers, but he was never technically ""alone."" He's followed a path that has allowed him to gain friendships. But he's also had a multitude of personal problems and turmoils that, unfortunately, not many will ever understand his feelings and hatred because of the barriers that have ensnared him.

Subaru starts to follow this path where he can't decide if he can trust certain characters like Echidna, Roswaal, and Garfiel. Not only that, the further he involves himself with Emilia, the more disoriented and astray he becomes, because this time, he doesn't know a way to save ""them."" He starts to realize the ""bigger picture"" because of Beatrice and ""that person"". While all of these setbacks and ""trials"" Subaru is going through, It seems as though no one may succor, aid, or even understand all the battles Subaru is clashing with.

The anime community has been emotionally impacted because of the amount of credibility and weight his story holds. Subaru's been through so many phases. He has wanted to give up, because of how disoriented reality is, but he can't. Even though he wants to give up, he has no choice but to keep on living for the sake of those he adores. He essentially goes crazy and insane beyond human emotion. And after all of this, It felt as though he's been the only one shattering, but reality barges in, then the realization that came into his mind flings into him saying, ""You think you were the only one suffering by your power?"" And during the end, he finally learns the weight of his misgivings about the reality he was forced into by essentially admitting…

""I don't want to die.""

These weren't the same words from S1. These were the words of a person who was lost in time, but eventually came to realize the importance of self-worth and how cardinal and important his life is to others...

Though, at the same time, it's terrifying almost. Even though he knows that he is loved by others, he still feels alone at many times during the series. It's even more terrifying than knowing you are alone yet no one understands you. In Subaru's backstory, we are shown that he's always wanted others to like him. He's putting up a facade, because he has never accepted nor understood himself. His overconfidence manipulated him to believe in a fake reality where he's a ""wise"" man. But no, he was just lost in a endless loop of hell and terrified of the vast world full of hostility pointed right at him.The story explains major elements like anxiety, ""love"", and insecurity that are constantly present during the show which adds many toppings and layers to the psychological horror of Re:Zero.

But as the story progresses, Subaru has resisted constant temptation right at his hands, wanting him to essentially go down the ""IF route."" Thankfully, he's grown immensely in decision-making. He's starting to develop in a more realistic and relatable way throughout the series from the results of last season, and the payoff in Episode 4 was presented in a rewarding fashion, with bits and pieces of sentimentalism. Subaru is starting to understand himself, he's starting to put away the facade and the insecurity he's been carrying all this time.

Viewing this season partly felt like connecting a huge puzzle in an entertaining manner.  Major loose-ends were being tied together throughout the progression of the story, which really put a smile on my face. The overall storytelling and plot progression really brought impact and complexity to the story. I started to understand its lore and premise much better by how it emphasizes on characterization. Examples being the ideology and motivations of Roswaal and Echidna. I was impressed by the world-building that the story managed to introduce, which was one of the major factors that allowed the story to evolve into something much more. Examples being the introduction of the ""Great Rabbit."" Re:Zero managed to bring more importance and thrill to characterization, world-building, foreshadowing, and to its narrative. The intensive dialogue occurring in each episode brought amazing suspense, fluidity, and thrill with each scene. It delivered clear and shocking cliffhangers every episode. As such, It doesn't rely on one-note gimmicks but rather progresses the story instead, without leaving the viewer behind. 

From a general perspective, Echidna seems reminiscent of a mother figure towards Subaru. She's observant of him, and aided him with his past... yet actually, their relationship is that of a bank account. Roswaal seems to be more of a father-figure towards Subaru. He wants him to follow the same path he went through, yet it is shown that he and Subaru were never clearly on the same page in the story. Ultimately, we are met with the crooked actuality, showcasing that Echidna and Roswaal view Subaru as a tool, nothing more, nothing less.

There were several characters introduced to Re:Zero. But we still don't know much about them. All we were introduced to were slight glimpses of their personality, and how insane their mindsets are. But because of these character introductions and reintroductions It added more substance to the story itself. Things like the ""Great Rabbit"" were explained thoroughly and why creatures like it exist in the first place. More characters now seem to hold a purpose and importance to the story in a way that adds more fluidity and chemistry to the story that now has evolved into something that has surpassed its own prequel.

It has a good balance of everything. It isn't overly dramatic, nor isn't underwhelming. Important factors like these make headway for the overall foundation and theme of the story, leaning more towards the suspenseful side. Each buildup methodically spurring is what really carried the suspense. For example, the buildup of Echidna's monologue brought to the story was thought-provoking and shockingly impactful to the overall theme of the story. The overall presentation of the ""Castle of Dreams"" radiated an eerie atmosphere. Re:Zero had many insane and thrilling scenes that added spice to the plot, it still managed to stay on track with keeping it's overall theme present throughout the entire story. The story managed to establish meaningful relationships between characters such as Subaru with Otto, Emilia, Roswaal, Beatrice, Echidna, and Satella. Specifically Roswaal, I was in awe of how crooked and complex his ideology was. He seemed fishy a lot throughout the first season, but I usually put him off the hook most of the time. And I'm glad I did. Roswaal, What a mad lad. 

This tale is certainly ""dialogue-heavy"" for many viewers, as for some though, the dialogue made this season memorable specifically because of Echidna's monologue, Roswaal's philosophical aims, and Subaru's backstory. It  touched and supported its driving force. However, writing wise, it does lose itself within complex scenarios,  especially with the dialogue and complicating narrative perception, which is a sound argument. Because of its shortcomings, there weren't as many action-driven scenes as before, more so obsessed with dialogue, backstories, and cleaning up major questions and mysteries of the anime, which is the correct way to avoid major plot holes to the story. 

For further notice, if you are not a fan of complex and fast-paced dialogue like something out of the Monogatari series, you'll probably be disappointed with this sequel of Re:Zero. 

 I was rather impressed by the visuals seen in Subaru's backstory because of how properly sentimental the overall atmosphere was, which partly serves as appreciation for its wondrous musical score.  Because of this, highlights would have to be Episode 4 and Episodes 12-13 personally. Specifically, what caught my eye was the soundtrack, opening, and ending themes. I'm very delighted to see that the producers didn't change most of the OST's due to the fact that it emphasizes so much on development and atmosphere.

 Re:Zero truly has a charm of its own.The franchise itself has managed to bring and smoothly execute compelling ideas to the table, while gaining a loyal fandom and immense popularity. It stays consistent and entertaining because of all the meticulous ideas it manages to introduce. All throughout, it stays honest, bestowing us a long-awaited sequel, topping its successor, which truly is a delight to witness. Re:Zero understands ""unpredictability."" It takes an immeasurable amount of twists and turns with its characters, action sequences, dialogue scenarios and plot twists. Garfiel, Roswaal, Beatrice, Satella, and Echidna being a fine example of this. You can't really tell who is ""righteous"" or ""evil"" firsthand through Subaru's perspective because of multiple new characters involved and how mysterious some characters are that were already introduced back then. White Fox knows their general set of viewers scarily well. So far, I'm really pleased to see the overall direction it is moving towards, not from how this sequel ended, but the overall improvements it had managed to successfully execute.

There's still a plethora of questions which haven't been answered yet, and that's precisely why it keeps me entertained and invested in how the story progresses as a whole. All in all, If you dislike season 1 as a whole, I won't recommend this anime to you because of how much complexity and dialogue is added to the story. To people who want to understand how thought-provoking season 2 is, I highly recommend that you rewatch this season to further your understanding of how the anime progresses. Maybe not right away, though be sure to come back. Don't fret, the rewatch value of this anime is pretty damn splendid to say so myself. And as a fan of this story, I'm thrilled to see what Re:Zero has to offer in the foreseeable future."

A show like this for the average anime viewer would be extremely difficult to watch, mostly because you have to memorize the names of all the characters as well as some aspects of the show if you're not paying attention, but it gets a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable as you progress down the line. 

Fate/Zero is a relatively simple show when you hear what it's about: In this world, there are some people with magic in their blood who are called mages. Every 60 years, an omnipotent wish granting device known as the Holy Grail chooses 7 mages across the entire globe to participate in the Holy Grail War. These mages are known as Masters. In this war, each Master gets a historical figure known as a Servant to fight for them in the war. The Masters, along with their Servants, then compete with each other to the death, with the winner obtaining the rights to have their wish granted by the Holy Grail.

Fate/Zero has, in essence, all of the tools it requires to succeed as a standalone show rather than a prequel to the Fate series; so that is exactly how I am going to review this show. Out of every show I have seen so far, Fate/Zero was the pinnacle of perfection when it came to exactly what needed to be done; in terms of execution and closure. This show was full of war and bloodshed, along with psychological deception and strategy. The show also depicts greatly that, out of all the Holy Grail Wars, both future and past, this war had the most powerful Servants across every class, which made this show even more entertaining to watch, as we are under the perception that because the greatest Servants of past and future are participating, we are witnessing the greatest war of all Holy Grail Wars unfold. An even greater point is that each Master is fighting for their own wish, and because of that, you get to see the events surrounding every individual in this show and the different paths they all take in an attempt to win the war. This makes the show feel even more rewarding, as although every Master is fighting to have their wish granted, they all have different motivations for wanting the Holy Grail, whether it be a good wish or an evil wish.

The Anti Hero: Kiritsugu Emiya

Kiritsugu Emiya is the masterpiece of this entire show, and not only because he is the main character. Kiritsugu is the pinnacle of tragedy as you continue to watch the show. In the beginning, his attitude is unclear, as he only states that with his wish, he wants to save the world and end world conflict. The viewers feel a sense of irony, since Kiritsugu is a mage assassin and has dedicated his whole life to killing. As the show unfolds, he begins to realize that the meaning of victory becomes meaningless as more bodies pile up and more people die, which is why he wants his wish granted in the first place.

Spoilers Ahead: !Kiritsugu wins the Holy Grail War and attempts to have his wish granted. However, the Holy Grail presents Kiritsugu with the boat dilemma. As the Grail continues the questioning, it becomes more and more clear that Kiritsugu would end up killing more people than he intends to save, which throws him into a state of despair because he realizes that to save one, you must kill another. The Grail then presents Kiritsugu with a choice: live out the rest of his life with Irisviel and his daughter, but at the cost of killing off the rest of the population of the world. This is where Kiritsugu's flaw is somewhat ""beautiful"": he rejects the wish of the Holy Grail in order to save the world, because he impulsively wishes to kill less to save more. As a result, the Grail is destroyed and curses Kiritsugu, and the city is engulfed in flames. Kiritsugu then finds a boy in the rubble and adopts him as his own son. Since Kiritsugu did not return the Holy Grail back to the family of his wife and daughter, he is no longer allowed to see his daughter, so he spends the rest of his life with the boy he saved, and dies 5 years later as a result of the curse bestowed upon him by the Holy Grail.!

Fate/Zero will have you constantly itching to watch the next episode, constantly aching to know what's going to happen next. This feeling alone is why it is impossible to rewatch this show, regardless of how much you enjoyed it. A psychological thriller is only entertaining when you cannot expect or know what will happen. I personally tried to rewatch this by showing it to my friends while I watched with them, and I did not get the same spark of enjoyment I got when I first watched this show. This is a masterpiece, a beautiful one at that. This is a show that is only meant to be watched once, and to enjoy every moment that you can."
431,"This is the first official review i've ever done and i am pursuing a career in film, i will learn and grow as I develop a stronger passion for the media. So enjoy! or not.

Let me start off by saying this is the best anime dub i HAVE EVER heard. Look at the cast too, Christian Bale and Billy Crystal. Every single character sounded like they were full of life unlike the previous ones, where it seemed like there was at least ONE flaw in the voice acting before. But this dub voice acting is better than most western media. Christian Bale captured Howl's playfulness and sometimes brash attitude at time. As well as Billy Crystal bringing the comedic relief as he always has with his iconic voice. Now that that point is made, let me talk about the OST. There is no possible way you can be in the anime community for longer than a year or 2 and not have heard the main theme. It's iconic. Each song played fit the exact tone and emotions when it needed to and the soundboarding was spot on. 

Ghibli has always had gorgeous themes that make us think. Grave of the Fireflies makes you think about how human vs. human conflict always ruin the lives of a 3rd party and to never take life for granted. Princess Mononoke makes you think about how our actions as humanity has different effects on not only other societies, but our planet as a whole. Whisper of the Heart makes you realize that its not an outside influence or ambition that makes us who we are or what we want to be, its passion for something. This one follows a timid and boring hat maker who offended an evil witch somehow so she was cursed to be an old woman. She then moves into a famous wizard's home to be hired as a cleaning lady and through various events, they fall in love and live happily ever after. As cliche as that would sound, the way they went about it was amazing. Each and every single character in this was flawed and had their own thing going on. They tried to better themselves or capitalize on things to help them. Even the antagonists had their justifiable motives and reasons. Howl by no means was perfect but was a perfect fit for Sophie and vice versa. He was lazy, somewhat brash at times, vain, and he tended to run away from all of his problems despite being SO powerful. His outward image did not match his actual personality. They learned their lessons and tried to be together eventually. To be honest the reason why i brought up the lessons thing was because, i couldn't find one in this story. It wasn't a one dimensional story, it was an experience in its own right.

I mean, it's Ghibli with its highest budget yet. It's so lively and fluid but simple and not over the top. If you have ever seen a Miyazaki film you would understand what i mean. It's the best among its genre.

While i did not enjoy it as much as Princess Mononoke on just premise and genre alone, i did enjoy the animation, characters (aside from San), music and overall upbeat vibe it gave off. Even in the darkest moments there was still an uplifting aura to the story that i couldn't grasp the concept of. The more i watched the more i was immersed into its lore and story. I wish it never ended. Anything that makes me appreciate the craft more and inspires me to do what i love to do is a once in a lifetime thing. This movie made me want to do reviews on a regular basis from now on instead of discussing it with my friends, because i love sharing my opinions and seeing other people's opinions on certain things even if i disagree. What i'm trying to say is, i guess i have a new favorite movie. Highly recommend to anyone who loves fantasy or just inspirational films in general"
99750,"After a long 2 month review hiatus, I'm finally back. Most probably didn't miss my meaningless opinions, yet unfortunately, I'm back to sharing them. Anyway, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas. I've only seen the anime movie, so that's where all my opinions are coming from. If they're inconsistent with certain things that differ in the novel/live action movie, that's why. To be honest, I basically went into the movie blind. I only knew that one of the characters was dying and that was the main driving force behind the plot. It was a little bit of a strange feeling since, usually, I know a little of what's going on in the movie before I see it. But anyway, enough of that, on to the review.

In regard to the music in I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, I really enjoyed what I heard. There wasn't anything that I thought was incredibly distinct to push it to amazing status, but it was certainly not a bad soundtrack. The opening and ending songs by Sumika were the true highlights of the movie, musically speaking, though I'll have to express my partiality towards the ending, Shunkashuutou. I have to mention that the voice acting was also very good, especially Sakura's voice actor, Lynn. Everyone else was solid too, but she really stood out from the rest, even if it was because her character was the most emotive of the cast.

Visually, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas is gorgeous. I mean, all you have to is take one look at any screenshot, wallpaper, or whatever else there is and you'll be able to tell.

There is so much beauty in the artwork of this movie that it's almost overwhelming, even if it isn't as beautiful as something like Garden of Words or Your Name (Which I consider to be the most beautiful movies I've ever seen). It's weird though, I've seen a lot of complaints about how bad the animation is, which puzzles me a bit, because I never noticed any bad animation per se. Maybe there were certain moments where the animation was a little more jagged than it could have been, but there was never a moment in the movie where I actively noticed any bad animation. I think that it could have been better animated, but the complaints about poor animation seem somewhat unfounded if you ask me.

I'm not even going to bother picking my favorite character, since it's so obvious who I'd pick.

Sakura just dominates the movie with her personality and charm, even if, by her own admittance, it is an act sometimes. I believe the characters of this movie won't get as much appreciation as they deserve for being so realistically deep and layered. While I mean the main two characters, even the side characters aren't particularly one dimensional either, though I have to wonder if the light novel expands upon them more than the anime movie does.  The main two's lack of one dimensionality really elevates I Want to Eat Your Pancreas to a much higher level and this is displayed through the main couple's relationship and interactions. And that is the main draw to watch I Want to Eat Your Pancreas. If nothing else, just their relationship makes it a worthy watch, though some may find the energetic, popular girl x the loner, bookish guy to be a tired trope. And I'll be honest, this probably won't be a breath of fresh air for you in regards to that. But what it is is a display of two people finding exactly what they need in each other, despite how impossibly different they are. It's a really heartwarming relationship to be quite honest with you, even if it's destined to come to end at some point.

I Want to Eat Your Pancreas didn't make me cry, but it did make me feel a deep sadness for these characters, because I had grown so attached to them over the course of the movie. I don't want to go into too much detail on such things, since that would go deep into spoiler territory, but suffice it to say that even when you're expecting something bad, it's still hard to accept when that bad thing inevitably comes about, and in this case, it is a bittersweet pill to swallow.

There's not a lot of depth to I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, at least, depth in the traditional sense. Instead, there's a lot of emotional and personal nuance in this movie, which was really interesting to see play out. These days, we're used to these grand works with many characters, each as deep as a puddle. But I Want to Eat Your Pancreas goes in the opposite direction and it pays off in a big way. A more personal way. A more relatable way."

A funny, colorful, cute, heartwarming , wonderful and romantic anime.

Plot:

The Story is something completely new. I've seen many romance and school anime but this one, is one of my favorites, there are many good romance & school anime but this story is based on the Chuunibyou syndrome and it continues hand in hand with the genres.  There is so much variety and love in each episode. An ordinary boy meets an crazy and cute girl, which lives in her own world and gets pulled back little by little in this lifestyle, decorated with comedy and few colorful fantasy journeys and surprising little events. The story keeps your excitement and makes you smile the most time. 



Characters:
Each character is individual, and this individuality makes it so varied. There was no such moment that I felt this character might appear too often or too less. Some of the characters have known each others before but each of them are ready for new things and new people. Rikka is the most outstanding character but this doesn't make you forget about the other protagonists. They're all connected  to each others somehow and that is why I really like every character.

Animation & Music
This part is definitely one of the strongest effect it had on me. You can't enjoy a anime if the animators didn't  put heart and soul in their work. The strong and different colors at the beginning just shocked me, I was so impressed they payed attention to the feeling of the scenes and chose the colors that would match the most. It is very detailed, even the background this devotion in everything makes it wonderful and a good anime worth to watch even without hearing but the sound is just as impressive. The opening and the ending is awesome, the background music in some scenes gave me goosebumps and I cant hear very good but I really enjoyed the animation and the music in harmony with the story.



All in all, a very funny anime with highs and deeps and a must watch for every anime fan

>I really hope this review waked your interests in Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! This was my first review ever, and I'm not a native English speaker but I hope you all could understand what potential this anime has and how funny it is. If you have feedback to this review or some big mistakes you found just write me I would really appreciate that."
98460,"Devilman Crybaby directed by [Masaaki Yuasa](https://anilist.co/staff/100068/Masaaki-Yuasa) ([The Tatami Galaxy](https://anilist.co/anime/7785/The-Tatami-Galaxy/), [Kaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/3701/Kaiba/), [Ping Pong](https://anilist.co/anime/20607/Ping-Pong-the-Animation/), etc) is a fucking wonderful and goofy ride from beginning to end. Gore, weird sexual shit, and human suffering all over the place. Thanks, Netflix! 

img440()

No censorship whatsoever, let's just dive right i--well okay. The blood of demons is like mustard yellow? But I guess that was an actual specific design choice maybe? 

img440()

Apparently the blood of demons in the [original manga](https://anilist.co/manga/31474/Devilman/) or other Devilman adaptations is supposed to be/was red but... I get it, it would have been a lot of red on the screen if everyone bled the same. The demons bleed mustard, it's... acceptable, I guess. After all, just because their blood isn't red doesn't make their deaths any less violent than the deaths of the various humans.

img440()

But no just jumping right into it, this series was fucking fantastic. But personally, I almost had a hard time taking it seriously half of the time? I mean yes, the gore is over the top, and there is certainly a darker tone throughout a lot of the show (not just the end), it was still... almost silly. In a refreshing way. Oh, and I should note that I had zero knowledge of anything Devilman prior to watching Crybaby.

 

The show is just so openly heavy handed with a lot of the more emotional or darker sequences and/or scenes. As a matter of fact, initially, I was honestly kind of not having this show. 

img440()

I was just kind of bored and uninterested for a good portion of the first episode, but then Ryo showed up, snatched away our main character Akira, and then just immediately goes to a nightclub to start an actual bloodbath.

img440()

There are just so many big tonal shifts or things that almost felt like they were too silly? Like the fact that the original 70s Devilman exists in the Crybaby version of the universe. Like Akira's entire character after changing into Devilman. Like the rap group. When the rap first started, I just immediately wanted it to stop. But by the end of the show, I realized the rap group actually fitted surprisingly well within the puzzle that is Devilman Crybaby.

To be honest, there were plenty of moments that I felt that were very obviously out to get the viewer to feel emotional. A lot of these moments didn't really work for me? 

img440()

But that's maybe just me, because I'm assuming not many people who watched this were actively cheering on for more death. Unfortunately, going into this, I was very familiar with a [certain series](https://anilist.co/manga/30002/Berserk/) that was heavily inspired by Devilman, so that led to my viewing experience being irrevocably altered.

As from the very beginning, I had numerous assumptions about certain characters. Despite this though, I really, really, really liked a certain character. Ryo. I could take or leave Akira. 

img440()

Ryo was just so fucking cool from beginning to end and the fact that there is a character who causes all of the havoc and mayhem of a series by taking his best friend to a nightclub and then starting a massacre with his own two hands (and a broken bottle) is amazing.

!Also, the fact that he's literally Satan and has indirectly or directly caused the deaths of pretty much everyone Akira loved or cared about is pretty great too. Speaking honestly, I probably should have hated Ryo more as an antagonist what with everything he had done but... he's fucking literally Satan. What else would you expect?!

...You know, me saying that I essentially didn't care about the emotional weight of most of this series would make you think I disliked this series. But it's quite the opposite. Like the three main words I would use to describe Devilman Crybaby is goofy, gory, and fun. Yet the series literally ends with...

!essentially basically everyone dead and the entire world completely destroyed, and Ryo Satan is finally realizing what sorrow is after he bisected the only person he actually cared about. Then apparently God resets the entire world for the whole thing to play all over yet again.!

img440()

The gore. The [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiAp85OVaJ4). The demons. The excessive emotion manipulation (that fucking baton, jesus christ). The endless amounts of death. The animation that consistently walks the tightrope between goofy and over the top. These are the primary reasons why I loved Devilman Crybaby. As a matter of fact, as far as like action series go, it's certainly up there for one of the ones that have entertained me the most recently. I think no matter what your personal opinion ends up being on this show, you gotta at least admit that it's unique.

img440()

...I gotta give it a 99 out of 100. There's just no denying how much enjoyment I actually got out of it. I've more than once said that gore isn't everything but you know... the entertaining and crazy action stacked on top of it made it work in my opinion. It almost feels like I am absolutely restricted from not loving it. Like if it wasn't for some of the purposely goofier stuff (the fucking rap) and some of the... sexual stuff, I almost 100% loved this series through and through.

img440()

Like wow, who knew. An adaptation of an overly violent and dark series with very strange sexual stuff apparently CAN work in 2018. You just need people who want to actually make it. And... people who are actually talented and/or know what they're doing. And... a way around the very obvious limitations that censorship is gonna put on it. And... probably money... and... if the original manga series is actually concluded and not indefinitely in-progress, that... also probably helps.

img15()

AHEM. Devilman Crybaby! Watch it! If you haven't already. As long as you're not averse to horribly violent and/or sexual stuff! And maybe you'll actually respond better emotionally to the story because unlike me, maybe you're not a fucking psychopath. 

Because arguably one of the most messed up scenes of the entire show, I would maybe actually probably describe it with the word beautiful. Granted, it's of course also fucking grisly and dark, but it's beautiful!

I love Devilman Crybaby!"

Video games have been a massive part of my life for as long as I can remember. Whether it be building massive dirt houses in [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), spending countless hours grinding in [Metin2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metin2) or playing Empire Earth for half a day without taking a single break, these moments are something I will cherish till the end of time.

And it is that sense of unfiltered marvel, never-ending curiosity, world-bending control and non-stop fun that countless anime and manga (or, in this case, [manhwa](https://anilist.co/manga/105398/Na-Honjaman-Level-Up/)) have been effortlessly and desperately trying to replicate, yet to no avail. As a result of their clumsy and unsuccessful attempts, the video game genre in animanga has morphed into a disgraceful, repulsive laughing stock that is synonymous with paper-thin characters, one-dimensional plot, repetitive action, laughable developments and a general lack of wit.

Why am I even bringing all this up? Well, the answer is pretty obvious: Solo Leveling is the textbook example of how egregious the concept has become and how low the writing can sink when sucking off the main character is the only thing it has going for it. It is beyond infuriating, but anyone with a working keyboard can say this much. To really grasp what it does wrong, I need to put on my imaginary diving suit and dive deep into the absolute abyss that is the anime's narrative.



But, hold your (sea) horses just yet. Before I venture into these crushing depths, I need to go over the positives first. Yes, despite my low score and extremely negative stance on Solo Leveling, I must admit that it is not completely devoid of merit. There are three elements worthy of commendation for their quality, albeit their positive effect on the series is overshadowed by the vomit-inducing odour of the other components: the voice acting, the action sequences and, more or less, the production values.

Although I rarely mention voice acting in my reviews, in this case, it is pretty much mandatory. While every actor involved in the project brought their A-game, [Taito Ban](https://anilist.co/staff/151336/Taito-Ban) went above and beyond and crushed all the expectations. His visceral screams, delicate whispers and chilling talks are so fantastic that listening to his performance was pure joy and I could barely hide how in awe of his talent I was during every episode. Even if the script he was supplied with is awful on every level, he poured his heart into the role, and I have nothing but respect for him and the rest of [the seiyuu.](https://anilist.co/anime/151807/Ore-dake-Level-Up-na-Ken/characters)

When it comes to the production values, the situation gets a little bit more hectic, as they are simultaneously impressive and inconsistent.

While the visuals are insanely energetic and bombastic during the numerous fight scenes that take place in the show, they are completely lifeless outside of them. The character designs are uninspired and boring, the colours are horrendously bland, the background art looks generic beyond human comprehension, the art style does not come even remotely close to the art of the source material (which is its biggest strength) and it looks very unimpressive, the animation fluctuates between being fluid and smooth like butter and chaotically rigid and stiff, the lightning is lifeless, the editing is mostly solid and the camerawork is pretty inoffensive as well. Overall, our eyes are either treated to a zany and zappy showcase of talent and passion, or a tiring and tasteless blend of colours, shapes and figures, which does not instil excitement in the audience one bit.

Thankfully, I have nothing but praise for [Sawano](https://anilist.co/staff/103509/Hiroyuki-Sawano)'s soundtrack, as his tracks make every moment in which they appear ten times better. It is genuinely impressive how much energy these simple tunes carry on their backs, and Solo Leveling desperately needs them to be in top shape to squeeze as much excitement out of its fight scenes as possible. What more can I say, really? The man just does not miss.

On the topic of action segments, they are the last component I can say is well-executed, well-organised and packs a wallop. Although their quality varies from one encounter to another, it is safe to say that they are at the very least competent in what they deliver. Take, for example, the fourth episode's clash between the protagonist and the snake boss. Despite some of its weirder moments here and there, it is a really decent watch. On the other hand, the showdown between [Jin-Woo](https://anilist.co/character/129928/JinU-Seong) and [Igris](https://anilist.co/character/145722/Igris) that takes place in the eleventh episode is absolutely terrific on all fronts, as the visuals and the soundtrack amped its batshit crazy energy to a whole new level.

And, Thank God these scenes are this cool-looking because everything that leads up to them is, to put it politely, horrendous and tedious as hell.



Firstly, there is the story, and it is quite a doozy. The entire premise of the series revolves around the sudden appearance of otherwordly portals throughout the world, and alongside their arrival, came the rise of hunters, who are, essentially, human beings with access to magical spells and abilities. Among them is the protagonist who, in the beginning, is a complete loser, but, thanks to a weird phenomenon, he expectedly ([because the synopsis spoils this development, duh](https://anilist.co/anime/151807/Ore-dake-Level-Up-na-Ken/)) gains the ability to ""level up"" (i.e. get more powerful with each enemy slain, duh²) and his reality becomes something akin to a video game.

It is the very premise of the show that is a giant eyesore. Why is the basis of the story so weird and out of place? Why does the power the protagonist obtains have to be video-game-based? Why does it have to be here in the first place? The answer is simple: it is much, much easier and more advantageous to adopt a concept based on something as universally beloved as video games than create one entirely from scratch, without relying on the already existing appeal of something. However, as beneficial as it is to the popularity of the series, it is extremely detrimental to the plot itself as it is horribly implemented, ill-conceived and hilariously half-baked.

Think about it like this: one of the hooks of the premise is the fact that contemporary society is invaded by monsters from a completely alien dimension, and people need to defend themselves and their homelands from the invaders by using their newly acquired powers and resources they gather from these portals and monsters' remains. That alone sounds interesting enough to offer an ample dose of brainless yet charming entertainment. Better yet, you can grab that extremely simplistic foundation, take it in an infinite number of directions and transform a simple notion into something truly special.

So why tarnish it with some gamer-tailored bullshit that does not fit the established setting one bit? Why blend a reality-based plot with a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) [let's play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27sPlay) when these two mix together as well as water and oil? A more organic power progression system that does not have to rely on video game gimmicks to ""make sense"" would have been far more fitting and conceptually sound for the narrative. What if the protagonist got possessed by an ancient spirit or his hunter abilities mutated due to an unknown power found deep within the double dungeon? I think that it would be a lot more exciting and compelling to see than resorting to half-witted RPG-inspired elements that take you out of the experience completely.

However, it seems the anime perceives its audience as simple-minded gremlins that eat, breathe and sleep video games, and so we are stuck with this cringeworthy, tacky hogwash that prioritises pandering to gamers over being logical and well-fitting within the confines of the setting and the story.

But does it really matter if this whole game-like power is well-integrated into the series DNA when it exists solely for Jin-Woo's sake? Does anything matter when the world, its inhabitants, and everything else are nothing more than his belongings? This is Jin-Woo's sandbox, and, as you have probably realised, he is the show's most prominent issue by far.

He is the type of main character I vehemently hate with all my being. He is not merely a person who pushes the plot forward through their actions and is the talking point of the series, but rather a parasitic, [Gary Stu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarySue)-esque self-insert that devours and spits out every single part of the narrative that is not about him and steals screen time and importance from everyone and everything else. At first, he is a massive pushover and his fellow hunters make his life hell (of course, in an extremely cartoonish and laughable manner because who cares about nuance, right?). They constantly call him weak, laugh behind his back and remind their colleagues that he is a worthless E-rank goober. After the infamous incident that happens in the first two episodes, the plot literally bends over and lets Jin-Woo dominate it for hours on end. Regardless of what gets thrown at him, he always emerges victorious with minimal or zero damage to speak of.

Is he tired or injured? Do not worry because the epic gamer system (which only he can access and exploit) can conveniently heal his wounds and instantly eliminate his exhaustion. Does an entity that is technically more powerful than Jin-Woo attack him? Haha, no biggie; he wins no matter how immense the gap between their power levels is, and the wretched creature that dared to treat him as something lesser than a God is humiliated, put into their place and turned into a joke. Does the situation seem dire and it appears to be impossible to take care of it? Pfft, the second he arrives at the scene, the problem disappears in the blink of an eye.

The real question here is: why ought I to give a flying fuck about someone that does not face any challenges, hardships, perspective-altering experiences or personality-defining moments? I should not because, as a consequence of his ridiculous overpoweredness, the series is utterly devoid of stakes and thrill.

Whether it be the protagonist's arrival at the test dungeon in episode 4, his attempts to enter the demons' castle, his fight with Igris or his encounters with other hunters (generic bad guys) that were out to get him, Jin-Woo is never truly in danger because the show always discovers some bullshit way to make him come out on top... or he merely relies on his godlike capabilities and simply pretends to struggle for a cheap sense of excitement and a shallow adrenaline rush. At no point during the season's run are the viewers ever concerned about the well-being of the main character nor do they question whether he is strong enough to take on the enemy at hand. Time and time again, we are shown that he is a massive snowflake who will get whatever he pleases with the minuscule effort put in.

Sure, in the beginning, he undertakes tasks aimed at making him stronger (though they are absolutely ludicrous in their difficulty since hunters are, essentially, superhuman beings, so doing the whole [OPM](https://anilist.co/anime/21087/One-Punch-Man/)-esque training regime feels like a nasty joke instead of something honestly demanding), yet the whole process is contained and wrapped up in about two episodes. By the fifth episode, we basically reach a point where the protagonist always reigns at the top of the food chain much like an apex predator, and every entity within his vicinity should bow down to his super shredded physique (which he conveniently gains for no apparent reason) and his totally ""badass"" powers. He can proclaim that someone is stronger than him all he wants, but that is true for a brief, fleeting moment; the pace at which his power grows is so asinine that opponents who once surpassed him in strength and ability are now nothing more than a bunch of pawns to him. Whenever he defeats a stronger enemy, the show remains quick on its feet and masterfully bullshits its way out of the situation by throwing around random excuses like ""Oh, he was merely lucky,"" ""If he did not dodge this, he would be dead meat,"" or ""He barely won.""

Such a scenario can be tolerated if it happens once or twice, not when it is a constant occurrence that not even once is questioned or transformed into something more believable.

I definitely blame the pacing for this, as it is yet another issue that stems directly from Jin-Woo's presence, but it also makes him somehow worse. Solo Leveling fails to grant any of its ideas, plot points or characters the breathing room that is necessary for them to develop organically and prosper, which just leaves them dangling like a ballsack. The episodes are either stretched so thin that they lose their impact (episode 1 and episode 2 are a great example of this because, for some unknown reason, the double dungeon incident is bogged down by the horrendous exposition dumps and clumsy, awkward attempts at worldbuilding) or they progress so quickly and contain so much cramped content that they feel too overstuffed (we do not need to learn about the [Jeju Island](https://solo-leveling.fandom.com/wiki/JejuIsland) expedition when the protagonist is in the middle of a fight; this merely ruins the already non-existent tension even further). Of course, the rapid growth of the protagonist does not help the situation one bit, as each and every episode raises the bar higher and higher as if the show wanted to conclude the entirety of its content in a measly 12-episode long season. However, knowing the source material, I know that this is merely [the beginning of the long and drawn-out showcase of Jin-Woo's supposed amazingness](https://anilist.co/anime/176496/Ore-dake-Level-Up-na-Ken-Season-2--Arise-from-the-Shadow/), and soon his package will grow so big the other personages will be forced to suck it 24/7.



Ah, right, I need to talk about them as well...

Truth be told, there are no other characters here. Sure, it is a factually incorrect thing to say since, as you can see on [Solo Leveling's page](https://anilist.co/anime/151807/Ore-dake-Level-Up-na-Ken/characters), there are plenty of other hunters and non-hunters within the story. However, even though they have different names, faces, abilities and whatnot, they hardly classify as living and breathing beings. They are just a bunch of toys the protagonist plays with, human-shaped obstacles he needs to overcome, figures that he needs to surpass in prowess ASAP, background fillers, exposition-spouting machines, yesmen that love every fibre of his being, moustache-twirling, zero-dimensional evildoers who are introduced only to be soundly defeated by him, and female orbiters that exist solely to be his love interest and have nothing else to say or show. It is painfully obvious how little all these different ""people"" (can hardly call them that when their personalities, motivations, goals and ideals do not exist) matter in Solo Leveling's eyes, and it is frustrating how mistreated, underutilised and poorly written they are. Why even introduce a slew of characters when you are unable to make a single one of them feel like a human and not a cardboard cutout? So that the self-insert protagonist is constantly validated, praised and commended for his actions and strength or doubted and underestimated just so he can prove the ""haters"" wrong? That seems to be the case here, and I cannot stomach this unhealthy, off-putting circlejerk, and, trust me, it will only get worse in future seasons.

Of course, the dialogue mirrors the quality of the caricatures that deliver it. It is riddled with bizarre and awkward exposition dumps, repetitive sentences that constantly remind the viewers how great the protagonist is/how weak he used to be, and hilariously inept statements that either:

A) exist solely to trick the viewer into believing there are stakes present (e.g. ""He is much stronger than me!"" or ""I only won because I was lucky!"")

or

B) attempt to breathe life into its cast but fail miserably since actions speak louder than words/a few sentences murmured under one's breath hardly constitute apt character development (e.g. ""The stronger I get, the more I feel something inside of me falling apart."").

The dialogue is truly as nuanced and subtle as a sledgehammer, and listening to these atrocious lines makes the already piss-poor experience somehow even worse.

All of these factors come together to form the ultimate reason why I genuinely dislike Solo Leveling: it is boring to an absurd degree, and watching it all happen in front of me was incredibly unpleasant. Although I never discuss my enjoyment in my write-ups because I deem it unnecessary (my arguments already spell it out for the reader), in the case of this anime, your enjoyment is more crucial than the story or the characters. It, essentially, defines the show's worth; Jin-Woo and his crew pray day in and day out that you will forgive them for their sinful flaws and enjoy their antics from start to finish.

If Solo Leveling is the type of series that lives and dies by the hype and entertainment value, then, naturally, as someone who was not charmed by the one-dimensional protagonist or the fundamentally atrocious foundation on which the plot stands, I did not find any enjoyment here. The fight scenes might look awesome and have insane tracks attached to them, but they evoke as many emotions as reading the ingredients on the back of a bottle of chemicals you picked up because you forgot to bring your phone to the bathroom. The production values might be impressive when the situation calls for it, but I do not appreciate any of the elements that constitute them, and I would much rather chew on a copper wire than watch the first episode again. To top it all off, the main character is such an aggravating snowflake that observing the constant glorification of his character makes me want to pull my hair out.

There is absolutely nothing engaging here, and I could not find a single thing to be excited about. No stakes, no consequences, no thrill and no fun—that is what Solo Leveling amounted to.



Sigh...

Before you stab me with your pitchforks and burn me at the stake for this blasphemous write-up, let me clarify that this is not a ploy to dissuade anyone from watching this show. If you genuinely sense it will be a great time, then I urge you with all my being to give it a go and see for yourself how much it is worth.

That being said, it is quite obvious how I feel about it as a whole, so I will spare you the long-winded conclusion I envisioned in my mind and keep these closing remarks as short as possible.

To sum it all up, Solo Leveling embodies the idea of mindless entertainment to a tee, and its fate depends heavily on your ability to shut down your brain and let your eyes and ears have all the fun. If you are able to do that, then this one will be a total blast. Otherwise, well, the series will be as pleasant as sticking your head into a washing machine, turning it on and cranking up the spin cycle to the max.

And I reckon I do not have to tell you which one of these applies to me...

I am getting dizzy...

5081,"Words can't begin to describe how brilliant Bakemonogatari is. The writing is fantastic and thought-provoking, and the combination of cinematography, sound design, art design, animation... basically all the components of anime are utilized to their fullest to create a compelling experience that is a joy to revisit.

Bakemonogatari is driven by mysteries and witty dialogue between its colorful and beautifully written (and performed) cast of characters, who discuss innocent topics which end up revealing volumes about the people speaking. The themes they explore are very relatable for young adults and the way these characters act, while ludicrous in other ways, make them feel so real. Their exchanges are philosophical, but not in a pretentious or preachy way, and the superb writing and direction give rise to a signature cleverness and charm that make Bakemonogatari endlessly entertaining.

The cinematography, animation, and art design are one of a kind, with a style of bizarre imagery and scene transitions that is rare in anime outside of the Monogatari series. Despite how ridiculous the imagery can seem at times, it’s never meaningless. Instead, it plays an extremely effective role in accentuating the mood and feel of scenes, and is able to convey the emotions and inner thoughts of the characters without the need for words. This all combines with the dialogue to create a pensive tone that puts the onus on the audience to be able to piece together the stories and motivations of the characters through their different perspectives. This perplexing nature of Bakemonogatari is what keeps drawing me back to rewatch it, and each time I do, I feel like I understand or notice something new.

All in all, Bakemonogatari is an absolute masterpiece that oozes personality. It’s brilliant in so many ways and I can’t think of another anime that executes its unique ideas in such a signature way. The reason why I did not include any examples in this review is because I strongly believe that Bakemonogatari should be watched with as little previous knowledge as possible, and that excessive details or spoilers would ruin the experience. It’s a must-watch and I would strongly suggest revisiting this series after your first viewing. 

I would recommend watching the other entries within the Monogatari series as well, as they also share the wonderful writing and style of Bakemonogatari (With the exception of Kizumonogatari, which has a different style due to its chief director being different. As such, I would recommend reading the light novel in addition to watching the Kizumonogatari movies.). 

P.S. Some might be put off by the imagery at times, as some scenes can be considered rather ecchi, but it’s important to note that these scenes develop the characters and help us learn about them through their reactions to such situations. The subtext is often as important as the scene playing out before you."

I first saw Weathering With You in Japan with no subtitles, barely a cursory knowledge of the language, and an empty stomach. But I still cried my eyes out. 

Being in Japan felt surreal, like I was swimming through the fog of a waking dream. Every time I went to sleep, I dreaded waking up in my room back in America, staring up at the small wobbling fan which looked closer and closer to falling with each spin, but my Japan trip was indeed real, it was no dream. Going to the bakery every morning with shuttered eyes and a drag in each step was as real as the blue sky settling into its place amongst the clouds. Each badly-enunciated Japanese phrase, each jumble of a word, each ignorance of a social cue causing a slap to my head from myself because I know the right words! Saying them, however, was an entirely different ordeal. It was with this stumbling clumsiness that I tripped into a showing of Weathering With You, directed by the legendary Makoto Shinkai.

Makoto Shinkai is a man who needs no introduction. Famed director of Your Name, a blockbuster so worldwide it garnered Elon Musk’s endorsement, Shinkai has reigned supreme over the “boy meets girl” genre in the animated form, and has been ever since going solo with his first project, Voices Of A Distant Star. Voices Of A Distant Star is an interesting case, because he animated the entire film all by himself. Though it blows through its short runtime (a brisk twenty-five minutes), the fact that it was Shinkai’s and Shinkai’s alone raised a lot of eyebrows towards the fledgling creator, and its concept, an ever-so-melancholy boy meets girl story that would fit right at home within Barnes & Nobles’ YA section, also helped assist in its acknowledgement. A boy and a girl are separated, due to one’s recruitment in the military, and the other remaining earthbound. As the story goes on, the text messages between our couple take longer and longer to send, until finally…Nothing. They can’t be together due to some cruel twist of fate. A simple conceit, to be sure, but one that would pervade through all Shinkai’s works through the coming years. Apart from Children Who Chase Lost Voices (an unabashed Studio Ghibli homage teetering the line of staunch plagiarism), Shinkai has stuck to this basic thematic constraint and threaded it through each and every one of his projects to date. No doubt there was a formative experience in Shinkai’s years that caused him to take this to heart, and thus imparts this overwhelming melancholy throughout everything. So perhaps it’s not in the changing of the story we should look for, but in the way that it’s told, for there are many ways to tell the same story.

The thing Shinkai is most well-known for, aside from his tried-and-true story formula, are his backgrounds, with these glossy, well-lit landscapes reflecting each ray of the sun and popping with color. His character animation, maybe not so much, but it’s the loving detail he packs into each and every background which throws you into the world Shinkai has created, soaking in the often rainy atmospheres and making you take in the air of the place. You can really get a sense of his love for the world’s beauty and how it correlates with the passage of time. For example, in Five Centimeters Per Second, his love of summer sunsets reflecting the protagonist’s fling, or the blistering chill of the winter winds as the protagonist runs to see his lover, waiting for him at the train station a few miles away. And in Weathering With You, he really turns the climate knob to eleven. 

Weathering With You follows a our downtrodden protagonist Hodaka meeting a peppy heroine Hina, who we find out is able to pull back the oppressive rain from Tokyo to make way for the sun. (Though people can change the weather in this film, the most unrealistic thing about it is the ease with which Hodaka finds a paid writing job.) Because of the central concept of Hina changing the weather, there are two distinct moods of the movie: raining and not. You’d think this would be very binary, as in, there would either be very gray skies or not-a-cloud-in-the-sky sun, but as I stated before, Shinkai is a master of climate. He takes the gray skies and jumbles them up, making them darkly intimidating in one scene, or with patches of blue in between lighter hues in another. Same with the sun; Maybe we do get the blue sky, but we also have hints of the rain coming back with the clouds in the background of the shot. It’s in the minuscule details that really shine, and this goes tit-for-tat, even in terms of the narrative.

The story is between these main two for the most part, but towards the back half of the film, we explore characters that Shinkai really hasn’t delved into before - secondary characters; Characters that supplement the main character and his journey. To clarify, this isn’t a deftly calculated slap at Shinkai’s face he’s just…literally never had anyone else but his main couple. So color me surprised when Hodaka’s surrogate father and Hina’s surrogate mother give them talks about life, romance, and more. It was the riffraff of this found family dynamic in the movie that really gave Weathering With You more color than Shinkai’s other works, really painting this slice of Tokyo in a comfortable light. These characters feel like people, as they’re supposed to, with lives and personalities and worries that extend from beyond the scene. Shinkai even delves into the mom and dad’s dynamic with each other, how it was falling apart before Hodaka’s arrival, and how he (and Hina) changed their lives for the better. Weathering With You definitely takes a step or two back from Your Name’s fast pacing, but I feel like that’s for the better, because instead of a lightning-in-a-bottle plot, we’re given time to get to know these characters. It makes Weathering With You feel distinct amongst Shinkai’s catalogue, no doubt showing the master at work. He may be making the “same story” over and over again but, damn it, if it isn’t getting better and better with each iteration! 

I wanted to review Weathering With You again because I didn’t feel this same connection with his most recent work, Suzume. To reiterate, the backgrounds are as gorgeous as ever, but I found myself missing the melancholy that Shinkai sneaks into every page of his films. Suzume felt impersonal, as if he was finally forced by the general audience to “make something different” though that may not have been what he wanted to do, so Suzume tasted like something different, it tasted like…you guessed it, Imitation Ghibli. Again. The worst part is, Shinkai is capable of so much more, and we’ve seen this with his oeuvre, but Suzume felt like an obligation rather than a project, at least to me. I’ll be sure to bite into my strong feelings for it, or rather, against it, in a later review, but for now I wanted to at least remind myself on why I felt such a connection to him in the first place. I saw Tenki No Ko (Weathering With You) during my last night in Japan, on impulse with my friend Jack, who changed his mind from not seeing it to a sudden “let’s go” paired with a wave from his hand. I’ll never forget those three weeks in Japan, but even if I did, I’d never lose that night. The nights of Katana Zero blasting through my iPod earbuds, the clack of the tracks, the large open skies, the compact city blocks, the hustle & bustle, the great people, the smack of hot ramen against my chapped lips. Until I can make it back to that hallowed ground of mine, I’ll have these memories. But I swear to not dwell on these memories forever! I’ll get back there on day. I swear the half-finished udon I left at a dining room table because I was too full of the tonkatsu, I swear it on the rusted bike I rode around the ports of Ashiya, and I swear on the ‘gracias’ I said to the cashier at the Sanrio store instead of ‘arigato’. 

Thank you, Shinkai, for creating this piece of me I’ll never let go.

21804,">""You're just my father, don't give me advice"" - Saiki Kusuo

Comedy is a very tough genre to excel at. Why? It's because of the difficulty in knowing what tickles people's funny bone. School comedies are even more tougher to work since the school setting makes it hard to step out and make people laugh. Now there are many supernatural school comedies but none of them made me laugh. Except Saiki Kusuo. Behold, the anime that made a comedy lover like me already decide it's score at a 10 in the middle of watching the show (I decide on ratings after binging a show). This is my review of Saiki Kusuo no PSI Nan. Yare yare, here we go. Original review written March 18, 2018 on MAL.

>""JUSTICE KNIGHTS OF THUNDER!!!""
img720()

Supernatural powers already allow so much more comedy that the folks went overboard and made a 120 episode anime over it, now even though they're 5 mins each they're to be enjoyed in bite sizes, much like coffee jello. Since it's a comedy a plot would be too much too ask (which makes sense) and so the only ""plot"" we got to see was the introduction of new characters. That and some very loosely tied events showed that the story isn't Saiki's best parts but plot progression isn't the only thing that is calculated in a comedy, it being a slice of life excuses that fact so we judge the scenarios that the characters are put in, and so far maybe around 5 out of the 120 episodes were remotely predictable and maybe kinda meh. The rest? Brilliant scenario making and not to mention brilliant story telling. The 5 minute per scenario focus made it even better since everything just kept a consistency of being fresh again and again. And so despite the fact that plot progression isn't the best of what a SOL (or any SOL for that matter) can offer, it more than made up for it by it's scenarios. The way the independent story moved on was easy-going and a joy to watch, even for J.C Staff who are known for being rushers. What does all this mean? Saiki has got a goddamn epic story telling mangaka being the works.



Arguably the best part of the anime is how lovable all the idiots in the anime are. We've got the main character Saiki who seems like he's the only smart guy in the group but then he gets baited by coffee jello, making him a very relatable character for reasons countless apart from the one I mentioned above. Teruhashi as well is an idiot in her own way and the fun part is how determined she is to make Saiki for ""Oh!"". Nendou goes without saying, his stupidity was so massive that it was refreshing to see such a baka in a comedy anime. Justice Knight of Thunder as well was as Chuuni as you get and Hairo was the Goku everyone knew him to be. Chiyo as well was a funny love interest although she wasn't too fixated on Saiki as Teruhashi was. That leaves us with a few characters who came a bit later on so I won't be spoiling them for you. The point is, if there's one reason why I hold Saiki Kusuo to such high regard, it's the characters. They are, were and always will be the quintessential part of the anime and a huge reason why it's such a joy to watch. An important thing about an anime is to have memorable characters, but just making them stronger and stronger and giving them multiple Saiyan powers won't do the trick, you have to make them lovable. Needless to say Saiki Kusuo more than managed that. There wasn't a single character I disliked in the anime, and that's saying something because I always have that one character I nitpick on and frankly Saiki Kusuo had me dancing with joy and laughter since it's character were so lovable and so fun to watch and interact with together. If there's one thing you should take away from this (overrating) reviewer, it's that Saiki Kusuo has one of the best casts in anime. Period.



Casts remind me of something very important that should definitely not be missed out here, the staff who worked on this beautiful anime. The highlight would of course be our leading man Saiki Kusuo, played by legendary VA Kamiya Hiroshi. You all may know him as Ararararararararagi if you watch the Monogatari series to name just one of the many award winning roles he's played. The rest of the cast isn't an A-Lister but to push them away would be the biggest mistake you'd ever do apart from say Coffee Jello is shit (I WILL end you if you say that), none, I repeat NONE of the characters were bad in their voicing and each of the VAs selected were brilliant. Another important part is the soundtrack. (JUSTICE KNIGHTS OF THUNDER) The OST in this anime is simply breathtaking, I fell in love with the soundtrack early on and that's to say nothing about Natsuki Hanae's oh-so-wonderful voice. His voice graced the first OP and second ED and let's just say it made me go ""Oh!"". Another thing I went ""Oh!"" at was Dempagumi.inc. (What? You think I'd go ""Oh!"" at Teruhashi? Bakaka [I'm lying]). Dempagumi.inc balanced out Hanae's soothing voice with some cheerful and playful action. It was reflected in the visual itself. A fun fact is that Hanae also played Reita in the anime apart from the theme songs. This all shows just how wonderful the soundtrack was along with the amazing characters which I'm sure I don't need to mention by now.



I've loved J.C Staff for a long time, but to say that J.C is the sole reason the anime looks good is totally unfair, the mangaka made the characters so beautiful from both the inside and outside that I was shell-shocked. Everyone was unique in their own way, and like I said before, to make an anime memorable you NEED to make them lovable and unique, and the mangaka and J.C Staff for that matter did that job elegantly. My reviews are rated according to my critical analysis of the anime by my point of view, so many times my score rating and my review rating are at odds but sometimes they do match and I'm sure this is one of those times they do. Why am I saying this? I gave Saiki a score of 10. Now I don't know what rating I gave it now (since I'm writing this before actually rating it in it's respective places) but I'm sure they'll be really close. The reasons are very simple. Be it my critical analysis or my personal enjoyment, Saiki Kusuo is an anime that is simple fun. It's an anime you relax to, cheer up to where you're down or just laugh when you're with your Aibos. Even if you don't have friends (Hontoni just find some friends then :P) watching these lovable idiots in action will give your perhaps cold heart some much needed warmth. 



Saiki has a lot of things to it's name. It's first and foremost THE most hilarious school comedy I have EVER seen. Then it has some of the most memorable characters. A soundtrack to dance or sleep to (Ah Hanae Natsuki <3). A well constructed MC. A non-flat love interest. A hilarious Chuuni for once. A whole set of lovable idiots and so much more. And if these don't sell you off then I'm sorry but you won't find a school comedy that gets better than this. I'm well aware that I used to overrated anime before but this isn't just me speaking. This is the MAL score speaking, this is the popularity speaking, this is the amount of favorites this anime has that's speaking. I'm constantly rambling on about the good of the anime (ahem no faults here apart from plot progression) but it's all on you the viewer. Saiki Kusuo speaks for itself. Will you try a much praised show? Are you going to lose something by trying a 5 min per ep show? Do you want to laugh? If your answers to all three questions was ""Yes!"" then dear sir/madam/person, get your funny bone ready, because it's about to be tickled, like REALLY tickled. Say hello to the best school comedy anime!

P.S: Girl Saiki is worth dying for. Yes, Girl Saiki is better than Teruhashi (maybe)

Wait, the review is over already? Yare-yare."

〈 𝘈 𝘫𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯... 〉

Have you ever felt you are way too cautious when it comes to interacting with art, which, in turn, may have caused you to hesitate or even avoid starting books, movies, or shows that piqued your interest? Have you ever set your expectations rock-bottom low because you were worried the latest popular product would not be worthy of its acclaim, thus leaving you sorely disappointed? Have you ever given said trendy new thing a shot, only to view it with a ton of bias, which utterly doomed your first impression beyond repair? I have been there and done that, and one of the best examples of this bizarre predicament is Frieren.

But fret not, my dear reader, because my wild and turbulent experience with this anime ends on a surprisingly positive note. This review will not be yet another cynical rant where I trash-talk a show for a couple of paragraphs. Well, not this time.

I will not beat around the bush or pretend to be holier than thou... I was initially super sceptical about Frieren, with heaps of negativity flowing through my veins. I kept doubting if it could live up to the hype, and, worse yet, I tried to avoid the show like the plague. After watching the first episode, though my opinion became more favourable, I was not entirely sold on any of its ideas and struggled to see the appeal. But as I dove deeper into its episodes, the show, slowly but surely, started growing on me. Now, having watched all of its twenty-eight episodes, I can confidently say it is one of the greatest anime I have ever encountered, and I feel silly for not taking it seriously from the get-go.



First things first, we have to give credit where credit is due: the team behind this project has truly outdone themselves in terms of visuals and sound, and they deserve all the praise they can get. Hell, I am more than happy to continue complimenting their work till I can no longer breathe or the sun no longer emits light. [Keiichirou Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/134254/Keiichirou-Saitou) and [his crew](https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Sousou-no-Frieren/staff) poured their hearts into this, and their passion for the craft and the medium itself shines through in every single frame, still image, second of animation, and note of the soundtrack—like a kid who was given a flashy new toy, I cannot stop gawking at their work in complete and unadulterated amazement. But all of this commendation is very ambiguous and general, so we need to get down to the nitty-gritty.

The colour palette was one of the first components I criticised when the show aired its first episode because I was not particularly impressed by it. Yet, as time went on, I finally came to my senses and concluded that my critique was unsubstantiated and narrow-sighted, as these seemingly commonplace colours consistently and relentlessly demonstrate how vibrant they are. Every scene, scenery and scenario is bright and full of life, yet the hues that inhabit them are not excessively saturated or unnaturally radiant to the point of causing eye strain or discomfort. In some weird fashion, despite the setting being anything but grounded in reality, everything on display teems with energy in an incredibly lifelike sense—thanks to these no-frills colours, the show is able to immerse the viewer in its vast, glamorous world and its countless distinct lands effectively and thoroughly. While you may see them as [just another generic collection of tints already seen a thousand times before in other shows with similar art styles](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Adventure&sort=POPULARITYDESC), when combined with other elements that constitute the visuals, they infuse Frieren with intense vigour and immediately make it stand out from the crowd.

Speaking of the art style, it is undeniably straightforward, yet that very simplicity is its most prominent strength. Owing to the usage of brisk, crisp and quirky lines, designs and hues, the art style emerges as delightful to look at and spellbinding all the way through. By dint of its inherent beauty, the background art can easily blossom and become an exceptional sight to behold. You can almost smell and breathe the world the characters exist in. You feel like you are a part of it, and, by extension, you get this tingling sensation of wanting to embark on a grand journey filled with numerous adventures, random encounters and memorable happenings. The cities the characters visit along the way look grand in scope, yet the manner in which they are drawn makes them feel cosy and lived-in. Unlike [other fantasy tales](https://anilist.co/search/anime/Fantasy) that merely aim for a fantasy-like look without much substance, the anime actually populates its villages with town life and makes the buildings, roads and architecture look like they were developed and used by actual human beings. Rural areas are gorgeously serene and peaceful, while forests, mountains, plains and whatnot evoke a sense of medieval realism and enchanting fantasy. In the same vein, the character designs are memorable and full of personality, considering they bring out the unique traits of each person donning them with simple ornaments, lovely outfits and distinctive body features. Altogether, the art style and everything surrounding it brim with this indescribable sense of wonder and magic, which perfectly captures the personality of the series.

Nonetheless, as beautiful and majestic as these images can be, their charm will hastily fade away once the animation fails to match their quality and struggles to bring them to life. An anime without proper animation is not going to cut it. After all, a contemporary show is neither [a slideshow](https://anilist.co/anime/125426/Gokushufudou/) nor [a trip to a museum.](https://anilist.co/anime/101429/Katsudou-Shashin)

Luckily, there is no need to worry about that because Frieren's animation does what is expected of it with flying colours. It does not settle for mediocrity or reeks of half-assery but instead executes everything flawlessly and constantly produces awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping scenes. Simply put, it is fluid and stellar, and it never runs out of gas despite the exhaustive number of high-quality and constantly impressive episodes. Whether it be a sombre moment where the characters converse with each other and contemplate their lives or a moment of high-octane and intense magical battle which involves countless blinding spells and objects flying left and right, the animation never stutters and always manages to deliver a mesmerising spectacle you can feast your eyes on. It is further complemented by the camerawork that makes sure the action is smooth, zappy and easy to follow, the lightning that enhances the ambience of every situation, and the editing that is not only sharp but also lets the scenes linger just enough for the emotions to settle in and take effect.

But a sincerely impactful moment is not just about what you can see; it is also about what you can hear. For a scene to deeply resonate with the viewer, their ears need to be treated to beautiful melodies that will strike them to their core. Yet again, we do not have to worry about that because the music the series boasts is absolutely wonderful at every step. Both [the opening theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIBODIPC8Y) by [YOASOBI](https://anilist.co/staff/194287/YOASOBI) and [the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkvWJNt77mU) composed by [Yorushika](https://anilist.co/staff/154702/Yorushika) fit amazingly into the atmosphere the show erects—they have a lingering feeling of melancholy within, yet are full of energy and positivity. [The ending theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r105CzDvoo0) by [milet](https://anilist.co/staff/144537/milet) embraces the other side of Frieren's narrative as its saddening, delicate tone elicits a sense of sadness related to departure or loss, which is an ideal fit as the closure to every episode. In conjunction, these songs will make you feel the urge to click on another episode, as you do not want these feelings to fade away. You want to cherish every moment you have with the show by your side for as long as possible.

Tying it all together is the soundtrack by [Evan Call](https://anilist.co/staff/119999/Evan-Call). Through tracks like [""Journey of a Lifetime,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgqb-sA6y-I) [""One Last Adventure,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ5MJbrD7rc) [""Where the Blue-Moon Weed Grows,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmx3CNjRUUw) and many, many more, the composer truly cements Frieren's score as one of the most impressive and gorgeous ones in recent memory. Tender, heartfelt, sorrowful, heartwarming and overflowing with a satisfying fantasy vibe all at once—these tracks feel grand yet so personal, majestic yet grounded, and sad yet hopeful, and I feel my heart crumbling to dust just by listening to them.



With an extensive description like that, you could easily get the idea that pretty looks and catchy songs are all there is to Frieren. Frankly, I would not blame you for thinking this way one bit. Whether we like it or not, [the medium](https://anilist.co/search/anime/popular) is populated by a constantly increasing number of [anime that value a single moment of visual brilliance over having a coherent, well-put-together, well-crafted and ingenious story and authentic, multi-dimensional characters worth rooting for.](https://anilist.co/anime/145139/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba-Katanakaji-no-Satohen/) But let me assure you that Frieren is not one of those shows that present the audience with plenty of eye candy but nothing to chew on narrative-wise; it is much, much more than meets the eye.

However, before I really dig into the narrative, I need to mention something that may not be so obvious but is definitely worth bringing attention to. Though many, after witnessing the first few episodes, deem the story to be an emotional tale that will pull your heartstrings at every opportunity, I believe that approaching Frieren with such expectations can and most likely will be extremely detrimental to not only your enjoyment but also your opinion about the show as a whole since you will expect such scenes to play first fiddle all the time. While, at the start, the emotionality of the content is painfully apparent, these emotionally charged moments are not so chokingly defining and dominant that everything revolves around them. They are a part of the narrative and not the narrative itself. The anime sights' are not set on merely being an evocative and meditative tearjerker that will force you to bawl your eyes out at every turn. Yes, the series is more than capable of doing that, which I experienced firsthand on too many occasions. Still, Frieren is, first and foremost, about the adventures, making memories, random encounters, and various detours the characters encounter along their trek; the emotions are a sweet and much-needed bonus.

Now with that out of the way, we can finally get down to business and see what the narrative is about. As I said earlier, the production values are made with so much passion and love that it is nigh impossible to resist their allure. However, as top-notch as they are, it is the combination of story, characters and themes that sets the show apart, puts it on the map and ultimately wins you over. These three components are the driving force behind its success and the reason why so many folks, myself included, have utterly fallen head over heels in love with it.

In the beginning, we are introduced to [the hero](https://anilist.co/character/184311/Himmel)'s party, as they gear up to and eventually succeed in taking down the Demon King. Sounds quite familiar, does it not? Of course, it does since we have seen [stories with such a premise so many times before that it has become something of a cliche.](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Isekai) As we quickly learn, in the case of this anime, this is nothing more than a setup or a prologue to what is to come. The quest is instantly taken care of off-screen, and time begins to blur as, in the wake of the constant utilisation of time skips, the years fly by in rapid succession. Before we know it, the group ceases to exist, and its leader passes away. What follows his death are tears, not only shed by those whom they helped throughout their numerous adventures but also by [the titular protagonist](https://anilist.co/character/176754/Frieren), as she realises that what seemed like insignificant, trivial moments to her meant the world to others due to them being a huge chunk of their life. With the realisation that she will long outlive everyone around her, and her apathy and indifference towards the world will not make her existence whole, she begins travelling in search of answers, yearning to understand humans and how to treasure the memories she made and will make. Along the way, she revisits the lands she stopped by in the past, meets and befriends other people and enjoys the presence of her newfound companions.

This is such a simplistic yet phenomenal setup that I am genuinely shocked I did not notice and appreciate it earlier. Taking the tired cliche of a party of warriors, mages and priests that aims to defeat the generic demonic overlord and completely flipping it on its head is such a refreshing and satisfying sight, and the way the whole quest is depicted is nothing short of ingenious. You see, [Frieren](https://anilist.co/character/176754/Frieren) is an elf, which means she is basically immortal. Even though the quest spanned about ten years, to her (and, consequently, the viewers) it was merely a fleeting moment, like a gust of wind that comes and goes without leaving any signs of its presence. However, this skewed perception of time is not a one-time gimmick; it constantly evolves and changes throughout the show's and the protagonist's development, and it originates from one of the main motifs of the series: the preciousness of time.

Time is a finite resource that we must use wisely. If you wander aimlessly through life, you will soon find yourself running short of it. Before you know it, you have used it all up, and it is only a matter of, well, time, before you have to bid goodbye to everything you own and everyone you know. The immortality of an elf stands in stark contrast to the frailty of human life, seeing that elves can live for thousands upon thousands of years, and still look like they are in their twenties. Yet, their careless management of time can very easily be applied to humans or human-related activities such as memory-making. Whether you have twenty, sixty or one thousand years, there is always the possibility that you are not focusing on the present and instead being completely oblivious to how fast and unrelenting the passage of time can be. Frieren perfectly encapsulates the importance of learning to appreciate each little thing, moment and uneventful day and understanding the fleeting nature of it all. It turns this incredibly straightforward idea/theme into one of the many important lessons it teaches not only its characters but also the viewers.

The same applies to the concept of memories; they, much like the passage of time discussed above, constitute the heart and soul of Frieren. These snippets of the past kick off the protagonist's tale, drive most if not all of the characters' actions and are responsible for some of the most emotional, poignant and powerful moments in the whole series. Just as they are essential to the narrative, memories are intrinsic to all of us. While they do not entirely define our existence, as we can still carry on even if we were to lose them all, they are extremely instrumental in shaping who we are. With them lingering in the recesses of our minds, we find solace in previous experiences, reflect on the present with the insight the past provides, and discover what makes us who we are.

However, what is head-scratchingly problematic about memories is the fact that what seems to be nothing more than an ordinary and everyday moment may become a vital, cherished recollection down the road. This notion is reflected throughout the series, as remembrances influence every character in one way or another. Although these simple moments might characterise these individuals, they do not restrain or torment them like shackles. Instead, as time goes on, the cast learns to use them as stepping stones toward personal growth and self-realisation. And therein is the reason why this show is so touching and relatable. The theme is universal and easily applicable to anyone, yet it is the process of witnessing the characters uncover how to deal with their past and try to use it as a learning experience that makes it all extremely personal, heartwarming and therapeutic.

Naturally, these two motifs are not the only ones that Frieren wears on its sleeves. Grief, loss, regret, the importance of human relationships and connections, morality, death and its ramifications, the search for meaning, mentorship, friendship, familial bonds, heroism, good vs. evil, embracing life, accepting oneself and many, many more themes are vividly portrayed within the anime, and are given just the right amount of attention and care to pack a really hefty punch.

As mentioned numerous times throughout the review, Frieren is all about the journey the characters set off on that can be equated to a collection of sidequests with plenty of goofing around, fighting, talking and exploring connected with surprising cohesion and creativity. On account of that, the series could have easily stuck to these adventures for the entirety of its run, never going beyond its excellent worldbuilding, captivating magic system, believable setting, exciting battle scenes, charming character interactions or quirky personages. But, it decided to embrace and embody both sides of the idea of travelling, combining literally moving from one place to another with attempts to find your true self and become a better person, and the themes above are why it all successfully comes together to create this nearly perfect package. The adventures are at the forefront of the plot as they entertain your eyes, ears and mind while the intriguing ideas that reside deep within the show's body touch your heart and make Frieren an unforgettable experience.

Nonetheless, every potent and contemplation-arousing subject needs to be conveyed and presented in an easy-to-digest manner. This is where [the characters](https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Sousou-no-Frieren/characters) come in, as they are the ideal vehicles for these ideas. But do not mistake them for mere carriers of the various concepts; they are fully fleshed-out people with their own interesting stories to tell. Whether you look at the protagonists or the supporting characters, everyone brings something to the table and fulfils a concrete and important role in the story, no matter how much screen time they get. Surely, [some of them may be seen as generic and one-dimensional](https://anilist.co/character/246057/bel), but that is merely a surface-level observation that hardly applies to any of these folks; even the most seemingly insignificant supporting characters are exciting, authentic, full of depth and flesh and blood.

Yet, as is the case with every single story to have ever been written, it is the main group who are in the constant limelight. Frieren and her companions, both old and new, are a diverse, sympathetic and charismatic bunch of goofballs. They all possess distinct personalities, easily understandable and relatable motivations, and dreams that strike a chord with the audience. It is very hard not to root for them, appreciate their wonderful chemistry, enjoy their quirky interactions/banters/conversations, feel happy when they achieve their goals, and feel down when they encounter any sort of hardship. The way they develop and mature as individuals as the show progresses is extremely impressive on account of the subtle, small yet noticeable changes in their attitudes, outlooks and dispositions. Not a single moment of character development is rushed, and the show allocates just the right amount of time to give these guys all the breathing room they need to grow, glow, and become great. And that is precisely what they become when the final credits roll around—a fun, organic yet deeply human cast of memorable characters, whose antics and adventures are charming beyond belief.



All right, it is high time to wrap up this incomprehensible wall of text masquerading as a thoughtful review. I want to end it by simply encouraging anyone who has yet to see Frieren to cave in and give it a shot. In the worst-case scenario, you will not be wowed by what it has to offer, and you will either power through its episodes as a reluctant passenger or abandon ship entirely. However, if it is your cup of tea and clicks with you, it will be an experience unlike any other.

In any case, I sincerely think Frieren deserves our attention and adoration and must be treasured for years to come. It is a nearly flawless and intensely special anime that, I kid you not, excels in every aspect. I feel fortunate to have been part of this joyful and adventurous journey for so long, and my love for it is as vast and endless as its world.

Farewell, Frieren.

This anime is the perfect mix of things you'll need if you enjoy Yuri/Fantasy anime!

They don't go over the top like in some other Yuri animes, this one is more of a comedy! Which I personally really enjoyed. The characters have so much detail in them and they each have their very own personalities, dislikes, likes, etc. No character is the same!
For example;
Kanna - Kanna is a adorable dragon in the show! She's soft-spoken and most of her thoughts are shown through motions, actions, and very short clips of her speaking. She's 7000 (As a dragon) but acts exactly like a 5 to 7 year old child.
Tohru - ""Tohru was raised to hate humans and was supposed to be a fierce and dangerous force of evil with nothing other than destruction in mind. However, this all changed when she met Kobayashi. Overall, Tohru is warm, loving and responsible.""
Koybayashi - ""Even though Kobayashi maintains a cool demeanor, she has been regarded as kind-hearted and reliable among her friends and colleagues. Level-headed and pragmatic, she stands as the source of reason when dealing with her dragon friends.""
Quetzalcoatl (Nickname Lucoa) - ""She is a calm, easy-going and laid back dragon, and has much better perception when it comes to what consists of normal human behavior (except, perhaps, for Elma). However, she easily gets flustered if her past is mentioned""

Moving away from the characters for now, the overall anime has so many great details and so much is shown in it that makes it automatically puts it in my top 10. Examples -
adorable scenes of dragon playful fights, cute eating scenes, etc.

This anime gets even more points (in my opinion) because the girls have love/hate relationships with eachother.
A few times Tohru does ""foolish things only a dragon would do"" and sometimes she really does help!

Miss Koybayashi did accidentally hire tohru after all, as said in episode 1, so they didn't exactly have time to know each other beforehand. Personally I think that small detail really changed some things! They didn't know a lot about each other which resulted in Koybayashi and Tohru to have small scenes together! Which I thought made a small difference.

To end it off here, this anime deserves more in my opinion. It's unique and adorable. From the characters, to the plot, even all the way down to the art! I can't say I regret watching this anime, Honestly I would consider rewatching this! Even just rewatching all the adorable scenes make me love the anime even more than I already do! If you're deciding whether to watch this anime or to skip it, reconsider and watch it! You won't regret your experience with this anime! 

Overall I think this anime really had a lot of effort put into it and is a anime that is worth watching."

Seriously WTF is this garbage.  
Why the fuck did they remove one of the best arcs in the manga and skip towards the end.
This Season is so bad that a non anime youtuber made a rant about it.
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUn7GYqHolY&t=9s)
I’ve seen [Many](https://anilist.co/anime/384/Gantz/) [Garbage](https://anilist.co/anime/189/Love-Hina/) [Ada](https://anilist.co/anime/2993/Rosario--Vampire/)[pta](https://anilist.co/anime/116006/The-God-of-High-School/)[tions](https://anilist.co/anime/20605/Tokyo-Ghoul/) 
But I had to witness it with my own eyes as someone who had read the manga prior to watching the anime.
It’s also bad that you're skipping from the  first arc to the final one. It’s like if Bleach’s anime went from the Substitute Shinigami (Or Soul Reaper) arc to the Thousand Year Blood War arc, or Naruto’s anime went from the Land of Waves arc to the 4th Great Ninja War arc.
WTF!
I loved Season 1 i really did it, I love how they handled the first major arc in the series, and how they made an amazing OST in Isabella’s lullaby
FFS they even removed one of the best characters in the entire manga
img220()


Story? 1/10
WTF is a fucking story craming 143 Chapters (while skipping a couple) into 11 fucking episodes is not a fucking story it’s just cramming  a bunch of shit to get done with it. To be fair as someone who has read the manga the manga did had its problems and the final arc (Particularly the ending) was just underwhelming (And to be fair was better than the one we gotted), and when it was announced that the series was going anime original i wished that it would fix the major problems of the manga, but instead it made everything worse. It was so bad that it made me reread the manga and in retrospect as flawed as the manga was it was better than this clusterfuck of an adaptation.


Characters? 1/10
To cram everything to the end, they did it at the worst expense possible, they ruined every single character.
To be fair the manga itself did wasted some characters but the anime but it much much worse
Ray? Phil? Everyone else that’s not Emma? Fuck you, you’re gone.
There’s 0 Character Development whatsoever everyone is the same as they are.
Fuck you Character Development.


Art 7/10
Aside a couple of whatever you call these:

img220()
The Art itself overall is fine i guess. Though it doesn’t help that Cloverworks were working on two other series in Wonder Egg Priority and Horimiya when they were working on this as well.


Enjoyment? 1/10
WTF is there to enjoy? Cramming 143 Chapters into 11 episodes? One of the best arcs in the manga being skipped? Every character that’s not Emma being pushed to shit. Fuck this shit. Fuck this Garbage. And Fuck everything it stand for. If I could find every copy of this shit I'd smash them with a hammer.
The only good thing about this is both the it’s fire opening and the ending
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRwcGr8yTws) 


Overall
I’m fucking frustrasted The Promised Neverland was one of the first manga I’ve read that I’ve seen got it’s anime announced, now it’ll be with the Soul Eater, the Pandora Hearts, and the Rosario + Vampires of the world fans wanting desperately for a remake aka the Brotherhood treatment. And unlike The Promised Neverland those series anime aired when their manga was still ongoing, The Promised Neverland Season 2 meanwhile was airing when it’s manga ended nearly a year ago. Not to mention the receptions towards Beastars and The Quintessential Quintuplets (Two series that aired in the same season as The Promised Neverland Season 2)  manga endings weren’t that good either but you didn’t see their mangaka telling the people who were working on those anime to skip towards the end.
At the end of the day like [Many](https://anilist.co/anime/384/Gantz/) [Garbage](https://anilist.co/anime/189/Love-Hina/) [Ada](https://anilist.co/anime/2993/Rosario--Vampire/)[pta](https://anilist.co/anime/116006/The-God-of-High-School/)[tions](https://anilist.co/anime/20605/Tokyo-Ghoul/)  The Promised Neverland like many anime would be more known for it’s anime instead of it’s manga, since after all most anime a just Cash-Grabs just to boost manga or light novel sales.
Overall I give this garbage a 20/100
Just fuck this anime and everything it stands for."

This review will only cover this particular season alone and will not include Battle In Egypt.
[For Battle in Egypt review [link ](https://anilist.co/review/12895)]

For the lazy readers, there will be a summary (verdict) at the end of the review.



Ah, Stardust Crusaders, the most memed and popular part. Moving on from Part 1 and 2 and taking on a new level of bizarre adventure. But just because it is the most popular, doesn't make it the best part. Now I don't wanna make this a one-sided review so I am going to divide into the good and the bad.


POSITIVES:
- Introduction of Stands: I am sure most of the people started JJBA just for the Stands, and perhaps even skipped Part 1 & 2 for it (If you skipped parts, I will find who you are and where you live). Stands are a unique concept which I haven't seen before. It kind of reminds me of Pokemon except here Stands are just ""psychical manifestation of your soul."" -Joseph

- Characters: Every squad got the 'Mr. Too Much Energy', quiet kid, clown, milf and محمد افدول. Joseph is still energetic as before, Polnareff is a very fun character, Avdol is just ""YES, I AM!"", Kakyoin is Donut and Jotaro is someone some people may not like much due to his 'boring' character.

- OST: The OST is very good in this part, the music choice for OP and ED suits very well. The character themes suit the characters very good too, Jotaro's theme playing as Jotaro critically injures and breaks every bone of a grown man for 3 pages gives a good feeling of satisfaction.



NEGATIVES:
- Stand Fights/Pacing: Most of the Stand Fights have little to no effect on the story at all. During this entire season, out of the 24 eps, around 20 eps are spent fighting these 'Agents of DIO' who try to stop the crusaders but ofcourse, they get beaten to pulp at the end of each episode. Watching the Crusaders battle these agents in every episode with some fights extending to 2 eps just gets tedious and boring. The only fights which actually had a significant affect on Story were J. Geil/Hol' Horse, Enya the Hag, and Cameo fights.

- Antagonists: Except the few mentioned above, the other Antagonists are so forgettable to the point that when you meet them constantly, it just becomes ""yay look another Stand User, can't wait for the Crusaders to take the entire episode to defeat them then move on their way.""

- Episodes: Now this might be biased but when I was watching SC, I had no idea Battle In Egypt season existed, so when I saw just 4 eps remaining, I thought ""huh so I guess they fight DIO in these eps"", 2 eps remaining, ""Well do they fight him now?"", season ends, ""w h a t"". In short, I was disappointed when I found out there was another season filled with another 24 eps just to fight DIO. This is something the OVAs did right as they were able to fit all of Stardust Crusaders in just 13 episodes in total (though the eps were 30 mins long so I guess it makes up for it).





In short, if I were to summarize, Stardust Crusaders introduced some good concepts but they were executed very poorly. The Stand Fights were so disappointing (mentioned in above points) that I wished they kept Hamon and preferred Hamon over Stands. It had good characters and story, but the length of the part with tedious pacing made it very lack lusting.

In the future reviews I will mention what Diamond is Unbreakable did right which Stardust Crusaders did wrong.

And just as the title suggests, I totally expect this review to be controversial."

Tower of God is a fascinating series, and that would be true even if we looked solely at where it comes from. Tower of God is an anime adaptation of a South Korean webcomic. The first of many, I would venture to guess. (Indeed, if you’re reading this as it goes up, the similarly-titled but unrelated God of High School premieres in only a week or two.) But while Tower of God’s multinational pedigree is certainly fascinating, and does inform some of its sensibilities, it would be a mistake to preoccupy ourselves with solely this aspect. So let’s take a step back.

img880()

Tower of God is the story of Bam, in many ways the very image of an archetypal shonen hero. Friendly, naturally gifted, determined, honest. Ah, and singularly devoted to a girl, who he begins his quest to scale the Tower in search of.

Tower of God is also the story of Rachel, who is that girl. Rachel is Bam’s opposite and his shadow, though that does not become clear until the series’ closing episodes.

There are a few ways to analyze Tower of God. Purely as an action series, what’s presented here is well above the merely competent. ToG has an interesting, clean visual style that sets it apart from most of its peers. Its plot is a pleasing mix of adrenaline-pumping fights and twisty political intrigue. The cast is colorful, both in personality and often literally, as the series’ origins as a webcomic really shine through in many of the “fuck it, it looks cool” designs of certain characters, such as the inexplicable number of ribbons that Yuri Jahad uses to tie her hair, a one-off character who is a living pink punch dummy, Anaak, a charming green lizard girl with a bobcut, and Rak, one of Bam’s main companions, who is a spear-wielding alligator-man. Even more “sensible” designs, such as those of Khun and Endorsi, make eye-catching, pleasing color choices.

img880()

In terms of actual characterization, they’re great. This is true when they’re working in surprisingly subtle, nuanced shades, say with Aguero Khun or Yu Han Sung, who operate as the series’ obligatory plan-spinners, or the intertwining histories of Anaak and Endorsi, or, indeed, Rachel. It’s equally so when dealing with broader, archetypal characters, such as Rak or for that matter, Bam himself. Nearly to a one, every character is a joy to watch work, even if it’s in a “love to hate” sense as with some of the villains.

The other point though is that Tower of God’s titular structure is a metaphor the size of a million skyscrapers. What for? Well, any system you care to name that pits its competitors against each other in a zero-sum game, and there are many of those. It maps most closely, in my estimation, to capitalism. Both with the foregrounding of the “haves vs. have-nots” dichotomy when Hoh betrays his team during the “tag game” arc, and the subsequent inequality and cycle of suffering that dichotomy perpetuates. Some of our characters are empowered by it: indeed, this is Bam’s role, someone deposited by fate and circumstance into a system which rewards his skill set and natural talents (making allies and shinsu manipulation, respectively). Others are much less lucky. Hoh, a blonde, horned character, is the clearest example. We never get the gory details of what, exactly, happened to his homeland, but the scattered nightmare flashbacks we get speak to the trauma on its own. In this light his betrayal makes perfect sense. Who wouldn’t do anything they could to come out on top of a system this vicious? 

img880()

This appears to be what drives Rachel, too, whose arc is a more subtle, larger-scale reflection of Hoh’s (perhaps that’s why they’re both blonde). We never learn why she’s so obsessed with “becoming a star” and “being special” (as Headon, the rabbit-like ‘guardian of the Tower’, puts it), but her deep-seated envy drives the final episode of the season. It would be easy to write her off as simply a bad person (and hell, maybe she is), but Tower of God seems to resist such simple readings. 

img880()

There’s also, to return to the “Tag” arc, Selena, who literally exits the series at its 2/3rds marker, plainly in the Tower because she is the only survivor of a band of criminals. It’s only when the system grinds her will to fight down that she willingly leaves. She isn’t dead, and in that sense her fate is better than Hoh’s, but both have given up the fight.

But Tower of God also touches on other forms of inequality. Khun’s apparent exile from his family seems to have been caused by either a violation of some sort of social taboo (it’s broadly implied his relationship with his sister may have been incestuous) or a frame-up to resemble one. This is certainly a very different sort of inequality than the systematic oppression wrought by having or not having shinsu affinity, but it feels an interesting stab at applicability nonetheless. Our own world is certainly no stranger to ostracization on these grounds. It’s not nearly as fully-realized a metaphor as the show’s primary storytelling mechanism, but it’s interesting food for thought nonetheless.

img880()

There is even incremental touching on of misogyny. We learn very little concrete about the King of Jahad, but his policy that his “princesses” cannot have sex or reproduce certainly feels like commentary. Again, it’s not followed through-upon with the same strength as the story’s central metaphor, but it's meaningful that the show even deigns to go there.

Of course, no anime is perfect. Tower of God’s thoughtfulness in some areas only makes it more obvious when it’s deficient in these same regards. No dark-skinned characters play a major role, which would perhaps be less egregious if the only one who comes close, Hoh, wasn’t the only named character to die on-screen. Elsewhere, Rachel being disabled and one of the show’s more outright villainous characters feeds into the ancient “evil cripple” stereotype that fiction in general, really, should be well past by now. Some scenes in the finale also imply that she’s faking it, which is not any better.

On the narrative side, the simple realities of cutting even a given length of a sprawling webcomic into thirteen 22-minute episodes means things are occasionally a bit confusing. The Tower’s mechanisms being obscure and obtuse usually works in the show’s favor--it really only adds to the central metaphor--but it sometimes gets in the way of the show’s literal plot. The “Tag” arc is the big offender here, while the emotional beats are great, the actual logic that the tag game works on is rather confusing. 

Tower of God thus can certainly feel like the long prologue to a story we’re only going to get in full from the second season (which, one seems likely) onward. I would hasten to ask, though, is that a bad thing? All of the above is tied together with an excellently-executed action shonen setup that is rarely less than a good time. Its flaws may mark room for improvement, but on both a pure craft level and intellectually, the series excels overall.

In general, Tower of God stands as one of the strongest entries in the already-strong Spring 2020 anime season. That’s to be respected, and celebrated. Tower of God ends on an ambiguous note, Bam washed down, seemingly back to the bottom of the Tower. A still, mysterious shot of a lone figure closes the series. The cliffhangers feel pointed, a promise that Tower of God is nowhere near finished telling its story. For that, we can be hopeful.

I have already [reviewed the Demon Slayer: Mugen Train movie](https://anilist.co/review/16452), but I think it is time I reviewed the TV version too.

Unlike the movie, the TV version of the Mugen Train arc starts with a anime only episode about how Rengoku got his bento boxes before boarding the train. This was a nice touch because it gave a backstory to one of the most iconic anime scenes of all time. If you don't know what I'm talking about already, I mean the scene where Rengoku repeatedly say ""UMAI"" as he chows down on the last meal ever. The rest of the TV version is rather the same as the movie, nothing else new is added. That does not mean it is bad though because we already know the movie was pretty much peak fiction. The climactic fight between Rengoku and Akaza is still one of the best fight sequences in all of Demon Slayer anime. Not to mention how deep the emotions run when Rengoku inevitably gets a hole ripped through his chest. Overall, I would say the extra anime only episode propels the TV version from peak fiction to a contender for the best fictional work ever.




We already learned what great and amazing characters Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko were in season one of Demon Slayer, but luckily for us we are introduced to new characters in this arc. Rengoku being the stand out of them all. Rengoku is a very cheerful and bright individual who also happens to be very strong. He pushes forward with unlimited determination to save everyone on the train and does achieve his goal. He even gets a flashback to flesh out his backstory. It was such a unique backstory. His dad didn't support him in becoming a Hashira, but he did it anyways. This backstory could bring anyone to tears. Unfortunately, Rengoku gets killed before reconciling with his dad. So sad, I'm crying as I am typing this. Akaza was also introduced in this arc, he's a bad demon that's really strong. Anyways, Rengoku's story arc was one of the best character arcs in all of anime and should get the respect it deserves.




It has good animation, but no where near how good the actual plot and characters were. The fight choreography, art style, and movements were all really good in this, but just wanted to remind everyone Demon Slayer is carried by its amazing plot and characters, not its animation.




I have listened to the OST countless times and each and every time I am brought to tears of joy and tears of sadness. The OST conveys the right emotions for each and every scene which elevates each scene to the next level.




Just like the OST, the openings and endings could make anyone with a heart cry tears of joy and tears of sadness. Some of the best openings in all of anime, that's all I can really say.




You already know why this is, no need to explain.



To all the Peak Slayer enjoyers, I love you :)
Thank you for reading to the end of my review!

I feel like I should preface this review with a very important announcement:


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The second installment in the Dr. Stone series - The Stone Wars - continues where we left off in season one, with Senku and his crew preparing for war with Tsukasa and his tribe. How was it, you may ask?

Pretty neat.

Stone War arc spans across 11 episodes, with each episode filled with events and interactions which progressed the story in a nice, cohesive way. Good pacing in shows this short is important, so I'm glad they kept it consistent with season one. The plot was not anything special, but I appreciate the consistent, light-hearted approach to storytelling that we experienced here. 

SPOILER SECTION 
!The ""war"", as they called it, was a crucial moment in terms of worldbuilding, as the conflict between two tribes had to be resolved in some way. How did the resolution turn out? Decent, although very shounen-y  and kinda awkward end to the Tsukasa and his character arc, a reveal of his reasoning and his backstory were all packed in the last few episodes, which... I don't know. I felt like the way they dealt with it was fine, but it would definitely gain a lot with one more episode or two considering how interesting of a character Tsukasa felt to be. Hyogo and his betreyal felt like he was bad for the sake of filling the antagonist spot, after Tsukasa got talk no jutsu'd but they way they got his ass was cool so I'm fine with it. Bit on the cheesier side, but still cool. I didn't like the fact that most ""recipes"" and science stuff was kinda rushed, unlike in season one, when you could feel the progress Senku and the crew made, and how much impact each step had. I guess it's normal considering the amount of episodes in this season, but I'm just pointing out what rubbed me in a slightly wrong way.!

Senku is still the good old Senku. The main character of this series is one of its strongest points, and this doesn't change at all through the course of this season. Senku feels absolutely FRESH each time he appears on screen, always keeping you guessing and having an ace up his sleeve.
Side characters kept their colorful personalities and sprinkled the show with wholesome and hillarious interactions all throughout. Chrome was lowkey the GOAT of this season, but I appreciate the rest of the old crew and the role they played. I just love these goofs so much.
As for the freshly introduced characters this season, we had some ups and downs. Psychofan blondie and dumbass police officer were meh, but they both still managed to squeeze in some funny moments, which is highly appreciated in a show like this. On T
the other hand I really liked Ukyou, and I would love to see more of him in the future. (here's me being biased because I like archers).

Visually the anime was as good as in season one. Consistent artstyle, funny as fuck reaction faces and some nice background art are what defines Dr. Stone as a series. Sure, there was no great holy-sakuga sequence, but it's not what people come and watch it for. 
As for the OST: holy fuck. The opening and ending sequence are such fucking bangers it is insane. You would think there would be at least one meh song in these two seasons but nah. As for the BGM, there were some decent choices in terms of action music, and as for the ""science"" section, it's still the same folky upbeat music that accompanied our characters in their tinkerking during season one. 

Overall, a 9 out of 10 experience for me. It's still the same amazing, light-hearted anime, full of fun and colorful characters in an interesting and funny story."

}I Hate Highschool Romance Shows (most of the time)



a frustrating part about romance anime is the fact that most of it takes place in High School of all times its not necessarily that I think these shows are bad or that the setting inherently saps quality away but rather that I think that the use of High School can sometimes feel overindulged at times for the genre and that the setting gets blander and blander.

not to say that I've never liked a high school romance Beastars uses its high school setting in a way that explores what it's like for adolescent teenagers in an anthropomorphic built society with their own interpersonal conflicts that stem from what they are and how it affects how they are

besides most of the high school setting in anime blending into a nebulous hazy image where you've seen the same backgrounds, seriously how many school anime shows have you seen with the same copy-pasted background that you've seen a million times.

}Highschoolers are boring


when it comes to Highschool romance there's a quality in which the romance basically becomes the center point of these characters' lives to the point where it's all they think of or all that happens with these characters.


img {
  border-radius: 8px;
}


It makes the characters seem as if they have no other interesting aspects other than being in love with each other which is a downside cause if I don't care about the characters on their own as individuals with their own aspects I don't feel any tension with the romance plot.

And a lot of the time's romance shows put heavy emphasis on the build-up to a confession or eventual dating of two characters witch can be done well but very rarely  I feel that 

A. This is the entire goal for the show and its characters and

B. That it takes entirely way too long for characters to get to that point 

I think this heavy emphasis on the build-up can kinda exaggerate romance way more than it needs to be at times  Wotakoi keeps it nice and simple and honestly in a more relatable manner in which the characters do have emotional moments but it's with more tuned down than any drama for the sake of trying to deliver a sense of tension

I've never delivered heartfelt confessions like I was staking my entire being on it and I find this aspect of

}Enter Wotakoi




instead of going for the signature type of romance Wotakoi is way more laid back the cast of characters have their own passions and interests which makes them interesting on an individual level without the romance aspect being pushed

Narumi is an Otaku specifically in the realm of Boys love  or BL manga and making self-published works she tends to compartmentalize her passion and interests due to how society tends to view Otaku as an embarrassing title and past failures at maintaining relationships which makes her feel as if she needs to keep a strict fence around work and relationship life

knowing the character's personal likes and dislikes and who they are and aren't as people help's to add to the romantic element of the show as its in the ways that contrast with their own partners that make for really meaningful, mature, and substantial relationship writing.

forgive the rant but often times but sometimes I feel like romance anime has a tendency to have characters fall in love for love's sake similar to falling in love with the idea of falling in love despite not having synergy with the partner.

this leads me to the next thing I want to talk about the show which is

h2 {
  font-size: 100px;

  font-size: 100px;
}Good Group Dynamics




Not an easy thing

  border-radius: 8px;
}


I just want to talk about how each of the characters contributes to the group in ideology or a different perspective wether its ont their personal likes and dislikes  of what kind of Otaku they are or how it influences their own personal relationships

For instance, like I've said before Narumi represents a person more reclusive with being an Otaku as its affected her relationships in contrast to this we have Koyanagi who is not afraid she neither fights or flees when it comes to her passionate hobbies of cosplaying 

and you can see this throughout the Group

Hirotaka is the outwardly cold, blunt, and quiet dispositioned gamer of the group who openly games a lot on breaks all the time he's not anti-social but he's also just naturally introverted

Narumi is a Bl obsessed girl who can often times procrastinate but also ironically is very passionate when releasing her own self-published works she's also extroverted yet a bit shy or embarrassed when it comes to cosplay and mixing her Otaku life with other aspects of her life

Kabakura is similar to Narumi also wanting to keep a lid on his hobbies due to embarrassment whilst being a rigid and slightly strict yet empathetic senior at work he's inadvertently one of the most passionate Otaku when it comes to his own personal feelings seemingly recording all the seasonal anime and binging it

this makes it so that the characters can naturally clash in entertaining ways which only further highlights their own personalities and sometimes I think this plays in romance where I wouldn't have gotten into something without being dragged and begged into it which is how I got into Devilman and Undertale funnily enough 



Prologue

Wotakoi is an exception for me to most romance anime and if you dont watch it after reading this well lets just say it wont be pretty

20829,"Owari no Seraph is about a deadly virus that manifest in Tokyo. The virus kills those above 13 yrs old. The virus was spread by vampires and the children are taken under their ""protection"" to give blood. Yuuichirou Hyakuya and Mikaela Hyakuya are two orphans that were enslaved by the vampires in an underground city. After Mikaela, Yuuichirou, and the other orphans try to escape to Tokyo they encounter Ferid Bathory. After being the only one to escape, Yuuichirou is found by Guren Ichinose, a Lieutenant Colonel of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army . Yuuichirou swears to avenge his ""family"" thus launching him into intense training and lessons to join the Japanese Imperial Demon Army. 

After watching Owari no Seraph, I finished my thoughts and started to write a review. (I will try to limit the amount of spoilers.) Throughout the series we are shown the life of Yuuichirou and how he was able obtain power in order to avenge his ""family"". Though I feel like the story focused more on him than any of the other characters. In one case I noticed we didn't get much of a character development for Shinoa Hiiragi, the captain of the squad Yuuichirou later joined. I also feel as if Mikaela's life after the incident was left barely touched, there could have been more episodes that touched on Mikaela's life but we didn't get any in season one. However a double-edged sword in this series was the pacing. Though the plot was interesting it never moved to fast, but, in some cases it moved to slow. In on instance lets talk about (!SPOILER ALERT!) (!SPOILER ALERT!) Mikaela and Yuuichirou reuniting, they reunited only TWO episodes away from the finale, the build up for this moment was fun yet  excruciating. Other than that the plot was pretty good. 
Now onto animation, in my opinion the animation was a on par. It kept up with action scenes and the movement of the characters was also good. The only problem I really had, which I heard other reviewers bring this up, was the background. Sometimes it looked lazy and it stood out with how mismatched it was to the characters. Other than that the over all animation was actually pretty good. 
The anime has 12 episodes but a few specials and a season 2. I had a really nice time actually watching the show and I do recommend it if you want a watch in the vampire/action genre. .

Again I hope you all enjoyed this and hope you tune in to my next review. Again, let me know if you have any anime you would like me to review.

21128,"Noragami Aragoto is probably the best 2nd season anime this year. There is a big deal of change since the first season, for good. To be honest, the first season's second half was slightly off the entertainment level. I wasn't able to dive into the seriousness of the final arcs in the first season. But I am surprised how second season made a remarkable progress in making the plot more interesting.

img()

Story: 9/10
We all have seen Noragami first season and were left with many doubts, mostly related to Yato and Bishamon. In the first half. the second season tackles the back story of Yato and Bishamon and reveals the secrets of Yato, Bishamon, ‎Kazuma, Other Gods etc little by little. The second half deals with the mystery of masked phantoms and also focuses of the relations between Yato, Yukine and Hiyori. Still there are plenty of things which are left untold which we can expect them to be shown in the 3rd season, when it comes out.

img()

Art: 10/10
Noragami and Noragami Aragoto has been animated by the studio 'Bones' which is very well known for it's remarkable art in the anime 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', 'Soul Eater', 'Space☆Dandy', 'Tokyo Magnitude 8.0' etc. As expected of Bones, it's art in Noragami is also smooth, colorful and remarkable. The character designs are another plus point of Noragami series. The characters are drawn so well, I can't even imagine anyone else replacing them in any way. Their designs are the perfect match for their personality which makes them so much likable.

Sound: 10/10
Noragami's opening song 'Hey Kids' by 'THE ORAL CIGARETTES' is a BLAST! There's no way anyone can deny me with this point. While everyone may not agree with me, the ending song 'Nirvana' by 'Tia' is another great song and the visuals and the lyrics adds more to it. While Noragami 1st season's soundtracks were already good, there has been a great improvement in the soundtracks in the 2nd season. The number of soundtracks under different situations have been changed, increased in number, and has become more suited to it than before. The soundtracks played during battles, sad scenes, happy scenes etc. makes them even more interesting and fun to watch. Coming to the voice actors, many famous and insanely talented actors like Kamiya Hiroshi, Kugimiya Rie, Fukuyama Jun, Sawashiro Miyuki, Ono Daisuke, Kaji Yuki, Hayami Saori, Toyosaki Aki etc. gave an amazing performance which makes Noragami deserve a 10/10 in terms of Sound.
img(


Character: 10/10
The male protagonist of the show, Yato, is my most favorite of all the characters. Not just from Noragami, but Yato has become one of my favorite character of all the anime and that's because of his cool attitude, wicked sense of humor and his seriousness when it is needed. Other characters like Bishamon, Kazuma, Yukine are also pretty likeable for their own unique personality. While most of you will disagree with me, I feel that Iki Hiyori is also an important character which adds some spice to the story. Due to her caring and loving nature, she is also pretty likable. And the fact that there is almost zero percent chance of her of being in relationship with a god, Yato, makes us want to know more about their relation progression.


Enjoyment: 10/10
For me, the first season of Noragami was like 10/10 in terms of enjoyment but the second half was like 7/10. With more interesting plot, Noragami Aragoto has exploited the curiosity of the viewers and made this season worth a watch. Definitely 10/10 in terms of enjoyment.
img()


Overall: 9.8/10
If you really liked Noragami first season, then Noragami Aragoto is undoubtedly a must watch for you! If you are like me who liked half of the season and the other half of the season was meh, then you must give the second season a shot and you will undoubtedly be satisfied with it. And if you didn't like Noragami first season at all, then there's not much helping it, better skip this season.

145139,"Perhaps I’ve just grown up. When I watched Season 1 of Demon Slayer a few years ago, I genuinely had a great time with it. Episode 19 had me incredibly emotional, and I was in awe over the world-class animation by Studio Ufotable. The Mugen Train movie was incredible as well, with a very emotional scene at the end. I enjoyed Season 2, but not at the same level of Season 1, since it was mostly fight scenes with very flashy animation. It was not until this season where I noticed how garbage the dialogue is in this series, and maybe it’s just because I’ve watched much more anime since Season 2 of Demon Slayer. The dialogue is just terribly done, with lines like “I slashed him!”, and “I got slashed!” We have eyes, we can see what’s going on, there is absolutely zero need for a good chunk of the things the characters say. I’m convinced the dialogue is just there so the episode run time gets padded and they can make additional seasons of the show by stretching the events of the arc.

People love to throw around the phrase “carried by animation” if they have a negative stance on Demon Slayer, and I admit, I’ve been one of those people before. In Season 1 and 2, I believed Demon Slayer had one of the best animation productions in our modern generation. This season, I cannot with a good conscience, say that this show is even “carried by animation” anymore. Sure, there is a fair share of sakuga to go around, but nothing that really transcended previous seasons, as the studio alluded to. The CGI is indeed an issue, but not in the way most people say. Having CGI is not inherently a bad thing, and the CGI in this season of Demon Slayer wasn’t bad, but given how much of a focus what on 2D animation in the past seasons, it just feels uncharacteristic of the show, and a bit of a letdown. The animation is still great, don’t get me wrong, but it’s just not enough for me to really get a kick out of it. The fight scenes also felt more uncreative than previous seasons. Remember when in Season 1, the settings were more interesting, and the fights weren’t all just screaming in the air, and slashing, and there was some strategy to the fights? There’s none of that anymore. It’s just riding the hype.

The story for this arc felt the most shallow of the seasons so far, and one that felt very “empty” to me, without a real objective other than killing the demons that pop up every episode. It was also a very backstory heavy season, with three backstories almost back to back. A problem I find in both this show and in Hell’s Paradise is that they try to characterize the characters by giving them a dark backstory where either all their families die, they were on the brink of death, or some kind of sob story. Just because they had a dark past, I’m supposed to suddenly care about the character now? I just don’t understand why every single character needs to have a sad backstory, it gets repetitive quick, and in my opinion, it’s a terrible way to give development to the characters, as it doesn’t reflect on what they’re doing in the here and now, but just to play on the viewer’s emotions.

The characters this season were extremely unmemorable. The villains this season were also very annoying with their antics and hugely inflated dialogue-heavy moments. They feel completely un-threatening, and completely devoid of any semblance of depth other than gimmicky actions of being in a vase, crying every two seconds, or whatever else they were doing. The amount of needless dialogue some of the villains spouted just made episodes go from 5 minutes to 25 minutes, just for the sake of padding the episode, and then ending with a cliffhanger.

All in all, this season felt like a soulless, passionless pile of uninspired drivel, and Mitsuri was just there to provide fan service for how bland the writing was. The flashy animation can only take the series so far, and this time around, it wasn’t nearly as flashy either. I probably have more enjoyment just laughing at how dumb some of the writing is.

Hopefully this is the worst that this series has to offer. I want to enjoy this show, I truly do. No problem if you like this season of course, nothing against fans of the show, we all have varying taste. If anything, if Demon Slayer can keep the lights on at Studio Ufotable and fund their next project, whether it’s more Type-Moon content, or the Genshin anime, I guess that’d be a nice trade-off. 

Here's a fishie to brighten up your day though.

When I was kid, I was really easy to please. When it came to entertainment, all you’d have to do was show me something from a genre I liked and I’d pretty much be guaranteed to like it. Race cars? Hell yeah. Superpowers? You got it. Magical girls? Kill yourself. But here I am, trying to convince you that a magical girl show is one of mankind’s greatest creations. I first watched Madoka Magica in a time where my tastes were still rapidly developing, and despite the high rating and rave reviews, my expectations were set pretty low. Of course after starting it, I was quickly proven…right. It only took me three episodes to tell myself that there was nothing about this that interested me. And so I dropped it. God, if only I could go back in time and punch myself for that. But at least it didn’t last for long. I kept hearing people call the show “a psychological masterpiece” and always saw it at the top of hardcore elitists’ favorites list, so I eventually decided to grit my teeth and give it another go. And while I’m not completely sure what exactly changed this time around, I actually found the same episodes I had disliked just a couple months ago pretty fascinating. I like to think it’s because this time I was actively considering why I hadn’t liked it the first time. I started to think things like “how had I not seen how insane the art here was?”, a sure sign that I had been taking several things that I really did value for granted. Fast forward almost two years later after finishing the show, and I’ve now found countless aspects throughout that I practically worship, ranging from broad universal ideas to the tiniest hidden details. So without further ado, here’s a few of those aspects that I was able to put into words.

img()

How does the universe work? What makes us human? Can we be happy by simply fulfilling our desires? Are our desires even what we think they are? Gen Urobuchi has built up quite the reputation for crafting complex and captivating stories, and despite being a magical girl show, Madoka Magica is no exception. In his usual pattern of writing, the Urobutcher thoroughly explores the difference between logic and human emotion to shed light into how the world really works. He does this through war in Fate/Zero, through society in Psycho-Pass, and with Madoka, he does this through the entire universe itself. Questions about the fundamental aspects of reality and how it affects us are analyzed in depth, making this Urobuchi’s most existential and thought provoking work I’ve seen to date. And given the guy’s prowess as a writer, that’s basically saying it’s one of the most thought provoking works I’ve ever come across. The show’s world building and magic system are built completely around these themes, with well-defined rules and few to no plot holes despite dealing with complex supernatural elements. Another aspect worth noting is the sheer density of storytelling in the show. Every single moment in its entire 12 episode runtime has its purpose, whether it’s directly advancing the plot, humanizing the characters, exploring its world and ideas, or often all of the above at the same time. One criticism I’d make is that the first few episodes may seem quite slow on the first watch, but on a rewatch you’d find them packed with some of the most brilliant foreshadowing in the medium for all of the story’s crazy shocks and surprises that come later. All of these tightly packed elements build towards a surreal, beautiful ending that effortlessly ties up all of its ideas while leaving room for its insane sequel movie.

While I’d say its characters are the show’s “weakest” aspect, this is not at all a show with weak aspects. As expected from its short runtime, almost all of the focus is placed on the five main girls and their adorable little pet, Kyubey. Oh, and a villain who I won’t name. In fact, for the sake of being spoiler-free I won’t name anyone while describing them. If you’ve seen the show you should be able to fill in the blanks. And if you haven’t, you now know exactly what you’re gonna do after reading this. Of the five girls, two in particular really stand out as stellar characters:  and . Both have several layers to their personalities, and their growth throughout the show is fascinating to watch unfold. While not quite as complex,  is also very multifaceted and human as a result of her dark past. As for , she is quite a bit simpler since her character is largely used as a symbol, but she portrays that symbol very effectively.  is admittedly a step down from the others, but she still deconstructs what it really means to be a role model quite well. And of course, how could I forget , that adorable little rascal. On the other hand, the main villain, , is an incredible foil to the main cast, representing the ultimate incarnation of logic. As a result, this villain’s actions are supported by some of the most justifiable motives I’ve ever seen, to the point where the show starts to question why the villain is the antagonist, what his antagonism shows about humanity, and why we were even made to want to antagonize him in the first place. Lastly for characters are the many witches presented in the show. While their characters are not explicitly told to us, hints of personality are shown through some crazy visual storytelling, which leads me to what I most admire about the entire show: the art.

img383() img383()

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. I say it’s worth infinite. Even a simple picture of…say, [a cotton ball with a mustache](), could probably be talked about and dissected for somewhere around a thousand words before forming some sort of meaning that makes sense, and even then all those words wouldn’t do the picture justice. So imagine just how many words it would take to come even close to interpreting a witch labyrinth in this show, with its hundreds of different seemingly nonsensical animations and images all swirling around in a sea of chaos. If such words even exist, they’d have to capture how these chaotic masses of abstraction can radiate such nightmarish feelings of awe, terror, depression, and insanity. The attention to detail is just unreal, with every movement timed precisely and every single image conveying some symbolic meaning that altogether creates a seemingly living, breathing environment that morphs into representations of certain characters’ deepest feelings. I’m talking the type of stuff that’ll make your English teacher pass out. Hell, the art directors even made an [entire unique alphabet](https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Decipheringtherunes) to hide several hidden messages, literary references, and poems within each labyrinth. To decode these, you have to first match each letter with up to three different symbols per letter depending on the situation, and then translate it from German to an actual readable language (sorry Germans). If that isn’t attention to detail, god knows what is. Studio Shaft may be famous for their abstract visual style, filled with vibrant colors, symbolism, and overabundant head tilts. But what they’ve done here with these witch labyrinths might as well be on another dimension from anything I’ve ever seen before, including the rest of their work.

Even outside the witch labyrinths the art is incredible. Gorgeous futuristic cityscapes are depicted throughout, which look crisp and clean in a stark contrast to the chaos of the labyrinths. The extreme minimalism often gives off an empty, desolate vibe, almost as if it’s putting up a facade for something deeper within, like a person hiding their emotions behind an expressionless mask. Sunsets are especially beautiful, and wash the entire city in a fiery orange glow. The character designs themselves are pretty unique and cutesy. I didn’t really like them at first, but they warmed up to me over the course of the show and now I find them quite adorable. And like everything else in this show, their clothes, accessories, and mannerisms all carry plenty of symbolic meaning.

We all know soundtracks can convey a really wide range of feelings. They can warm your heart, inspire hope, drain away all your happiness till you’re left soulless and crying yourself to sleep…oh wait, I don’t need a soundtrack to do that. But anyways, where Madoka’s music excels the most is in creating those cold chills that make your arm hairs erect; a feeling you might get from watching something like the apocalypse unfold. The greatest example of this is [Magia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp3rnFGs), which also doubles as the ED for most of the episodes in addition to being used as a normal track, and my goosebumps get goosebumps from those heavy electric guitar strokes and ghostly vocals whenever it plays. There are also tracks that are amazing at conveying bittersweetness, like [Decretum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcgEHrwdSO4) and [Sis Puella Magica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmSuNcxiIU), by combining somber violin strokes with delicate chimes that pluck at the heartstrings. No matter what kind of tone the show is trying to convey, there’s always a track that fits and amplifies it naturally. Something that makes this soundtrack stand out in particular is the way it’s able to convey meaning, and I’m not talking about through just lyrics. For almost every major character in the show, there’s a theme for them that captures their personalities and development through tone, progression, and even chord structure in [Homura’s case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHOKs-1IKk).

Apart from the main soundtrack, there are some super trippy sound effects to accompany those trippy visuals. I don’t even know how to describe them, but that should be proof enough of how trippy they are. The [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrgpX-bFqM) is sweet enough, with heartwarming melodies, visuals, and lyrics that are thematically relevant, but I don’t think it’s one of the greatest OPs ever or anything. The main [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MlhVkOxz0) though, which I talked about before, is by far the best I’ve ever heard. And voice acting is on point throughout the entire show, particularly at its emotional highs when those words feel like they pierce right through you.

I could spend all day talking about the unreal emotions this anime has made me feel. I could talk about how it made me tear up 3 times within the span of two minutes just from awe. Or how it made me go numb from pure shock on a rewatch when I knew exactly what was going to happen. But I think the best way to convey how I truly feel about this series lies in a question I find myself thinking on a daily basis: 

>How is it even possible for something so brilliant to exist?

Yeah I bet that caught your attention, skimmers. Of course, this isn’t something I immediately thought while watching the first few episodes. It wasn’t even really something I thought after finishing the series, despite loving the hell out of it at that point. It was only after at least a year of thinking, reading, and rewatching in hopes of truly getting a detailed understanding of it where I started to see just how insane of a creation Madoka Magica really is. Not only does it master all the individual aspects above, it seamlessly blends their boundaries so that all these aspects are constantly working together throughout the show. The story isn’t just enhanced by the visuals and music, a large part of it is told by them. The characters don’t just exist for plot convenience or to look cool, they all represent key ideas that drive the story’s themes. And every single thing you see, hear, or taste in the show, whether it’s an entire witch labyrinth, a weird camera angle, [a conversation about how girls can’t love girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI9hgp32-f0), or even just an overabundance of windows in a school building, all of it builds toward a massive overarching message about existence itself that can be applied to every single aspect of our reality. I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but that really is what I’ve come to believe after all the time I’ve spent digging into it. And all the enjoyment I got from doing so made all that effort so much more than worth it.

I like to think of a piece of media as a cake. At least right now for the sake of this review I do. In Madoka Magica’s case, it would be a cake with simple frosting covering countless different layers that all contribute to the flavor. For each extra layer you eat per bite, the bite tastes exponentially better since each layer helps complement and balance the others out. I often see people on the internet or in real life say they thought Madoka Magica was “pretty good” or just “decent” without being able to come up with a single justifiable reason for thinking that way. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with having a different opinion. But to them I ask, if you can’t justify your opinion on something, are you sure you aren’t just eating the frosting by itself, just like I did both literally and metaphorically as a kid? And if that’s the case, what’s stopping you from digging deeper into that cake if you know it’ll taste better that way?

Stories are powerful things. For every person in the world, there’s at least one story out there that can significantly change them for the better. After all, stories are able to convey ideas by showing them to us, which can be infinitely more powerful than simple words of advice. Unfortunately, over the years, people seem to have become less and less willing to acknowledge this power, sometimes even going as far as ridiculing the possibility of a mature adult having their worldview changed by a movie, TV show, or god forbid, one of those Japanese cartoons. I’d bet a good chunk of people have already consumed a story that could’ve changed them, but weren’t willing to look deep enough to view it as something far more than just a way to pass the time. It all starts with simple ideas or expressions that resonate. After that comes finding out why these ideas resonate, and seeing how they can make you a happier person. With Madoka Magica, its ideas were enough for me to devote a deep and personal interest towards, and before I knew it they had become influences on my life that even today affect the way I imagine things, the way I cope with despair, and the way I see myself in relation to the vast unknown. And Madoka Magica is the type of story that’ll have me exploring these ideas for the rest of my life."
100388,"Maybe I've just run out of patience. After fifteen years of seeing/reading queer-adjacent stories that think this kind of subtext is good writing, that refuse to just spit it out and make it official, that's a distinct possibility. But even with that taken into account, Banana Fish is one of the most extreme examples I've ever seen.

I started watching this anime because drug mystery intrigue with gang wars and two guys falling in love among the chaos? Sign. me. up. However, around the halfway point I started to get the feeling that they were either A. heavily delaying the inevitable, or B. never plan on turning the subtext into text. So I looked up what to expect (even though I'm violently anti-spoiler) and I'm extremely happy I did. Because if I had to watch gun shooting lessons draped in sunsets, declarations of ""I'll wait for you forever,"" super zoomed in closeups of deeply affected reactions to what the other was heroically doing, tongue kissing for strictly plot purposes, tearful confessions of guarded secrets in the dead of night, ""one of them thinks the other is dead"" tropes, etc etc etc with no actual romantic payoff, I would have been livid. 

At some point, calling it a 'friendship' becomes irresponsible writing. If you're treating it like a romance, developing it like a romance, and giving it all the emotional cues of a romance, but don't turn the corner and make it a freaking romance, that is bad writing. That's setting up viewer expectation and not delivering. At all. May as well pull the rug and yell 'sike!' while you're at it.

And what's more, apparently the original manga (that came out in the 1980s for crying out loud) called a spade a spade! They actually called them gay! So why not the anime? 

The whole thing is baffling, especially since the rest of it is damn compelling. Sure, some of the twists and turns aren't terribly surprising or imaginative, but it's sourced from the 80s. As a whole it keeps you engaged, keeps things moving, and throws more obstacles at the main characters than they know what to do with. (Ash got hit with the Tragedy Porn in particular, but again...80s). 

They had a solid, entertaining, captivating thing here, all of it cheapened by robbing the core relationship of the show of its due."
19,">And I saw a beast rising out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads; 
And on its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names. 
And the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority. 
They worshipped the dragon, for he had given authority to the beast, 
And they worshipped the beast, saying, 
“Who is like the beast, 
And who can fight against it?”
Revelations 13: 1-4 NRSV

The culmination of Naoki Urasawa’s genius; the groundbreaking Monster. Written by the legendary mangaka himself. Naoki Urasawa was known for his wholesome shoujo manga, Yawara! which was released in 1986. But in 1995, he decided to write a completely new manga, by going into uncharted territories. This manga was adapted into an anime format by the studio Madhouse in 2004. Little did he know, that this anime, would come to be his best.

 Urasawa seamlessly perfects the art of persuasion; pathos, logos and ethos. It is unlike any of his works, as it questions every aspect of the human ethos. By showcasing empathetic characters, it evokes pathos from the audience. It explores profound concepts and often nihilistic ideologies, which lead way to numerous diverse logos. The conundrums are so philosophical, that you tend to forget your own habituated mentality. The elusiveness depicted in each question, is due to the abundance of philosophy, mainly evident in the cynical part of the show. What makes it a legendary medium redefining anime is the sheer surrealism portrayed in each and every sequence, which consequently leads to an unexpected conclusion. Its depiction of the human mind, soul and body is so close to reality, that it often comes off as horrifying. 

Naoki Urasawa has a way of portraying mere humans as inhumane creatures, without using excessive and unnecessary blood, gore and horror. He achieves this by delving into the psychological aspect of the human emotions. The emotions that are constantly reinvigorated are fear, terror, agony, trepidation and hopelessness.

Monster showcases numerous characters throughout its long duration. Each character has some sort of significance and adds a layer of nuance to the overall message. The side characters are portrayed tragically, even those who appear periodically, which always have a deep underlying message. The stories which pivot around these characters showcase a moral lesson, a few examples being ""I will stop smoking"" and ""I will stop drinking"". From an outer perspective, these may seem trivial, superficial and generic, but they definitively show the flaws of these characters, and how they try to better themselves, but eventually succumb to their inner 'Monster'.

The story is definitely the best aspect of the show. It easily achieves a strong infrastructure in just a few episodes. It does so by constantly creating grueling and unexpected scenarios, which often lead to an unforeseeable result. The methodic aspect of the story is unimaginable - in a way that makes it completely original and creative. 

To grossly simplify, the story is about a heavily acclaimed Japanese neurosurgeon named Tenma Kenzo. He goes from Japan to Germany to find a suitable job. After being lost in a foreign country and not being able to find a job, Dr. Heinemann, the director of a highly influential hospital, takes him in after seeing his exceptional aptitude. He instantly makes a connection with the daughter of the said director, Eva Heinemann. He places his complete trust in both of them, and always reiterates being indebted to them. The story takes an unexpected turn when the term ‘morality’ comes into play. 

 Occupations are often portrayed as a leeway to an adult world, and to some extent, they are. But not in a good sense. No matter how much passion you have for a specific occupation, you'll eventually realize the inevitable grim side, which in Monster's case revolves around medicine. The world of medicine is riddled with politics. The life of an individual is measured by their stature. Going on this disconcerting statement, a man with a higher position will be treated undeservingly better. Naoki Urasawa squares in on this concept with the perspective of a renowned Neurosurgeon undergoing a mental deconstruction, who seemingly creates an infinite time paradox of stress. This paradox is the result of a version of the trolley problem. Two people come into the hospital. One is an influential Mayor whose death could result in the downfall of the entire hospital, and the other is a young boy on the verge of death, who came before the Mayor.  A classic ethical dilemma.  The decision may seem obvious, but the surrounding environment urges Tenma to go with the Mayor. Eventually, Tenma makes his decision and opts to perform on the boy, which results in the worst-case scenario.

Naoki Urasawa uses every single one of his forte residing in his repertoire which creates an amalgam of perfection, complemented by his signature art style, which Madhouse exceptionally replicates. This, in turn, leads way to a prodigious score, where each soundtrack aggregates into a sanguine symphony, equally melancholic and cathartic. The casting is done adequately, and the voice actors truly fit the characters, bringing them to life. 

Monster is criticized for its inconsistent pacing, which I conform with to some extent, however, I find works like these with a dry episodic tone more appealing. Any other criticism is often subjective, undiscussable, baseless or downright idiotic. The overall message of Monster is an inexplicable one, which can be defined in many ways. Monster diminishes the importance of a name, by showing its insignificance and how easily an identity can be manipulated. It ends with showing Johan in a hospital bed, but in the next frame, the bed is empty, signifying that the Monster with No Name ceases to exist. Monster continues to retain its ambiguity till' the final sequence, where the ending manages to be portrayed in such an inoffensive way, resembling the aforementioned rhetorical triangle.

 The view which I highly agree with is that the 'Monster' resides within everyone. Grimmer’s violence, Tenma’s altruism that makes him save criminals, Lunge’s indifference towards his family, doctors’ choice of saving wealthier patients, Bonaparta’s experiments, Roberto’s lust and murders. Anyone can become a Monster, even you."
113813,"I think Rent-a-Girlfriend does three things well. It has a nice presentation, it looks good, and it has the honor of having The Peggies do its OP. I'll get to the other parts it does well later. I'm going to refer to Rent-a-Girlfriend as Rag for now on because it's easier and seems like an appropriate nickname for it.

A quick plot summary with a few gripes along the way, Rag starts with our MC Kazuya recently getting dumped by his girlfriend of one month, Mami, the seemingly conniving and manipulative type. To get over this, Kazuya masturbates, a lot. Like too much. My god who thought having inner monologues over a dude fapping would be a good idea. The soft colored presentation of the anime really is betrayed by Rag's tendency to implied jerking off scenes and the weakest attempts at ecchi. Then, Kazuya discovers an app that's the Door Dash equivalent of getting an escort. Through this he meets the stunning and charming Chizuru, who through a series of the most nauseating and eye rolling inducing decisions made to hamstring some sort of conflict for the show is now stuck with Kazuya. They have to fake being a couple to their friends and Kazuya's grandma, who desperately wants her grandson to stop being such a loser and introduce the love of his life to her before she dies. In a crazy twist of fate, these two turnout to be neighbors.

As for the characters, the overlying problem with Rag is that no matter how good or best ""waifu"" material they may seem to you basement dwellers, they are all tied to Kazuya and having to like him because he is a harem MC. Chizuru switches between acting as the perfect girlfriend to an assertive, do anything to keep her job a secret type. Throughout the entire running of the show, Kazuya does nothing beneficial for Chizuru. He stalks her and begs for her to keep up this charade for him. There is no quality Kazuya possesses or action he does for it to be believable that Chizuru can hold any sense of feeling for him outside of pity. Just understand that this is a harem and the ladies need to flock around him because it's easier to do that than to write a competent romcom. 

We get introduced to Ruka later on, who is a rented girlfriend for his loser beaver-tooth looking friend. Her shtick is that she has a heart condition and goes on dates to find the one that can make her heartbeat properly or something along the lines of that. Turns out, that man is Kazuya. Yet again, he does nothing to win over the affection of the girl, he is simply given it as they start to date. Ruka's condition is only explained through the ED of her first episode appearance, and honestly I thought it was a nice way to present it, as this is still a secret from everyone else. Ruka's fault is that she is annoying, and she is a cuckold, as Kazuya refuses to stop renting Chizuru, now out of a genuine feeling of love for her. Which was realized during a masturbation sequence. Very cool. 

The character who caught my eye the most was Sumi, for having a really cute character design. She shows up at the second to last episode. You see more masturbation in Rag than you do Sumi. Her deal is that she is taking the job to become less shy and she looks up to Chizuru as a role model for the job. She gets set up on a rented date with Kazuya to practice. It's a simple, cute episode of them going on a date, albeit a bit boring. Everything goes well and you just know the seed of affection in the wide, vast fields of loving a harem MC is planted. These girls should have a higher standard. Nonetheless, Mami spots them during their date.

The best part of Rag is Mami. She is voice acted by Aoi Yuuki who does a phenomenal job. Mami is the main antagonizing force of Rag and really brings spicy conflict. She's still possessive over Kazuya for whatever reason. She plays dirty and is manipulative. It is genuinely entertaining to see the other characters wrapped around her finger like they’re her plaything. But, this loops back around to the big problem with Rag. All of these girls are tied to Kazuya.

Kazuya is the biggest loser. It’s okay to be a loser, and he’s not an incel, but he is extremely irredeemable. There is nothing he does that would entice any of these girls to like him. The last thing I think Rag does well is a very small detail. Him and Chizuru’s first date is at the aquarium. A small detail yet plays the only part in Kazuya’s positive character development. You go into his apartment and notice he has posters of fish and a good collection of aquatic creatures he takes care of. It was a nice detail to give Kazuya some dimension of personality of him having an interesting hobby and having it be a background detail. That is literally one of the only things Rag does well. That’s it. The harem fails as the object of everyone’s affection is this contemptable loser. Every plot point is so forced with conflict that could be resolved with just a single conversation. Rag cannot not have Kazuya on screen at all times, as he literally secretly listens into almost every conversation like some creep. Kazuya never improves, he never learns, and does nothing to win over any girl. He simply begs and pines for Chizuru’s affection and masturbates, treating his actual girlfriend like an unwanted side piece because he’s to much of a coward to confess his feelings.

Rag, as a harem romcom, has very little spice, very little humor, terrible romance, and half-assed ecchi. Just watch Nisekoi or Bokuben instead. At best it’s a bit spicy, at worst it’s incredibly boring."

If the first cour of the show had been to gather the cast and crystallize the relationships and status quo, the second cour naturally would follow suit to see the characters in their day-to-day life, trying to make the most of their crazy situations and frequently getting in and out of trouble. The notion itself is perfectly fine; this is a world where there are essentially three stories moving in parallel – Operation Strix being carried out by Loid, Anya’s adventures at school to get good grades and into Damian’s good graces, and Yor’s attempting / failing to become a better housewife while maintaining her double-life as an assassin. Each one presents its own scenarios that feel at home with the cross between spy thriller and comedy that the show managed to pull off beforehand.

But therein lies the problem – the keyword that I had used to describe the first cour was “spontaneity,” and that is what feels like it is sorely missing this second time around the block. The sheer collision of the absurd and crazy was a part of Spy x Family’s adrenaline. In trying to so often fit square pegs into round holes through its dynamics and interactions, the series had an off-kilter swagger that impacted both the scenarios, setpieces, and the characters within them. That swagger is absent, however. Because the series has now reoriented itself into a new norm, the scenarios feel less crazed and more trite. They’ve more or less settled into a routine, robbing the series of a sense of forward momentum.

Most typically, there are two ways to express forward momentum from a storytelling standpoint. One is the way we generally tend to associate with stories: have the plot itself move from point A to point B and so on until you get to the end. The other way tends to lend itself better to episodic content like Spy x Family – rather than focus on the overarching encompassing conflict and eventual resolution, have the focus be geared more towards the largely self-contained episodes and get by through whatever the stylistic vibe the show is going for. The focus is less geared towards the resolution of the whole and more towards the resolution of the moment.

This series adopts the latter approach, and on some level, this makes perfect sense. The franchise is structured like a sitcom through its idea of “mission of the week” and putting larger-scale conflicts on hold, delaying the sense of a finale until the mangaka Endou Tatsuya feels that the time for it has arrived. However, there is a misalignment between where Spy x Family’s strength ultimately lies versus where this cour thinks it does, at least in regards to its material – the charade of maintaining the family life and focusing the attention on the Forger family as a unit tends to work far more effectively. Operation Strix is not where the appeal is kept because that is not what the series has been about, at least as I have watched. The Operation being carried out may have been what gathered the ensemble, both from within and from without the Forger household, but that mostly served as a means to an end and a backdrop rather than being the main glue that kept me coming back initially. 

It’s within the comedic moments of Yor trying to become a better cook, Loid realizing that his marriage might possibly be in jeopardy, and Anya snarkily commenting on the various goings-on between everyone that gives the series its funky color. The grander overarching story of Operation Strix has far less appeal both comedically and dramaturgically than the everyday life of the Forgers and the natural problems that arise because, well, families experience problems, especially considering that everyone in this particular family has secrets that they MUST keep from one another. Spy x Family part two places too much emphasis on the drama with the comedy somewhat forcing itself in rather than the comedy taking the reins from the start. 

That’s not to say that the series is not trying to make Operation Strix work, because it is. There are remnants of that off-kilter variety there, such as from the first scenario of being threatened with the trained terrorist dogs, and needing to break into a secured area in order to change some test answers. The addition of Nightfall, another spy that has worked with Loid, is among the better aspects of the second cour, mostly because of her interactions with the show’s inner structure. She introduces a direct counter to both the spy and the Yor storyline by trying to prove herself worthy of being Loid’s new wife. Aside from the juxtaposition of a cold-on-the-outside, head-over-heels-in-love-on-the-inside facet of her character, she presents a threat disconnected to the East vs. West cold war that hangs over Loid’s mission. Her main concern is not the success of Operation Strix, but with proving herself to be a far-better housewife and marriage partner than Yor. 

By having her character written in this fashion, she manages to weave herself into the Operation Strix scenario anyway, which makes the connection between Loid’s home life and Loid’s work “marry” wonderfully. What this illustrates is that Spy x Family tends to be at its best when it’s examining the characters of the Forger household, with the other storylines moving as companion pieces alongside. The strength is in playing off the incongruities of both the people and the storylines that comprise it, yet tying them together in unexpected ways. The family thread acts as the real heart of the tapestry, the real cypher that makes everything fall into its proper place.

With a film and a second season on the horizon (both slated for 2023 release), I do not know whether my misgiving about this cour result from the material not being as inherently funny as the first cour, or if I no longer find the premise as alluring as I once did. Only time will tell for sure. I do not believe the cour itself is bad, but rather that it is not nearly as entertaining as it once was. Spy x Family is a series that made me laugh more than I assumed it would when I first saw it, and I truly hope that future installments can make that happen for me yet again.

100240,"Tokyo Ghoul:re Anime Review
Episodes: 12
Genres: Horror, Supernatural, Psychological

Plot: 3.5/10
Most stories will have a clear problem in the beginning that the characters need to resolve before the book or show ends. Like in a classic mystery: someone dies, we need to figure out who killed them. Tokyo Ghoul:re doesn’t have something like that? We’re introduced to a mishmash of character who seem to not have any motivations, except one. Nothing happens that would indicate a problem until the anime is 3/4 over. The characters just live their lives, doing whatever they want, not achieving anything. The story is actually about how Haise deals with his lost memories, but the way he deals with it is so incredibly unrealistic and boring. The show cannot even get its main objective done well. Also, can we talk about Deus Ex Machina? Maybe used once or twice in a show isn’t that bad, but multiple times in every episode? It’s so annoying when none of the characters can die because everyone apparently has magical powers of living. You finally think someone will die, nope saved by some random luck. It’s poor story writing when you rely on this cliché so heavily.

Art/Animation: 6/10
The animation is “meh” at best. There’s nothing really special about it. For a show heavily focused on fight scenes, said fight scenes weren’t animated to their full potential. Why this category gets a 6 however, is the art. I quite liked the character designs and seeing how old characters changed. Juuzou <3

Music: 5/10
Numerous times while watching this show I thought to myself, “You know, there may be something wrong with your show if the opening theme is the greatest thing about it”. The opening was great; everything else was lackluster. Nothing more to be said about it.

Characters: 1.5/10
This is my biggest problem with the show by far. None of the characters were likable, none (Juuzou is cool tho). The show tries its hardest to make you like the characters, except Urie, and feel for their struggles, but you just feel nothing. The show makes the ghouls out to be these harmless creatures that just need to eat, but you really couldn’t care less if any of them died. Speaking of Urie, he was the most annoying character I have ever had the misfortune of seeing in my entire life. His monologue was simply there to prove how much of a jerk he is and everything he does, everything is useless to the plot. He does nothing, but make himself look idiotic. Now, do the characters have any development? No. No, they don’t. The one character that is meant to have a lot of development, Haise, is the most indecisive person I have ever seen. I don’t want to talk about the ending because of spoilers, but you cannot have a character develop when they are constantly fluttering back and forth on how to behave. His entire character is a mess.

Overall Score: 4/10"
11617,"Disclaimer: This is a SPOILER-FREE review of the first season of [High School DxD](https://anilist.co/anime/11617/High-School-DxD/). Rather than a review, this is meant to serve as an elongated personal impression. I bring up very subjective points and relate DxD to other anime, however, I hope you enjoy reading this nonetheless.



High School DxD is notorious for its copious amounts of ecchi; however, lewd fanservice is not the only thing it can provide. It most certainly does not deliver a groundbreaking, revolutionary story, but it does deliver some good entertainment. Although it's not on par with Toaru, High School DxD will possibly go down in my book as one of my favorite battle harem series. Personally, I'm not a fan of most battle shounen, but I must say that High School DxD has some aspects that I love about them. Even though High School DxD is, in reality, an ecchi battle series, the anime adaptation holds much more than that.

img()

The story of High School DxD is nothing complex, yet it is not extremely simple. It’s not something that will make you re-evaluate your life choices; after all, it is still an ecchi battle harem series. However, DxD does have its fair share of lore. I’m not saying that it contains elements that revolutionize the world of storytelling, and I cannot talk about the story too much without spoiling anything. In terms of the source material, High School DxD’s first season does not deviate from the light novel too much. For the average viewer, this should not matter. It might have added some bits and removed others, but that does not take away from the enjoyment factor. Fights in this anime are also a joy to watch. It may not be ufotable quality, but it most certainly isn’t bad. The pacing in this anime is just right. It's not like High School DxD starts with Issei hanging out with his friends and then the next episode he's the ultimate being squaring up with God or something like that.

img()

The characters in this show fit into tropes and it is very apparent. Tropes in anime are definitely not a bad thing; in fact, they are most certainly welcomed in my book. But, people have different tastes so they may not be enjoyable. First off, I want to talk about [Issei Hyoudou](https://anilist.co/character/50387/Issei-Hyoudou), our main protagonist. I’m sure many teenagers have had their own “Issei” stage in their life. You know what I’m talking about… the stage where all one can think about is the body of the opposite sex. Issei Hyoudou has that vibe of your average perverted high-schooler with a generic shounen protagonist thrown into the mix. However, when I say generic shounen protagonist, I don’t mean the, “I’m going to fight things for absolutely no reason!” kind of shounen protagonist. The point is, Issei is somewhat likable due to his moderately relatable character. Along with the main character, the main heroines of the series are also pretty likable in my opinion. After all, what is a harem without its heroines? I won’t talk about them too much, but I will say that they do fit into stereotypical anime archetypes. For example, [Rias](https://anilist.co/character/50389/Rias-Gremory) and [Akeno](https://anilist.co/character/51347/Akeno-Himejima) both fit the older sister archetype, [Asia](https://anilist.co/character/51335/Asia-Argento) fits the younger sister archetype, and [Koneko](https://anilist.co/character/51343/Koneko-Toujou) fits the “kuudere” archetype. Personally, my favorite character was Asia Argento due to her role in the story. The point is, the characters aren’t dull, but they are not vibrant. Furthermore, I’d like to talk about the voice actors. In my opinion, the voice actors in this show did a great job at their respective roles, especially [Yuuki Kaji](https://anilist.co/staff/95672/Yuuki-Kaji)’s performance as Issei Hyoudou. At first, I didn’t think his voice fit the character, but it grew on me fast. His performance really sells Issei Hyoudou’s character. Also, the character design in this show is also nice. For instance, I really like how [Yuuto Kiba](https://anilist.co/character/51345/Yuuto-Kiba) looks in the ending sequence.

img()

img()

Speaking of Kiba in the ending, I’d like to take my time to talk about High School DxD’s infamous ending. It may be an overstatement, but the visuals of the ending sequence are astounding. The animation itself flows extremely well, and it glues my eyes to the screen like hypnosis. It’s mesmerizing. I’m not saying this because of the lecherous visuals, it just flows extremely well with the combination of the song. The ending song itself is, in my opinion, a great song. Both the ending visuals and the song itself can stand on their own. I understand that this does not add to the overall plot of High School DxD, but it surely adds some points to the adaptation.

img()

Along with the ending sequence, the soundtrack and opening sequence are joys to the ears. I’m very glad that I have the ability to hear in order to listen to this soundtrack. It’s not a Kevin Penkin or Sawano Hiroyuki masterpiece, but the soundtrack is splendid. The way everything in the soundtrack is orchestrated is beautiful in my opinion. For example, the main combat theme 「[Utsukushiku, Akai](https://youtu.be/yNTCKiR5Ofw)」features a violin that gives off majestic vibes; attacking the ears with flurries of alluring melodies. The soundtrack itself is one of my favorite things about the show. Also, the opening sequence is great; it’s one of those openings that I would listen to in my spare time. I don’t know how I would explain the opening song in text, so I'll leave this nice song [here](https://youtu.be/NA6kahymBUk).

img()

High School DxD’s ecchi factor is most likely the reason why many people came to watch this show. When the term “ecchi anime” pops up, chances are that High School DxD pops up in some people’s heads. While DxD does contain heavy ecchi elements, breasts are not shoved in the viewer’s face every ten seconds (at least in season one). However, it does have lewd moments in scenes that do not need it. The ecchi factor in this anime is not extremely overbearing, but it is not subtle.

img()

In general, High School DxD is an enjoyable experience. I recommend it for fans of ecchi, harem, and action. While DxD’s action and ecchi balance may not be the best in the world, it most certainly isn’t the worst. The characters and the soundtrack are the stars of the show, and I would totally rewatch the first season for them alone. While the series is enjoyable, it isn’t exactly groundbreaking. So, I give High School DxD a:

7.5/10, kuma!

There are few franchises that have captured my attention in the same way ""Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure” has. Both as a manga and as an anime it manages to be this wholly unique experience. Through the combination of Hirohiko Araki’s never ending imagination and David Production’s efforts this has become what I consider to be one of the defining anime series of the decade. With each new installment in the franchise this feeling becomes more validated. What I want to explore in this review is the fourth part, “Diamond is Unbreakable” or DIU for short. This was a very refreshing series, especially when following something like “Stardust Crusaders”. It gave us some of the greatest characters in the franchise, some of the best arcs, it gave me my personal favorite villain in Kira Yoshikage, an amazing visual style, a wonderful soundtrack, rewatching it for the first time since it aired really gave me a new appreciation for it. 

When we first saw the key visuals for the anime I will admit I had some apprehensions. I wasn’t sure at the time if this is how I wanted to see the characters look, but as time progressed it really grew on me. The difficult thing about the aesthetics in DIU is in the manga Araki was undergoing some radical change as an artist. The earlier chapters show a significantly different style than the later ones. This is quite the situation to be in when adapting the manga. Do you try to achieve that earlier look or do you just work with what we had at the end? What fans got was this middle ground that ended up working to the anime’s benefit. This style allowed for the characters to be more expressive than they had been in previous installments. And this color palette is so unique that I really have to applaud the staff. Josuke in his royal blue gakuran against this yellow sky is so eye catching. Koichi’s silver hair is far more interesting than the blond hair many expected him to have. And I just love the shade of green they chose for Rohan’s hair. Fans over the years have brought up how there were some dips in animation quality during DIU. I can see what they mean, however the televised version still contained really strong visuals in spite of a few slips. Now something that I think needs to be brought to people’s attention is what David Pro did with it later. The bluray release of DIU was given a major facelift that looks absolutely stunning. It is just as visually impressive as “Vento Aureo”. And those infamous moments fans took note of during the broadcast were fixed. If you have a way to view this version of the anime I strongly suggest that you do. 

img500()
img500(v)

The DIU anime begins with the sounds of the Morioh Cho Radio jingle while we observe what would be revealed as a severed hand preparing breakfast. This was an anime original scene and I think the choice to open up this way was perfect. It establishes that we are going to be in what appears to be a regular suburban town, but something is lurking. We then see our previous hero Jotaro Kujo, now more mature and wise, arrive in the town of Morioh in pursuit of Josuke Higashikata, the illegitimate son of his grandfather Joseph Joestar.  Jojo at its core is a generational series and one of the strengths to it is how Araki manages to build off of his previous concepts. We see a fan favorite character come back into the plot, but showing signs of progression. And it is very interesting to then see Jotaro in this mentor kind of position considering the person we saw him to be in ""Stardust Crusaders"". Josuke is the character Araki has said is his personal favorite and its clear why that is. He is made instantly likable and distinct from his predecessors. He doesn’t want to cause issues for Joseph’s family and we see that he’s a really good guy. That said we also get to see that he has a ferocity when pushed too far showing that he contains that same intensity we’ve grown accustomed to in this family. He also isn’t above a little bit of scheming on occasion, but it never leaves the viewer feeling against him. Josuke is still that same positive character in spite of a little sneakiness. We also meet Koichi who does not appear like he will be very important on first glance, he even says his name isn’t worth remembering.  But as we follow him and Josuke we see him undergo great character development, becoming more confident and assertive without losing that humility that endeared him to viewers in the beginning. Okuyasu is the third person to round out our main trio and he is just a delight. Initially an enemy he then becomes Josuke’s best friend and a source of so much fun. I love watching Josuke, Okuyasu, and Koichi interact amongst themselves and following them through their crazy noisy bizarre town. After a series of adventures in Morioh that bring in other characters like Rohan Kishibe and even an older Joseph, we then shift gears into exploring just what the mystery is behind the hand in episode one. The anime handles the transition between these two phases in the story extremely well.   

One thing that has always made DIU feel so fresh is that it’s not a grand epic taking characters across the world, it’s a story focused within the town of Morioh. This worked because the characters Araki gave us are so engaging and the situations they end up in are so filled with creativity. Seeing Josuke navigate his daily life while dealing with enemy Stands and eventually the hunt for Kira Yoshikage helped give DIU its own distinct voice compared to previous parts. A Stand user of the week format is something we saw with “Stardust Crusaders” except here it’s intertwined with Josuke’s life in Morioh. We see the cast grow with each encounter he has and once our key players are established things feel so alive. When we see Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu about town it really feels like we have experienced a lot with them and that Morioh itself has taken on its own identity. The anime pulls this off with great success. They nailed the chemistry these characters share. And the seiyuu cast really brings it home. Jojo is a series that has one of my favorite casts in all of anime. We see Daisuke Ono and the late Unsho Ishizuka reprise their roles as Jotaro and Joseph. And among the new characters we have Yuuki Ono, Yuuki Kaji, Wataru Takagi, Takahiro Sakurai, Toshiyuki Morikawa, Kappei Yamaguchi, and Shigeru Chiba. The anime’s casting is just so perfect. These seiyuu just nail their roles and David Pro deserves a tremendous amount of credit for assembling such talent. 

As previously stated, DIU takes on a somewhat slice of life style. There are episodes where the characters encounter their enemy of the week and then proceed to go about their usual routines. While some episodes may not be crucial to the search for Kira, the anime doesn’t treat them like they don’t matter. We still get the same amount of excitement out of “Let’s Go Hunting”, an episode where Jotaro and Josuke hunt for a rat, that we do in something like “Sheer Heart Attack” where Jotaro and Koichi have to face off against Kira’s automatic Stand ability. Sometimes the episodes are funny and sometimes the episodes are serious, this is something Araki has always been great at balancing and David Pro has managed to strike it for themselves. There are even episodes, like “We Picked Up Something Crazy” where Josuke and Joseph find an invisible baby, which manage to serve incredible fun and then present the viewer with some strong emotions. And it all feels at home in this story. I felt the weight of the Nijimura family’s problems, I felt Hayato’s anxiety during the Bites the Dust arc, I was moved by Josuke opening himself up to Joseph. And on the other hand I always get a great laugh at Rohan being punched in the face after boasting “I’ve won” or Tonio losing his mind at Josuke because he entered his kitchen without washing his hands. None of these serious moments felt undercut by comical ones nor do the comedy scenes feel out of place in this narrative. And in the case of a character like Kira Yoshikage I always felt he walked the line between being unsettling and being darkly comical. This is what I like about him and the anime captured that amazingly. Take the scene of him licking sauce off of his “girlfriend’s” fingers after piercing the wrapping on a sandwich. Is this disturbing? Is it funny? Is it both? This is what I think Araki was trying to achieve and the anime pulled it off perfectly.

The work David Pro continues to put into the Jojo anime is nothing short of spectacular. They have continuously topped themselves and showed they are willing to try different things. When DIU came out it felt so different from what we had gotten before. The tone and feeling of it felt so fresh. It managed to be everything that the manga was while also offering up exciting new things. They provided the audience with some new scenes and even linking up three different arcs into a series of episodes creating an arc all its own. Not to mention the openings which are every bit as great as fans expect even without the CGI from past series. We still talk about the Bites the Dust version of “Great Days” for a reason. We had seen a villain tamper with the opening of the show before, but never to this extent. It’s clear to me that the anime staff members are always looking to find new ways to enhance the experience. These are things that make manga fans like myself get excited for the anime. It’s not just wanting to see the story animated, but what they are going to do with it. The manga was already a masterpiece in its own right, but sometimes that’s not going to ensure a good anime. We have seen some great manga get outright terrible adaptations, but Jojo is not among them. And DIU is every bit the adaptation it needed to be. It captures the mood and spirit of the manga while also supplying audiences with striking visuals, great voice acting, excellent music, and new ways to present the story and characters they love. And I strongly recommend giving it a revisit."
120377,"CYBERPUNK: EDGERUNNERS is an anime that was able to set up an incredibly overpowering atmosphere from just the first episode. For those that are unaware, this is an anime based within the world of a video game called Cyberpunk 2077 released in 2020. However, there is a tabletop role-playing game first published in 1988 titled Cyberpunk that this world was invented from. Needless to say, Cyberpunk's world is one with extensive history. 

And yet, CYBERPUNK: EDGERUNNERS clearly has it's roots planted firmly in the video game. The grimy streets of Night City and the sweltering dessert of a drought-stricken northern California are nearly identical to the point that hardcore fans of the game will recognize more than just a few locations.

Atmosphere. Set in the imaginary place of Night City decades into the future, mega-corporations wage wars above the drug and crime-filled streets. Cybernetic upgrades that trade your own flesh for metal can grant you unimaginable strength and even make you bullet proof. Within this cesspit of a city, cyber punks (A.K.A. edge runners) will do anything to earn money and have their names written down as legends. This dark dystopian world was something that the anime was able to convey brilliantly. From paywalls on your own washing machine to being denied healthcare and left to die if you're poor. You're constantly left deeply disturbed by the scenes that unfold around you. Many a time I found myself pausing and rewinding when I saw something I didn't believe would be real. Ultimately, the world and atmosphere is the strongest part of this show.

The characters. Excluding the main character, the rest of the cast can each be labeled by simple archetypes. But, it doesn't mean they're unlikeable. I actually loved each and every one of them even though they weren't the most well-written or deep characters. And frankly, I think it boils down to the fact that these are the kind of people you would expect in this world. A large-muscled arrogant team leader. A foul-mouthed creep. A battle loli. The scummy backstabbing guy who you knew was a villain from the first second you saw him. The outlier is ultimately David, the main character. He grew up poor with his mother who worked tirelessly to get him into an expensive academy and out of the slums, that's his mom's dream, not David's. David never knew what he wanted and even though he's rebellious at every turn, he's never truly acting for himself. He doesn't have dreams, he just wants to make others come true. The story sees him transform incredibly to the point that he's nearly unrecognizable at the end. Even with a few flaws and generic people, I enjoyed every interaction between the cast.
img300()
I'm not going to talk much about the story, as I want to avoid major spoilers, but it's a rather non-linear one. There's not an overarching goal and there's never only one enemy to fight. Instead, the story is more about the world itself and what happens when you take a look too far into it's depths. The main character lives life the way he wants, and we're just along for the ride. What this means is that you may not be the most satisfied person when you finish the series since there isn't a lot of closure. No demon king was slain, no world takeover or revolutionary uprising, the world just continues moving forward and the stories we witness are left to wither away in the dust. Nonetheless, I was on the edge of my seat as the story came to it's end and I enjoyed the way it ultimately unfolded.
img300(
Lastly, I'm going to talk about the production. The art, animation, and sound design are all stellar. Every piece of this world has an incredibly unique feel and there's something at every corner that draws you in, not to mention each character's unique designs. I thought Trigger did a great job, especially with the lighting and moods of different environments. The animation itself was great. There are a plethora of action scenes and none of them unfold like the other when it comes to camera angles and imagery. The sound design was also pretty spot on. They stick to their guns and borrow as much as they can from the game, borrowing the exact sounds and giving any one who's played the game immediate nostalgia when you hear a phone call. The guns sound meaty and every voice actor (In Japanese, I did not watch it dubbed in English) had an incredible performance, and I felt they matched with their characters very well. My only gripe was that sometimes I felt that the score being played didn't match certain scenes, although I only felt this in the beginning and not later on.
img300(v)
Overall, I think this is an anime well worth a watch, even if you haven't played the game or know anything about the franchise. You may feel bombarded by the weird lingo and technology that isn't always explained, but I still think this is a great standalone show about a character's personal struggles and how he overcomes the harsh world around him. If you're looking for something unique to watch with a boundless world that you can binge in one day, do yourself a favor and pick this up."
105334,"This Review is meant for all seasons and contains no spoilers

It's not as easy to tell a good story then you might think, a tale that will have a lasting effect on you, and you come to appreciate more over time. That's what Fruits Basket is at the most basic level for me. It's a complete reboot of the original shoujo anime. Out of nowhere, we got this new adaptation with a bit more modernized look while retaining all the charm and flavor of the old. What a surprise it brought when it blew so many's minds when it stole the heart of many as it left its imprint on the anime community by cozily resting on the top spot. I hope it stays there. I have seen my fair share of anime, and I can confidently say Fruits Basket is among the few deserving. This incident also is what led me to take the dive. At the time, I couldn't predict that Fruits Basket would end up taking its spot in my favorites. It's been so long since the last time. I am unable to even recall it. I am stubborn, as you can tell, yet something in Fruits Basket finally won me over and showed me what marvel and precious treasure anime can be.

Fruit Basket is undoubtedly the embodiment of a Shoujo, the pinnacle. It retains most of the same quirks, but at the core, it's nothing like most typical Shoujo out there. The amount of Shoujo I liked, I can easily count on one hand. It's too few. Shoujo is known for its cheapness and stalling romance subplots without real meaning or value and until the last couple of episodes/chapters. This goes for adding unnecessary drama but never really getting to the point until pigs start flying. Let me tell you now that Fruits Basket is nothing like that. One of the potentially most significant dramas plot devices was solved effortlessly in a realistic and grounded manner without being milked into oblivion. This also led to the author, Natsuki creating opportunities to mislead us again and again. Creating a most twisty turny experience since it was hard to guess how things would transpire.

Sadly, many may not connect with Fruits Basket because the first season can be a grueling experience if you are not patient and don't like SOL elements. But, long story short, Fruits Basket is a precious gem for those who don't mind stories taking a long way if there is a satisfying payoff and a meaningful and valuable message waiting on the other end, changing your perception of what you thought was innocent and pure at first. As you'd expect, SOL is Fruits Basket bread and butter, much like any other Shoujo. We start with some wholesomeness, nothing but pleasantries, and a ton of cute moments topped with charming comedy. Then slowly but surely, the story perspective gets intenser and darker as we get a hint about our characters and their burden. Otherwise, Fruits Basket begins episodic, following the same formula of introducing someone, mostly zodiac members of the Soma family. Already from the getgo, it's clear the character is cleverly designed and written with attention to detail, holding some meaning. 

The standard format starts with us being introduced to a quirky character with a heavy burden pressuring them. In the first episode, we see who they are as a person as they bounce around with our cast before concluding with an emotional episode. If you are not a fan of the episodic format, it might be a buzzkill, but I can assure you that you will be well rewarded if you are patient. One Piece taught me that. Natsuki is also pretty good at foreshadowing and leaving trails that will ultimately connect when the puzzle becomes clearer. It's incredible how well everything came full circle when we learned the secret and how it all came to be. There is no doubt in my mind that watching Fruits Basket on a second watch will give you a much more satisfying and valuable experience. It's that kind of tale. Playing the long game is usually a double-edged sword. Not many like to have to wait before seeing the story in its full glory. But Rome wasn't built in a day, same as how a great story, a really impactful one that will stay with you for a lifetime, cannot be told easily either. It's why stories of the ones that end up as dear treasures to me are those that are told over a longer period. Just like how you cannot get good at, say, soccer in one day. One can't expect to be genuinely emotional and charmed unless the author puts in the effort to make you feel that way. This is exactly why the first season works so well as the prologue to Fruits Basket.

At the forefront, we got our insanely lovable heroine Honda Tohru, who, in the most simpler terms, is like the sun, which shines her light on everyone by warming and comforting them in their time of need. But, she could also sadly be the reason most turns away from this gem. Tohru comes off as flawless in the first season, someone who cannot make mistakes, but please don't let that fool you. And if you are hesitant about the episodic formula for the first season, I am here to assure you there are more than enough things that make up for it. Among the biggest is the absolutely phenomenal cast of characters. For me, if the cast is solid, then I can still find enjoyment, but don't get me wrong. Fruits Basket has a wonderfully complex, personal, and relatable story to tell. It might not be apparent at first glance, but there's a reason why Fruits Basket is so loved. The cast is a big reason, no question asked, but the story is nothing to dismiss at all, nor is our female heroine Honda Thoru.

Tohru allows the characters to come to terms with their sad life, accept them, and nurture some confidence to keep going rather than give up. She's like a doctor giving free therapy to everyone who's down in the dumps, ready to give up everything. The characters issue tends to vary greatly. Common ones include loneliness, regret, curse, and many more. It's all sad and emotional, but it never really feels like the same thing. Tohru's overall focus in the first season is to be the bandage to the cast's darkness. We never really understood her as a person on a deeper level before much, much later. Not that I disliked her even once. She's so charming and so lovable it should be illegal. I don't usually rock with a joyous protagonist who can't do wrong and are always happy and cherry. But something about Tohru just works well despite her being clumsy and feeling so simple at first glance. Her voice alone makes me feel at peace. Honestly, it's more accurate to say she's an ideal mother, a taste of paradise. She's no doubt one of the best and most fleshed-out female protagonists out there. Plus, she's essential. Everyone needs a Honda Tohru in their life.

In any case, Fruits Basket has many life lessons to give, and you should listen up because many of them can hit close to home. The first season explores these issues and conveys to the audience how to best attend to them. Fruits Basket shows that pain is a part of who we are, we can forget it, but it will always come back to haunt us until we embrace it as a part of us and accept it happened, even if the memory is lingering over might be painful. Burying it is like removing a part of yourself, and removing a part of yourself is like denying yourself. In the simplest explanation, this is what Tohru is for the Zodiac members burdened with heavy darkness. She's the light causing it to balance out, so they won't be consumed by the negativity.

Yes, I really enjoyed how the latter half of Fruits Basket had some well-crafted backstories and character development despite the cast being relatively new to us. The author Takaya Natsuki knew what she was doing and quite well. There are only so many authors out there in this world with that talent. One that easily comes to mind is Eiichiro Oda of the immaculate and extremely massive One Piece. Both the backstory and how characters were fleshed out felt akin to Oda-sensei's touch with One Piece. Natsuki-sensei is not writing characters but real people with immediate flaws and quirky points unique to themselves, making it easier for us to grow attached. Natsuki doesn't limit herself either and keeps on pouring with the characters, yet somehow knows how to use the surroundings to flesh them out. I don't felt any character was wasted. There is a lot of things we can take from them into the real-life. This is also where the zodiac bond between the main members of the Soma family comes in. It's clear to me the zodiac bond and its curse are used as a catalyst to explore various parts of the characters and their bond with, say, parents, friends, lovers, etc.

Each of them has a reason for how the zodiac curse ties them down, acting as a mental chain, forcing them to carry a deep burden of both sadness and pain. We see this in how each of the Soma, even the most irrelevant, is haunted by a dark and sorrowful past they cannot break free from. Much like the bond between Zodiac members that ties them down. It's a constant reminder of the dark past they cannot escape no matter how much they struggle. In short, the bond is like a symbol of being stuck in the past. On another note, the side cast is reasonably well fleshed out. Tohru's wholesome friends are charming and bring so much enjoyment, benefit, and comedic relief to Fruits Basket. Yuki and Kyo are interesting as love interests and remarkable characters with tons of layers to them. I could go on a huge raving on how delightfully charming the cast is. There is nothing but praise here, as I cannot even come up with one glaring issue as to why not like them. There will always be some you prefer more over others, some you may come to hate, but more or less, by the end, you might find it surprising how many characters you like. 

In the second season of Fruits Basket, there is a big change. One thing is because Tohru Honda is more than just a pretty and innocent face that melts our heart and makes it worth living to see that smile and hear that soothing voice. Before, it was not easy to attach emotions to our lovable heroine. She seemed so perfect, but in the sequel, we see how even Tohru got flaws and how the first season even foreshadowed it through the many characters that got fleshed out. It even gives meaning to what seemed like pure gag moments. It was actually subtle clues hinting at the deeper parts about Tohru. It's impressive how well Natsuki hid it in plain sight, but it only became visible when it was time. Tohru always had something eating at her from the inside this whole time, and it's clearly connected to a bond. A major theme in Fruits Basket. I hope everyone who reads this review can learn to appreciate Tohru more if you are still wavering about her and are concerned about starting Fruits Basket because you might not like Tohru. She's not that easy. Not to mention, if you hate Tohru, you are my enemy, and I beg of you to not talk to me. In any case, it's again so nice to see how similar Natsuki is to Oda in how they don't mind playing the long game because the payoff will be all worth it.

Another thing that makes the second season stand out more is how it depicts the influence of childhood and how much it impacts the person we become when we grow up. A child is the reflection of their parents in some form or the other. They are the ones who will guide their child into a respectable or a terrible person in society. When we first come into the world, we are enamored by our parents. We depend on them, respect them, love them, and do whatever we can to receive their attention and make them love us back. For some, this might not even change once you grow up, and Fruits Basket makes that painfully clear. One of the worst kinds of hell in life can come from our parents, but that's also where we can get a taste of paradise. If your parents shower you with much love, attention and are there to guide you. Be there for you, not condemn you, but correct you if you are mistaken in an orderly and mature fashion the child can learn from, that can become a dear memory, not a nightmare that haunts them for all time. This all depends on our parents and the things we learn from them. Fruits Basket shows this exceptionally well by exploring different issues between the character's bonds.

That's to say, if the parents are terrible, they blame everything on their child by slapping them with all their stress and worries. This will affect the child's live-in society later. I would like to show an example, but I don't want to make this review a spoiler only for a potential newcomer. So let me see if I can be vague as possible. Consider your upbringing was meant to make you a perfect human. No slouching laziness allowed. All about getting those perfect grades, talk in a calculated way, no real fun to be had. Really no free will but behaving based on how society and your parents want you to. You are literally a slave to the whims of the parents. You get strict discipline, it's tough, maybe even scary, but your parents pay attention to you and clearly care about you. Even if they only do it for themselves, but will a child notice this when they are young? One day, due to unforeseen circumstances, the parents decide to abandon you once you've reached their goal, there is no explanation, but suddenly you find yourself it is suffocating to be around them. They don't even bother wishing you a good night at night anymore or ask about how school was, even welcome you home. It's like they wiped you out from their memory.

This could become a haunted memory once we grow up and influence our stands and position in society negatively. The whole personality could be significantly affected. It brings sad memories and terrible expectations. You think the world would hate you if you were yourself. Hence, you pretend to be someone else, but that's not secure for success either, so you end up just keeping yourself alone, not interacting with the other kids. Since you are afraid if you cannot be someone they like. They will end up abandoning you, pouring salty on the past injury. Fruits Basket shows this concept outstandingly well. I have seen not one or that many anime so far that has accomplished so much and meaningful in, honestly, no that many episodes and feel this realistic. When it feels like the world is out to get out, we do so many things to run away from the world instead of facing it head-on and overcoming the pain. Among others, we create a so-called ""bad guy,"" someone you don't like who you force to take on all your responsibilities so you can keep running from your own mistakes.

Maybe you seclude yourself from others, so you don't have to deal with pressure or even put on a fake mask to forget past scars. Fruit Basket shows us that people are not who they might seem at first glance. The most playful and gentle soul can be all kinds of broken on the inside, even if the exterior tells a different story. Even the harshest and vilest can be as innocent and pure as a baby but to cope with their pain. They bring pain to others to make themselves feel superior. They shame others so they can have a reminder those people are more miserable than I am. Something that lets them forget their own pain. Fruits Baskets shows us all too well how greedy, whimsical and imperfect we are as a lifeform, but that's exactly what makes us human in the first place. Let's say you are free from a destructive bond. You conquered your fears. You've grown up, gained experience, and matured. At that time, even the biggest bully, once you are younger and unaware, can seem like a joke, not even a bit threatening. Whether those bullies are the parents who use you to take their responsibility or even someone who controls your life with you having no say in the matter.

Wait a minute, what's all this philosophical talk you've been raving on and on for a decade. So I thought Fruits Basket was a romance? Is it not? It's far more than that. It has romance, and the way its executed is unique and honestly so charming. There is no unnecessary drama, every step has a purpose, and there is an actual main couple. We understand why it had to be them and not someone else. So if you are worried about the kiss not being shown or on some lewd handholding, put your worries to rest. We see the couple kiss, and we see it in its full glory without interruptions or cockblocking. That beautiful moment is not taken away from us as we stare into the sunset. So get that out of there. We don't do that here. Fruits Basket goes a step above and shows handholding. I know quite lewd, and it doesn't even bother to censor it, so you have nothing to worry about. Moreover, the main couple is not the only romance story arc here. There are several, and by the end, I didn't even realize it, but it's crazy how many couples we got on our hands. Above all, it makes sense. There is a reason for x and why to be together. They may heal each other scars and comfort each other, be relatable in some fashion, maybe even total opposites, and the list goes on. But In the end, they all complimented each other and were meant to be together.

On another note, Fruits Basket is so pleasant to the eye. It is back up by a solid and mostly consistent production value. It was vibrant and popping with the life and energy emanating from the good old days from the early 20s0s. Even the background is so unbelievably stunning. It does a firm job of capturing the emotions and setting the mood. I can see the comedy may be feeling off in what should be serious moments, but this was more prominent in the first season and is not a big issue in the sequels. The comedy is perfectly encapsulated through the visuals and art, and voice acting. Seriously, it's on another level. Never have I heard so much emotion in a single line or reaction. It's so amazing how passionate the voice acting crew is about their characters. They literally become them. It was immaculate. Whether it be Tohru's angelic and soothing voice, Kyo's rash and explosiveness, Yuki's cool and calm collectedness, Shigure's mature playfulness, Hatori's mature and chillness. Or say, Hanajima's sarcastic and absolutely satisfying voice complemented with Arisa's upbeat energy. I loved it all. I could write a book about how incredible the voice acting alone was. But hopefully, I got my feelings across. Then there is the absolutely breathtaking soundtrack, yet another huge blessing to my ears. Enhancing the emotions when it's playing.

Above all, there are only top-notch tier OP and ED that more or less do a solid job of capturing the various essence of Fruits Basket. I would like to talk a bit more in-depth into them because it's genuinely a marvel. The first opening alone gives you a sense of nostalgia. I have not seen Fruits Basket before now and still felt the same. It's like a gentle hand reaching out to embrace you. A quality ballade that's telling you to welcome back to Fruits Basket. I won't go through them all, but each opening and ending makes me feel something different. Another case is the third opening which captures Fruits Basket so incredibly well with its upbeatness and cheery vibes, making you automatically bop your head to its catchiness. In any case, each opening is really unique in what it symbolizes, how it sounds like. No, I don't dislike any of them, but I prefer more than others as expected. Overall, however, there is nothing but quality here. As for the ED, they are all so soothing, healing to the soul, peaceful and chill and are especially nice to have once you get to the more dramatic and intense parts of Fruits Basket. 

One thing I want to note is if you don't like Shoujo, please don't fret about trying out Fruits Basket. It might honestly surprise you with its rather complex narrative that's both philosophical and grounded in reality, a phenomenal cast, a fantastic soundtrack, impeccable voice acting, and a really consistent production value. To summarize, Fruits Basket is about how one person not conveying their thoughts and emotion the right can influence so much—either positively or negatively and is the cornerstone for what becomes of the person. It influences who you are, who you become, even what you become in both body and soul. It's crazy how many things went wrong due to the wrong interpretation of others' intentions, feelings, emotions, wishes, actions, words, and behavior. But the way it was laid out was beautiful beyond words because it called connected back to the starting point, which made all these things happen in the first place. This was the cast's own bond, their relationship with their close ones, family, friends, or lovers alike. It's linked to a bond that's either strong as steel and unbreakable. Suffocating and dreadful like a poison that slowly kills you from the inside. Terrifying and painful like a nightmare you want to get away from and forget at all cost. All these were the catalyst that nurtures the absurdly many painful and sad scenarios our cast found themselves in, and it's one of the core essences that makes up Fruits Basket. I am not ready to say goodbye, but as we well know, nothing lasts forever, and all good things must come to an end."
133965,"woww, this anime is bad. this show has like one joke, and that joke just doesn't land. the show pretty much sticks to trying to be comedy the whole time, which means there's almost nothing left over when the comedy is bad. almost every character is or ends up being a gag character, such that they feel vacuous when looked at beyond their awful joke. what could otherwise be a very average or somewhat below average show is then dragged further down by incessant yelling and poor visual gags, that transform the show into an unpleasant experience. there are almost no positive points to this show, and almost every aspect of this show has been done better by other shows. i feel that this adaptation is fundamentally flawed, and, while it is very likely to get additional seasons that i will watch anyway, i don't know if it is salvageable. i can see where the source manga could alleviate some of the problems i have with it, but as an anime with this direction, i think this show is always going to fall flat.

without comparing it to other shows, it falls flat, but in comparison to similar, and better, shows, it really fails to impress. even the fundamental aspect of a mute main character has been done better. what should be washed away and forgotten along with countless other seasonal anime has somehow taken a foothold among viewers, and apparently not for the sake of it being good. i can only imagine that it's some sort of cope by manga viewers. 

terrible comedy, bland and forgettable romance, annoying cast, a clownish take on anxiety. it's like the show doesn't even try. so much of the writing feels half-assed, you could probably ai-generate these episodes. visually, the show is average at best, and the opening is probably the best part about the show, but it's not like visuals could prop this thing up. the only thing stopping me from dropping my score any further is that, while terrible, the show, at least, isn't offensive to view. if the show toned itself down, maybe took a break from just being so loud, it could be at least a little pleasant to watch, or maybe as background noise, but instead it's all just loud as a humor mechanism, and loud as funny isn't funny. shows can be loud and funny, but when they manage it, the mechanism that makes the show funny is the actual content and good writing, not the inherent fact that it is a loud noise or someone shouting.

at least najimi is a good character, tadano feels like a google search of ""generic romcom protagonist"", and is extremely under-defined as such. komi has two character traits, exactly enough for a side character, not a main.

hopefully season two can redeem this, feel free to send me a comment if i'm wrong

cope and seethe, komi fans"
114535,"I think that I speak for a lot of people when I say that the day that the first episode of To Your Eternity released, the emotions that it managed to draw out in most of us was very unexpected. In the realm of repetitive seasonals that show the sheer uncreativity of the anime industry on full display, To Your Eternity managed to stand out from the rest by telling a very resonant story in just the span of 25 minutes. It is an extremely rare sight to see something with such a limited timespan make a sizable portion of its viewerbase break down into tears. The only other episode off the top of my head that I can think of that I can compare it to is Violet Evergarden Episode 10. Out of nearly any anime that I have seen, To Your Eternity was one that easily made one of the best first impressions. It is very easy to see why it gained so much attention by just the first episode. However since then, To Your Eternity hasn’t really captured the same amount of attention as it did in its premiere. It isn’t like it was no longer popular after the first episode, but it never managed to spark the same type of emotionally driven passion in the anime community as it originally had. To Your Eternity after its first episode never really captures the remarkable impression that it originally left. There are still moments of the series that capture the quality of that first episode, however those moments of brilliance stand alongside ones of pure mediocrity and ones that are completely baffling. To Your Eternity is inconsistent to an astronomical extent, and it is honestly a remarkable feat that it even manages to encompass so many different realms of quality.

img()

The first episode is definitely a smart way to start the series. It isn’t exactly dishonest about what the strengths of the series are, but it manages to frame itself in such a way that it makes its biggest weaknesses basically invisible. The first episode manages to be so strong, because the biggest strength of the series is its ability to create extremely sympathetic characters. It is a strength that the creator of To Your Eternity, Yoshitoki Ooima, has demonstrated fully well in her most prolific work, A Silent Voice. Ooima’s character writing makes the protagonists of her stories feel extremely likable and relatable to the audience in their introductions, which she eventually uses to create extremely heart wrenching emotional payoffs. The first episode of To Your Eternity is possibly the most distilled version of her version of a character arc, since it manages to fit in the initial characterization for the unnamed boy and the final emotional payoff in a singular episode without feeling at all rushed. With how tight the first episode’s narrative is, it sets high expectations. Maybe even a bit too high. 

Now, when I say this, I am not saying that the arcs that succeed the first episode don’t have good character arcs in them. As a matter of fact, I’d say that the arc that comes after the first episode, the March Arc, has just as meaningful of a story as the one told in the first episode. The thing that drags the arcs down compared to the first episode is that every single story arc (which includes the first episode) has about the same amount of material that they want to say. Despite this, each arc gets progressively longer as the series progresses. This means that the watertight narrative that helped the first episode thrive gets generally lost as the series goes on. At the end of the day, To Your Eternity tells simplistic stories with simplistic characters, which is fine, but the length of each arc fails to compliment this. It isn’t really helped that each story arc typically only really contains one character arc in it along with the greater arc of Fushi, compared to the multiple arcs contained in a story like A Silent Voice. The series increasingly has to stretch itself more and more thinly as it progresses, eventually making each arc feel more sluggish, eventually culminating in the absolutely godawful pacing of the Jananda Island Arc. While the increasingly sluggish pacing of the story arcs isn’t inherently the most awful thing at first, the ways that the series tries to relieve that pacing with padding spawns a whole new cavalcade of problems that way down that later parts of the series even further down into mediocrity.

img()

As I said before, the March Arc’s story is one that is just as strong as the one told in the first episode. Compared to the first episode, it is only weighed down by the lack of multiple character arcs being told and the slower pacing. However, the arc is brief enough for it not to really be a problem in the grand scheme of things. It is the Gugu Arc where these problems start to really become noticeable. While Gugu’s story on paper should be a grand slam, it is also when the problems of the length of the arcs starts to work massively against the series. Out of all of the arcs, the Gugu arc definitely shines the most in the initial characterization phase of developing itself. Gugu is a very well developed character in the time that he has, and that is thanks to great dialogue scenes that flesh out his relations with the world around him. However, the emotional payoff ends up getting botched due to previously built up problems over the course of the arc and the fact that it felt more coincidence driven than emotionally driven. The series kept stopping itself with speed bumps of varying degrees that make the arc feel more dragged out than it really has to, this arc introduces a physical manifestation of the problems that this series has, the Nokkers. In a story that should be driven by its characters, the Nokkers being a literal emotionless husk used as a plot device to either add a fight that just pads for time or as a way to cheaply progress the plot completely spits in the face of ethos of the character driven story that the first episode built the series on. However, the Gugu arc only really provides a small glimpse into what the seeds of To Your Eternity’s problems would truly grow into compared to how much it affected the Jananda Island Arc.

The Jananda Island Arc is an anomaly compared to the rest of the show it is attached to. The arc’s very existence confuses me in a series like this. By the Gugu Arc, I would assume that the strengths of the series have already been very well established. It should’ve been well established even way before To Your Eternity even started to serialize based on what A Silent Voice accomplished. However, the Jananda Island Arc is at a lot of times the antithesis to what makes Ooima’s writing work so well. The main cast of the arc is expanded to the point that none of the people that we are supposed to care about in the arc get enough time to get fleshed out so that we care about them. It feels like, for the most part, the main characters of the Jananda Island Arc aren’t as complex as any other main character of other arcs. This leads the emotional payoff to completely fall flat, since I really don’t care about what are effectively cardboard cutouts with notes written on them that could potentially be seen as character traits. The only mild exception to this is Tonari, who out of any non-Fushi character gets the most development, however she can’t get a proper emotional resolution due to being drowned out by all the white noise masquerading as actual substance. Hayase is brought back from the March Arc, but instead of her just representing an oppressive system that is difficult to escape from, she is turned into one of the most baffling one-dimensional villains that I have ever seen. There are honestly so many problems with the Jananda Island Arc, that naming all of them would make the review so long that it would seem like I was rambling. For all the small and big problems with the arc, the one throughline for all of the problems is that there is an absolutely callice disregard for how to actually develop characters satisfyingly and for what the strengths of the series actually are. What truly puzzles me about this arc in particular is that I can’t think of a reasonable reason as to why the series would end up with such a stand out section of it. It isn’t like this series needs to experiment to succeed since the general formula it set up for itself was so versatile. I really don’t know how the series that produced the absolute slog of these 7 episodes also made the incredible beginning of it.

To Your Eternity holds a weird place for me. On the one hand, I didn’t enjoy it for most of the episodes, because in terms of episode count, the bad parts of the Gugu Arc and the Jananda Island Arc do outnumber most of the good stuff in this series. However, it isn’t like other series where the bad parts ruin what the good parts build up because of the semi-segmented nature of each story arc. While the first episode, the March arc, and the good parts of the Gugu Arc take up less than the episodes that I consider to be bad, I honestly got way too much out of those episodes to say that the bad parts outweigh those episodes in the end. I can’t definitively say if I enjoyed To Your Eternity on the whole or not. It isn’t like it is perfectly mediocre, its quality varies massively, and that is really something that can’t be fully encompassed with just a simple score. To Your Eternity occupies many places along a spectrum of quality simultaneously. It both makes fantastic and boring characters. It can both make anybody cry and people completely emotionless. It can both be perfectly paced and be as slow as a snail. Maybe I have a bit too much hope for what comes after this considering the general quality trendline of this series being downwards. However, I do find it easier for something like this to take a fresh start, since new characters for Fushi to interact with are introduced every arc. I wouldn’t say that the future of this series is bright, but just that I am hopeful for what is to come. But with what we have, To Your Eternity remains to be an absurd combination of different features, managing to be one both one of the best anime of the year and one of the worst as well.

116006,"If I were to attempt to encapsulate the idea of GoHS within few words, as the brevity the digital age would have you require, I'd simply say: Battle Shounen on steroids. The more I ruminate on it, the more comfortable I feel at the phraseology of my likening. For indeed, the show exhibits nothing but a gross accentuation of the attributes idiosyncratic to the genre, while consistently outright ignoring the literary conventions for forming and maintaining an engaging narrative, much to the dismay of everyone who has the ridiculously unreasonable bar of expecting more in a story than mere mindless clash of swords/fists. The rule of cool permeates the very fabric of this adaptation; it is comparable to allocating one's skill points solely to one attribute. What should be a mere experience enhancer is mistaken for the main dish and is thence expected for one to stomach a plate filled with naught but condiments and spices. Needless to say it doesn't make for a particularly hearty (nor tasty for that matter) meal. Vague conceptions and aphorisms aside, I shall get on with the meat of the discussion.

As far as any work that features action compounding with fantastical elements go, what is paramount above all else is establishing what exactly those elements ARE, how it ties into the world and its mechanics, as well as the capabilities of the characters relevant to the story. And GoH has NOTHING, and by that I mean not even a SEMBLANCE of this very rudimentary understanding of how stories work in its arsenal. Gigantic swords are conjured from the sky, otherworldly creatures resembling Stands are summoned, anything ranging from elemental magic, cathode ray guns, regeneration, and even teleporting whole cities goes in this story with no apparent explanation to what even is the source of this arbitrary and inconsistent litany of distinct skillsets. Eventually, in episode 7, they chalk all of it up to a mystical power that transcends human knowledge borrowed from the Gods. This helps absolutely nothing; it's still impossible to gauge what our heroes/heroine are capable of, thereby obscuring the level of danger they face at any particular time. It's unimmersive as it is anticlimactic, why should you care about a battle that you cannot make anything out of? Anyone can survive anything, some random god can decide on a whim to bestow you powers. It successfully kills off any excitement one can have over analysing how the tides of battle can potentially change in either combatant's favour. Shows that aren't too keen on building the combat system from scratch tend to instead use internal monologues to give us a sense of the state of battle. This, while not being nearly as satisfying as deducing so yourself by extrapolating from visual cues, works absolutely fine. Too bad they decided not to do that either. As audience, you're but a detached onlooker, witnessing an alien occurrence play out, furrowing your eyebrows at the inexplicability of it all.

The cast is a reskin of the stock characters you've seen a couple hundred times by now. You got the hot-headed and bubbly mc who just loves fighting for the sake of fighting, the stoic and taciturn kick-ass going at great lengths for the people he values, and lastly the uptight and more ordinary tritagonist who mostly assumes the role of the Straight Man in the comical scenes that ensue. On the supporting cast too, the trends naturally follow, but with the added handicap of not being explored at all, unlike the mc's, whose motivations we at least were allowed some minimal disclosure of. There's the enigmatic rich businessman whom we have as much insight on in the end of episode 13 as we do in the beginning of episode 1, some deranged cult leader who just wants to see the world burn, an antagonist who wants to crush people and have as much power as possible because... uhh, you know what forget it, they're stock characters, perhaps better suited for theatre. Though it should be mentioned, my remarks here oughtn't be construed as claiming a uniquely realized cast is a prerequisite for a successful anime, that is not necessarily the case. If the narrative is gripping by itself, inoffensive and simplistic surrogates may very well suffice. But when it's already nothing to be proud of on those respects, this could only be seen as an aggravating factor in inducing head scratches.

There are two subplots seemingly interconnected with the motivations behind the tournament and the fate of the heroes of our story, but it is too unbaked to the point where even addressing it feels like giving it more than its due. ""There is a cult-like organization discontent with the usage of charyeok?"" Okay... ""Mori's grandpa is constantly moving because baddies want him, also he has something to do with NK?"" Sure... ""Park Meijin and the commissioners have a plan involving the GoH to awaken the key?"" What it is, what it is for, how GoH helps it manifest, why everyone and their mother is vying for it, these are all great questions; but well, how about more flashy animation instead? It's all a bunch of vagueries in an attempt to hold in place a series of action sequences, they could be more accurately described as passing remarks than plot points, given that they're mentioned once and never elaborated on again until they're literally at your doorstep. In the unlikely instance where you do get some expository direction, it'll be by means of brief info dumps that are unrelated to the scene in question. I legitimately had to look up the episode synopses in order to remind myself of these plot elements, not because the storytelling is too dense to take in, to the contrary, because there is so little info to go on when interpreting what the hell just transpired that it isn't a feasible nor a worthwhile endeavour.

In short, this is a well-animated fighting compilation that would work perfectly fine as a long-winded trailer for a fighting game. As a full-fledged narrative building up on itself it is an absolute joke.

108511,"It’s hard not to feel at least somewhat conflicted with this first part of the Slime’s 2nd season. Part of it comes down to how inconsistent and middling the show is, but there’s another reason for this. That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is a series built around its novelty value.

The gimmick of a slime building and ruling a nation from scratch was a refreshing one, as it allowed for straight-forward fun and more vibrant animation than what one would expect from most isekai. Of course, when the charm of its premise wore off, the latter half of the first season petered out with less interesting arcs. However, the presentation still had some fun tricks up its sleeve to keep the experience less dry than some of its contemporaries.

With Slime 2, there’s novelty in watching a seemingly benevolent leader witness everything crumbling down before he administers karmic, cataclysmic retribution. Despite the show’s reputation as a charming, vibrant isekai that’s more palatable than most of its brethren, it’s never been a stranger to darker storylines and plot points. Rimuru himself was never averse to combatting enemy armies in order to protect his kingdom and forcefully expand relations. It’s just that this time, things are personal and as such, this first cour is the story of how Rimuru becomes a triumphant and mildly tragic war criminal who has to rethink his approach to inter-kingdom relations. It makes for a fun experience on the surface once those moments hit, but that’s more so because RImuru and the show extent actually have the balls to get this bloodthirsty, rather than due to good writing.

In spite of the main gimmick being warped into something far darker and more dramatic than usual, the show never quite lives up to the heights of S1’s first arc. Where that arc was well-paced and laid down its more dramatic moments with tact and not a lot of redundant exposition, Slime 2 does the opposite. This is most apparent with Youm’s subplot with newcomer Myulan, as she constantly monologues about how in spite of denying her own feelings for him, Youm is such a fool for trusting and loving her considering she’s being sent by Clayman to assist in Tempest’s destruction. The entire middle portion, once the show transitions into its big arc, is a slog where the fights become more about the inner monologues and explaining each other’s powers and positions than the actual fights, which aren’t that well-animated outside of a few solid cuts, anyway. The pacing also feels really weird, as in we get moments like the aforementioned that linger on extraneous nonsense or how episode 9’s conversations and pity party could have been truncated if not for how it inserts a recap at the very start with S1 footage. At the same time, some scenes don’t get enough time to breathe in the middle episodes, like with Youm’s romantic subplot developing way too fast.

Perhaps the most distasteful moments in the mid-section involve the otherworlders, a pair of humans from our world who act as repulsive brats that try to purposefully and falsely accuse some of the Tempest goblins of sexual harassment in the case of Kiara, and comment on how they want to makie Shion and Shuna into his sex slaves in the case of Shougo. Disregarding how the latter feels even more discomforting given the existence of a certain Healer show this season, this is just a really gaudy attempt at getting us to further hate characters the show already convinced us were pieces of shit. Clayman, the main antagonist of both cours of S2, has far more restraint with how he’s presented, allowing him to maintain a level of presence and villainy without the show having to go overboard on him being a manipulative scumbag. Even the king of Farmus, the antagonistic force of this cour, doesn’t feel this gratuitous, considering how the otherworlders reek of more rancid LN titles like Akashic Records. It’s fun watching them get their comeuppance thanks to the final ⅓ of this cour having some solid cuts as the baddies get squashed. However, it’s not the easiest to get invested in.

Part of the problem is also the show’s cast. Slime has never had a particularly memorable cast, as most were just Rimuru’s lackeys with a few personality differences that get exploited for some decent gags and explosive moments. However, they certainly don’t get a chance to be more interesting this season. Even in the set-up phase of the first 4 episodes, we still have particularly embarrassing moments like Shion wailing cuz Rimuru wouldn’t take her with him. A lot of this was easier to deal with in the less dramatic arcs of S1, but since this season becomes more focused on serious storytelling, it’s hard not to feel at least a little empty when the show doesn’t tighten up its characterization or even feel particularly brutal when shit hits the fan.

Rimuru himself has some cool shots to express his sorrow and silent wrath in the final few episodes, and those imposing moments land quite nicely. However, the novelty of his charm has worn off now and he’s kind of a boring protagonist without too much to make him particularly compelling or memorable when the show switches from cutesy hijinks to serious warfare. The finale does bring back the charm of him being very reactive and willing to use his previous world’s knowledge in quirky ways like with the naming of Diablo. However, moments like this and him being a bitter, sore loser in ep 6 are a bit too rare.

When he crosses that line to get revenge on Farmus by mowing down hoards of soldiers that weren’t even part of the initial invasion that burnt his kingdom, even though there are more benevolent reasons attached to this, it’s not as easy to get on-board with as the show wants it to be. In fact, no one objects to or feels reservations about this, not even Youm, who hails from Farmus. Actually exploring the morally gray nature of his actions this season considering he’s forced to rethink his stance on humans, would go a long way to add weight, drama, and humanity to this conflict. However, tension is only allowed in the shortest of bursts, and it favors an explosive ass kicking gauntlet with a tinge of vague tragedy, as opposed to doing anything that would prevent it from both having its cake and eating it too. The least it could do is be more ruthless in some of the violence on display in the final few episodes, but alas, that’s not the case. Slime 2 is a bit too toothless for what it shows outside of some cool finishers.

The presentation in S2 is passable on its own merits, but pales in comparison to the vibrance of S1, even if both entries are rather inconsistent in terms of artwork and sometimes animation quality. While there are some sick moments like Hakuro’s final move against Kyouka or the explosive final move Hinata lands on Rimuru before the latter escapes, there are also several jank moments throughout even the better episodes. Atsushi Nakayama went from assistant director of S1 to the primary director here, and the vibrant animation and fun, playful multimedia menu explanations for Rimuru’s powers have decreased. Both that and Rimuru’s playful visual interactions with “the great sage” are dramatically doned down outside of the finale and maybe one other moment this season. Additionally, some of the fights this season, particularly in the middle, look downright terrible compared to most of S1. Moreover, there is a surprising amount of lackluster CGI, particularly for the invading army of Farmus. There’s also just generally less visual flair here, which is best evidenced in the character of Diablo. In S1 ep 24 and the OVA episodes, his introductions had a sinister, grand presentation with some of the most striking visuals in each of these entries. He commanded a serious, sinister presence, even when the visuals of S1 sometimes failed to match that in his big fight scene. His summon in S2 had some shades on that, but he feels far more subdued compared to before since the visuals barely capture how imposing he is. There are some fun moments with how flamboyant and eccentric he can be, but the point still stands.

Even the audiovisuals of S2 are at least a little weaker, but that’s mainly thanks to “Storyteller” being one of the weaker TRUE anisongs, and “STORYSEEKER” from STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION being a far cry from S1’s EDs. It’s a shame that neither Azusa Tadokoro nor Takuma Terushima had songs this season, but eh, maybe in the next cour we’ll get something from them. The actual OST done by Elements Garden is still fine, with some suitably somber or epic-sounding tracks that feel more notable in the last 5 episodes. The series doesn’t even reuse as many tracks from S1 as expected, which is nice, and the sound effects are as crunchy and bass-boosted as ever.

To move onto another positive note of Slime 2, the first 3 episodes do still retain the magic of S1’s early episodes, barring the aforementioned scene of Shion crying. Revisiting the Drawf kingdom and the Elf tavern was pretty entertaining. Jokes such as dwarf king Dwargo lecturing Rimuru for his apparently weak speech towards the former’s kingdom, and having that echo in the back of Rimuru’s mind when his apology towards Shion and Shuna for sneaking out with the boys to the Elf tavern result in him eating Shion’s food for a weak are pretty fun. Watching Rimuru navigate politics with the Eurazania kingdom with liquor and some 1 v 1 battles with Shion and Youm against some of Eurazania’s best was cool. There are other fun gags and moments here, and even a few glorious bits later on like with what Rimuru decides to do with Youm, Myulan, and other newcomer Grucius in episode 8. However, the show can’t exactly go back to all of this without cheapening some of the drama presented here, even if the end game of the season inherently does that to some extent despite how brutal a lot of moments in the penultimate episode were. Well, the show does go back, and that’s part of why the show being somewhat toothless and completely unnuanced in the handling of its more serious and grim moments stings so much.

This is actually where the structure of the series comes in. On some level, this is the fault of the original material, but it’s taken to a whole new level with this adaptation. With S1, the creative team and producers had a hard time settling on how long they wanted the adaptation to be, which led to a very jittery 2nd half that had to skip the first half of arc 4 just so it could get to the part with the kids to end the season on something resembling a climax. This left the Eurazania and Farmus set-up for this season. Given that S1 ended right before the arc everyone had been waiting for, a lot of people were frustrated when S2 had to come back to what was left behind just to provide context for what the rest of the season was poised to adapt.

A problem that was averted by the finale was the seeming lack of presence Millim had this time around. In episode 8, Eren details a fairy tale to Rimuru after explaining the truth about her and the party she traveled with back in the first arc. This fairy tale meant to give Rimuru some hope, just so happened to be Millim’s tragic backstory presented in a form reminiscent of a hybrid of motion comics and stained-glass windows, and adds a lot to the show’s worldbuilding. In spite of what the entire scene means for the narrative, it was one of the best moments in the show for the sheer level of context it provides that add to some of the more likable side characters (who kinda just show up here) and to elements that could be exploited in the future. Up until this point, Millim herself only appeared once this season...in a 2 second scene with no dialogue because the anime wanted to show that Clayman is sending her to wage war on Eurazania that way Rimuru has his hands full with two war conflicts to resolve. However, the finale brought her back to fight Eurazania’s lord, Carrion, in a big way with one of the coolest battles in the series. Her finisher was particularly glorious to witness, more than rectifying what was initially a strange issue with this cour that could have been indicative of the structuring of the adaptation.

The finale itself is probably the best episode of the season, with how it sets up the future conflict in an exciting fashion while showcasing some of the vibrance and charm the series strove to have with RImuru’s and Benimaru’s “password” fiasco as well as the last two scenes of the show. In spite of the myriad of issues the arc itself had, it at least ended on a high note.

The 2nd Season of That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is a rather conflicting experience. Before and at the end of the big arc the season adapts, there’s still some of that charm that made early S1 so refreshing. However, the arc itself, and even some of the build-up to it, are rather laborious at times and laden with obnoxious issues reminiscent of the worst LN anime. It’s not even as boring as some of latter-day S1, let alone as unenjoyable as the frustrations mentioned above could make it seem. There’s still some enjoyment to be had with Slime 2, just like before. While S1 definitely petered out after a while, it was perhaps the most charming isekai anime out there prior to Bookworm. However, now we have better options, and the show really does begin to stumble under the weight of a more serious direction and the structuring problems it dealt with as an adaptation since S1. There is some mild satisfaction and surprise in watching a show like this get as dark as it does by the end, but it doesn’t entirely stick thanks to certain plot points, the suboptimal writing of the show’s villains and drama, and how the show never goes hard on its morally gray ideas and sheer brutality.

There are several hilarious moments, especially early on, and some of the fights are relatively entertaining. Unfortunately, the show’s foundation really needed to be better if it wanted to execute a more expansive and dramatic arc with the finesse it once had in simpler times. Slime 2 part 1 isn’t a complete waste, but it’s about on par with S1’s weaker arcs and it doesn’t even look as good as before. There are several fun and amusing moments, but once the straightforward fun and novelty wear off and it’s time to be more critical, it’s hard not to acknowledge that we’re left with a bit of a mess. Hopefully the second cour picks up and the Shizue arc can finally have some real competition for ""the best arc of Slime""."
103572,"“A dream of the unbelievable day that brought us together.” Uesugi Futaro to his bride.
(This review will contain spoilers for episode 1 and 2.)

Harem anime. Oftentimes, they’ll have female leads with a great personality, unlike the incel protagonist who has barely any redeemable qualities with the “character trait” of accidentally groping women. Yet, just after one line and action from our boring incel protagonist, all the girls fall for him. It’s rare to find a good harem with a great protagonist, and it’s difficult to find one you can moderately enjoy. They lack foundation with the main character and simply have them be a tool to move the story, and nothing more. However, Quintessential Quintuplets is both a good show with a great protagonist who grows. 

Written by Negi Haruba and adapted into an anime on January 11th, 2019 by Tezuka Productions, who worked alongside Mappa on Dororo, Quintessential Quintuplets follows a genius, poor, focused, and to himself student known as Futaro Uesugi. He’s hired as a private tutor and he finds out that he’s a tutor to five girls, the Nakano’s, his classmates. Despite the girls desperately needing better grades, none of them want Futaro as a tutor. And so, Futaro has to gain the trust of each girl and show them that he’s not just some guy with perfect grades. 

img()

At first glance, the art and animation of the show is..fine, following the generic style of other harems, but there are times during important scenes where the art is absolutely stunning. 
img()

Obviously though, this isn’t the meat of the review, and I’ll be moving onto the best part of the show, the characters. 

The characters are rich with personality and never overreact to everything, including our protagonist, Futaro Uesugi, but I’ll get to him at the end of this, because it's time to talk about:
The waifus.
Itsuki is the first girl we meet and is a respectful hard worker. Although she doesn’t want Futaro to be her and the other girl’s tutor, she understands Futaro’s family situation and allows him to come over.


Ichika acts like the eldest sibling of the girls and doesn’t really mind Futaro being around, but still doesn’t want to study, having her own girls to work towards while also smiling to keep her sisters happy.
img()

Miku is the best girl of the five and for good reason. She’s to herself and has little to no confidence, not wanting to talk to her sister’s about her interests. Despite this, she’s pure-hearted and will stand up when other people are in the wrong.
img()

Nino is the least developed out of five, which doesn’t really make her a bad character. She’s the most hostile to our main lead and has tsundere traits, while not being one entirely. She acts like the mother of the girls and clearly states her mind and isn’t afraid to do dangerous things as long as she gets her way, even if that does mean drugging a cookie to make Futaro pass out.
img()

Yotsuba is the most energetic of the 5, with the result of being blind to current situations. She’s great at anything physical, but mentally isn’t the best, getting the lowest score of the first exam out of the five girls. Nonetheless, she supports what Futaro does and is the most friendly with him.

At a first glance if I told you only the things above, you would think that this show is just another bland harem, but, Futaro Uesugi proves otherwise.
Sure, he’s a studyholic, but he learns to understand why the girls do certains things, act a certain way, and uses what he learnt in order to help him. This provides insight and interesting conversations with him and the girls. He makes mistakes with the girls sometimes, yet he learns why the mistake happened and what he can do to fix them.
There’s a scene in the second episode where he’s talking to Miku about the other girls, and Miku states that sure, she might’ve gotten the highest score of the 5, but each sister is still different from each other with their own skills. Futaro says that just because one sister can do something, doesn’t mean the other can’t. He shows Miku the last exam result, and she realises that none of them got the same answers right. They’re all different, but they can still achieve the same thing because of that. Without Futaro, this show would simply be another generic harem.


The opening for the show, Gotoubun no Kimochi (Quintuplet’s Feelings) is sung by the five girls. There’s no outstanding visuals or anything in it, but it showcases important events in the show and how the girls view Futaro.
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKIT6Glw7c)
The ED, Sign, sung by Aya Uchida, showcases the girls in wedding outfits for Futaro’s wedding. 
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32J9wkieEE)
The OST has a unique, gentle, and calming feeling which makes certain moments in the show stronger.


Seeing Futaro’s interactions with the girls, with the world, with everything around him is without a doubt the strongest part of the show. What does love really mean? What type of person do you want to be for others to look up to? How do you be honest with your feelings? Although the art and animation might not be the most jaw dropping experience, if you have time for 12 episodes and are looking for a wholesome harem with a great main character, this is it.

101165,"To preface this review, I must say that Goblin Slayer is my favorite anime to come out this year (even if i didn't watch many this year). The way that this anime doesn't feel like a regular fantasy world anime but a tabletop RPG, in which the players roleplay as the characters included in the cast makes this an enjoyable ride. The way this anime works is not a focus on plot (no story to speak of, actually) or the characters individual growth, but instead, the characters growing closer together as friends in an adventuring party through the many adventures that they will go through (all of them including goblins, of course). There are some spoilers throughout the review but nothing major.

Story: 5/10 

I must admit to being generous with this score because the story and plot are clearly not the main focus here. In fact, they are practically non-existent. The adventures that the cast goes through are very random, and pretty much is just ""oh here's a quest, it involves goblins lets go"". The quests themselves don't have a story to them, with one exception which is the Sword Maiden's, but even that is scratching the surface of a story. Mentioning the Sword Maiden's quest, I feel there was a huge missed opportunity with the mirror and the goblin world on the other side. They could have used that for a setup to a future arc in which they raid the goblin place in the mirror, but instead, the mirror was just buried under a layer of concrete, probably never to be touched again.  
Also, for side story/not involved very much with the main cast, is the Hero and the Demon Lord. The Hero is almost considered to be the protagonist of the Goblin Slayer world, and is only briefly mentioned by the main cast and only seen defeating one of the servants of the Demon Lord on screen. The Hero's adventures are what would be considered the main plot of an RPG, with the final boss villain being the Demon Lord. The Hero’s party not appearing very much on screen or being involved at all with the Goblin Slayer party, further emphasizing the point that the cast is not the main focus of the world and rather just a group of adventurers doing quests. This also serves to show that the show tries as hard to deviate from its genre of adventure fantasy, which usually involves the main cast being the Hero vs the Demon Lord (The names are also very telling here). 

Characters: 9/10 

Ladies and gentlemen, the main focus of the show. Now I'm not going to say that the characters are “deep” and “have emotional troubles stemming from their dark past” because that’s just not true (except for Goblin Slayer). In fact, the characters are very much what you would see in a fantasy world setting, but that's where it most shines. The callbacks to regular tabletop RPGs are extremely apparent here, where the main cast consists of a High Elf Ranger, a Mage Dwarf, a ""Summoner"" Lizardman, a Cleric Priestess, and of course Goblin Slayer, not pertaining to a certain class but a high affinity for anything that kills goblins. You might have noticed that I didn’t mention their names and that’s because they don’t actually have names. They are mentioned by the other characters and each other by nicknames and their races, and of course Goblin Slayer as Goblin Slayer. It definitely paints the image of newbie players who have made their generic characters and are new to tabletop RPGs, not getting into the roleplay enough to have a decent backstory or names for their characters. And even the initial awkwardness for being strangers to the other players is present in the beginning, but that’s one of its biggest strengths and why I like this show so much. As they get to know each other through their quests, the initial awkwardness fades, making it clear that as the players got to know each other better the characters also got closer together as a party.

Goblin Slayer himself needs his own paragraph. For being a sort of main character (debatable, the priestess could also be), he is probably the best to be put in the limelight, because he is essentially the veteran player’s character. Fully equipped with a designated role designed for gathering the most experience the fastest way possible (further emphasized by how he counts the goblins as he kills them, and his silver rank despite only killing goblins), a backstory that itself has other “minor” characters and depth, and an actual name. Goblin Slayer by himself is incredibly boring as a character BUT that is only in his introduction. After Goblin Slayer joins the party and the priestess, it becomes obvious that the player is starting to enjoy not only playing the game but playing the game with friends by his side. And this obviously reflects on Goblin Slayer towards the party that we see in the show, where Goblin Slayer is opening up more to his fellow adventurers. 

Visual and Sound Design: 7/10 

The visuals in this anime are very much grotesque. The goblin’s facial design is a prime example, and very much fitting into the tone of the anime. A LOT of blood is present when damage is done, so you’ve been warned. The character designs are very obviously trying to go for what I previously mentioned in the character section. Goblin Slayer and the Sword Maiden having unique character designs affirms the point that Goblin Slayer (and the Sword Maiden) are the veteran players, having characters with fleshed out backstories, previous adventures, and character designs with unique gear to reflect as much. The other characters look generic, probably on purpose to accentuate how they are new. Good to mention here that there is CGI present, usually when there is a pack of goblins or Goblin Slayer himself is also CG (I don't mind the goblins since I'm used to crowds having CG, but not a fan of Goblin Slayer being CG at times). The art is good at its best, it's not exactly Your Name levels but its passable (though having read the manga I prefer the manga’s). The sound design is pretty good, the music shines where it counts and the blows actually have an impact and you can feel how hard a hit really is (very much like this since its usually a gripe I have with action anime). 

Enjoyment: 9/10 

The pacing in the anime is great, introducing the main characters and cast in the first couple of episodes naturally. No episode felt boring, and as long as the cast was present having adventures or just simply talking about why they wanted to become adventurers it is fun. 

Conclusion: 
All in all, this show is a solid 8/10. 
It's pretty much DnD the anime. It's great; Need season 2."
6746,"If you are contemplating whether or not to watch Durarara!! or not, go ahead and watch it. Even if you don't like shounen, and even if you are a filthy 3D loving person.  Durarara is about this kid called Mikado who is invited over by his friend Masaomi over to Ikebukuro to join him at his school, why Mikado will travel across the country for this is unknown, but Mikado is obviously shocked to see the city life in full swing and that's when the story breaks away into multiple facets and all of them move towards a single conclusion (like how Game of Thrones would be, if that 3D bastard would just write the two damn books already).  Durarara is quite entertaining, no matter how you look at it, its got wholesome fun for whatever thing you like (unless you like loli, you won't find any here). Don't like Mikado and his constant whining? well, he isn't the main character anyways, just root for someone else. There is quite a bit of realism at the start, but its quickly dispelled by a vending machine getting thrown, this is a fantasy world and a world of true urban legends, just because it doesn't have big-breasted girls fighting with swords doesn't make it non-fantasy. That said, let's move onto the proper review.

 

Artwork (18/20)
The artwork is definitely quite good and the animation is also out of the world quality (or atleast it was, way back when in 2010), you will occasionally be surprised by the fluid animation on vehicles or particle effects, and it just makes it even better, the city of Ikebukuro is definitely a beauty, and you won't be disappointed.

 /

 There   is  one small problem though. The crowd. Its usually greyed out, but I guess its a small price to pay for quality artwork overall, eh?
 

The fights are usually very well done.



Music and Sound (18/20)
The music is quite something, both OP01 (Uragiri no Yuuyake) and OP02 (Complicated) are very good. The ED is somewhat lacking, but music during scenes makes up for it. The sound effects on the other hand are not all that good. The sound is never really able to give that feeling of 'busy city' as it should, but I guess I can't have everything.

Story (16/20)
The story is presented in arcs, which usually follow the life/history of one out of the myriad of characters and tells us a little more about them. Every arc usually has tremendous character development which really brings a life of its own to some characters.
The story starts out very slow at the start, but it picks up after it reaches around episode 9 and then hits full swing by episode 18 to bring a somewhat satisfactory end. ""Why just a  somewhat satisfactory end?"" you ask. Because the end removes all hopes of a second season, that's why. And I would be lying if I said I didn't want another season of this awesomeness. The story does start getting a little stale as it approaches the end, there is definite tension in the air, and the tension just keeps up for too long, which could have been avoided, but hey, atleast it was all fun and no filler. The plot also has some holes, but I won't discuss them here due to spoiler issues. Durarara's rewatchability is also very low because the plot relies too much on keeping things hidden from the viewer. Once you already know the story once, it loses all its charm.

Characters (17/20)


I can't help but say that the character development was the best I have ever seen. Most characters end up being nowhere near what they used to be at the start of the series. That is not to say I liked them. I didn't. I guess I liked Izaya a bit, but other than him, I could never really get along with anyone, I never could cheer for one of them. As far as I was concerned, they were all a bunch of two-faced bitches (which is what made Durarara so entertaining in the first place, guess I am a hypocrite). Of course, other people's outlook may differ from mine. 



Enjoyment (17/20)
Durarara! is definitely enjoyable, you will find yourself at your wits end by the mystery in it and you will scratch your head about it, and you will love it. That's the sort of series that durarara is. Admittedly, you might be bored by some parts, but you will grow fond of it over time.


Final score - 18 + 18 +16 +17 +17 = 86/100
Durarara is a masterpiece which somehow end up short due to some very silly mistakes, but believe it, you will be glad you picked it up. Do not think of my rating as a 86, but as 4 short of 90, and you will see how good Durarara really is. Its a must watch for everyone even if you do not like its genre. 

So, what the hell are you waiting for? Go watch it now."
106625,"I am reviewing this show not to make you get into Haikyu!!. This is more so to give you my main opinion on this season. This is not a review, but more so a discussion. Obviously, there will be spoilers if you are not caught up to Haikyu or at least S4. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk about the show.
Season 4 starts off after Karasuno’s victory. After Kageyama is invited to the All-Japan Youth Training Camp., it seems like he is showing off to Hinata. But it is quickly revealed that he is just provoking home to catch up to Kageyama. With the Youth Camp, we are introduced to all the new rivals and antagonists. Over on Hinata’s side, Tsukishima is invited to go to a special rookie select training camp for first-years in Miyagi Prefecture. As both of his rivals are invited to train with some of the best players, Hinata feels left behind. As the mad-lad he is, he breaks into the training camp Tsukishima went to. After he’s caught, Yashijo makes Hinata the ball-boy(Yaoi artists be sweating right now). With all the characters set up, let’s talk about the antagonists.
The best part of this season is how it builds up to the 2nd part. The new characters perfectly maintain the momentum between S3 and the 2nd part of S4.
All of the characters especially Atsumu and Hoshifumi are amazing rival characters for Kageyama and Hinata. Hoshifumi’s incredible similarity to Hinata is what I was waiting for. Throughout I thought that Hinata is really underwhelming because he’s only rival is Kageyama. That’s why every time he’s growth is influenced by characters like Kenma or Bokuto, it feels a bit too immature. I don’t hate it but I thought there were better ways to handle this. That’s why seeing Hinata be intimidated by Hoshifumi and the clear difference between them will lead to an amazing showdown in the second part. 
Atsumu is a 2nd Oikawa. I think everyone gets that. His cockiness and extreme immaturity but undeniable talent make him a perfect role model and rival character that Oikawa was. His influence on Kageyama right in the first few episodes is mind-blowing. I advise you to watch Aleczandxr's video on Kageyama because he will be able to explain this better than me.
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84PUIIK1UEY&abchannel=Aleczandxr)
Atsumu’s provoking pushed Kageyama to be a lot more strict on his team but not exactly like how he was in middle school. This perfectly explains what Oikawa meant to say in Season 2. This makes me keep on watching Kageyama’s development and like him more
I have talked to some Haikyuu fans who don’t like season 4. Most of their reasonings are that this is not that this season does not live up to the same hype as season 3. Well yeah, but the main point of this season is to build up all the characters and this is done marvelously. It perfectly hypes me up to watch the new season and lays down all the plot points.
Season 4 is underrated because this is more character-driven and does not have the same level of hype as the other seasons. The whole point of this “review” was to explain to you the point of season 4 and change people’s opinion on it.
This review may have been a bit messy but I think I was able to say what I wanted to say. If you want me to review a show, message me or DM me on Twitter. (Links in my bio.)"
2167,"Hello, my name is TheRoundChestnut. 
Due to the success of my Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann review, I decided that I wanted to make more reviews to give the people who are hesitant on watching a certain series reason why it is good or bad. 

This time, I am conducting a review on Clannad.
This review will discuss what themes it expresses, the character which upholds its themes, and the uniqueness of this anime. I, then, will discuss why this anime is not for everyone, and shall give some suggestions on if this is anime is right for you. 
I will be discussing more of its story rather than its animation and music, etc.
(This review will contain minor spoilers, but not anything too bad) 

img300()

The reason why this anime is beloved for what it is is the amount of depth between each and every character, whether that leads into romance or even feuds within their families. The story is centered around Okazaki Tomoya, a delinquent who is wandering through his final high school years and constantly aggravated on the dullness of his own life. The reason why the premise of the beginning is important is because the viewers realize that the main character is at his grey point (the lowest point) of his life and sets up a story of change. This is already more hooking than most romance animes out there, because the viewers are able to experience the change of Tomoya from the lowest point of his life and eventually to his peak.
The characters that are introduced through out the story are represented in Tomoya's expansion of his relationships with other people. His build of relationships becomes important throughout both seasons because they allow Tomoya to feel ""alive"" rather than living ""dully"" without any relationships. (Kinda pointing fun at those people who do actually live those kind of lives). The show presents a way how a person can change through the interactions of people and how they can grow upon those relationships by merely being with them. 
Another theme that is present throughout the series is the ties between sacrifice/loss and redemption. (I'm not going to say anything specific here because if I do then it's super spoilers). The characters all experience these ties at least once in the series. Not only does this provide character development, but it also allows the viewers to relate it to their own lives and surroundings. Clannad emphasizes on this theme because it allows the viewers to sympathize with the characters and their hardships. This theme centralizes the entire series as a means to convey the importance of emotions and sympathy and loss. Imagine losing a relative or as little as your favorite toy from when you were 8. Now imagine losing them. To others it may seem nothing or out of pity to say sorry, but inside it is different. It's a heavy lump of disparity for that loss. Clannad uses that as a mean to tell its story and the different backgrounds each character faces. This is why Clannad is powerful in conveying its story, and thus leading to people loving it so much. 

Animation wise for a 2007 - 2009 show by Kyoto animations, this is really a spectacular anime to watch visually. The characters are fluid and well designed, scenery is real, and most of all the world and atmosphere feel alive. 
Music is very fitting for what ever scene there is. If there is a scene of lively talking, then the music is lively as well. Same goes for when the atmosphere is heavy, music is heavy and dramatic. I love the OST always gives me the chills for how memorable and nostalgic it is.
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KMzDVf2Bx4 - probably the best). 

img400()

But, as I said in the beginning of this review, this anime is not meant for everyone. Here I will be discussing the common problems/refutes people make when complaining about this show, and I will refute them to try to convince you a bit that you may have looked the wrong way. 
1. ""It's too boring."" - People who usually say this are people who watched Clannad thinking its like Toradora or SAO, with a bunch of action or drama that drives the story. Clannad isn't like those two. It immerses the viewers in the perspective of Tomoya. Clannad is a Slice of Life, not a dramatic romance.  

2. ""It's way too slow"" - This I can kind of understand this. The first season goes around introducing each character with their own arc, so when it does get to the final episode of the first season, the viewers feel drawn out. But like I said earlier, this is a Slice of Life that draws the viewers and immerses them in their world. And the only way the characters can come off meaning is by giving them their own arcs. So in the end, it's not wasted episodes. 

3. ""Where is the sad part?"" - This is something I have major concerns with. If everybody came to watch the sad part and the sad part only, then this entire first season didn't need to exist. The whole entire reason why the sad part is sad (somewhere in the second season) is because the entire show (first and second season) builds up to it. And the reason why it's so heavy and impactful is because it happens to the characters that we watched up to this whole time. So if you're watching Clannad just for the sad part, either stop watching because you're not going to feel sad, or take a step back and enjoy every part of it. 

4. ""It's overrated and hyped up so much."" - It may be overrated because of how popular it is, and how much people gush over it. I was like that too thinking no show was going to make me cry, but I was wrong when I watched this. This show made me change my perspective when it comes to watching shows and to take them how they are meant to be taken. And hopefully if you could take the time to watch Clannad again with that idea in mind maybe you could grasp why people refer to this show like how they do. 

5. ""Where is the romance"" - The romance of Clannad does not come to the forefront so easily. The build up of the first season onto the second season is key. The interactions that Nagisa and Okazaki had were developed (slowly) so that they can fully flesh out into a couple in the second season. The romance here is intimate. I don't think it is anywhere direct in its portrayal of romance in both season, but it does not have to be that way. Romance can be interpreted in different ways. Some like it slow and some like it fast. But being able to appreciate both ideologies is what makes watching Clannad a wonderful show to watch. 

img400()

Conclusion: 
I do not think Clannad is for everyone. The romance in this show is slow, and the progression of the story is slow. But if you are here for a fast romance, then this is not your show. Sit down, lose the sense of time, and enjoy the ride. I want to express how much Clannad means to me and I want you to understand the same. 

Should you watch Clannad? Definitely."
164,"Ashitaka was the last Prince of Enishi, a small, peaceful tribe living out their days in the Muromashi period of Japan.  His tribe was already dwindling when fate struck them with a horrifying encounter.  One day, a giant boar, corrupted by some mysterious demonic entity, attacked the village.  Ashitaka saved the day, but at a great cost, as his arm was tainted by the demon.  Permanently exiled from everything he knew, Ashitaka set out on a quest that would see him caught in the middle of an ongoing war between the deities of the forest and a contingent of humans who wished to claim the territory for their own.  With the help of San, a young woman who was raised by wolves from infancy, can Ashitaka successfully quell the hatred surrounding him, or will it doom both sides as his curse dooms him?

Princess Mononoke was the last Studio Ghibli movie to be completely hand drawn, and thank God for that, because I don’t want to think about how many visuals in this movie probably would have been relegated to CGI if the movie had been made five years later.  You just know they would have used CGI for the forest spirits, and while I could see that approach working(although CGI Ryuk would beg to differ) the thought of the demonic sludge worms being animated that way makes me want to shudder.  That didn’t happen, thankfully, and it’s one of the few reasons that I personally consider this to be among the best looking Ghibli films ever made.  Sure, as a drawback it wound up becoming the most expensive anime movie ever up to that point, but that money was well spent. 

The animation itself is pretty much what you’d expect from Studio Ghibli...  The movement of characters is smooth and graceful, every bit of motion feels alive and unhindered, and that level of motion lends itself generously to the numerous action scenes.  As far as character designs go, they follow a samurai/feudal Japan aesthetic, but they do so with bright, vibrant colors that are thoroughly easy on the eyes.  Miyazaki has always had a very large imagination, and while it was on full display with all of the strange and fantastical spirits visiting the bath house in Spirited Away, I like it a lot better here because instead of just cramming scores of random creations under one roof, his imagination largely extends to the forest spirits in this movie, and they all feel like the natural inhabitants of the world they’re living in.  No matter how over-the-top some of the design choices get, I never felt like any of it was jarring or out of place, it was all just part of the spirit of the forest, living in their (super)natural environment.  Giant animals with strange features might take a little while to get used to on a first watch, but even the weirdest of them grow on you in time.

And what an environment it is.  It’s fair to say that most Ghibli movies take place in a handful of settings...  This street here, this house here, this bathhouse, and so on and so forth.  I don’t even know what to call the setting of Princess Mononoke other than an entire region.  It’s not just the forest and the human encampment...  It’s other villages, it’s different fields, it’s other forests, it’s too many battlefields to count, and as many as there are, none of them feel generic or repetitive, despite the fact that they all do feel related.  Every area is intricately detailed, every frame a painting unto itself, and the whole region feels alive, rather than just the backdrop of a story.  The setting of Princess Mononoke is an entire world...  One that feels immense and invincible in the moment, but one that we know from a modern perspective CAN be conquered and transformed over time with the right resources.  Best way I can describe it, this is what vast, untamed wilderness looked like BEFORE humanity had the technology for deforestation.

The English dub has a sort of complicated history, as it is technically a Disney effort, but all of the actual dubbing effort was done by Miramax, a company that Disney owned for a seventeen year period up until 2010.  This happened sort of as a consequence for the way Disney butchered Nausicaa a few years prior.  Miyazaki was rightfully pissed about that, and as a result, he absolutely refused to let Disney edit or cut Princess Mononoke for a family audience.  Ever protective of its image, Disney handed the project to Miramax(Which I guess means it was too mature for Touchstone?) and to direct the dub, they hired...  No joke...  Neil Gaiman, and he took the project as dead-serious as he could.  His adaptive script heavily altered the wording of the material to sound more natural in English, and while there are a few moments I personally found cringeworthy...  One character’s introduction was far more rambly than it should have been, there’s a line that deliberately makes fun of the Forest God’s appearance before we even see it, there are a couple of shots that were supposed to be silent and subtle, yada yada yada...  It is almost entirely for the better.

One of the benefits of Disney being hands-off about the dub is that there really weren’t any late-nineties pop culture celebrities thrown in there for marketing purposes, and come on, you know damn well Ben Savage and Melissa Joan Hart would have been the leads otherwise.  Instead you have Billy Crudup and Claire Danes playing roles that could have very easily been boring and one note with a stunning amount of charm and sincerity.  Minnie Driver rides a very fine line between inspiring leader and fearless sociopath, Billy Bob Thorton adds some very welcome likeability to a character that was previously just kind of soft spoken and sinister in the sub, and the Gods of the forest are granted an unearthly level of strength and wisdom from people like Gillian Anderson and Keith David.  There seems to be some confusion over Gillian Anderson’s character, as the wolf Moro had a male voice actor in the sub, but the character is female.  The Japanese just have a tendency of applying male voices to wolves, so, yeah, that’s a thing.  It’s not a perfect dub, I do think the adaptive script does over-reach at times, but I still highly recommend it.

When you think of the average Miyazaki movie, one of the first qualities that comes to mind is that he makes movies for children, but adults can still enjoy them...  Well, most adults, but I digress.  This sort of puts him in common company with Disney, a studio he does have close connections to.  What I find particularly striking about Princess Mononoke is that it seems to be the exact opposite...  It’s a film aimed at adults, but one that children can still enjoy.  There is a decent portion of violence throughout the film...  It revolves around a war, and while they never shy away from the reality of people dying in war, going surprisingly far with dismemberments and blood, it never feels particularly gory or sensational.  It’s used sparingly, and at least back in a previous decade, I could see it getting maybe a PG rating...  You know, back when that rating actually meant something.  And let’s be real, parents will take their kids to see ANYTHING these days as long as it doesn’t contain bare breasts. 

There is a ton of depth and complexity to the plot that might fly over a kid’s head, but the plot itself is still clear and accessible, there’s a ton of fast and intense action, and most of the characters are likeable and interesting.  I’m not going to pretend like the violence wouldn’t have been too much for me when I was really little...  I couldn’t watch Alice in Wonderland because I found cards getting their heads cut off off-screen too disturbing, so I’m pretty sure the on-screen decapitations(plural) in this film probably would have scarred me too...  But by the age of ten, I’m sure I would have dug the crap out of this.  That’s saying a lot, by the way, because when I look at my two over-all favorite Ghibli films, Grave of the Fireflies and Only Yesterday, those two movies mean a lot to me, but I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t do anything for me if I watched them before my mid twenties at the very least.  

I’ve made no secret of the fact that I’m not a huge Miyazaki fan.  I’m more of an Isao Takahata guy.  I don’t really buy into the magic and whimsy of Miyazaki’s work, and while I’ve never really had a good explanation for that, what I’ve kind of been realizing recently is that it just feels disingenuous to me.  As much as people call Miyazaki a genius, I can’t help but look at all those stories that have come out about him being a massive asshole who’s really difficult to work with...  Who publicly denied wanting to mourn the passing of one of his inspirations, and who can barely manage to even pretend to be supportive to his own son...  And compare everything that’s publicly known about this man to the whimsy he keeps producing, and feel a distinct level of disconnect.  I’m not sure how to put this, but there was a sort of balance to his work in the 20’th century.  He made a few magical children’s movies, and he made a few action movies aiming a bit older, and while Nausicaa is kind of a mixed bag, these films just felt pure, like they were exactly what he wanted to make at the time.  Then Princess Mononoke was successful in Japan, but didn’t do so hot over here, only hitting a handful of theaters.

And then came Spirited Away, the world-wide smash hit that turned both his name and his Studio’s name into hot commodities, and he’s been making strictly whimsical children’s movies ever since.  Sure, The Wind Rises is the exception to this, but tell that to the people in charge of marketing at the time.  I realize this isn’t a popular take, but there hasn’t been a single Miyazaki-directed movie since the turn of the millennium that I was able to fall in love with.  I didn’t like Ponyo, I didn’t like Howl’s Moving Castle...  I’m sorry on both counts... And while I did like Spirited Away and The Wind Rises, I've never loved them or considered them masterpieces like so many others do.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm completely off base, but pre-2000s, it felt like he was making movies fir himself, and post-2000s, it felt like he was making movies for the audience.  Modern Miyazaki movies, more often than not, have this cloying quality to them, a level of compromise that would be totally acceptable with most other directors, but with an auteur like Miyazaki, there are plenty of pre-2000’s examples of what his films look like when there’s no compromise involved whatsoever.  Princess Mononoke is the prime example of this.

For starters, I mentioned in two of my previous reviews how Miyazaki sometimes has a tendency to direct through story-boards, focusing on animation and emotion above the actual story and plot, both of which he largely makes up as he goes along.  That is not the case with Mononoke, a film he developed for over a decade before production even began.  Unlike a lot of his modern films, Mononoke doesn’t just thrive on magic and animation, it has a tightly written plot, a well thought out story and themes that are explicitly explored not just as loose one-off morals, but with deliberate intent and sincerity.  It doesn’t talk down to you, it doesn’t teach you life lessons with the vibe of a parent wagging his finger at you, and solutions to problems don’t just come out of nowhere.  Relationships are developed perhaps a bit too quickly, but through understandable circumstances.  You could argue the romance between Ashitaka and San isn't the strongest, but there is substance to it.

Likewise, Miyazaki has always had a fascination with environmental preservation, and while I don’t think he’s ever done a bad job exploring this topic in his films(although his commentary about polluting the ocean in Ponyo didn’t really go anywhere plot-wise), it’s still a breath of fresh air for any American who had to grow up having condescending shit like Ferngully and Captain Planet shoved down our throats.  The plot of Princess Mononoke deals with a conflict between man and nature, and unlike most of the conservationist swill I grew up on, there’s no clear villain.  Man-kind needs to grow and prosper in a world with limited space, nature needs to defend itself from destruction and deforestation.  Each side has lost a considerable amount of lives at the hands of the other, breeding a blood feud based on both misunderstandings and hatred, and since Ashitaka was cursed as a side effect of this conflict, it’s up to him to find a compromise that you just know HAS to exist, but that neither side believes the other side is capable of. 

Of course, having a complex conflict wouldn’t mean much if we didn’t also have complex characters, but luckily, that’s another area where Mononoke shines.  The most obvious example is Lady Eboshi, the leader of the human city, and she’s presented as benevolent to the core.  She hired prostitutes away from brothels and lepers off the streets and gave them far more safe and dignified lives aiding her in her efforts.  She cares for her people, she’s aware of mankind’s reliance on nature...  And yet on the other side of the coin, she’s a ruthless madwoman who will stop at nothing to dominate nature and trample it underfoot if it gets in her way.  Honestly though, nature is no better, with the wolves and boars being just as proud and furious as their enemies.  Hell, the men in Eboshi’s army and the wild pigs of the forest are compared to each other in subtle ways throughout the movie.  It’s hard to get a read on the God Deer, as it only shows up a couple of times, but it does turn into a raging God of Death at one point towards the end, and the lake it resides in...  The one touted as being healing and full of life...  Has the bones of the dead scattered along its bottom.  If that doesn’t tell you how dedicated this movie is to nuance, I don’t know what will.

I’ve heard people refer to Ashitaka as a mary-sue, and while I do kind of get where this complaint comes from...  He is the only character who ever really comes off as preachy, being the moral center of the film who’s always screaming about peace and looking past hatred...  It’s worth remembering that these aren’t his personal beliefs.  He knows first-hand that hatred itself is the villain and he knows the conflict has to be brought to an end, because that’s what he was told was the cause of his curse.  He’s not arguing for pacifism because he hates violence, he’s doing it because he doesn’t want to die, or worse, be transformed and corrupted like the boar he slew in the first place.  He still gets angry, he’s still willing to kill if he has to, he just has knowledge that the other characters don’t.  I guess you could make an argument for San being a bit simpler and less interesting than the rest of the cast, and while it is kind of true that she’s not that complex...  I personally see her more as a symbolic character than anything else...  She’s still really cool and likeable, she just doesn’t have a strong enough arc to justify being the namesake of the movie.  I do like the way her arc is resolved, and no spoilers, but it reminds me of how they changed Mowgli’s resolution in the live action Jungle Book, which is the main reason I prefer it over the original cartoon.

There’s no easy answer to this plot.  Neither side is presented as entirely right or entirely wrong, as they both have entirely understandable goals to achieve and grievances against one another.  Compromise isn’t easy, but sometimes you have to set aside your differences and find a middle ground for the sake of the greater good.  The only villain in this situation is hatred itself, which can turn a natural conflict into all out war, and which is destined to carry bloody repercussions.  It sort of reminds me of The Lorax, both the original book and especially the old Chuck Jones short, because they presented an argument, told the audience point blank what the conflict was with an undeniable level of respect and honesty, and left it to the viewer to figure out the solution.  The movie said ‘fuck that, trees are great, let’s blame everything on an over-the-top irredeemable villain instead of highlighting the real dilemma!’  And I think it’s obvious which approach Princess Mononoke took.  In his prime, Hayao Miyazaki respected his viewers, he never talked down to them, and he never compromised his vision, and while that may have resulted in the movie being a bit too long...  It’s over two hours long, and it kind of feels like it could easily been cut down to an hour forty five without losing much, but if that’s the biggest complaint I can come up with, that says a lot.

Princess Mononoke has been available from many different sources, including Miramax, Disney proper, and now Gkids.  It’s pretty easy to find at any level of quality and price that you could possibly desire.

If I’m being honest, Princess Mononoke is not my favorite Hayao Miyazaki film.  I still slightly prefer My Neighbor Totoro, but when I say slightly, I mean slightly, like they are neck and neck.  That bias aside though, this is Hayao Miyazaki’s true magnum opus.  It has depth and complexity, it explores important topics with intelligence and respect, and it just generally succeeds in so many ways that countless other films have failed.  Its only serious failure is that it came to the United States at a time when Americans just weren’t ready to accept animation as a medium for anything other than children’s entertainment and immature adult comedy, and while it did add some legitimacy both to Japanese animation and the range of animation as a whole, it’s scary to think about how it might have faded into obscurity on our side of the pond if Miyazaki’s follow-up hadn’t busted down the door and turned the Ghibli brand into a house-hold name.  There’s always going to be debate between a handful of his films, and there’s an argument to be made for each one, but for me, this is the movie I consider to be his masterpiece, not because it’s perfect, but because it feels like his last genuinely unfiltered, uncompromising passion project.

I give Princess Mononoke a 9/10."
127720,"Isekai.

You’re probably familiar with this term. The sheer number of shows that come out each year from this genre has gotten to the point that many are just sick of it and would rather skip than watch the same formulaic anime. However, not every Isekai is created equally.

There is one which has gathered somewhat of a cult around it - one that is seen as the grandfather of modern isekai, using pre-existing tropes but executing them properly. One that truly has the right to call itself an isekai.

Welcome to Mushoku Tensei.

This is the tale of a man known as Rudeus Greyrat and how he is forced to live in a new environment with completely unfamiliar customs, traditions and a never before seen power - magic. Contrary to most Isekai stories fans are familiar with, Rudeus’ flaws and regrets from his previous life carry over to his new body - flaws and regrets he often needs to reflect on. Throughout the series, the audience can see how he grows physically and also mentally. However, that does require patience. Changing is not a process that can happen right off the bat, instead requiring years of time and effort to accomplish. It’s an aspect of the show which is constantly being driven home.

The world around you and the people you meet will change as you grow. Nothing is static and will always move, forcing you to mature along with the world around you. It may be a painful experience. It might be sufferable. But truly living life to your fullest, not having any regrets and doing all you can so you can die without any is a task hard to accomplish.

The characters in this show have some of the most realistic depictions of human beings that I have ever seen. In a typical Isekai series, the MC and their party are often tropey characters, ones whose personalities can be described in a few adjectives, very one dimensional and uninteresting entities. But when it comes to writing compelling characters that resemble us humans, it is important to factor in the fact that mankind does make mistakes and that nobody is perfect. We are all flawed individuals that often make mistakes, act irrationally and hurt others. Most of us have plenty of good sides but also bad ones that we try to mitigate or get rid of. We have complex personalities, and these aspects are what defines us as human beings.

In Mushoku Tensei, the way in which audience is introduced to the characters is by showing them in the worst light possible, with their flaws on full display, to later make their growth visible as they change. Throughout the duration of the journey these characters have to face their vices and develop as people, slowly mitigating aspects of theirs that hurts those around them. The series teaches us that sometimes first impressions could even prevent us from seeing someone for who they really are - confusing it with who they appear to be. Willing to see past the flaws of someone and giving them a second chance is something that people should strive to achieve.

Often times changing yourself requires a lot of effort and many just give up without ever trying to get back up. Looking at yourself in the mirror and acknowledging your mistakes is an important part in life. To see the flaws within ourselves and understanding what parts of us hurts those around us is the first step in becoming a better person. However, simply having the conviction to change is not enough and it may often require help of other people that will extend a hand and direct you on a different path.

The animation and art is extremely well done, by some very talented animators that bring the series to life. It’s fluid, it’s natural and it heavily immerses you to the world, captivating you almost instantly. There is a lot of depth put into it, showcased by various elements such as the grip on a sword, balance on the sand, fire changing color depending on the heat, the list goes on. These are aspects highlight just how detailed this show is and is part of what makes it so compelling and grounded. To add to the immersion, Mushoku Tensei has many openings, changing depending on the region the characters are current in. Each of these songs perfectly sets the mood.

Overall, Mushoku Tensei is a story unlike any I’ve seen before despite, at its core, not doing anything groundbreaking. It has managed to execute the tropes flawlessly and has such wonderful character development and high production value that it stands out amongst many others from the same genre. I’m sure it’s one that’ll be remembered for years to come. This is only the beginning of the long tale of Rudeus Greyrat and I'm convinced that many wish to see more of it.

If there was a person next to you who struggles to change, who is suffering a lot, who is unable to read the room and may often hurt those around them - would you be willing to give them a second chance and help them on their journey?

Or would you abandon them on the spot, turning a blind eye and ignoring them?

That’s an answer that only you can find and I hope this show will open your eyes to it."
99539,"I had my fair share of problems with the first season of Nanatsu, but it was somewhat entertaining. I never expected the second season to be a masterpiece, but damn this anime managed to disappoint me nonetheless. 

One of the highlights of the first season is the fact that even with very poor writing, the show manages to embrace you on the drama and conflicts of each character. But here this definitively doesn't happen, every time the show tries to go for a more emotional or dramatic approach, every possibility of comotion is obliterated by the fact that the author doesn't know how to write a dialogue or to create an actual conflict. For some reason, almost every character here becomes unbearable. Meliodas is ridiculously edgy and this makes almost impossible to relate to him; King is straight up nonsensical, bro is onto nothing; Elizabeth is still annoying; and some others characters like Ban and Gilthunder straight up don't make any sense.

This new gimmick of power level added to show might be the worst idea a writer ever had. Like, who the hell thought that was a good idea? It makes the power of characters look so artificial, like they are in a videogame or something. And since the power leveling of this anime is so cracked, this gimmick just serves to demonstrate how stronger than the other characters Meliodas, Escanor and the Ten Commandments are. And the fact that they never talked about this on the first season and now every episode I have to watch that fucking pig saying the power level of every single individual for no reason at all pisses me off. 

But for me, the worst thing here is how they went deeper into the grooming hints. I do not care that Elizabeth is actually a ancient goddess, during her current reincarnation, she has the mind and the brain and the body of a average human (besides that she can do magic). And Meliodas not only harasses her a lot of times (yeah, the fact that she is okay with the harassement maybe makes it a little better but is still disgusting) but he alsos went full on the degenerate side and raised her with the intention of, in the future, wife her or something. Bro, this is fucked up! On the first season we had the King and Diane situation where King arguably groomed her too. But in that I don't see much problem since it's such a innoccent relationship and the concept of age for giants and fairies can be quite different than ours (I don't like this type of argument but in this case it can pass), however, Elizabeth is a HUMAN, and her relationship with Meliodas is not only disturbing but also unacceptable and is the worst thing about this anime.

Well, I can't say that this show is all bad though. Escanor is fucking cool, some of the Commandments are sick too, Ban is charismatic and edgy at the right dose of edginess. But all the entertainment value of this season comes down to Escanor being badass."

A wise woman once spoke, “fun things are fun”. Given the way that 2020 has panned out I feel like it is important to take the time to enjoy something fun amidst all of the stress we are experiencing. I know I needed a pick me up with the way things have been transpiring. And that came in rewatching an anime that had previously brought me an immense joy, “Gintama”. I needed to go back to something that had cheered me up in the past and this was the perfect fit. As I make this review I am currently rewatching the other installments of the series, but the focus here is specifically on the first. Based on Hideaki Sorachi’s manga it was produced by Sunrise and ran from 2006 to 2010 spanning 201 episodes. Despite how lofty that sounds, it was actually smooth and easy to complete it again. With its likable cast of characters, wonderful comedy, and ability to handle drama with more skill than one may anticipate it truly was fantastic to see it all again. I understand the length of the anime is intimidating, but trust me once you’re hooked you are not going away. 

“Gintama” takes place in the land of Edo that was once home to the mighty samurai and became overtaken by aliens known as the Amanto. With a ban on swords put in place it appears that the samurai way has died out, but it still lives on in our hero Sakata Gintoki. After encountering a down on his luck teenager named Shimura Shinpachi and Kagura, an eccentric girl hailing from an alien tribe known as the Yato, together they form Yorozuya, a business that will take on any and all odd jobs for a price. “Gintama” has an episodic format so while it does have this general premise at its core, it isn’t operating based on a structured plot like other Weekly Shonen Jump titles do. Some episodes will be our main characters getting caught up in some strange mess or focused on other members of the very large cast.  However there will also be arcs that span several episodes that manage to bring in something more substantial. Through them you may learn a character’s back story or something hinting towards a bigger plot that will be explored later on. First and foremost “Gintama” is a comedy though and the way it keeps its humor fresh and exciting for this long is nothing short of impressive. One might think this premise isn’t enough to justify an anime this long or that the running gags will grow stale with time, but the series manages to keep itself together through its run and even on a revisit the jokes still hit their mark. It really is a testament to Sorachi’s talent that something like this holds up the way it does.

img600()

One area where “Gintama” really stands tall is with its cast of characters. It’s given me some of my favorite characters and despite how many of them there are it doesn’t feel like potential is squandered with any of the recurring cast. Gin is one of my favorite leads in a Shonen Jump series. At first he appears to be an irresponsible slacker who would rather gorge on sweets while reading the newest “One Piece” chapter than perform any heroics, but even in his debut scene there was something more. Something that spoke more to his nature of someone who will step up and protect the ones he cares about. As selfish and amoral as Gin can be he is still someone who chooses to do what’s right even if at his own expense. I love seeing a character who is imperfect, but still does the right thing in the end. And I can’t help but feel a sense of warmth and happiness whenever I see him. Shinpachi is a character I have seen people describe as shrill and I don’t agree with that. Yes he does get stressed out and yell a lot, but it never comes across as annoying to me. He occupies the straight man role in the anime, something the show literally tells you, and him pointing out the absurdity of what the other characters do ends up making him a great audience proxy. Some big laughs came from him drawing attention to how ridiculous the situations were. Plus it’s also worth bearing in mind that Shinpachi is just a teenager and struggling to keep his family dojo afloat so this part of his personality makes a lot of sense. Not only that he is also someone who, despite knowing his limits as a fighter, will still push himself to do the brave thing and I’m a sucker for that. No matter how many times I see this sort of trope at play it leaves me feeling good. Kagura meanwhile is one of the best female characters from a Jump series ever. She’s hilarious and never fails to bring a smile to my face. She’s blunt, she’s strange, and she’s absolutely wonderful. It feels great having our heroine be someone so brash and energetic. And I can’t help but get a kick out of her excessive eating and overwhelming physical strength that does not reflect in her petite design, these are more tropes in anime I appreciate. But beneath that upbeat energy lies something compelling. She’s a fourteen year old girl who wandered the stars and found her way to an unusual, but incredible family unit through Gin and Shinpachi and her giant dog Sadaharu. Given what we discover about her biological family it’s very satisfying to know she did find a place for herself surrounded by people who care for her. These three carry the series so well and we really were blessed to have them.

img600()

Of course the other characters deserve mention as well. The recurring cast is so lively and engaging that I don’t even think there’s a character I can say I come away hating. Even in manga and anime I love there can still be a character that gets to me, but I don’t think I feel that at all with “Gintama”. The Shinsengumi members are some favorites of mine. I just adore seeing Kondo, Hijikata, and Okita’s group dynamic and all the bizarre situations they end up in. I can’t get enough of how much Okita transparently hates Hijikata and will sabotage him in a heartbeat or how Kondo blunders his way through life or Hijikata’s cool guy exterior crumbling the minute he drowns his food in mayonnaise. Many of my favorite arcs were centered around them, those three have a history together that gets explored at various points and it makes for some of the best moments in the anime. Meanwhile Yamazaki, another Shinsengumi member, is just trying his best to keep his mind intact. There’s also Katsura, the beautiful leader of the Joi rebels with a mind that goes beyond mere human understanding. He acts like everything he does makes perfect logical sense when his behavior is nothing short of pure insanity and it’s always funny. Most often seen by his side is pet Elizabeth, an enigmatic individual of few words who may or may not be an old man in a suit. We also have Hasegawa the infinitely unlucky. It’s interesting to watch him because on the one hand you enjoy seeing how low he can go because it is entertaining, but you also want to see his life improve at the same time. And then there’s the female cast. I think “Gintama” has the best female cast of any Weekly Shonen Jump series. There’s Otae, there’s Sacchan, there’s Kyubei, there’s Tsukuyo, there’s Otose, and Tama, and Catherine. The women in come in various forms and occupy roles in the story that are distinct. Young and old, working class and rich, we are not just getting one type of woman and calling it a day. We see them as proactive and forward thinking individuals who are also just as funny as the male characters. They don’t exist to be some no nonsense foil that roll their eyes when the men do something dumb, they come at you with their own brand of comedy that is unique to each character. And we see them regularly, these aren’t characters who appear once and never come back. Having a cast like this makes the anime feel so dynamic and its never a dull moment.

img600()

Something that this anime does with surprising success is how it handles drama. It is a comedy at heart, but it still finds a way to swing around to something more serious and does it amazingly. Some things get hinted at earlier on and don’t appear as anything significant until events unfold and then you realize you’ve been heading down this direction the whole time. Maybe Sorachi had these things planned or maybe he just decided later on to expand on things he already established, but regardless the way it’s done feels so seamless. Early on Hijikata speaks of the wonderful things Kondo did for the Shinsengumi members, Kagura’s father mentions Earth being stifling for their kind, we hear about Gin’s valued teacher and all of that is explored later. It’s a writing style that reminds me in ways of how Eiichiro Oda writes “One Piece”. Sorachi plants these seeds of information and after a period of time you see that come back into the forefront. Some of these moments end up being rather beautiful in ways and others can break your heart and it never leaves me feeling like it’s out of place. Yes we will go from these sad moments to wild and crazy fun in the next episode, but it works. The jokes don’t cheapen these episodes, there’s this harmonious way “Gintama” approaches these two extremes. Those serious moments still mean something to the characters and it leaves them feeling rather rich and more than just outlets for Sorachi’s jokes. You feel for what they go through and become happy knowing things get better for them.

The jokes, of course, are fantastic. Most famously it will reference other anime and manga. Whether its old school classics like “Ashita no Joe”, “Space Battleship Yamato”, and “Space Pirate Captain Harlock” or crowd favorites like “Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure”, “Berserk”, and “Neon Genesis Evangelion”, the references keep coming and it’s always a blast. In fact the referential humor serves another purpose as it can expose a viewer to an anime they might want to try. This anime is what made me watch “Alps no Shoujo Heidi” and it ended up becoming one of my favorites. References aren’t the only style of humor the series offers though. At times sexual and crude, at others sarcastic, but also with a lot of physical comedy, the jokes keep coming and because it doesn’t stick to one particular gimmick it feels very exciting. “Gintama” has a really great energy to itself and it just makes the humor soar. There are also running gags with the characters and no matter how often you see some of them they still work. Sometimes, in other shows, you’ll grow tired of catchphrases and running jokes because you have been exposed to them too often, but “Gintama” finds ways to keep bringing those things back without it feeling monotonous. Something like Hijikata’s love for mayonnaise is used often, but the way it gets used can vary and leads to some big laughs even though you have grown familiar with this part of his character. Keeping things fresh like that is important to comedy and to spend hundreds of episodes and still maintain that is impressive. 

“Gintama” really is a special franchise. It takes a certain kind of star quality to make someone want to come back to your anime and breeze through every episode with ease and it did that for me. I loved it the first time I saw it and I love it even more now. The characters are fantastic, the seiyuu cast is one of my favorites in all of anime, the jokes leave me howling, and the drama leaves me feeling more connected to the characters I’m attached to. Sunrise did a great job working with the material even if there’s a few recaps and fillers scattered through it and Sorachi really deserves a lot of credit for putting something like this out to us. During times such as these I felt like I needed something to uplift me and put a smile on my face each day. “Gintama” succeeds and then some. I always looked forward to getting home and revisiting the episodes even when watching the more sad moments. It warmed me up and made my days feel less stressful because I could unwind with it and enjoy myself. While this is an anime containing some episodes that had me in tears it is also the same anime where Hijikata reenacts the plot to “Dragon Ball Z” because he wants a cigarette and where Gin and Katsura get cursed into cats while Kondo becomes a gorilla through an unrelated incident. The feeling I get from it is that yes there are times and moments where you will hurt and feel sad, but never lose sight of those fun bright days. I had a blast seeing it all again and cannot recommend it enough. “Gintama” is worth every moment and I hope that if you haven’t seen it yet that you’ll give it a try. You won’t regret it.

No spoilers.




A bit of a quick and dirty one here for me. Wonder Egg Priority was, by far, the most excited I've been to follow a show this season. It was like Rice Krispies - it snapped, crackled and popped. Every episode brought something really interesting to the table, whether it was a cool idea, or a great fight scene, or even some fascinating revelation. But at the end of it all, WEP somehow felt a little bit empty. Episode after episode, I'd wait for something to really tie the show together and cement it as great. But without that - and, no, I don't think that the last few episodes quite got there - it couldn't have ever been much more than just awfully good.

I want to caveat that this is not a finished show, technically. Production hitches mean that we'll have to wait until June for a real conclusion to Ai, Rika, Momoe, and Neiru's stories. But there's enough here to render a judgment. So render judgment I shall.

>Story



WEP has a fascinating premise and a great hook. Magical girls (and let's be clear, that's what these girls are) have to save girls from supernatural enemies - but if they die in the dream world...they die in real life! Dun dun dun. Throughout the front half of the show, there's a sense of crystal-clear mission and storytelling. In the back half, though, things get a little bit fuzzier. It's less clear what the writers are after. There are still good ideas scattered here and there, but they're buried. And the episodes devoted to each egg feel more like a way of exploring those ideas rather than a way of exploring the characters who they represent. Rika is best-served, and Momoe and Neiru (especially Neiru) get the short end of the stick.

There's a great framework here, it just seems to be lacking that something more that the contemporaries of this show (dare I mention a certain magical girl anime that starts with M, ends with a, and has ""adok"" in the middle? perhaps a show about a character that starts with U?) have. WEP says a lot - it tries to tackle some awful big issues. Suicide, gender identity, the perils of obsession, sexual assault, et cetera, et cetera. It's pretty goddamn grown-up.  But at the same time, it never really has anything to say about those things other than that they exist. And that's valuable, sure, but never really feels that impressive. It's all just a bit...sophomoric. It kind of feels like the author is trying to get away with a fairly surface level read on social issues by depicting them graphically. That's why the best moments are where things like Rika's self harm are treated, because it's done quietly and carefully.

>Art/Animation



The art and animation is simply astonishing. The character designs are fantastic and absolutely leap off the screen. They're so full of life, and the character acting by the animators at CloverWorks is just wonderful. The use of colour is beyond brilliant, and the fight scenes are so, for lack of a better word, big. Actions feel like they have a lot of weight, and the fighting has real inertia to it. Absolutely top-notch. Nothing really to criticise here.

>Music



Music is great. The OP, to use a technical term, ""frickin slaps"", and really fits nicely. Sound design is never knowingly undersold, and even though it would be very, very easy to slip into irrelevance for some of the more high-concept ideas, the sound effects always feel strangely completely appropriate.

The VAs put in good work with what they have, although I never felt any performance really stood out.

>Final Thoughts



So, here's the problem. WEP, by all standards, should be fantastic. But at the same time, it never really gets beyond just really good. While there's maturity in the writing, enough to treat what are very serious issues with some measure of respect and a lot of seriousness, it never feels like WEP has anything to say about them, preferring instead to slip into high-concept sci-fi in the last few episodes. And that was a cool way to go, but it never felt like it mattered past aesthetics and some interesting ideas.

Perhaps the production difficulties put the kibosh on the proper expression of the writer's ideas, and I'll have to wait for the special coming in June to put a neat bow on the story. Perhaps. But I really don't think so. We have to judge on what's there, not what might be there. And what's there is something that I never felt got that far beyond being gorgeous and feeling smart.

Ultimately, I think WEP is a (gorgeous) missed opportunity. It could have been a lot more than what it was. Anime usually doesn't treat serious subject matter well, preferring instead to catastrophise, allegorise, and trivialise. WEP had the potential not to do any of those things, and come up with a much better treatment of some societal dirty laundry that really needs an airing. What it was is still pretty good, and by gosh was it exciting to follow along with Ai, seeing what each week would hold. But would I recommend it to someone else? Eesh. I don't think so. And that's all you need to know.

Maybe next time.

102883,"Golden Wind (or Vento Aureo, but I will be calling it Golden Wind in this review) was an absolute journey of a series. This is my first anime review, so don't expect much. Obviously this contains big spoilers. TL;DR at the end. 
img220()

Characters:
I pretty much loved or liked every single character. Giorno was definitely the weakest Jojo and the most bland, but it doesn't mean he was bad. He was enjoyable at times and he's a smart ass too. Comparing Dio's personality and actons to Giorno's is actually interesting as well. The side characters 100% carried this. Mista is so great, the funniest guy. While his stand breaks all the stand rules, who cares right? We all love Sex Pistols. Bruno is super loveable and I'm very surprised he didn't die sooner. He's also my favorite character in this part :). Narancia is best boy. Abbacchio may be an asshole but i still like the guy. Fugo is a huge pussy, but at least he gave a little dose of reality on what people would actually do if they were in that position. All the villains were great, instead of pawns like Dio's followers, they actually had a dose of reality like Fugo, and fought for survival. Trish was really interesting, there's not really much I can say about her other than that she's one of the coolest female Jojo characters, (even though there aren't that many). Polnareff coming back made me SUPER happy. Polnareff wasn't my favorite Crusader but I sure as hell love the guy. He died a bit quick, but the Turtle bit really sold it. Doppio was super weird (in the good way). I was confused about him, but it worked. It was interesting. Last but not least for characters, Diavolo. Diavolo was a good main villain. Of course he isn't the best main villain, but there's no doubt he's a good one. He may be a big pussy, and pretty damn weak compared to Giorno, but he was pretty cool nonetheless. I would give the characters a solid 9.5/10
img220()

Plot:
Starting off with Koichi was an odd choice, but hey, who doesn't love Koichi? Rarely seeing Jotaro was a bit odd, since it was his idea to search for Dio's son. How Bruno sided with Giorno was kind of odd since him betraying the organization in a way that fast was pretty weird. Fast forward, the journey to return Trish to Diavolo was fun. It was nice seeing everyone's stands (while some of them are crazy OP). The villains during that arc were also fun like the villains on the boat attack scene. The mini arc with Bruno in Diavolo's...(hideout?) was great. Bruno really felt betrayed and angry at the same time and that emotion sells that mini arc. I don't know the name for this arc but all the episodes where they were going for Diavolo it was probably my favorite set of episodes. Doppio was really interesting and all the side characters got the most screen time in these episodes. Diavolo was pissing his pants every day. Finally, the final arc where it's the final showdown. When they all switched bodies i was pretty attatched because it gave us a funny scene with Mista and Trish. AND it saved Polnareff :). Diavolo was pretty weak compared to Giorno. Giorno was way too overpowered in this part but the Requiem stand ideas are really cool, and I hope they don't get forgotten. The plot deserves a 9/10 in my eyes.
img220()

Fights:
All the fights were great in my opinion. It doesn't matter if it was a character I didn't like or not, they were all great. The phenomenal animation makes it 10 times better. The stands in this part were really creative and weird as usual which made the fights enjoyable. 
My favorite fight from Golden Wind is Bruno and Mista vs Pesci and Prosciutto: Pesci was your classic wimpy, bubbly villain but he was loveable in my opinion. His stand was kind of stupid but opposed a threat surprisingly. Prosciutto's stand was interesting and my favorite part about this fight was Bruno zipping his whole body open. That was really cool to see, and that 'Arrivederci' just made me respect him so much more. Aside from my favorite fight, some fights can be stretched out a bit too far. Like some fights lasted a couple episodes which got a little repetitive, but it makes sense since the farther they went on their journey to face Diavolo, the harder the opponents they would face. Fights is easily a 9.5/10, and there's nothing that can change my mind about the fights in Golden Wind.
img220()

Deaths:
Like there wasn't already huge spoilers, if you're still hanging around, get your dumbass out of here. First off we got Abbacchio. For sure he was an asshole, but his death was still pretty sad. It wouldn't be that sad if Narancia wasn't crying for Giorno to fix Abbacchio. He really sells this scene. Next up we got Narancia. When he died I was pretty surprised. I knew he was too weak to survive but I really didn't think Araki would kill him off since Bruno kind of called it when he was going off to betray the organization. This death wasn't really sad in my opinion, but more surprising. Next we got Polnareff. Now even though he comes back as the turtle, he still died in his own body. I thought it was kind of fast and I didn't really like that until he came back as the turtle, so it was all fine in the end, but I would much prefer him alive in his own body at a good state. Next we got Bruno. This was the death I was really sad about. Giorno still lived up to his dream and to Bruno's will and defeated Diavolo. Bruno was the purest hero in my opinion. The deaths are a 7/10 for me, not very emotinal for most of them, just surprising or just a character we all didn't love (excluding Bruno of course).

As I said before, this animation is PHENOMONEL! Best animation in Jojo by far. Everything looks so clean and clear and more realistic than what it was for the parts 1, 2, and 4. Animation is easily a 10/10

Music:
Oh my god, the music is amazing. While Bloody Stream is my favorite Jojo Op, Fighting Gold and Traitors Requiem are really close, and I don't even know what I like better. The visuals are amazing as always, and the music is just unskippable. You really feel like you're in the anime when you're listening to them. The Ed's are also very good. Ed 1 (Freak'n You, I think is what it's called) is my favorite Ed. Ed 2 is also very good. Ed 1 is just so different it's hard to love. It doesn't even sound like an anime Ed and definitely doesn't sound like something from Jojo. But who cares. The OST's are also amazing. Giorno's theme sounds amazing and is so iconic. Diavolo's theme also gives you chills. Music is a definite 10/10, never disappoints.

TL;DR:
Golden Wind has its flaws here and there, but there's absolutely no doubt it's great, even amazing. Weakest Jojo character-wise, however, best side characters. Action is phenomenal, along with the animation and music. The plot can be a little iffy at times, but it's a damn fun time."
150672,"I started reading Oshi no Ko around 2 years ago but dropped it after a few chapters as I wasn't very interested. Not too long ago the anime came out and the first season just finished so I thought I'd share my opinion on it. It's gonna be a fairly short review and will include SPOILERS.



Starting off with what I liked:
The first episode was great, no doubt about that. It's pretty much an entire movie on its own with two completely different types of characters being reborn as the daughter / son of the idol Hoshino Ai which they both adored in their past lives. The premise is really original and interesting, the characters are all pretty unique and the ending definitely left me wanting more. I really liked Hoshino in particular as a character, seeing her try her best as both a mother and entertainer / idol and getting an insight into the whole industry, while also watching Aqua and Ruby growing up was really enjoyable. The art and animation are also above average. Some scenes definitely look better than others, but overall the show is really nice to look at. 

img420()



Now the things I didn't like:
To put things into perspective, I pretty much only really liked ep 1, 6 and 11. Everything in between just didn't seem interesting or important enough for me to truly care about and I'll get into why that is. Firstly, I just don't think the characters are that great. Aqua has pretty much no character development after ep 1, Kana is a super stereotypical tsundere and the rest, including Ruby just aren't that well written or have anything going for them to set them apart from the rest. 

Secondly, the humor. It's just not funny. I laughed maybe once or twice during the entire show and that's because it caught me off-guard (like Aqua suddenly starting to dance in the last episode). The rest is just incredibly stale anime humor that's been done 100 times before, or just really badly timed jokes that ruin the atmosphere. The fact that it's written by the same author as Kaguya-sama is really noticeable in some scenes, because as soon as he tries to write anything serious, he feels the need to put in some completely unnecessary joke for no reason. This also ties into my other complaint, as the serious parts of the show fail to have much of an impact on me because of that. 

It feels like Oshi No Ko occasionally just forgets what kind of show it's trying to be. On one hand it's about Aqua trying to get revenge on whoever killed his mother and on the other hand it's about Kana / Ruby finding their place in the entertainment business. And then somewhere in-between it's also a romance / love-triangle I don't even know... It's also just really melodramatic most of the time which creates this weird contrast between being a comedy- and a serious revenge anime. 



In the end I did enjoy some parts of Oshi No Ko and I do think it's an above average show, but I simply fail to see the hype around it. Maybe it's the fact that it has both male and female main characters which both sides can relate to or simply that there's just nothing better to watch currently, I genuinely have to idea."
128893,"First of all, a quick writer’s note, as I’m writing this, it is June 30th, and it’s late at night, and I’ll be heading to bed right after I write this. The final episode of Hell’s Paradise airs in around nine to ten hours, and I’m just starting on my review. I did this intentionally though, to imitate a MAPPA style of production, rushing and submitting the work just a bit before it’s due to see how poorly this review will turn out.

Studio MAPPA has been known for taking on big name action or shounen titles as of late, with the likes of Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack On Titan, Chainsaw Man, Vinland Saga, and now Hell’s Paradise. They've taken on so much that they have become a popular name amongst anime fans. While their shows generally look decent, it is clear that because they’ve taken on so much, their production schedule has been a literal hell, with very overworked staff, and poor working conditions. Of course, I’m sure many other studios experience these kinds of things too, but MAPPA has been brought into the limelight due to how many popular titles they’ve done recently. Clearly, Hell’s Paradise was not their favourite child, as this show looked considerably worse visually than their other shows.

But before we get to all the production things, let’s talk about the story. On paper, this looks like a somewhat generic action shounen, with a death convict in Gabimaru being tasked, along with the rest of the death row convicts to find the “Elixir of Life” on an island called Shinsekyo, in order to escape their death sentence. Obviously, the convicts fight amongst each other, as only one can have this elixir to evade death. This island looked very interesting and colourful, with some scary creatures around them, all around a very intriguing, perhaps a unique setting. However, what this anime fails at is the most important narrative technique, which is “Show, don’t tell”. Time and time again, we are told about what this environment is like, the religion aspects, the creatures, how the world works, but we don’t really get enough showing of the environment itself, either through simple background shots, or just cutting back on the expository dialogue. There is no need to spoon-feed the viewers every single narrative detail about what is going on, people can figure things out. There was solid potential in what the environment could bring us, but I wasn’t really invested due to the overly saturated dialogue.

The characters felt interesting at first, but slowly also devolved into being rather gimmicky or generic. Gabimaru is the typical protagonist who starts out cold but ends up warming up to people and becomes more kind. For the female characters, there is a sense of empowerment that they were trying to go for, especially with Sagiri looking to escape gender norms and become a samurai, instead of the “norms” that this anime instills upon women. While on its own this would be a cool concept, the fact that all the female characters were so sexualized, and somehow getting saved via princess carry, defying all logic of physics by the men just felt a bit hypocritical to the potential message the show was trying to convey. Furthermore, people died before we could even really have a chance to know them, and adding a sad backstory to try and make us feel emotions just felt like such a weak way for characterizing them. At least the backstories weren’t too saturated after the first few episodes. 

From a production standpoint, the show looks fine, but disappointing by MAPPA’s standards. Some of the fight scenes were genuinely very decent and tense, but the other moments of the show had this very weird filter where the characters didn’t really “fit in” with the background art. The compositing was awful at some points, and characters went off model a lot. It was clearly the product of rushed production, as most episodes were outsourced to between ten and twenty different anime studios and animation directors, which signalled how poor the production schedule was. It more or less just felt like MAPPA gathering up all their buddies to finish their homework just as the teacher was coming to collect it every week. This might feel a bit harsh and nitpicky, but if we’re comparing it to other MAPPA works, this is probably one of their worst productions, but from a wider perspective outside of MAPPA, the show looks average to fine visually.

Overall, there is decent entertainment value to be seen here, but it could have been so much better with more time spent on production, and more showing instead of telling. This will undoubtedly get more seasons, so I just hope the next time this show comes around, it’ll be a much improved product compared to what we got this time around. MAPPA, you just got to chill with the amount of projects you got."
18153,"The setting of Beyound the Boundary is really simple: There are monsters and guys that kill monsters. The comedy is created from the character traits of the cast: The protagonist really, really likes girls with glasses, the girl who tries to kill him is a shy girl with glasses. The best friend of the protagonist is really, really obsessed with his little sister, so they fantasize together about the little sister and what she would look like with glasses. This style of comedy is very simple, but at least not terrible. Beyond the boundary manages to at least write comedy that makes sense from what we know about the characters, for example when the poor girl with glasses sells pictures of her to a anonymous buyer with the initials of the protagonist.

But the comedy is not the main focus of the story. After episode 6, an episode that only consists of the friends fighting a monster that can be distracted by scantily dressed, singing girls, the story begins to speed up, but also gets worse to the end. That is the biggest problem of the show, it's not a bad show, but it is wasting its potential. The ending has a long emotional buildup, only to destroy the point of the whole fight and story in the last thirty seconds.

The characters are characters written for comedy. They have one or two defining character traits and have only little character development. We learn about their backstories and their motivations, but they never become really complex characters. That being said, the love for glasses of the protagonist is a funny idea, it's different to the normal love for little sisters or other questionalble likings, not that they don't exist in this show. The good thing about the characters is that they all are connected, no character is there for no real reason. 

One of the biggest selling points is certainly the amazing animation, the fighting scenes are fluid and nice to watch. It´s always nice if a bloodsword doesn´t look like a bloodsword, but like a sword made of strange dirt.

Sure, good animation alone can't save an otherwise bad show, but Beyond the Boundary is not a bad show, it's better than most shows I watched. It's just sad that there is so much wasted potential."
100182,"I've never liked sword art online, it doesn't have anything to draw me in. The only thing I liked about the franchise is the memes it spawned. I went into this installment with an open mind. It was worth the watch, I'm really excited for the next arc. Kirito was facing his biggest challenge yet, he's once again in a video game. The difference is the AI think just like real people, except they have no idea they are AI. They established their own land, rules and social norms. The big theme is the influence of a moral compass, even the antagonists were saying they aren't as bad as demons because they are just part of an hierarchy and system. Kirito became tied up into a personal and bigger than life vendetta.
Now the reason why I wanted to watch was the music and plot for Alicization. I still play the first opening to this DAY. It captures the feeling of adventure and suspense, you have a goal and you are excited yet nervous to achieve it. Kirito wasn't just some OP character destined to save this word just because there happens to be an enemy. He got to experience a whole life in this virtual world all while on the verge of death or being a vegetable. That's all I ever wanted from this series, stakes that actually peak my interests. The researchers are making this world to prove a point, what's the difference between AI and a person? You can give a robot the capacity to learn and feel, but just how far would people go for power and emotions?
I loved the fights, each character had a reason to fight and was affected by the laws of the land. Royalty believed they were untouchable gods and abused their privileges meanwhile everyone dealt with it. At first I didn't understand why no one tried to revolt or fight against the royal douches, which eventually boiled down to fighting the royalty is no different than fighting the system. Even within the royalty, there's class divisions and rankings.Everyone knew their place and was aware how much wiggle room they had. Despite all this several characters strives to be the change they seek regardless of the law and danger.
For once it didn't feel like just about kirito, we also had an amazing supporting cast who have their own goals. After finishing this anime, the biggest takeway I got was the fun should be about the journey and moments we have reaching there, not just about a unrelatable, annoying MC. It wasn't the best thing I've ever watched narrative wise, but I looked forward to every episode."
7054,"Very light spoilers ahead, almost spoiler-free. 

I tend to be very wary when it comes to the Shoujo genre due to the amount of clichés I'll be facing ahead of me. But it's alright, I do not mind a cliché as long as it's well executed.

This one was disastrous.

The characters: 1/10

I think the worst thing about the anime was its characters. Extremely horrendous, from the main characters to the very useless ones. Let's start with the main characters:

Takumi Usui: I think I should start making a list of my most hated characters, and I'm sure Usui will top that list. I have never seen such an atrocious character in my life like this before. If I had one word to describe Usui with, it will be: stalker.
Usui is a literal stalker that started following Ayuzawa everywhere she went. We don't see much about his character. We don't see him doing anything but stalking Ayuzawa. It's beyond me why every girl in the school worships him. They don't like him, they literally  worship  the dude. Every single person in the school worships him, let it be male or female. For no damn reason. Sure, he's good looking, but that's all. He's a cold, emotionless, expressionless character that rejects girls in the worst way possible. He does not to talk to anyone, has no friends, and does not do anything but stalk Ayuzawa. It seriously got creepy. He would even casually pat her head, half-hug her, or calls her 'his maid' or 'his' in front of people, despite her continuously telling him not to 'casually touch her.' He repeatedly makes her uncomfortable and tensed. I don't know about you, but if the girl I like does not like my presence, I wouldn't be around her 24/7. He went as far as pretending to be a stalker when there were rumours of stalkers targeting maids so 'she'd be ready.' That's the kind of a creep he is.

Misaki Ayuzawa: The demonic Class President who scares off boys and helps girls. As it's quite obvious in the synopsis, Misaki isn't your average girl. She's not so very feminine, an Aikido kickass, and a workaholic. She's a very cheesy character of the not-like-other-girls theme. But a character can only get so cliché. Misaki exceeded the limit. The anime wanted to show how much of an oh so strong independent woman it got so annoying. She's the top in academics, the top in sports, the Class President who handles all kinds of responsibilities and organises events. And she also has a part-time job as a maid in cafe. She's hardworking, determined, selfless, accepting, thoughtful, hot-headed and a tomboy. On top of that, she does not have a single breakdown. She's completely one dimensional, annoying, and boring. I think it's the worst version of a tsundere I have ever seen. A very forgettable character. If anything, she came off as a sadist who likes to scare boys, and a masochist who likes to be in pain.

The supporting characters: You shouldn't really expect any meaningful supporting characters when the main characters themselves are one dimensional, so here I am, repeating again, every single supporting character is a stupid, one dimensional airhead.
And seriously, what is WRONG with the whole stalker idea? Not only does Ayuzawa have a main stalker, she also has 3 other stalkers that go to her cafe every single day until they're penniless because Ayuzawa is 'kawaiiii', even though she was their enemy at the beginning and they hated her guts. It IS NOT OK to stare at a girl at your school every day at her part-time job.

The supporting characters can be distributed into 3 groups:

A. The stalkers: mentioned above.

B. The dumb airheads: all her coworkers at school and basically every other girl in the anime.

C. The worshippers: 
The worshippers are basically the rest of the school. We have:

1. 5 boys who look exactly the same, who worship Ayuzawa because of how smart she is and how much they want to be like her. (They also follow her everywhere in the school)
2. The rest of the school: Usui worshippers. Every time he opens his mouth, they fangirl and drool (Not literally) at his words. Like he's a god.


The story: 2/10
One point for the idea. It's your typical tough girl with an oh-I'm-not-like-other-girls theme, and your average hot boi that everyone is head over heels for while the only person who grabs his attention is the one who does not give a damn about him -- the tough girl. It's a very famous cliché especially in the Shoujo genre and if it can be done well, then it can be good. I think this version of it was the worst I have ever read/seen. The anime is mostly a very tedious Slice of Life about overused one dimensional characters. It's dragging, extremely boring, full of unnecessary details with a very shitty romance--if I dare call this creepy thing they had a romance. Nothing ever truly happens. Romance lovers should skip this anime as well, there's a very limited amount of 'romantic scenes', and a lot of awkward ones. (Though, to be fair, the final scene at the final episode was decent.)


The Art: 4/10
It was cringy. The characters are well-drawn but would alternate between a decent drawing and a crappy 5-year-old scribbles a lot.

The sound: 4/10
It was okay. The openings aren't very bad and the voices are kind of decent, but the music was a bit underwhelming. Easily forgettable.

Enjoyment: below zero.
Nothing about the anime was enjoyable, there is not a single thing you can find even slightly amusing and not a single character you can root for. It was torturous.

Overall: 2/10 Appalling. A very terrible experience."
137822,"Blue Lock is a sports series where some of your normal sports anime tropes aren’t present, especially the “power of friendship”, which is good in a way, yet it made it so edgy to the point where sometimes, it’s quite laughable. If you’re someone who likes sports anime for its realism, you won’t get that here at all. It’s definitely quite epic at times, and there are a couple unpredictable moments mixed in there, but I feel like the appeal of sports anime in general is to have a good mix of humour and drama, while being very character driven and relatable to the viewer at times. With how gimmicky the characters tend to be, it was hard to resonate with any of them, or the plot in general. For me, it was mostly just a popcorn shounen show, that didn’t leave me with much to take away other than some hype moments.

The premise is quite interesting, as the Japan Football Union created this project called Blue Lock, who would select three hundred U-18 strikers into their program, and pit them against each other to rise to the top. In a sense, I thought it’d be like a death game anime, where if you fail, you would die, and this show sort of has that identity of being that way, as expulsion from Blue Lock is virtually the end of one’s pro soccer aspirations. 

While soccer is generally considered a team sport, Blue Lock separates itself from other sports anime, as it focuses on selfishness and ego, rather than trying to build teamwork and good relations with teammates. While that seems like a novel concept, to me, it has a major drawback. Since character development is one of the most important things in sports shows in my opinion, the lack of team building and cohesion makes it so the characters aren’t that memorable, and they’re more gimmicky than anything, with each character having their unique part of the game that they’re good at, whether it’s vision of the field, speed, shooting, or handling the ball well. The character interactions for the most part, don’t tell us much about each character besides their surface personality. In fact, most of the characters don’t even develop properly, and have zero backstory to them. Without meaningful character interactions, it was difficult for me to really empathize with any of the characters. Their aspirations beyond being the “best striker” is all they want to do, so most of them have nothing that separates them from others aside from their gimmick.

The animation and art in Blue Lock is not all that great in my opinion. Some of the movement during the games was very stiff, especially during the second cour of the show, where I think the studio just rushed through production. The CGI was quite ugly at times when it was shown as well. As for the character designs, they scream like edgy teens. The eyes were extremely cringy to me especially, but I suppose the edginess is what makes this show special to people.

The music was middling as well, as the soundtrack wasn’t all that standout. The first ED and second OP were good, but the OP and ED by Unison Square Garden just wasn’t all that impressive. 

As for my enjoyment throughout the show, I thought it had quite an unimpressive first half, and then the story improved towards the end of the series. It’s unfortunate that the animation degraded as the second half went along, or else I would have had a more favourable impression of this show overall.

Overall, Blue Lock is a fine show, despite all my criticisms. It can be quite exhilarating to watch sometimes, in the big moments, but the edgy dialogue and humour wasn’t all that great. The characters are quite weak overall, while the story was up and down. One thing I found funny was that the 2022 World Cup happened during the airing of this anime, because I felt it unintentionally promoted this show a bit more.

The main message here is just don’t expect a realistic portrayal of sports, you won’t get it in this anime. Otherwise, maybe try it out, but I can’t promise great things from this show."
114236,"A good sequel and I enjoyed most of it but some of the fight scenes were dull. Also, I don't rate my reviews based on enjoyment because am writing it for other people to know if they want to watch it so the score I give on a review will differ from my list. 
No Spoilers


I genuinely think that Fire Force's plot is pretty good and unique and since I didn't make a review of the first season, I'll quickly go over the plot. Basically, people around Tokyo combust and turn into Infernal's which is where the Fire Force come in, they put them to rest by fighting them... with fire, so they fight fire with fire. Then of course there's the main bad guys which I won't get into because that's spoilers. One thing that was terrible about the second season was that they underpowered Shinra he either he would lose in a fight or the bad guy will leave. Also, the fan service is annoying.
img(&ehk=3cQNC2kOZrGLHiFp6cgbFwV9S4YIoonYPbpGRCFuTgc%3d)


The animation is pretty good and most fight scenes are usually badass because of the animation but still somehow dull. Since literally half the time in the anime there's fire they had to draw it really well and I think they really did the job well.
img(&ehk=uDp4cdcqO78V%2fcp%2b1%2f%2f2wlWKuVcl7Y1M3O7%2bRrMv5IY%3d)


The characters in the second season definitely had more depth to them because that what season two really mainly focused about but only Arthur had a proper backstory. But throughout the anime the only person with notable character development is Isis but I can't really say how because spoilers. Also in the second season Shinra is way more underpowered and like I said before he barely won any fights. Then of course we have Tamaki who just stands by cries and strips from time to time. She only had one badass scene all the way in the end.
img(v&ehk=L6HH57fMuG%2bXxN%2bqn0rZ3Z8GmcuOKjzPZZvYLmAJFFQ%3d)


A pretty good sequel that any Fire Force fan would like or any person who enjoyed Fire Force since it's almost just like the first season but slightly watered down. The animation is great for all the badass fights and so is the music and the characters are all pretty important (other than Tamaki) to keep progressing the story.

20661,"This anime had a good storyline, the whole soundtrack was completely and beautiful. The soundtrack is personally my favorite soundtrack out of any anime I have ever watched. One bad thing about the show was the English in it, for some reason they had German voice actors instead of English voice actors to voice the Americans. I obviously speak English and I could barely understand the words they were speaking half the time. I believe this anime could have been expanded and more in depth but even so, it was a masterpiece. It is one of those anime's that you will remember forever. You should definitely watch it if you haven't already.

Characters
The characters are developed very well and you begin to become emotionally attached to each one. You learn the backstory to pretty much every character which aids in making you emotionally attached to them. Personally my favorite character is Nine, as for his and Twelves' wit adds a lot to the series. I sorta wish that we could have learned a little more about the main character. 

Plot / Storyline
The storyline was a genius idea in showing the corruption of the government, this series could have easily had 3+ seasons but they decided to keep it short because it was already a masterpiece as it was. I personally loved the plot and the idea of this anime but I wish it would have been a little bit longer. At the very beginning of this series it seems as if the anime is going to be an anime about terrorism but trust me, it has much more to it even though terror is in the name. Every action and event that occurs has a reason in the end. I also enjoyed the art-style that this series had, it was very beautiful and different from the normal shows I watch.

Soundtrack
The soundtrack to this series is perfect. I can pick any song from the soundtrack and I would love it, each song went so perfect with each scene it was played with. You can definitely tell that they put thought and effort behind the song choice. Personally this anime has the, in my opinion, the best soundtrack out of any anime I have seen so far. I can put the soundtrack on in the background and sit back and it would relax me."
8074,"Highschool of the Dead is an anime that in my opinion can be extremely enjoyable if you watch it with the right mindset. No it doesn't have a great story, the characters aren't anything you haven't seen before either, but what it does deliver are some great fights, music and overall atmosphere and that's what you should be expecting going into this show.



Art & Animation:
This show is surprisingly well animated and the art is pretty great as well, which isn't all that common for a harem anime. A lot of scenes honestly look incredible with fluid animation and direction, especially the fights and I only found out it was made by MADHOUSE after my 5th re-watch or so, which definitely explains why the visuals are so good. 





Characters: 
As I said before, the characters aren't anything special, but they are pretty well written considering that (let's be real) they were probably more of an afterthought and they actually get shit done. Every character, yes even the MC, has an actual personality that even somewhat evolves throughout the story. Unfortunately the anime will never get finished so some characters don't get developed as much as others but I'd say that isn't too much of an issue as everyone still has fairly similar screen-time.


img470()



Story:
The story is fairly simple and about as complex as you'd expect. All of a sudden a zombie apocalypse breaks out and they're trying to survive and find their family. It's a pretty generic zombie plot but that's one of the reasons I like it so much, it's not trying to re-invent the wheel and the anime medium is lacking in the zombie department anyway. Occasionally some characters get their own short arcs here and there with a little flashback or something to develop them further, which is a nice way to change up the pacing a little from the pretty mindless gore and fighting (which is still fun don't get me wrong). One unique thing that comes to mind is how the zombies are completely blind and only respond to sound which does set this show's zombies slightly apart from others' and makes for some unique scenarios.





Sound:
The music is probably one of the best parts about the show, especially the opening which is one of my favorite songs of all time. It always fits the scenes and really adds to the atmosphere, it really never feels out of place. It also has a unique ending song for every episode which is quite uncommon and the only other anime I can think of that does the same is Chainsaw Man. The english dub is also really funny and this is one of the few shows where I'd actually recommend the dub over the sub.




Summary:
There isn't really much else to say so why do I like this show so much and why did I watch it 7 times? It's mindless fun that's really all there is to it. A simple story, fun characters, great visuals, atmosphere and music just make for a really fun show. Highschool of the dead is an anime that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't, but it manages to be entertaining with it's stupidity and simplicity while getting the basics of what makes a zombie show fun just right. If you wanna watch something that doesn't require too much of your attention while also being entertaining, this is it, but if you're looking for a deep, meaningful story with impactful scenes and character development, you're obviously in the wrong place."
20799,"This review contains major spoilers for the second half of Stardust Crusaders
[ img20() ](https://anilist.co/review/12122)

[ img20() ](https://anilist.co/review/13440)

img520()
Hello and welcome back to my review series on JoJo's Bizarre Adventure! Last time, I delved into the first half of Stardust Crusaders. While the show wasn't perfect, the camaraderie between the main characters, the colorful cast of villains, the imaginative fights, and the highlighted adventure aspect all helped to make Stardust Crusaders my favorite JoJo part thus far. But Stardust Crusaders is only half the story. For its anime adaption, David Production split the part into two halves. Simply titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, the first half chronicles the Stardust Crusaders' long journey to Egypt in order to reach DIO. The second half,Battle in Egypt, follows the group traveling two Cairo, battling DIO's last remaining henchmen on their way to him. 

Battle in Egypt is an amazing continuation and conclusion to a great show. Battle in Egypt doesn’t see too many notable changes to the formula. In fact, it’s counterintuitive to think of this as a second season. It’s just another set of episodes of the same show. For the most part, praises I gave the first half simply grow in intensity, and the minor gripes that I have become a bit more major. But make no mistake, there are a few new tricks up Battle in Egypt's sleeve and the things that return are still great. Battle in Egypt didn't show me much of anything new, but it didn't really need to. Battle in the Egypt solidified Part 3 as my favorite part so far. 

img520()

Beginning a bit small, the first thing you'll notice about Battle in Egypt is the change in OP and ED, with ""STAND PROUD"" being replaced with ""[JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku end of THE WORLD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NQn4Rg9Uo)"" and ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" being replaced with ""[Last Train Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG7jKUHsLfY)."" As someone who wasn't at all a fan of ""STAND PROUD"", it shouldn't come as a surprise that I was open to the change. What does come as a surprise to me was the fact that this may be my favorite JoJo OP thus far. I tried skipping at first, still missing ""BLOODY STREAM"" and ""Sono Chi No Sadame,"" but “end of The WORLD” is the type of OP you realize that you can't hate despite your best efforts. The quiet singing at the beginning sets up a feeling of dread before giving way to boisterous strings and guitars. It's really hard to not like this song when at the end of it, all the singers shout ""ORAORAORA"" to emulate Star Platinum's iconic battlecry; it's so much fun. And the song really epitomizes Battle in Egypt as the end of a saga. The song opens with images of Jonathan, DIO, Joseph, and Jotaro, tying them all together. Not to mention, each of the three former OP singers, TOMMY, Coda, and JIN form the group JO☆STARS to perform the song, leading to very sonically satisfying music via vocal diversity. The opening deserves a rewatch after finishing the show, as it contains a lot of foreshadowing of events. The craziest thing about “end of THE WORLD”  is that, during the final two episodes, DIO has a surprise appearance where he uses The World to interfere with the opening sequence and it blew my fucking mind. Last Train Home is a song I knew and loved prior to JoJo. With its chill, soothing sitars, it’s the perfect song to wind down tense cliffhangers. Like the opening, the ending sequence also features foreshadowing and after Stardust Crusader's final episode, the song becomes very bittersweet. Beautiful, to be sure, but bittersweet, all the same. I'm not sure I can listen to it the same way again. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the two hilarious, catchy special EDs, which play during the episodes featuring the [Oingo Boingo Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhZKRb25s) and the [Boingo Hol Horse team-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIDrA26laA). The rest of the OST largely remains the same, thus, is still quite good. Some notable tracks are [Setting Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlgRXAGonLg), [Space of a Lone God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5Vm86dD3n0), [Awakening Darkness of The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qJrFqzrgU4), and [Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLmIVDR5jyo).

The Stand users are even better here. They're all quite memorable and threatening with each sporting unique skillsets that force the Crusaders to think on their toes in order to defeat them. I think the non-DIO highlights are the battles against the D'arby brothers. D'arby the Elder is a professional gambler and cheat while D'arby the Younger is a Gamer™. When we're introduced to them, their creepiness and high skills are displayed thanks to the Elder's collection of his bested opponent's souls trapped in coins and the Younger's collection of defeated souls trapped in eerily-animated dolls. Forced to fight on the brothers' terms, the group (i.e. Jotaro) can't just punch their way to victory. This makes for the most creative fights in the series; in terms of logic used, it's actually more sound than that of the final battle. It's notable how tense these fights get without a single punch being thrown.

img520()

Speaking of tense, it's really a testament to how well this series is crafted, how invested I got considering the fact that I knew exactly how DIO's Stand, the World, worked. You see, the mechanics of DIO's stand are a bit of a mystery, and finding out what it actually does is a big part of the final arc wherein the Crusaders Jotaro dukes it out with DIO. Due to the prevalence of [JoJo memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ePWNmLP0Z0), I already knew that The World had the power to stop time. I was surprised to find out that this really didn't impede my enjoyment of the anime at all. While I knew how his powers worked, I was blissfully anywhere of how the fight would shake out.

In my last review, I detailed how I was okay with Avdol's fake-out death since I knew that main characters can die in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. As if to prove it, the bodies really hit the floor during this half of Stardust Crusaders. Thanks to DIO and his right-hand man, [Vanilla Ice](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible) (and his Stand, [Cream](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun)), more than half of the Stardust Crusaders are wiped out by the end of the show. The ball really gets rolling with Avdol's death, which is quite shocking in its suddenness. One moment, everything's fine, then the next Avdol is pushing Polnareff from some unseen foe before his body is sucked into another dimension thanks to Cream's powers. As they fall to the ground, Avdol’s arms are the only proof that he ever existed. You might hold onto the hope that Avdol somehow survived, that he'll be able to return from whatever dimension he's been sent to. But in the pit of your stomach, you know it's unlikely; Araki doesn't seem like he'd employ a double fakeout. After the fight is won, we're treated to narration (used prior to comedically state that an enemy has ""retired"") confirming that Avdol has, in fact, died. Kakyoin takes a bit longer to die, but his fatal wound comes no less suddenly — a brutal punch through his gut courtesy of DIO. As Kakyoin has seemingly ensured that DIO would be unable to attack him, this death comes even more as a shock and will confound viewers who haven't been spoiled as to the nature of DIO's Stand. Stardust Crusaders is easily the saddest, most emotional part so far due to the deaths of these characters. It's not only enough that we've come to know and love them but, as I outlined before, we really buy their comradery. Stardust Crusaders can achieve sentimentality without dipping into hokiness. I'll admit that the framing of Kakyoin's death begins to veer into the overwrought territory — we get his backstory during the episode where he dies, which feels a bit manufactured, especially as it could have easily been added a few episodes prior where Kakyoin is the focus character. An example of sentimentality done beautifully right is the scene in which Iggy and Avdol's spirits watch over Polnareff before they ascend to heaven. The ending with Holly knowing that her son and father are coming home is also well-done. 

img520()

On the other side of the spectrum, both halves of Stardust Crusaders are quite funny. I've heard some state that Battle Tendency is funnier, but I have to disagree. Even when an arc is serious, it will often end in a humorous way such as with Judgement and Death 13. In this half, after the tense fight with Anubis, the announcer states that it ""retires"" after a drawn-out gag wherein the Stand keeps hoping, in vain, that something will stop its trajectory towards the Nile river. The equivalent of ""badumtiss,"" ""chan-chan"" is used several times in the series. The comedy is most notable in the situations Joseph and Avdol get into thanks to Mariah's magnetism as well as the episodes involving Boingo. The show is positively a riot and it's really impressive that it manages to blend tension and comedy so well — sometimes in the same scene, such as D'arby the Elder freaking out over Jotaro raising the stakes of their bet.

img520()

However, as I alluded to before, not all is well in Egypt. A lot of my gripes, unfortunately, remain. This makes sense, because, again, this is essentially just one continuous show, but that really doesn't do much to temper my annoyance.

First of all, the emphasis on Jotaro remains in full effect here. If Jotaro is present, then he will invariably be the one to save the day even if other characters could logically shine. The only way for someone not named Jotaro to defeat the enemy stand is to not have him be present. As much as I enjoyed the arc, I think D'arby the Gambler is a pretty egregious example of this. D'Arby's a gambler, so there's not much reason that Joseph couldn't have been the one to beat him, since the conflict doesn't rely on physical strength. Hell, it's been noted by fans that Joseph shouldn't have lost the game involving dropping coins into the drink since Hamon has been shown to be able to manipulate liquids. With Jotaro and Avdol the only Crusaders remaining, I thought it would finally be Avdol's time to shine before this possibility was promptly shot down by Avdol stating that he's too noble to gamble. When D'Arby the Younger is fought, Kakyoin is revealed to be a Gamer™ whilst Jotaro is implied to not have played video games before. Naturally, Kakyoin loses while Jotaro is the one to win to show how smart he is. It's really annoying because it can start to feel like this is less about a team of allies and more about showing how cool Jotaro is, with everyone else there just to make him look better. Polnareff also gets the spotlight a lot, but it feels a bit different since he's squarely characterized as an underdog and he bumbles into his fights. Avdol is probably the biggest victim of underutilization as he never really has time to shine by himself. A part of this boils down to Araki considering fire too OP for a protagonist Stand.

img520()

I stand by Stardust Crusaders being great, but having seen the whole thing through, I can acknowledge some of the growing pains fans talk about. From what I can tell — Araki had trouble balancing a large group of heroes. The interactions between them all are great, but in addition to some spotlight hogging, there's not much synergy in terms of fights. The powers of the heroes are seldom used in tandem in order to defeat their foes. There certainly are examples of team-ups like Joseph and Avdol working together to defeat Mariah and Joseph and Jotaro outwitting D'arby the Younger, but these moments are few and far between. And again, there’s never a moment when the six Stardust Crusaders are fighting as one, which feels like a missed opportunity.

Nothing more exemplifies the dichotomy of Stardust Crusaders, its strengths and witnesses, than the fight against DIO during his eponymous arc, DIO's World.

img520(v)

The fight against DIO is, in a word, messy. The more I think about it, the more I find things wrong with it. First and foremost, the underuse of the Crusaders as a whole, a problem the entire Part struggled with, isn’t rectified here. There's still a heavy emphasis on Jotaro to the detriment of the other characters. Instead of them all fighting him at once, the Stardust Crusaders ""fight"" DIO one by one. I put ""fight"" in scare quotes because the remaining Stardust Crusaders not-named-Jotaro simply get bodied by DIO. I know that the show states that the group would have most likely lost if they attacked him all at once, but I still can't help but feel disappointed that Araki went with the formula that he stuck to since the beginning of Stardust Crusaders. And yeah, on paper, DIO was defeated through The Power of Teamwork™: in his dying breath, Kakyoin revealed the secret of The World, Joseph warned Jotaro of the ability right before being fatally stabbed by DIO, and Polnareff was able to distract DIO long enough to save Jotaro's life. On paper, this shows how great of a team they are, but in practice, this is really just another example of this being Jotaro's show. The team feels a bit hollow when their contribution is getting merc'd all so Jotaro can get a one-liner in the end.

To quote a terrible movie, in regards to The World and Star Platinum's sudden, flashy movement abilities, I have to ask ""they fly now?"" To which Araki responds, ""they fly now.""

img520(

And Star Platinum's powers, good God, Star Platinum's powers. As stated before, DIO's The World has the power to stop time. In most works of fiction, the power to control time in any way, shape, or form is a devastating ability, and Stardust Crusaders is no exception. Despite only having six seconds of stopped time, DIO can do a lot with that time and it's all the Stardust Crusaders (i.e. Jotaro) can do just to survive his onslaught. How in the world will Jotaro beat him, you may ask. Surely there's some weakness that Jotaro can exploit? Nah, Jotaro just gets the ability to stop time, too. You see, it's revealed that Star Platinum and The World being the same type of Stand, an inference made by the fact that the two of them both [punch really fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GtWoCt3UE). Is this foreshadowed or hinted at at all? Sure isn't, save for a brief frame of the OP wherein Jotaro moves his [finger while time is stopped](), but as I said before, this is really only something you'd notice in hindsight (and it wouldn't have been in the manga where this story originated). I really don't buy Star Platinum's rapid fisticuffs being proof of time-stopping capabilities because it happens in real-time and The World's use of it is framed as independent from its time stop.

I think it's mainly hearsay, but I've heard that Araki intended DIO to have the power of all of the other Major Arcana stands. Since time stopping would have had to come from somewhere, the group would have then been able to deduce the power originated from Star Platinum. Without much foreshadowing/hinting, it still wouldn't have been great, but it would have at least been much more solid of a reveal. The point is moot, of course. It's said that Araki thought this would make DIO too powerful, so either way, this is nothing more than a neat trivia point.

img520()

In short, DIO's defeat came in the form of an asspull, a deus ex machina. Oh sure, DIO's hubris played a part of it, but without Star Platinum inexplicably being revealed as being ""the same type of stand"" as The World, Jotaro would have taken the L. Araki wrote himself in a corner for the second time now. It's clear that, at least as of Star Dust Crusaders, Araki struggles to write compelling conclusions to his climactic fights because of how powerful he makes his antagonists. It's really hard to logically beat ""The Ultimate Lifeform"" or someone who can stop time. Kars' fight wasn't great — what, with him being able to survive the one thing that could have logically and creatively killed him, and him only being defeated because Joseph's body ""moved on its own"" — but at least it wasn't hyped up the way DIO's fight was. The frustrating thing is that DIO's fight didn't need to be this way. Araki could have easily given him some weakness for Jotaro to exploit such as over-utilization of the world tiring him out.

img520()

Those are just the main things; the more I think about it, the more little nitpicks I can think up. I mean, you're telling me that the guy who survived as a disembodied head was completely destroyed because of a punch? Really?

But what a glorious punch that was.

Because at the end of the day, I acknowledge that the fight with DIO is far from perfect. But I ultimately don't care, because goddamn if it isn't cool. For the better part of forty-eight episodes, Stardust Crusaders was hyping up an epic rematch with DIO, always obscuring his face, always showing his immense influence through his sheer charisma. And what can I say except that DIO's World delivered? The fight might not have been that satisfying, narratively, but I was promised an epic showdown and I wasn't left hanging. DIO was sorely missed and I was very happy that his cockiness and hamminess came back in full force. It's the type of fight that annoys me if I think about it but is a damn good time if I just let it wash over me, enjoy the spectacle of it all. Does flying make sense? Not really. Is it cool? Hell yes. Would it have been more impactful if somehow Jonathan's body was able to stop DIO from hurting his descendant? Yeah. Is the fight still good without it? Yes. The Stardust Crusaders got bodied in the service of a one-liner? Pretty much. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a great one-liner.

[Rule of cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) can hold sway over my opinions more than I'd care to admit. The fight shouldn't work and I should be annoyed about it. I am annoyed if I think about it, but then I can't help but smile.

It's like my brain is going

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVOJg23QZ0)

but my heart is going

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqFm7qfRQk)

That's probably a good summary as any of my feelings towards Stardust Crusaders. I might have thought it was nigh-perfect come the end of the first half. The second half has made it pretty clear that it has some notable problems. But at the end of the day, those problems don’t impede my enjoyment too much. It's too cool, it's too funny, too tense, too heartfelt to stay mad at for too long. I'm still happy to say that this is my favorite JoJo Part thus far and I feel it deserve its notoriety, deserves being as iconic as it is. I'm excited yet nervous as I approach Part 4, Diamond is Unbreakable. I'm nervous because people often describe it as being completely different from Stardust Crusaders and I'm afraid the show will do away with everything I loved about this one. I'm excited because it could improve upon what I didn't enjoy as much. Though I'm moreso excited because I'm sure I'll have a good time, regardless. It is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, after all.

Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a romantic-comedy anime about finding one’s self-worth and the struggle it takes to accomplish what one wants. The main character, Sorata Kanda, is sent to Sakurasou, a run-down dormitory, after being kicked out of the regular dorms for housing cats. At first, he wants to leave Sakurasou, seeing himself as the only normal person in the building, but slowly changes his mind after Mashiro Shiina arrives. Shiina, not knowing how to take care of herself, is dependent on Kanda’s support. Through taking care of Shiina, Kanda finds a reason to stay at Sakurasou and to peruse the goal of making a game, even if he has no natural talents or skills related to game making.

The anime revolves around Sakurasou, a dormitory where ‘problem children’ are sent to. Kanda originally wanted to leave because of the reputation it has. The students that reside in Sakurasou are all eccentric in their own way, from the level of talent they have to the way they live. 

img1000()

Being the main hub of most of the activity in the anime, Sakurasou is where all of the main characters live. At the beginning of the anime, Kanda, Misaki Kamiigusa (a very energetic girl who’s very good at drawing), Jin Mitaka (a ‘playboy’ who writes scripts to Misaki’s anime(s)), and Ryuunosuke Akasaka (a shut-in who’s a programming expert) are housed at Sakurasou. Shiina arrives in the first episode, and Nanami Aoyama (Kanda’s friend and aspiring voice actor) moves in later. These six are the only ones that live in Sakurasou (besides Chihiro-sensei, the dorm teacher of Sakurasou).

Being a romantic-comedy themed anime, the relationships that form in-between the main characters are the main draw to the show. From the get-go, Misaki’s love for Jin is shown, although Jin deliberately ignores her confessions. Kanda and Shiina also form a close relationship, mainly due to Kanda being the only one that is willing to perform ‘Mashiro Duty’, or take care of her every need. The pairings in the show can be convoluted and frustrating at times, but not to the degree to which it takes away from the show; it just shows the character’s flawed process of thought.

img1000()

More than a rom-com, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is also about the concept of ‘hard work’ against ‘natural talent’. This is mainly shown through Kanda and Shiina. While Shiina is a prodigy in the art world and is naturally good at painting and drawing, Kanda has to bust his ass making a game proposal just to have a chance of getting it to pass the first round of a game creation contest. Even if she doesn’t recognize it, Shiina is miles ahead of Kanda when it comes to raw talent. The main reason why I like this anime is because of how it shows this dilemma. Kanda is frustrated that Shiina can have the natural talent to excel at anything related to the art world, while he has no talent and has to get her help just to increase his chances of winning the competition. Does Kanda give up and wallow in his misery, or does he get more self-determined and motivated to work even harder next time? 

Kanda isn’t the only character that has to deal with failure; Nanami also has to take two years of demanding voice acting classes just to get a chance to become one, which she has to take along with having multiple part-time jobs. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo shows the struggles of average people like Kanda and Nanami, who have to give 110% to try to accomplish their dreams, while in comparison to Shiina, who is an artistic genius that’s already at the top of the art world.

img1000()

While I’m giving Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo a high score, the anime was just average for the first third of its run. If you can get past that, then you’ll enjoy the other two-thirds, which are where it gets great.

Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is one of the better ‘rom-com’ anime, more than likely because there’s way more to it than the main character’s prospects of love. The concepts of natural talent and hard work are as prevalent as the rom-com elements in the anime. Sakurasou as a space for all of the main characters to interact and chase their dreams is also vital to the story. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo isn’t only good because it pulls off ‘rom-com’ decently, but also because it shows actual challenges relatable to all of us, without falling into clichés (most of the time). Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is definitely worth a watch."

Finally arrived the time to comment on the anime and the experience that the adaptation of 86 gave me. When I finished reading volume 1 of the novel I was wondering if the ""story"" could go beyond that, in this case an anime adaptation ..

img1000()

When they announced the anime I was very euphoric and extremely happy with the announcement, but after some doubts in my mind and if it would be something as incredible as Light Novel.

As everyone knows, adaptations on the same level or even better than the original material is a very rare case of whether currently in the industry, I may be mistaken to say that 86 is the best adaptation of recent times. A lot of adaptations usually have between 11-13 episodes and some end up adapting an absurd amount of volumes in just a few episodes. As an example: Re:Zero that suffered some cuts in relation to the novel, but it is still a very good adaptation.

Nowadays people have come to be quite critical of Manga/Novel adaptations. Imagine you seeing your favorite work being adapted in a way that does not follow the same tracks as the original material this is sad to see. But everyone dumb knows that the changes always made will be in relation to a Novel/ Manga, the changes that can sometimes be ruined or pleasant. 

But in the case of 86 it is something that deserves all the praise and I am not saying this just because I am a long-time fan of the work, I say this because we are blessed with a studio that took all possible care for the adaptation from 86 would become what we are seeing this season. 

img1000()

The scenarios presented in this first part were a little different from what I imagined when I read the novel, but I think they hit the nail on virtually everything. In the novel, the base of the Eighty-Six was something that looked like a place totally similar to a concentration camp, but here in the anime it was something totally different.

img1000()
The CGI was one of my big concerns and not to mention that A-1 pictures had never done anything like that and it turned out they got the CGI and the action parts right. It's amazing how a soundtrack makes such a difference in an anime. I think the only composer who could work on the part of the soundtrack this guy was Sawano.

I confess that I was a little worried when they announced that A-1 Pictures would adapt 86 and I think everyone was left with the receipt that a novel would not be so well adapted, when it changed the first promotional image of the anime it was worrying and thankfully that they adjusted it like things like character designs.

When I read that the author of [86] supervised all the storyboards for each episode, I was even more relieved and that may have been one of the great factors of the anime being incredible.

I wonder if another studio had taken 86 to adapt and I wonder if it would be something at that same level, well .. although I had some doubts when it was announced that A1- Pictures would adapt, but I didn't think it would be something at that absurd level. I saw a lot of people complaining about the original partrs that were implemented in the anime and that they didn't have in the novel. Sometimes implementing new things in works can be good or bad, but as volume 1 of the novel leaves something to be desired, the anime corrected and not to mention that it was really good.

img1000()

It's really amazing how the anime made me have a greater appreciation for the secondary characters and that's one of the things I don't like very much about the novel, we have Daya's death which in the novel is only mentioned in a few volumes farther ahead. It was fantastic to see that even the very important characters had a bit of prominence and that's something that added a lot to the plot."
11771,"I originally watched the first season while it was simulcasting, and I recalled having an excellent time with it. Unfortunately, due to my ADHD and life just becoming super hectic, I never finished the series in its entirety. So, I made the decision to begin re-watching the first two seasons with the intent of finishing-up the entire serial this time around. While watching it, I noticed many little details about the show that blew my mind because it occurred to me that Kuroko’s Basketball is an homage to the beautiful art of Kabuki theatre. Hell, it’s even in the title with the name “Kuroko.”

Kuroko’s Basketball is about two freshmen at Seirin High School who have been newly recruited into the basketball club who are determined to prove that they aren’t just your average-Joe b-ball players. There’s Taiga Kagami, a guy with tons of raw talent who’s recently returned from the United States, and then there is Tetsuya Kuroko, a boy who is about as basic and average as you can possibly get, which gives him an edge during basketball games. The series follows them as they strive to be the best Japanese high school basketball team around, which means going head-to-head with nation’s most-talented group of players, known only as the Generation of Miracles, or players attributed to having almost God-like playing powers.

Many years ago, I remember studying Kabuki Theatre in quite a bit of depth because I love it so much, not only as a form of artistic expression, but also as a major influential aspect of Japanese culture, and its importance historically as well. My best friend, who is a Japanese person living in Japan, majored in the study of Kabuki and we have some of the best conversations about how Kabuki has influenced Japanese culture and its entertainment scene in ways that are so subtle that if you didn’t know what to look for, it’d be quite easy to miss the references and minute connections. Of course, this anime was a recent part of that discussion. As I sat there binge-watching Kuroko’s Basketball, it all came flooding back to me and I was astonished. It helped me appreciate and respect the series from a brand-new perspective.

For people who may not know what Kabuki is, please allow me to briefly go over it. Kabuki is a classical Japanese dance-drama performing art. It’s mostly known for its exquisitely stylised execution of dramatic acting and for the remarkably intricate make-up that adorns most of the performers. Every part of Kabuki is essentially grandiose and a statement in and of itself, which is exhibited throughout Kuroko’s Basketball in numerous ways, all starting with the most vital element of Kabuki—a lesser known one—that is called the kuroko, or sometimes regarded as kurogo.

The kuroko is an individual who assists actors onstage, usually adorned in all black to be invisible to everyone around them. These individuals usually have many tasks that they charged with, but their fundamental duty is to help the actors with playing their respective roles. They will enter the stage unnoticed and keep entirely to themselves—being utterly inconspicuous—while doing their work. In most cases, it’s highly imperative for the actors and the kuroko to maintain a delicately timed balance in order to keep up with the flow of the performance, or play, without any disruptions whatsoever. So, in its most simplified form, a kuroko is an underdog whose sole presence is invaluable to the successful execution of Kabuki performances. Hmm… sounds like someone in an anime I watched recently. Don’t you think?

Culturally, Kabuki performances tend to be laced with multiple meanings. There is a lot of dialogue and commentary about being superior, oft times in a subtler scale, and pertain to dramatic references of certain parts of history, depending on the specific type of Kabuki performance, which I won’t go into detail because the specifics aren’t too relevant to my basic point here.

In Kuroko’s Basketball, we have characters who are always throwing out puns and phrases swathed in double entendres. The wordplay consists of commentary and dialogue about being the superior player or getting sensationally excited for “worthy” competitions—all of it just dripping in innuendo, and if you pay close attention, you’ll notice that most of it begins with or revolves around Kuroko Tetsuya (at the very least his presence).

The secret to Kuroko’s Basketball’s charm, and even the intermittently ambiguous humour, is how the story uses basketball to shine a spotlight on something from Japanese culture that is rather unique to the country; something not many people know about, either they’ve never heard of it, or they don’t comprehend it with much depth. The main character’s name is the first—and most obvious—clue to this revelation. Kuroko is 100% an embodiment of his name. Even though he is the protagonist, the invaluable member that holds the series together, the narrative isn’t truly about him at all. It’s about the other performers, or in this case the players, and the issues they all have as individuals. Kuroko is simply there to assist everyone, whether to become a successful arse-kicking player, or to overcome their unique bullshit so that they can be better people. He helps them fulfil their individually assigned roles to their perfection.

Aomine Daiki (bless his blue-haired soul, I love this bastard so much) is one of the fiercest players in the series. When we learn about his time playing with Teiko as a part of the Generation of Miracles, we see how his love for the sport spirals into depression and then apathy. The only person who has ever helped him achieve a sense of accomplishment and joy from his love of basketball was Kuroko, then and now, though in different ways.

Kise (ah, the womaniser of my heart) is not really the best of the best, but he’s damn pretty to look at and he’s got enough skill to keep up with the others with his very special ability. Kuroko helps him achieve his potential and motivates him to look outside of his substandard mould as an individual. People don’t expect much beyond the obvious from Kise, but it’s Kuroko’s carefully placed comments—unbelievably simple, no less—that truly helps Kise realise that he doesn’t have to be this cookie cut-out of what people want from him.

The second protagonist, Kagami, is initially shown as being an average guy with amazing playing potential. He’s far more normalised than the other players, at least during the first season. The more that he plays with Kuroko and the more that he engages with the Generation of Miracles, the more he starts to see that he has a near-genius level talent that others can only dream of. Through his evolution as a player, Kuroko has been the shadow to his light. This is actually stated throughout the anime, which is a direct reference to Kabuki kuroko as they always wear black, hiding in the shadows and becoming one with those shadows to help the play be a wonder.

Kuroko isn’t the only similarity between Kabuki and Kuroko’s Basketball. Other commonalities include how exaggerated and unreasonably stylised the series is. That is the aesthetic essence of everything the show does. The ridiculous over-the-top skillsets that each Generation of Miracles player has (including Kuroko and Kagami) are extremely lively and superbly dramatic. Midorima (or as my friend refers to him, the tsundere carrot) is a superstitious dude, and I mean superstitious as fuck. He checks the daily zodiac predictions and carries around a lucky item relative to that day as well. His entire nature when it comes to good luck, bad luck, and overall superstitions are so hilariously melodramatic. Yet, the series not only makes it work, it makes it work well, particularly when you consider how his unique abilities can be challenged.

Each character encapsulates a precise trait and exhibits those traits in a full-bodied and theatrical means. This is a reference to very meaning of “Kabuki” itself as the meaning pertains to supremely embellished and stylised performances. It’s supposed to go beyond realism; an eccentric and extraordinary outstep of common sense.

The overwhelming ludicrousness isn’t limited to the characters but is also exhibited in the animation style, which still holds up rather well when you consider the serial is about six to seven years old. There’s lots of super showy shots (ha-ha, pun mildly intended) of players dunking the ball or throwing three-pointers. When someone’s expression changes as they become “totally serious” about the game, it’s usually accompanied with zooming onto their face and focusing on the intensity of their eyes. Their moves are revealed in slow-motion to emphasise that they’re going into battle, so to speak. The music consists of various forms of rock and digital score and songs to turn up the suspense and force of the basketball matches.

I know that this is a characteristic that was off-putting to many folks who tried to watch Kuroko’s Basketball, but when I saw it recently, I adored every ounce of it. Maybe it’s because I have an appreciation for the spectacular overstated (campy) shenanigans that take place here, especially if you toss in sarcasm and fun wit, or maybe it’s because it’s all about that motherfucking Kabuki.

If you haven’t seen Kuroko’s Basketball, but have any bit of interest in it, I recommend that you go watch it and pay attention to the design of everything—from the characters’ looks, to their mannerism, to their playing abilities, and finally the relationship they have with Kuroko Tetsuya. There’s also the animation and music, and sporadic use of English via Kagami to illustrate his shock at things (oh, yes, you read that correctly). If you have seen it, and wouldn’t mind a re-watching it, do it. Let me know what you think about my over-active analytical nonsense. Do you see the stunningly understated homage to Kabuki Theatre?

119661,"THIS WILL BE A REVIEW FOR ALL OF SEASON 2


Introduction:Hello. My name is Neill or ""MiNi."" This will be my in depth review of Re:Zero Season 2, the 2020 anime adaption of Tappei Nagatsuki's brilliant light novel series. With all my reviews I will score the anime discussed based upon 5 categories that include: Story, Characters, Art, Music, and Personal Enjoyment. Each category will be given a score between 0 and 10. The ending score will be what I determine the show deserves overall. Keep in mind I will be talking about spoilers that occurred during the anime along with spoilers of the light novels that proceed after. Although this review is written under the season 2 part 2 webpage, I will be talking about and discussing all elements from the second season of Re:Zero since its original intent was to be a continuous single cour run. Now, without further ado, let's get into this.

 STORY (9/10):



The only department I believe Re:Zero lacks in compared to its 2016 entry is it's overarching story arc. The premise of these 25 episodes is much harder to summarize and understand. Even as a veteran web novel reader such as my self, the ""end goal"" of arc 4 is somewhat difficult to keep track of. Contrasting this story to that of season 1, and there are much easier digestible narratives. Arc 1: Stop Elsa from killing Emilia. Arc 2: Find out who is killing Subaru at the mansion. Arc 3: Kill the white whale and stop the witch cult. The best summary I can give to arc 4 is to ""save the sanctuary"". Now the whole, ""what"" and ""why"" of this plot does not really reveal itself until almost the very end. It seems that the characters with all the knowledge pulling the strings behind the scenes don't even know what the sanctuary is themselves.

Is this this to say the story is bad? Absolutely not. In fact, many web novel and light novel reader agree this is one of, if not the best arc so far in the story. There are definitely elements of this plot I love and prefer to that of season 1. Although the story is more convoluted and mysterious, does not make it bad. 

The very beginning is what hits hardest. Subaru losing Rem puts him at his lowest yet. This is an element that I love. 

Compare the end of season 1:



To the beginning of season 2:



The parallels are extremely prevalent. The ending of season 1 is joyful, happy, feels like the work has finally paid off. Then everything is immediately taken away at the beginning of season 2. Right back to square one. Right back to zero (I'm sorry). 

In all seriousness though, this is a great element for storytelling and subverting expectations which is brought up a number of times throughout this season. Other examples include us being introduced to Roswaal in full body bandages the first time we see him. Subaru's parents being extremely supportive of him etc. These are parts of the story that you don't expect. You don't expect such a powerful figure such as Roswaal to greet Subaru in a full body cast. You don't expect a NEET like Subaru to have an athletic and outgoing dad along with a caring and loving mother. There are dozens of other great forms of expectation subversion in this arc which is what kept me coming back for more.

I also really enjoyed the trials of the sanctuary. It was an amazing idea to tie them in with the whole ""what if"" part of Re:Zero. The dealing with your past, what could have been, and what could become is a subtle but ingenious nod at the ""return by death factor"". I was a lot more engrossed in the first of both Subaru and Emilia's trials compared to both of their second and third ones however. They just didn't feel as developed. 

Along with the trials there is a a great deal of this arc expanding on the lore of the world of Re:Zero which in my opinion is one of its strongest elements. Tappei has really fleshed out the history and background of the world, magic, characters, and mythos. We got glimpses and hits of such aspects in season 1, but season 2 cranks it up twofold. Seeing new monsters, learning about new technology, and meeting new characters is what keeps viewers interested.

Season 2 also contains some of my favorite episodes of the whole series. Season 2 has some of the strongest continuing streaks of just incredible episodes, I was thoroughly impressed on just how good the episodes continued to be. Part 2 especially started on the right foot incredibly well. Some of the best episodes in the entire series are shown within Season 2 which I did not expect.

Overall season 2 definitely sets itself to be ambitious and expand on the scope of the Re:Zero story. Although more sophisticated, it has continued to deliver some of the greatest fiction in current anime.


 Characters (9/10):



Natsuki Subaru: Comparing Subaru from the beginning of season 1 the beginning of season 2 is incredible. He has grown so much throughout the story. The story of season 1 showed us how he overcame his selfish tendencies. Season 2 shows us how he becomes a leader. He takes initiative of the his opportunities and does his best to help everyone. Is he perfect? Absolutely not, he still makes mistakes which cost his own and other people's lives. But he is much more of someone you'd strive to be like in this season. I am excited to see him on screen in the future because he will only keep improving.

Echidna: I somewhat figured the anime community would go crazy of Echdina, but didn't foresee the extent of her popularity. She is terrific. Not necessarily the ""antagonist"" of the season, but definitely not someone you're exactly rooting for either. Her development builds up slowly throughout the two parts, but the second cour gets most of the meat from her backstory and motivation established. I greatly enjoyed her interactions with Subaru and the other witches as well, she definitely carried herself as the most sophisticated and ""pleasant"" of all of them. Overall, a fine edition to the series who I'm excited to see more of in season to come.

Emilia: Emilia is easily the most improved character from season 1. Her screen time is easily doubled from her previous 25 episode inclusion. If season 1 was the Rem show, season 2 is the Emilia performance, we get to know so much more about her motivations, struggles, and insecurities. She by no means has been pictured as the ""damsel in distress"" in the series, but she also didn't seem that much more capable than that of Rem or Ram to defend herself. Her timid persona grew out of her shell with the help of the trials and becoming a leader to the people of sanctuary. Her backstory was one of the highlights of the entire series, seeing child Emilia along with a pre-insane Petelgeuse was extremely satisfying. To me Emilia has been ""best girl"" since the beginning, but I think season 2 really showed how greatly written a character she really is.

Garfiel: Another fantastic addition to our main cast. He was the character I was probably most excited to seen on screen from reading the Web Novel and I think they nailed him perfectly. His persona and short fused personality was captured perfectly. Garfiel's backstory as well was very adapted. Nothing much more to be said other than he is a great ally to the Emilia camp.

Otto: From watching season 1, I thought Otto would be a one off character that wouldn't be seen again after season 1, but I'm glad they didn't because he was a delight to watch on screen and compliments Subaru well. Although it is interesting to learn and get to meet the ""extra ordinaries"" of the Re:Zero world, the regular people can be just as alluring as well. Granted, he can speak to animals due to his divine protection, but he's about as grounded as it gets when you're apart of Subaru's team. Otto was definitely a captivating member of this season and I am anticipating more of him.

Beatrice: Beatrice was also a greatly improved character form season 1. She doesn't see the limelight that much, but when she has the audiences attention you know there's bound to be something funny happening I suppose. Her finally accepting Subaru even though he wasn't ""that person"" was gratifying. She plays a lot larger role in later arcs and her relationship with Subaru is one of my favorites of the entire series so I can't wait for future content featuring our favorite magical loli. 

Roswaal: Roswaal's motivation was left as a mystery in season 1. We get to learn more about his relationship with Echidna and how he became the person he is today and his tie in with the whole story. If there were any antagonist in this season it would probably be him. I was still left a bit by some of the decisions he decided to make and his place in the story, but he wasn't awful. I still think he is a great part of the season and hope we get to see more of him in the future.

 
 Art (8/10): 



Although I don't think Re:Zero is doing anything exceptionally different compared to it's peers in the anime industry, its animation is nothing to scoff at. White Fox's level of detail is as good if not better than it was in season 1. I know there were some strange complaints of of the animation during the beginning of part 1 but I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. 

The animation overall is great, I think the action was very stratifying to watch and they nailed what Tappei was trying to show in his writing. My favorite scene was easily the battle between Garfiel and Elsa outside the burning mansion, you could tell quite a bit of the budget was put in to make it look especially nice and it was noticeable. 

Re:Zero's art isn't something industry defining, but it doesn't need to be, as long as it keep you engaged and isn't distracting it does its job perfectly.

 Music (8/10): 



Although I prefer the season 1 OST, season 2's is still done exceptionally well. Realize was easily my favorite OP of the season and Believe in you was my favorite ED. The insert songs were a particular highlight of this season. I tend to not focus too much on the music besides the OP and ED, but a lot of the voice over music really caught my ear and made me enjoy the season quite a bit. 

As stated with the Art section, as long as it isn't distracting and takes you out of the element, then its fine. Very few anime I think can redefine how the music is used in anime and I don't think Re:Zero is one of them, but it isn't a bad thing. Re:Zero's soundtrack is commendable for its great work in season 2.

Although it doesn't mean much I REALLY hope the composers at White Fox continue to feature these songs starting with ""re"". Redo and Realize are both great. Season 3 perhaps could feature ""Redemption"" or ""Remember""? I have plenty more suggestions for them if they'd like.

 Personal Enjoyment (10/10): 



It's no surprise that Re:Zero is my favorite anime series of all time. Season 2 definitely impressed me with how genuinely perfect some episodes were. Some of the strongest points across the board came from season 2. I fell in love with the story from the very start, and I haven't given up on that love since. Season 2 strengthened that love even further and I'm more that excited to see so many others find out how great this show is. There is so much to love about season 2 of Re:Zero, it truly was a great continuation to my beloved anime. If you have not already done so please watch season 1 and immediately follow it up with season 2 some of the best fantasy isekai in all of anime.

I really enjoyed the follow up to the 2016 hit season. I just pray we don't don't have to wait another 4 years for a third season.

Did you really read the review, or are you just looking at the score?"

After all this time, I think it was about time I finally wrote a review for this anime… As the representative of K-ON on Anilist, it was a duty for me.
So this review will encompass all of K-ON (both seasons, both OVA and the movie) as I only consider it in its all and this will be in S1 due to it being obviously where people will start the anime.
img()
 ‍
This review is quite challenging and important for me, because no matter how much I love it, I can't recommend it to anyone as it is really not an anime for everyone (and I honestly would rather people not watching it than not liking it), but I'll do my best to explain the appeal. Be warned, it’s gonna be pretty long.

img500()
 ‍
So to do so, I'll try to go through different parts that make this anime what it is. First of all, I'll talk about the story itself, then the visuals followed by the characters and I’ll finish with the audio aspects (music and VA). This review will be spoiler free until one final part where I will use some moments to illustrate the points I mentioned throughout all the review (this technically won’t really spoil, but as I will speak about moments that are happening in the story, I prefer to give a warning just in case).

STORY It's a very slow and calm anime with nothing big happening, so a lot of people might find it boring.There aren’t really big psychological dilemmas or huge dramas as the show focuses more on the interactions between the characters and the development of their relationship.

img()
 ‍
A really popular misconception about K-ON is that it lacks a narrative, which is an opinion that is completely wrong. If you look randomly at the show, on a moment to moment basis, it may feel like a comedy show about five girls having fun, slacking off, making jokes and drinking tea while eating some cakes. But then you would have missed the point of the entire series and tons of growth of each character, which is all stuff that you can only appreciate by watching the series all the way through (that’s the reason why I don’t want to make a review for each part). While it may seem like K-ON is an episodic series, it’s not quite right. Indeed a lot of events could seem to be discontinued one to another, it is in fact a sequence of events with a logical progression which reaches the conclusion at the end of the show, the same way a film would.

img()

Another really big misconception about the show is that it's just a Cute Girl Doing Cute Things. It is indeed a CGDCT anime, I’m not denying that. But it's not just a CGDCT. It goes further than that and has a really good message about enjoying little things in life while they last, about friendship, relations with others and stuff like that. The thing is, as the show doesn't say it directly, that the characters won’t say “I learned something today!” and continue with a monologue explaining their growth, the viewer has to understand it by looking at the characters' reactions, feelings and dialogues, therefore some people might miss it (it’s a big part of why there is the misunderstanding I mentioned earlier).

img()

Regarding purely the comedy aspect, I have to say that, for me, this is a peak example of what a good comedy is. The jokes themselves are amazing and the timing is executed perfectly. It’s really hard for me to choose one moment in particular as basically everything is perfectly made. But I don’t think I’ll talk too much about it, because even if the joke is well made, the appreciation is purely subjective.

VISUALS First of all, the animations and art style, as made by Kyoto Animation, are amazing (even if the animation might be a little bit weird sometimes in S1, I still love it). But I have to admit, that was kind of a given from KyoAni, which is a studio that always puts a lot of effort in their animation, the art style and the backgrounds.

img()

The anime is made in a way that everything you see seems real, may it be the backgrounds (the school is a copy of an existing school in Japan, and the same goes for a lot of places), the characters' clothes or some aspect of their design. Below is a non-exhaustive list of a few places. I selected a few random ones, but the list can go on and on as basically every shot is based on a real place.

img()

To continue, Naoko Yamada (K-ON’s director) even went directly to London with some staff members to get inspiration for the movie.
youtube(https://youtu.be/zDgR1G3sx14)

The realism in the visual doesn’t stop there. All of their instruments aren’t some random ones. All are real models that actually exist (you can find the exact model on the [wiki](https://k-on.fandom.com/wiki/K-ON!Wiki) in the trivia page of each character). 
img400()
 ‍
CHARACTERS This show has probably, for me, the best characters there are. Even if there are like one or two characters from other anime that I slightly prefer, overall, this anime has the best, as the worst characters in it are just ok. So let’s talk about them! (I’ll use the order in which they joined the club and after that, it will be random). I won’t say that I like the characters because they are cute, due to the fact that, first of all, it’s obvious that they are, and secondly, as every single one of them is, it would be a bit redundant and not very helpful.

Ritsu Tainakaimg()
Ritsu is an energetic yet lazy tomboy who loves goofing around and to tease others. She became the president of the club because she found it cool, but ended up not being suited for the job.
For me, Ricchan is good due to her energy and funny moments (may it be with Mio or Yui, with whom she shares the best ones). I could say that, as a drummer, she has a bonus for me, but I decided to start playing an instrument and became a drummer after watching K-ON so back then, this wasn’t a relevant point. I personally love tomboys and her upbeat and carefree personality really makes her amazing.
img() 
 ‍
Mio Akiyama img()
Mio is a timid and shy person. She is Ritsu's childhood friend. Mio is really reliable and the most mature of the group, but still has a few childish sides.
For me, Mio is lovable due to the way she’s serious yet learns when to play around. And her shyness adds an extra level of cuteness and funniness (also as mentioned for Ritsu, their duo is amazing) 
img()
 ‍
Tsumugi Kotobukiimg()
Mugi is a rich girl who didn’t get to experience much of an “ordinary girl” life and therefore is excited to try any things that seem common. 
For me, Mugi is one of the cutest of the group due to how excited to do anything. She’s always so cheerful, not only to try “commoners” stuff, but to be able to relate to others. How she loves to take care of others and how important friends are to her makes her just so heartwarming.
img()
 ‍
Yui Hirasawaimg()
Yui is an airhead girl that didn’t do anything but lazing around before joining the club, due to a misunderstanding. She’s extremely talented at only one thing at the time. 
For me, Yui is extremely funny due to her really easy-going, laid back attitude and her quickly going to both extremes when it comes to what she’s capable of doing. She’s also extremely sweet and caring about others.
img()
 ‍
Azusa Nakanoimg()
Azusa is the youngest of the band. She joined the group one year later than the others after thinking they played amazingly well during a concert they did. She’s very hardworking and tries to motivate the others to practice, but generally ends up following them in their procrastination.
For me, Azunyan is absolutely charming as she’s always trying her best. She’s very humble and doesn’t have a very high self esteem, but she will always do what she can to help others, no matter how hard it is (like teaching Yui how to improve with the guitar). Also, bonus for being an adorable cat.
img()
 ‍
Jun Suzukiimg()
Jun is Asuza and Ui’s classmate. She’s a bassist in the Jazz club and admires Mio as a bassist. She’s playful and easygoing.
For me, Jun is probably the less good character of the show. She’s far from bad but I find her less interesting than the others (maybe due to her having way less screen time). She’s still pretty funny and has great interactions with both of her classmates and senpais.
img()
 ‍
Ui Hirasawaimg()
Yui’s reliable and helpful little sister, Ui is way more mature, responsible and capable than the latter but deeply loves and cares for her.
For me, Ui is an amazing character due to her devotion to her sister and how she takes care of her friends and family. She’s the perfect younger sister that everyone wants.
img()
 ‍
Nodoka Manabeimg()
Nodoka is Yui’s childhood friend. She's a really serious, mature, reliable and structured person.
For me, Nodoka is incredible due to her sweetness and how she is willing to help the others (especially Ritsu with her club president work and Yui with basically everything).
img()
 ‍
Sawako Yamanakaimg()
Sawako is the music teacher and advisor of the club. She will be not only a support for the five girls, but also a helpful critic. She’s very sweet and cautious of her image.
For me, Sawa-chan is charming with her relaxed and nonchalant nature, she will still do what she has to do. Just like Ui is the sister everybody would want, Sawako is the teacher everybody wants.
img()
 ‍
Classmatesimg()
This is a continuation of the “feels real” that I was talking about in the visual section (it could have been written there, but I think as I’m talking about characters, it fits here better). Actually, all of their classmates in S2 have a given name and a last name (even nicknames for some of them) and a personality trait. Unlike a lot of anime, they aren’t just some random characters that will only be shown once (some of them are even visible in season one). They are all different. If you don’t know this, you might not notice them, but if you pay attention to them, you should be able to like them. Some of them actually have some “mini fandom” ([Himiko](https://anilist.co/character/68163/Himeko-Tachibana) and [Ichigo](https://anilist.co/character/67937/Ichigo-Wakaouji) are probably the most popular ones)
img350() img350()

I could have continued with other characters like Norimi or Sokabe, but they are less relevant, and my review is already too long as it is, so let’s move on. 

AUDIO  [The songs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL62M2qr3IDBLOrYJPSZJ4canzg49yM4N3) are amazing and I could basically listen to nothing but that. For the OP/ED. I prefer the ED than the OP of the anime (to be honest, in my top 5 best ED, 3 of them are from K-ON), but
I also love all 4 openings.
img()

The background OSTs are also really good. They are not too intrusive (which could make them less memorable than a lot of other anime). They still feel right, know how to hit correctly and help the viewers go with the flow.

img()

Regarding the voice acting, I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t listen much to the English dub, but from what I heard, I don’t really like it. I won’t speak about the voices themselves because I probably don’t like them due to the fact that I’m used to the original ones. But I can speak a little bit about the translations. A lot of jokes can’t be translated (especially in the movie as it’s very japanglish oriented) so the translators did their best, but sadly a lot of things are missing. Of course, if you prefer English versions over Japanese ones, go for it, the translations aren’t the thing that will make you dislike the anime.

webm(https://i.imgur.com/Abl6Lod.mp4) 

Now, regarding the Japanese voice acting. Every voice actor did an amazing job (especially as they still were pretty new in the industry). They managed not only to give the correct emotions in the dialogue, but the way they speak fit perfectly (this isn’t only the job of the VA obviously, the direction has a lot of implications in it, but still). 
On a side note, It’s really cute and heartwarming how the five of them really became close to each other and became just like the characters they play (which can be seen in some interviews of their live concert).

img()
 ‍
EXAMPLE Regarding the character development part, I will mainly take three examples and quickly mentions two others (I could undeniably talk about a lot more, but that will be enough for now)
The first one is when Yui wants to buy her guitar. The one she wishes for is way too expensive, so her and the other girls need to take part time jobs to earn money. But at the moment they all give Yui their share, she understands that she’s just being selfish and decides to give them back and take a cheaper guitar (even though she will still get the one she wants). 
img()

The next one is about Ritsu and Mio's relationship (mainly in ep 11 of the first season and ep 18 of the second one). During ep 11, Ritsu, who isn’t used to Mio being far from her, gets pretty jealous of Nodoka and angry at Mio who wants to spend time with the only person she knows in her new class (and the fact that Ritsu is sick and Mio scared about the upcoming live doesn’t help them to get some perspective on the situation). But in the end, they both realised what the other needs, that their dispute was meaningless and their bond only grew stronger.
img()

When they are both selected to play Romeo and Juliet. As they are both playing the character that would have fit the other the best, they help each other and find ways to improve together to make the play a success.
img()

Now a focus on Mio. During the anime she will learn to have more confidence and to be less scared. Of course she will still be shy and won’t completely change, but during some “trials” like being forced to sing on their first concert due to being the only one who can, needing to sing when Yui forgot the lyrics and could damage the live or action as Romeo in their class play, she will gain strength and confidence and grow as a person (which can be seen in her expression and overall attitude when she’s on stage).
img() 

Some others development that I won’t speak too much about (due to them being clearer than the others) are Yui who finds a goal in her life that can be easily seen at the end of season 1 where she run to school similarly to the first episode, but this time without tripping or getting distracted on the way (the monologue she has makes it pretty clear) and Azusa who learns that relaxing and not only focusing on practice is also important and helps to forge deeper relationships with a group and at the end, the things she wanted to change became what she wished to keep. But once again, it’s shown pretty obviously so I won’t elaborate much further.
img()

In regards to the messages of the anime, I will only quickly mention the importance of the turtle in the anime, which illustrate the fact to take the time to enjoy things and that you don’t have to rush.
May it be Ton-chan, the turtle in the stairs of the school or a few others, the turtles serves as an illustration of this message 
img()

The other big point of this message is through the development of Azusa, but as I already mentioned it just a moment ago, I don’t think I need to elaborate on this side of the message.

CONCLUSION I don’t know how many people will fully read my review as it’s extremely long, but thank you if you did.
It could have been longer as there are many things I would have wanted to talk about (like character development of all the ones that I mention in the “characters” parts, a lot of details of the anime, some analysis of specific episodes and so on), but I really should stop there…
img300()

So in the end, if you don't mind this kind of slow paced anime, I definitely recommend it to you! I don't think you'll like it as much as I do (I know... I have a problem, you don’t have to remind me of it) but you should like it (once again, if you like this kind of show) and you'll get one of the best anime there is..  There’s no quick answer as to why this show is good and why I like it so much, because so much of the appeal has to do with the personal relationship which the viewer forms with the show along its run, so sadly, I can’t really make a little TL:DR. K-ON is a show that gets better and better the more of it you watch, not only because the second season is better than the first one, but in that season one is more enjoyable if you’ve already seen the show in its entirety.

You will definitely be able to relate to some parts. May it be some characters or some moments and experiences such as sleepovers with friends where instead of sleeping, you’re just making jokes and laughing or going to big events with your friends and so on. This anime will speak to you and probably make you feel nostalgic for some moments of your life.

This anime is really rich in detail (I end up noticing more stuff every time I rewatch it) and really strong emotionally. It’s no exaggeration when I say that this anime changed my life. A lot of anime had a strong influence on me, but K-ON is the only one that made me change stuff in my life (for the better of course).

If you already watched K-ON and my review made you understand things or maybe like the anime more, I’m really happy about it. If you haven’t watched it yet, but my review made you want to start it, I hope you’ll enjoy this anime which is really dear to me and I’ll be happy to like your activities!"

Love is complicated, scary, fleeting, but certainly not war. For Kaguya and Miyuki, though, it is. For months upon months, they have played this game where whoever confesses first loses, having lots of fun along the way, but when faced with a time constraint, was all this “war” a waste of time? Love doesn’t always wait for us, people come and go, and that’s why people must take advantage of every opportunity to be with those they love.

Watching this third season of Kaguya-sama was like watching the last act of a play, or listening to the last verse of a song. It felt like at the end of this cour, something momentous would happen, and the characters would step away from the status quo, starting potentially a new journey in their lives.

I have to credit mangaka Aka Akasaka’s brilliant storytelling and hysterical comedy in the original work, but I can’t give enough credit to the wonderful work of A-1 Pictures, the animators, and all the staff working on this passion project. The anime brings the manga to life so well, with adaptations shattering all expectations. For example, that rap sequence in Episode 5 this season was one of the best single anime episodes I have ever witnessed, with references that made me shocked. Throughout the series, we’ve seen so many different references, such as the Monogatari series, Dragon Ball, and even Western culture references like A-Ha’s “Take On Me”, and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody”. Once again, I cannot give enough credit to the staff for coming up with this type of modern masterpiece. What I find most impressive is director Shinichi Omata’s grasp of modern society. He has done his research on what kind of comedy works in this day and age, and it’s not always situational comedy, it’s comedy that harnesses works from other mediums other than anime, which is such a creative spin that borders on comedic genius. Comedy is subjective, and it’s possible that not everyone enjoys this comedy, but for me, it couldn’t have been much better and funnier.

STORY: 22.5/25

The continuation of the antics of the student council. The continuation of Kaguya and Miyuki’s relationship. Similarly to previous seasons, each episode is divided into skits, but this season is a bit less episodic than the rest, because the meat of the season lies in last few episodes focusing on the cultural festival.

I never can get too much of Kaguya and Miyuki’s mind games, and there is no shortage of that this season. It’s not all the same as the previous seasons though, because there are some important developments, and near the end of the school year, Miyuki gets accepted into Stanford University, a renowned school in the United States. That would mean he would be separated from the student council earlier than expected.

The underlying reasons of these mind games and why they never confessed is simple. One, it is scary. Two, they thought they had all the time in the world. When we are in a good place in our lives, with little time constraint, it’s hard to leave the status quo. In fact, it’s scary leaving a comfortable place in our lives. For Kaguya and Miyuki, it would have been comfortable and fun to play their mind games forever, but each person has their own lives and ambitions, and when there is a time constraint, they had to act upon their feelings and get it all out there. It’s really a tale that depicts the different sides of every person, the playful side, the childish side, but also the mature side. It’s a pretty relatable story of one’s growth in high school.

A side story, and one I was very invested in watching, was Ishigami’s story with Tsubame. Ishigami has been one of my favourite characters since the first season, and he has a very intriguing personality, delivering cynical lines now for fantastic comedic relief. Tsubame is the leader of the Cheer club and the organizer for the cultural festival, so naturally, she was pretty popular amongst the students. Ishigami doesn’t come off as a very confident person, so a relationship with him and Tsubame didn’t seem very possible at first, but Ishigami, with some help from Kaguya, was able to take action in search of a date with her. The funny thing about all this, is that this is hypocrisy to the highest degree, in that she’s telling Ishigami to go forward with his ambitions, but she doesn’t want to confess to Miyuki herself. It was honestly very entertaining to watch the twists and turns of this relationship play out.

Overall, there was a lot of development this season for a few characters, not just the main couple, which was a good take on the romcom genre, allowing many characters to shine.

ART: 9.6/10

As I mentioned, this is a passion project made with a lot of love. The animation is vibrant, and always adds to the comedy. It’s a visual feast always, with chaotic animation every episode. I would also love to shout out Vercreek, an 18 year old animator who was the key animator for the Episode 5 ED “My Nonfiction”, which was such eye candy. The regular ED was also very good and colourful, with yet more references, this time, to Kaguya-Hime, and Starship Troopers! Sasuga A-1 Pictures!

MUSIC: 9.5/10

Masayuki Suzuki had yet another wonderful opening in “Giri Giri”, though I do prefer the previous two openings. You can’t have Kaguya-sama without Suzuki though. The two endings were wonderful musically as well, especially “My Nonfiction”, which took rap elements and k-pop elements in a visually appealing ending. The OST is also great, as always.

CHARACTERS: 19.5/20

The main cast of characters bounce off each other very well, for great comedy. The voice actors do a great job, and I bet they had a lot of fun while doing the lines. Aoi Koga is such a great voice actor for Kaguya, killing it yet again, with her excellent range, balancing her dark side and shy side so well! I’ve talked about the characters a lot already, and it’s no surprise that I like every single one of them. I’ll just go over some of the characters I found interesting, besides Kaguya, Miyuki, and Ishigami.

Let’s start with everyone’s favourite comedic character, Chika! I noticed her somewhat lack of screen time in the cultural festival arc, and that made sense, since she’s more of a comedic character. Her running gag this season, similarly to previous seasons, is her being Miyuki’s teacher for many things, and getting PTSD from those experiences. Every time, that type of comedic bit is great, though I think they overly used it this season. Her bubbly personality was still a joy to see.

Next, we have a new character, Maki Shijo. I admit, I found her kind of annoying at first, but her friendship with Ishigami was why I ended up liking her. She has her problems with romance, but she’s able to use that to help Ishigami in his pursuit of romance. She was a wholesome character to watch, and had some great moments.

Lastly, let’s talk about Iino. Her “healing music” made for one of the funniest comedic moments of the season, as it was just so weird, but in a funny way. Her sensitivity to indecency made for an obstacle at times, so maybe she’s the “fan-service police”? Because of her, the fan-service in the show was limited? That’s how I like to see her as.

Great cast of characters that made for awesome comedic moments, while having their own character development in the process.

ENJOYMENT: 15/15

Had so much fun with this series, as I usually do with Kaguya-sama. Always was invested, so I was frustrated with the cliffhangers, but that’s a sign the show made me excited.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 19.7/20

Basically, all the excellent animation and musical themes helped coalesce the production, and establish drama and suspense. Director Omata’s cinematography and grasp of modern culture and the human condition made for excellent comedy. The romance felt as well paced as ever, never forced.

OVERALL: 95.8/100

Kaguya-sama has been a work of pure love, and it has always been made with great passion. I love works of art like this show that doesn’t rely or flashiness or fight scenes to create suspense, but just relatable romance tales that keep me engaged and excited all the way through. I found that when there was a great episode, I always smiled throughout the end credits, and honestly, this show made my day sometimes. It’s one of the most fun I’ve had with an anime ever, and if anyone ever wants a funny romcom to watch, or even if they’ve never watched anime, this would be near the top of the list for me to recommend. I haven’t poured my heart out this much writing a review, and that’s a testimony to how good this show is. I feel blessed to have been part of this 12 week journey, and to be able to share all my thoughts to you. If you’ve read everything, I truly appreciate it."
523,"Moving away can be tough, but it doesn’t always have to be. For Satsuki and Mei, two rambunctious children living in Japan in the 1950’s, it’s an adventure, in spite of the sad circumstances that brought them to their new home. The Kusakabe family has just moved from the big city into a more rural, country-esque community, surrounded by farms and woods, but they aren’t there for the change of scenery. They’ve moved there to get closer to the hospital that their mother is staying at while she battles an unspecified long term illness. The community is warm and welcoming, their new neighbors are supportive to them, but most importantly, they have each other. While their father Tatsuo spends his day working in his room, Mei and Satsuki play with each other around their new property, searching the house for ghosts, running around the yard, and exploring all the weird and quaint wonders of their new home.

It isn’t long at all, however, before things start to get strange. Their first encounter with the supernatural was fairly innocuous, as they discover a horde of tiny black soot spirits living in the dark corners of their home, which flee into the shadows whenever the two of them enter a room. Things get even more bizarre the first time Mei is left to her own devices, and she begins to uncover creatures living near them in the woods, including the mighty Totoro, a hibernating beast nestled deep below the roots of a giant tree, who becomes fast friends with her. Described by her father as The King of the Forest, Totoro isn’t always around, but he shows up when they need him, keeping them company or helping them out, all without saying a word. They’ll need his help more than ever, however, as a vague telegram brings up the troubling news that their mother’s condition has gotten worse, and a fight between the two sisters creates a terrifying situation. Can they rely on their spirit friends once more to see them through, or have they been all alone from the beginning?

This is the third Studio Ghibli film that I’ve reviewed, and out of the three, this one is probably the closest to what I’d consider the standard Hayao Miyazaki style. Of course, almost all of Miyazaki’s movies are visually gorgeous… My Neighbor Totoro is a solid thirty years old now, after all… But Totoro is one of his more cartoony looking projects, and it’s probably one of the best looking out of them. One particular note I’d like to make is something I didn’t really notice until watching this movie again this week for the third time in my life… There are exceptions, notably Spirited Away, but for the most part, the characters in Hayao Miyazaki’s films look less realistic the younger they get, with the adults having more or less realistic proportions, children being a little more exaggerated with larger facial expressions, and the littlest of children being portrayed as adorable little goblins with heads too big for their bodies and mouths wide enough to make Totoro himself jealous. It works well because of the cartoony nature of the designs, though.

The same can’t really be said for the backgrounds, which are highly detailed and realistic throughout, although they did manage to create some incredibly diverse scenery. There are times when the background can feel a bit stiff and lifeless, but this is mainly during scenes where we’re supposed to be paying attention to the characters anyway, and the artwork itself is still beautiful to look at. I haven’t been this entranced by the clouds in the sky of an animation since I reviewed Diebuster, and a lot of the imagery from the forest seemed like it was taken right from the forest next to my own house, which I used to explore quite liberally when I was younger. Honestly, the tunnel under the shrubbery that Mei takes to get to the large clearing is a dead wringer for a similar path that I used to crawl through back in the day. Backgrounds that actually move, like scary swaying trees at night, tall grass being pushed through and fields of grass and other plants being rustled by gusts of wind, are very well captured and lushly drawn.

The character movement is perfectly fluid and graceful, well, as graceful as two clumsy, awkward kids and a cat bus with creepy, millipedey legs can be. There’s a lot of running, which I’ve heard can be particularly difficult to animate in 2D, but that’s what this movie entirely is… Traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation, which makes the aesthetic especially impressive. And that’s not anything against the CG that Miyazaki would use in later movies… I understand perfectly well why they needed to use it in Spirited Away, because the story took place in one giant set piece, with a terrifying number of working parts and crazy inhabitants, so it had to be a major boon for them, but I still vastly prefer the look of the hand drawn Kusakabe house, as it gives so much life to the crumbling old structure. The final thing I should mention is probably the design of Totoro himself, as they were so flawlessly able to walk the line between unique looking monster and fluffy, adorable gentle giant, and while I don’t know enough about Japanese mythology to place whether he’s based on anything, I can still understand any kid wanting to befriend him.

Just like Spirited Away, the music for Totoro was composed by Joe Hisaishi, but this time around, since there’s less going on in the story, I was able to soak it in a lot better, as his tracks aren’t just supporting the product, but acting as important elements all their own more often than not. Since there’s no real action to speak of in the film, the score is very childhood oriented, with tracks ranging from happy, fun and upbeat to calm and relaxing, with very few exceptions for the sake of it’s few serious scenes. The most memorable track is easily it’s theme, literally a song about having fun with your friend Totoro, and while it’s been parodied mercilessly(The South Park Cthulhu version is my favorite), it’s hard to listen to without feeling something. The instrumental portion has a curious motif going on, as quite a few of it’s tracks, which otherwise don’t sound that much alike, do manage to have a few bars in common, and they’re bars that also get hummed by the characters a few times, but I’m not sure what the significance is. They are pretty, though, which I think I can say for the rest of the score as well.

As for the English dub, I was surprised to find out the two main child characters, Satsuki and Mei, were actually played by the Fanning sisters… Respectively, Dakota and Elle. Remember in my review of Spirited Away, how I said the character was voiced in a more childlike way compared to the sub, and it didn’t feel like much acting was really being done? Well, the same thing happens here, but it works a lot better for three reasons. First of all, this is a different kind of story. I won’t get into too much about the focus of the plot just yet, but it’s not the kind of story that really requires the individual characters to be particularly interesting or memorable. The focus is primarily on the family, so of course the kids are going to be portrayed as kids. This inevitably leads into the second thing, the brilliant casting of two real life sisters as the main characters. The bond between Dakota and Elle translates completely into their characters, and you can feel the love and familiarity of their established bond, and it adds a level of caring to their dynamic onscreen.

The third reason is that even in her worst movies(Hide and Seek, anyone?), Dakota Fanning’s been a fantastic actor ever since she started out in her career. From her collection of TV cameos in the year 2000, she’s always had the kind of acting chops, timing and stage presence that some adults are never able to achieve, so even in a role where she’s not really expected to do anything more complex than hang out with her little sister, she still manages to shine whenever one of her scenes calls for more emotion… When Satsuki’s worried about her mother, or frustrated with her sister, or going through the big climax of the third act, she does manage to put on a compelling performance. Elle, to a lesser extent, does an okay job as well, I mean she couldn’t really bomb this part as long as she continued to read her lines, but like I said before, the most important thing was their bond, which does sell the characters to us. We do wind up caring about them.

As for the rest of the cast, there really aren’t any other major notes I can make. Satsuki and Mei’s parents are played by respectable character/voice actors Tim Daly and Lea Salonga, one of whom has a long resume stretching back to the eighties, and the latter being a mainstay of Disney movies, playing the singing voice for numerous Disney Princesses. They’re strong actors, but neither had a lot to do here. More noteworthy is Pat Carrol, who was born in the twenties and has been acting since the forties, and is actually still alive and performing today, with a recent role in the Tangled cartoon series. She plays a very kind and lovable old woman, the first person to welcome them to the village and the person who explains the spirits in the area to the two girls. Finally we have the legendary Frank Welker, voice of millions of animated animals, playing the titular character Totoro, among others. It’s a testament to his abilities that he’s able to convey emotion and personality from a role that’s basically just Chewbacca roaring. The adaptive writing does change things, but it does so with a bit more respect for the audience than some other films.

While most of Ghibli’s films are able to garner their own consistent reputations, My Neighbor Totoro seems to be one of the more divisive films in their collection. There are a lot of people who consider the film to be a great nostalgic classic, one of the main movie of their childhoods, but I’ve seen an equal number of people saying that they find the film to be boring, and it’s hard to not see both sides. As much as it manages to be a whimsical tale of childhood innocence, there really isn’t a lot going on in it… It has almost no plot to speak of, and viewers can get so disengaged that they wind up focusing more on the puzzle of whether or not Totoro even exists in the story, rather than anything actually going on in it. There’s also a third camp, people in the middle, who think it’s perfectly fine as a kids movie, but doesn’t have as much appeal to an older audience. These are all solid points, and I can understand where they’re all coming from, but I honestly do feel that it has more to offer, even to adults, than most viewers would realize.

As I stated before, Satsuki and Mei are not, on their own, interesting or compelling characters. You would never want to go to great lengths to see them in any other context, nor would you really want to catch up with them in the years following the movie’s conclusion. They work as a unit, and while they’re not entirely defined by each other… Satsuki is a bit more serious and responsible, Mei is a bit more careless and dependent… They are each other’s most important qualities. What I didn’t mention is that they both share equal space as main characters, something I rarely ever see in sibling-centric stories. Ed and Alphonse are both important in FMA, but Ed is still clearly the main character. Mirai is clearly the star of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, with her puppy Yuuki just being there to act cute, die, and make us cry. Gregory is a very interesting and quirky character in Over the Garden Wall, but he’s still clearly a sidekick in Wert’s story. Mabel and Dipper share equal billing in Gravity Falls, but Dipper is still the one moving the plot forward.

With My Neighbor Totoro, however, both children get equal time to shine, spending more or less the same amount of time both alone and together, both having interactions with Totoro himself, and the only real exception… A certain crisis in the third act… Is still entirely focused on their relationship, despite the relatively dramatic stakes. If it wasn’t for the fact that I’d gone over ten years without watching it right up until the time of this writing, the two of them would have been a shoo-in for my top ten siblings list a few years ago, as the bond between them is so strongly written and developed that Miyazaki had no trouble making you care about them and get invested in their story, despite their lack of individual development. I’d even go as far as to say I like the two of them on a more personal note, as they remind me a lot of my brother and me as children… Granted, we were closer in age than these girls are, with only about a year and a half between us, but we still hung out a lot, explored together, and fed both off of and into each other’s imaginations.

And that’s ultimately the point of this movie… The importance of imagination in a healthy childhood. My Neighbor Totoro makes no bones about the fact that Satsuki and Mei are going through a rough time, with their mother in the hospital and their dad working, so the two of them are left with nothing but each other as a support system, coming up with fantasies and elaborate creatures that the adults in their lives are more than willing to humor and encourage. Yeah, that’s right, I think all the supernatural stuff that happens in this movie was imaginary, because I’ve been there… I’ve been a kid, entertaining myself with epic fantasies playing out around me, and even when the creatures in the movie DO tangibly interact with the girls, I could easily see these moments being recreated from stories they told each other or came up with to describe the events around them, much like Edward Bloom from the movie Big Fish. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Totoro and his little minions didn’t appear until Mei was all alone.

With her sister in school, Mei no longer had her playmate, and had to come up with a new one… A big, giant furry one who’s subtly hinted to be based on a frog, and maybe a little off of Mei’s initial impression of the old lady next door. Satsuki didn’t see him at first because it took her a little while to understand why he was important, and to come around to Mei’s way of thinking. Then again, maybe I’m wrong, and it was all real. Maybe Totoro really is the spirit of the forest, he really can fly and call upon help from a cat bus with weird centipede legs, and the two girls are seeing something that’s really there. If this were the case, it wouldn’t bother me at all, as it wouldn’t take away from the movie. It’s never made clear whether or not Totoro exists in the real world or just in the children’s heads, and that’s exactly how it should be. It’s that blur of fantasy and reality that expresses just how important and, well, real our imaginations are to us, both when we were children and even as adults.

All right, before I wrap this up, I should talk about the elephant in the room. Actually, there are two; The first one is that there’s a nude scene in this movie. It’s only a few seconds long, but it shows the girls and their father bathing together, and while that may seem weird and creepy to a western audience… I wouldn’t judge you for not wanting your kids to see it without parental guidance… It is, in and of itself, an innocent scene, as families bathe together in a completely non-sexual context all around the world, so it’s a perfectly innocent moment. I did, however, have a friend once who, when I mentioned the movie to him, immediately said “Ooh, the bath scene…” We’re not friends anymore. Don’t be friends with people like this. The other elephant is a weirdly popular fan theory that the movie is a metaphorical retelling of an old murder, with the girls both secretly dying in the third act, and while I don’t personally believe in this theory, I can kind of see how it came about, and I do get that there’s some evidence for it. I don’t think it holds up, myself, and I personally like to view the movie on it’s own merits, but hey, you do you.

My Neighbor Totoro is available from Gkids, with the original Disney release being out of print. A novelization by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Miyazaki himself is also available stateside with an English translation. Interesting note, Totoro also showed up as a plush toy in Toy Story 3. If you can find it, there’s also an older DVD where, on the case’s artwork, it looks like Totoro’s top is sticking out of his butt. Your welcome.

My Neighbor Totoro is one of Studio Ghibli’s flagship titles, with the big fluffy Totoro himself serving as the Studio mascot, much like the Cat in the Hat is with the Dr. Seuss empire. It might not have accomplished as much as certain other titles in their filmography, with Spirited Away being their only major award-winner in the United States and some of the more dark titles garnering far better critical praise, but in my opinion, this is one of their biggest triumphs. This movie does everything it set out to do and so much more, becoming a timeless classic that even thirty years later, still manages to capture the hearts and minds of children and even some adults(like yours truly). It’s simplistic, but it still has an unmistakable dignity to it, and it stands as proof that you don’t need epic circumstances, intense action scenes or complex writing to make a movie good, and you don’t need randomness, quick editing or flashy CG to appeal to children. If you treat your audience with respect, they’ll come to you, and they’ll never forget you. I give My Neighbor Totoro a 9/10."

Universal Vibes. There’s something authentic about Samurai Champloo that vastly separates itself from other pieces of fiction, even upon rewatching. One could mention its immersive atmosphere of engulfment viewed from the protagonists similar to Mugen, Jin, and Fuu. Or that unforgettable sensation produced by esteemed hip-hop soundtracks in a historical premise. It could maybe be the lingering warmth that oozes a memorable experience. In other words, people tend to remember their favorite fiction by the tender “feeling” they obtained from it,  the “vibe” felt by consuming it.

Samurai Champloo is straight vibes.

A newborn journey has usually been depicted as a commodity meant to give the viewer satisfaction and closure at its completion. Although, the common fallacy and mistakes of adventure-driven stories lean towards the inconsistencies in narrative structure, followed by artificial punchlines, unnatural characters that have no originality and uniqueness. Furthermore, the results of these misinterpretations end in dull, unvaried writing.

No punchlines. No gimmicks. Only pure vibrance. Samurai Champloo doesn’t follow the rules of traditional storytelling through its composition of chronological, formative events mashed together wherein each episode carries distinctive value. Following the journey of 3 complete opposites banding together to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, each story aims to entertain, amuse, and leave an efficacious message by the end of it. Some days, the trio could be participating in gambling sessions, eating contests, chugging G-Fuel, or simply experiencing unexpected, unforgettable encounters with different individuals. Samurai Champloo faithfully leans toward a character-driven narrative without forcing self-righteous ideals. It’s wholesome, chill, poignant, comedic, unique, and entertaining. Each episode radiates a sense of profoundness, leading to probably one of the most engaging experiences I’ve viewed in quite a while. It doesn’t rely on carbon-copied gimmicks and writing. Most of all, the dialogue feels ideally simplified, whilst being palpable. With compelling characters like Mugen, Jin, and Fuu and an atmosphere like no other, Samurai Champloo’s reputation is fully cemented as a classic. However, Shinichirō Watanabe's directing is also a core foundation of this tale, being able to think outside the box while emanating the ideal atmosphere, while successfully pacing Champloo's episodic storytelling.

I highly advise that you pay attention to the use of multiple, various soundtracks in each episode, the experience only adds to the enjoyment and entertainment value. Hip-Hop and Lofi culture was highly influenced by the goat Nujabes, who was responsible for most of the tracks used, along with Fat John. If you haven’t listened to any of Nujabes’ songs, I highly advise you to, as it's great for stress-relief, relaxation, study sessions, or maybe if you just want to vibe out to something.

In addition, the soundtracks oozes such a chill, vibrant atmosphere within the premise, and most iconically, is the main reason why this piece of fiction is both unique and affecting. 

Why? Samurai Champloo utilizes its historical premise of traditional Edo-era Japan and blends it with a modernized, present-day soundtrack, which is an unconventional combination that signifies originality and diversity. In addition, it emphasizes on the thematic focus of Champloo, the characters themselves, and most importantly, its method of presenting the production's general aura.

Viewing Mugen from an initial perspective, his clothing seemed rather modernized. Furthermore, he's a stubborn individual who lives by no laws and rules. His fighting style is rather unique, bombastic, and explosive, unlike Jin, who traditionally fights with calculated swings and slashes, birthed by the influence of training under his master, Enshiro Mariya. Throughout Samurai Champloo, Mugen and Jin have stumbled across many burdensome predicaments, kindled by their inescapable pasts, influenced by past crimes, instances of self-isolation, and involvement with others. Both are nuanced in similar ways, yet they are distinct from each other. Depicted as complete opposites, Mugen and Jin serves as the backbone of Samurai Champloo. As individuals, Mugen and Jin have gone through some of the most believable character development I’ve seen. In their character arcs, both have faced their pasts head-on, mainly due to accumulating acceptance towards the journey they’ve embarked on together, caused by Fuu’s intentions. Mugen and Jin contrast each other, yet they both learn to value one another. Samurai Champloo rewards the viewer through accompanying their experiences, inside of a narrative that ignites progression, while at the same time, bestows them with a difficulty to eventually overcome.

The amount of effort put into choreographing the action was a sight to behold. Studio Manglobe's animation, being made in 2005, was well-produced for its time frame. The merging of fluid, yet pompous movement of swords swinging, and the use of unique soundtracks makes Samurai Champloo in a caliber of its own. Jin’s sword style is highlighted by sharp, fast, and precise movements, quietly phrasing his chill, calm personality. Mugen’s reckless style is formatted as an endless combination of modernized break-dance movements along with loud, aggressive swings. In general, The choreography reflects many character identities, and is the exclamation point in thrilling action sequences.

Shown as a traditional waitress, Fuu isn’t your typical damsel in distress fated to be saved by the male lead. With the goal of finding the sunflower samurai, which is one of the core themes of Champloo, Fuu may be vexing and bothersome at times, but she is believably equipped with resolve, which is a great addition to Samurai Champloo’s thematics. Furthermore, Fuu is what makes the trio of herself, Mugen, and Jin function in the way the author intended the process to be. As a victim of an isolated past, She is more or less ready to go through thick and thin, along with the companionship of her bodyguards.  Fuu isn’t inherently my favorite character like most others, but she is bound to be appreciated, notably through her methodical writing direction towards the last half of Champloo, involving the theme to avoid dwelling on what you can't change.

Samurai Champloo’s core themes lie within discovering purpose. It communicates the message that life has no narrative, no plot, which notions toward the reason why the show intentionally pushes the plot away for 20+ episodes. At the start, we're given the vain attempt of finding the samurai that smells of sunflowers, despite sunflowers having no smell. Now, it's essentially a wild-goose chase that by the end of it, unconditionally means nothing, a foolish unattainability the show presents it as. Mugen and Jin believe that finding stronger enemies to kill is their purpose in life, albeit after their experiences, Samurai Champloo showcases that companionship vastly outweighs living for the sake of violence and more influential, past dilemmas. This odyssey explores the dichotomy of solitude and isolation. Being alone breeds rich togetherness. Discovering purpose never lies within following the orthodox path to success that is “meant for you"", as it doesn't exist. It’s about finding the right people who'll instead voyage with you throughout the joys and difficulties. The destination can never rival nor compare to the journey that created those unforgettable memories you made during companionship. Ultimately, what matters is having the right people who'll change you for the better and who'll be by your side through thick and thin."

Oregairu is a really interesting series. Its tone shift from season 1 to season 2 was one of the most ballsy stunts I’ve ever seen an anime pull. Even at the expense of possibly losing a large chunk of their audience, they went for it with an unparalleled payoff. Oregairu is a piece of media that has truly transcended its genre while still keeping what made the original so good. One of the most important aspects of season one that carried into season 2 was the intense overdramatization of the scenarios throughout the show.

High school is a different experience for everyone, but one thing that most people seem to agree on is that the moment you’re living in right now feels more important than it should. Irrationally so. That is why the fact that Oregairu seems so overdramatic at times is an amazing rhetorical device that resonates throughout the whole show. From the moment that the show begins, we can clearly see that this is a different show than its predecessor: unfittingly beautiful visuals, a much darker color palette, and deviant character designs. This is the same show, right? It’s not the same light-hearted comedy we came to love anymore. This is something else. In season 1, the main way we see overdramatization was through the eyes of Hachiman. Every seemingly small thing, he scrutinized to the limit. Every single second he breathed; he would find a way to mention his backstory. For the most part, this carries over into the second season as well. This time however instead of Hachiman having to explain to us why the scene is so wrong to him, it is carried out by the medium itself. The directors never shy away from inserting sad music, using dark and contrasting color palates, and beautiful scenes and characters. This is done with a purpose in mind. Oregairu communicates what it means to be in the stage of your life, through these elements. Oregairu is overdramatic on purpose. The problems in Oregairu are not complex, if you were looking for a show with a complex and convoluted plot, there is a lot to choose from. I would go as far as to say that even the characters are not fleshed out as they could be in the traditional sense. Oregairu relies on its masterful execution to tell a story. As I said before, you live in the now during high school. Everything matters more than it should, and as a result, you stress about meaningless things. Oregairu is a piece of media that perfectly exemplifies that. The reason why the visuals and audio are so dramatic and overdone for seemingly trivial high school problems is that this is what the world feels like when you’re going through that phase in your life. The problems that these characters face are not really that big. However, to the eyes of a high school, who have a multitude of other things to worry about like college applications and their own health, their minds still find ways to worry about these seemingly irrelevant things. These “small” problems still seem to hold weight in a world where there are so many other things to worry about. This overdramatization is also a reason why some of the themes in this show are so easily able to shine through. Primarily the theme of how people have a really hard time thinking logically. Just as the anime itself, is over the top, people similarly, think of things in a very similar manner. In Oregairu, there are a lot of instances where the over the top visuals and audio are necessary because we, the audience, are looking at these problems through the lens that Yuigahama, Yukinoshita, or Hachiman would look at them through.

In the end, I don’t think I’ve ever been happier and warmer watching an anime before. There were times when I wanted to smile and realized I’m already grinning wide as possible. I write this because, I was a high school up until quite recently, as such, this anime really struck a chord in me. Thank you for reading."
226,"Due to what are apparently masochistic tendencies, I've subjected myself to a lot of bad anime. This got me thinking. I asked myself ""what is the worst anime I've ever seen?"" I thought this over for a few moments, and gave myself this answer: ""Elfen Lied. Elfen Lied is the worst anime I've ever seen.""

Elfen Lied is essentially about monster girls with psychic powers behaving violently in response to humans being shit. One monster girl tries escaping and actually manages to succeed, but loses her memory in the process, reducing her to a vegetable who only goes ""Nyu!"" She winds up in the care of a boy and his female cousin, whose names I've forgotten and can't be assed to look up.

There are a few things to like about Elfen Lied. The first is the soundtrack. By this, I mean that there's a good song (used for the OP) that is repeated through the soundtrack ad nauseum in slightly different ways. The second is the potential it had. There were a few themes that could have been fairly solid. But we'll get to those when we talk about what was bad. Which happens to be now!

Any good of Elfen Lied is far outweighed by what's bad. I could be wrong since I don't really have an eye for animation or direction, but I don't remember it being particularly impressive. In fact, I think I remember laughing at how poorly things were animated at a few points. The English voice acting is lackluster, even by dub standards, and I've heard the Japanese acting isn't all that impressive either. Maybe not bad, but certainly not any points in the show's favor. Let's talk about things I can more definitively say are bad.

I hate to throw around buzzwords, but I can't think of a way to describe Elfen Lied's shortcomings without saying that it tries way too hard to be edgy. There is plenty of gratuitous violence, gore, and nudity, as well as themes relating to the darkness of human nature. It is possible for these elements to make a show good. Elfen Lied, however, utterly fails on that account. It assumes that these things are inherently good, so it makes no further effort. There are many stories in various forms of media that have combined sex and violence in ways that make both more appealing. Elfen Lied seems to be vaguely aware of this idea and has tried to emulate it to ill effect. Instead of having these two elements emphasize each other, they are simply thrown together so that hey both exist. The result is that they cancel each other out. The nudity makes the violence ridiculous, and the gore makes the nudity unsexy.

Worse than that is the theme, which weaves through the plot. Elfen Lied is about monster girls called Diclonii who can kill people with their brains. The government experiments on these Diclonii, because humans are scumbags. This bit is important, we'll come back to it later. One Diclonius, named Lucy, attempts to escape. She succeeds, brutally murdering half the facility in the process, but a sniper shoots her in the head. Not fatally, mind you. Only enough to give her brain damage, because the plot requires that she become literally [redacted] for a while in order to work. She is found and taken in by a boy named Kohta and his female cousin Yuka.

The government is not fond of Lucy escaping and murdering, so they send a bunch of Diclonius after her. Her murderous side conveniently reemerges when she is in danger. As the series progresses, the government continues to try to bring Lucy down, while flashbacks slowly reveal Lucy's past. Spoilers follow:

!It is revealed that, as a child, Lucy was bullied for being a Diclonius. We see a scene in an orphanage where, after Lucy makes friends with a puppy, a bunch of children beat it to death in front of her. She then uses her mind-explodey powers and reduces them to strawberry jam. Later, it turns out that Lucy and Khota ended up meeting each other, and he was about the only human who was ever nice to her. Then, one day, Khota's like ""Sorry, can't hang out with you today. I've made plans with my cousin to go to a festival"" and Lucy's all ""Is this cousin a boy or a girl?"" and for whatever reason, Khota lies and says that she's a boy. Lucy finds out about the lie and murders Khota's father and sister in revenge. Because even as a child she wanted his dick and was apparently terrified that he'd fall for a blood relative instead of her. Though in fairness, he and his cousin totally do start falling for each other over the course of the season, because incest is edgy and that's how Elfen Lied rolls.!

Ultimately, the series hammers in how much life sucked for Lucy and how horribly everyone always treated her, and how that turned her into a murderous monster. Because humans are trash, you see. We're cruel to anything that's different from us. This on its own isn't an inherently bad idea to explore. There are plenty of ways it can be handled well. But once again, Elfen Lied fails on that front. Instead of showing realistic human cruelty, it subjects us to the most blatant, over-the-top, cartoon villain evil it can find. Men abusing women isn't funny, but when a man randomly backhands a woman in an early episode, entirely unprovoked, I can't help but laugh. It's such a hamfisted way of attempting to show that a character is evil. There were so many times that I didn't know whether I should be laughing or whether I should just be disgusted at how much Elfen Lied was insulting my intelligence. There's making a point, and then there's flat-out misanthropy. Guess which side of that line Elfen Lied is on?

Elfen Lied is an anime that not only failed to do anything correctly, it flat-out insulted my intelligence and insulted me as a person by implicating that, as a human being, I was terrible simply for existing. Maybe, in the hands of someone more talented, Elfen Lied could have become an average series. If that were the case, it would have at least had the decency to be forgettable. But no, it decided that if it couldn't achieve greatness, it would at least manage to succeed at being terrible enough to be remembered, dammit! And the worst part is, because this was one of the first ""edgy"" anime to gain relative success in the West, there are a lot of people who are actually under the mistaken impression that this is good. It's not. Worst anime I've seen. One star."
18897,"“You can't achieve anything if you don't make a move. Love is an all-out assault.” - Marika Tachibana

Nisekoi. A story of promises and love, and the development of love and relationships. My first impressions of this anime were pretty good, especially with a talented vocal cast doing the magic behind some of the main characters. The storyline was interesting and mysterious, and we were quickly introduced to what we should expect moving forward. As the story progressed though, it was soon apparent to me that i wasn’t going to get much progression on the storyline in Season 1. Instead, more characters were introduced and we got a bit more character development with them. I also noticed that this anime leaned more towards its comedy side instead if its romance side, because it was definitely full of funny moments and interactions. Overall though, how did it do? Well, lets see!

Art and Animation: 9.1/10

Is this much of a surprise? With a studio like Shaft, its very hard to notice any slip-ups in quality. Character designs were well animated, and we had also gotten those signature camera angles we all love from Shaft. The color palette was neither overused or lacking, but was well balanced for each scenario to add to the immersion. There weren’t any stiff animation problems that were obvious to me either, which is always a huge plus. When it came down to facial expressions and body language, Shaft had done a beautiful job in conveying the characters emotions and attitude through their body language and facial expressions. This is where Nisekoi was most consistent in my opinion, as we were able to see Shaft work their magic.

Storyline and Character Progression: 7.8/10

This is where Nisekoi fell off the most for me. In the beginning, things looked like they were progressing quite smoothly with the progression of the characters as well as the occasional addition of other characters. Soon though, it felt like we were getting a bunch of fillers that were neither important to the plot nor the development of any of the characters. Even the original goal of the entire anime: the locket, seemed to be just forgotten and insignificant at some points. It went from being a top priority and something special to the main protagonist, to something that could be left on the backburner and handled whenever. This change in behavior so suddenly was very confusing to me, and i just couldn’t get why it would change in priority so drastically. Sure, i could understand him getting to the locket another time, but outright just having little interest in opening it all of a sudden when you CLEARLY have the tools to get to the truth? This didn’t fit the main protagonists personality at all to me, with this wishy washy attitude. Also, while this anime did have its moments, it was definitely a more Com anime instead of Rom. There were plenty of funny moments to spare, and cute moments here and there too. As for the romance aspect of things, this too was mostly put in a comedic light. So there wasn’t much romantic progression in the first season of this anime. So if you like your Romcom with a bit more drama or spice, this may not be the one for you necessarily. As far as Character Progression goes, we do get a bit of it here and there. But its more-so focused and devoted to whole episodes. So when we get a sort of “filler” episode, thats all that it is. But when we get an episode on a character, its sole focus is on developing them more. Like i said earlier though, there isn’t much ROMANTIC progression. As this anime mostly handles romantic situations in a comedic light. This ultimately is up to preference, but i personally would’ve preferred to have the romance part of this anime the be handled a bit more seriously to add more depth to the storyline and situations.

Soundtrack and Audio: 8.6/10

This was balanced with both an average soundtrack and really great quality voice acting. The soundtrack was straightforward enough, and was great quality in some parts thanks to the help of ClariS. Nothing really AMAZING stood out though to be both emotional or memorable for me to drive the point home. As i mentioned earlier, i have almost no complaints when it comes to the quality of the vocal cast. They had succeeded in expressing sincere emotion when playing their roles. This is always such an important part of an anime in order to maintain or further progress a viewers immersion, so im glad they did such a great job with this.

Overall, Nisekoi had both its really strong points and obvious weak points. Despite all of this though, i believe this anime can be considered a classic in the Romcom genre because of how it executes all the usual tropes, cliches, and overall direction of storyline. Its still a good anime, but it just has some very apparent flaws that prevents me from fully investing myself into the storyline. If the storyline was handled a bit better in terms of priority and execution, im sure this anime could’ve been a truly memorable one. As for now though, this anime scores as right on the average line for me with an 8.5/10. It was by no means awful, but still had enough mistakes to be considered average to me. Thanks so much for reading this far, and i hope this helps paint a better picture of whether Nisekoi is your type of anime to watch. I’d definitely recommend it to someone in the romcom genre or just looking for a lighter romance storyline for sure. Until next time, see you in the next one!

171018,"Maybe it's because I'm losing interest in the genre, or maybe it's that I've watched too many, but romance anime is getting very repetitive. I'm always looking for something with a twist- a change from boring student council arcs and thirsty harems. There are exceptions of course, but the consensus is that the same tropes are being exhausted. 

Romance Shounen seems like a good idea! 

Most Shounen romances suffer from the same thing- there is almost no room in the plot for the main leads to bond, as it is mostly fighting. There are two that I can think of as exceptions: [Sword Art Online](https://anilist.co/anime/11757/Sword-Art-Online/) & [Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks](https://anilist.co/anime/19603/Fatestay-night-Unlimited-Blade-Works/). They both have good romance, but the tone of the story isn't funny and cheerful, the glue for a good romance.

And that's where DAN DA DAN comes in.


★ Okarun is a nerdy and socially awkward guy who loves to talk about aliens and UAPs (UFOS). He has always been bullied for his interests and awkwardness - resulting in an inferiority complex.

Okarun first meets Momo when she saves him from being bullied.

★ Momo is a feisty, bold, and aggressive ""popular girl"" who is intimidated by almost nothing. She has just broken up with her boyfriend, as she really only dated him because he looked like her favorite actor.

Momo believes in ghosts, and Okarun believes in aliens. Neither of them thinks the other is sane, and they want to prove each other wrong. So they both go to places where aliens and ghosts should be, proving that aliens and ghosts do in fact exist.

DAN DA DAN is about two kids fighting aliens and ghosts while falling in love.


DAN DA DAN isn't for everyone. And that's a fact. The first episode has Momo chained down in a chair while aliens try to take her genitals. Just by hearing that you can probably guess that the show will have many more things like this to come, and you'd be right. Nothing ever happens when the aliens chain Momo down, and I think that also speaks volumes about the story. There are crazy scenes that have outrageous things happening like a demon asking for Okaruns banana, but they are clearly there for lighthearted fun. The “plot” of the story is Okarun trying to get his balls back after an alien took them (plus the romance). And if that doesn't sound like your thing, then DAN DA DAN isn't for you. 

I know a lot of people don't like fanservice, so I'll say this: There is almost no direct fanservice in the whole series except for weird alien moments like the one mentioned at the beginning. The only direct fanservice is Momo's grandma, and even that is rare. The author of the series doesn't add unnecessary sexual innuendoes and that earns a lot of respect.


The chemistry and pacing are some of the best I've seen, and not in the way you think. 

DANDADAN is weird because the confession doesn't feel important. Most romances out there have the clear goal of confession, where weak points in the plot are the catalyst for entertainment, while Momo and Okaruns relationship thrives off of pure chemistry and learning what it means to understand. Now there are points in the story where problems in their relationship arise, but they aren't dragged on for countless episodes. The reason that this works so well is because of the characters, and how they view human connection. Okarun has obviously lacked connection all his life, so when something comes up, he understands the importance of making it right with the other person. Momo on the other hand, is a ""popular girl"" that doesn't really have trouble making friends- though these friends clearly dont value their relationship as much as Okarun. I love Momo as a character, because she's a likeable ""half"" [Tsundere](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=tsunedere+definstion&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) that can be harsh at times but realizes what shes doing is wrong, unlike every other female lead. (cough cough [Taiga](https://anilist.co/character/12064/Taiga-Aisaka) cough cough [Alya](https://anilist.co/character/217334/Alisa-Mikhailovna-Kujou)  cough cough [Chitoge](https://anilist.co/character/48391/Chitoge-Kirisaki) ) 

What I'm really trying to get at is that 70% of the reason this works is because of Okarun. 

A lot of people praise [ Hachiman](https://anilist.co/character/67065/Hachiman-Hikigaya) because hes ""relatable"" and a ""loner"" but I think that Okarun is a million times better. Comparing these two seems weird as these anime aren't similar at all, but I'm using it as a baseline to say this: 

Okarun is the one of the most relatable and real male leads I have ever seen.


The fight scenes in DANDADAN are beautiful and full of color, thanks to [Science Saru](https://anilist.co/studio/6145/Science-SARU). Momo and Okarun work together as a team, patching together their weaknesses, and most importantly, adding comedic relief while sprinkling in some cute moments. There's nothing bad I can say about the action.

DANDADAN is MUCH different as it's structured more as a slice of life, with there not really being an end goal like One Piece for example (actually I guess Okarun getting his balls back could be it.) The balance between romance and fight scenes is awesome, as you'll get some episodes full of Okarun and Momo growing closer, beautiful fights, and incredible backstories that make you cry ([9.7 on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33609042/?ref=ttepep7)).

Though DANDADAN might not sound like its for everyone, I think it marks a turning point in romance.

If you have any feedback/thoughts, reply to this thread! Id love to talk about the show. https://anilist.co/activity/830705347"
21518,"“Ermm... I am Souma Yukihira. Truth be told, I did not expect to be admitted in this academy. I do not plan on losing to some bunch, who never stood in front of clients. I will use all of you as stepping stones. Now that I am here, I will take the top.”-- Souma Yukihira

Food Wars!, or Shokugeki no Soma is a Japanese shounen manga series, which was written by Yuuto Tsukuda and illustrated by Shun Saeki. Due to big success, the manga received an anime adaptation by J.C.Staff, which aired between April 3, 2015 and September 25, 2015 and a second season, which began airing on July 2, 2016. The new season continues after the qualifying test with curry dishes. Eight contestants have entered the quarterfinal of Autumn Elections: Souma, Megumi, Takumi, Hisako, Alice, Kurokiba, Hayama, and Mimasaka. Their next challenge is bento. (Note: bento is a single-portion takeout or home-packed meal common in Japanese cuisine. A traditional bento includes rice, fish or meat, with pickled, or cooked vegetables, usually in a box-shaped container. While bento can be bought all over Japan (you can buy them almost everywhere in Japan), Japanese try to prepare bento for their relatives, with a great care. That said, bento is something very important for all Japanese; it has been a part of Japanese history for almost 831 years). What new dishes will Souma, Megumi, Takumi, Hisako, Alice, Kurokiba, Hayama, and Mimasaka have to cook, who is going to be the best, and how is Totsuki Saryou Ryori Gakuen going to implement their Totsuki Saryou Ryori Gakuen stagiaire program—are the main three questions the new season will try to answer.

The animation and sound are on the level. Not only character designs, but also the food makes you want to cook something delicious. The creators of Food Wars! spend enough time and money on the animation, making cooking look more like a fistfight than anything else. The sound and the voice acting; however, deserve a special mention. The OST is so awesome that it helps you to dive into the atmosphere of this series and to be more prepared for what is about to happen. Truth be told, I have never called a shounen “epic”, but thanks to the OST of Food Wars! I can say that this anime is truly epic sometimes. But the OST is not the only thing that I should mention, the voice acting is also amazing: all characters seem to be real, their emotions, their deeds; the Japanese cast did one hell of a job voicing their characters.

The characters are still the same, the only exception; however, is that some new supporting characters that will not do anything significant for the story, will take part in the new series. Anyways, the characters of Food Wars! are still far from being flawless: Souma is not perfect, sometimes you just do not want him to repeat all these cliché of his ancestors. (Not noticing that some girls love him, for example). But, at the same time, Souma is different because he is the true warrior, he is the true man. His aim to become the top, his aim to become the best, has not changed. He is also not a prodigy, he is not a billionaire, he is just a normal young man with his own dreams. He does not only win, and it has not changed in this season, but he still works hard and he is still able to surprise everyone. And I must say that his charisma is still very contagious. However, the main problem of this anime is supporting characters and it has not changed yet. They are so dull and boring that sometimes you just want to skip their scenes. Do not get me wrong, I am just trying to say that more attention should have been spent on the supporting characters.

As for enjoyment, the series is still very enjoyable and I would even say that the new season is more enjoyable than the first. Everything has become serious, and the second season of Food Wars is far from being a comedy now. Yes, it is still not flawless, and I would love to see more supporting characters’ development, but, at the same time, it is not something I would call “a very serious flaw.” Food Wars still has enough material for a new season and I hope that the third season will become even more epic than the previous two.

All in all, Food Wars has not changed at all: it is still epic and you just want it to never end. Without a doubt, it is still far from being flawless, and I would not recommend you to watch it, if you did not like the first season; however, for those who liked the first season, I am sure that Food Wars! The Second Plate will not disappoint you."
120697,"I feel a great need to wear surgical gloves as I type out this review, for fear of the shame trembling out from my fingertips and leaving a residue on my keyboard. Indeed, I've used this keyboard to lambaste a great variety of anime, and regardless of the words I've chosen, I have always taken to these reviews with a measure of pride. However after finishing Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san, I looked down at these keys, lovingly decorated with the vinyl Harry Potter stickers I bought on Etsy last year, and felt tangible embarrassment for the first time. For a moment, I couldn't believe that it's actually my job to watch and write about crap like this. I publicly set the show to 'dropped' because I didn't want my co-workers to see me watching it. Maybe I need a break. Or maybe the industry as a whole needs one, because I weep at the thought of the collective time it's wasted with series such as this.

Let me skip right to the apotheosis of this review: This show is cheap smut in everything but name. While there are a handful of self-deluding holdouts who pretend Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san has comedic value or narrative worth, the overwhelming majority of people who watch this show do so because they like the idea of being emasculated by an imperious woman. I've admittedly shared a similar fantasy since finishing Living History (2003), but that was an incidental, natural reaction to a stellar book. Nagatoro is, conversely, a shameless treadmill of fantasy-enabling gestures with no goalpost or meaning. From start to finish, the intended way to enjoy this show is to project yourself onto the frail, insecure, and utterly doomed male protagonist as he is incessantly tortured by a salacious girl. It subsists entirely upon that preexisting interest, and never once dares to venture beyond it. 

Simply put, it is a 12 episode-long lobotomy and it would be a waste of time to write about any particular scene because they all consist of the same premise: Nagatoro teases “senpai”, and a mistake or a misunderstanding results in the teasing being slightly more lewd than she intended. Roll credits. That's it, genuinely. There is no further context to be extracted from this shameless carnival of a series. I've covered it all.

For all intents and purposes, that's my review. There is, however, a pressing matter that deserves additional study. I am of course referring to the blistering controversy surrounding the show's localization. 


For the love of god, leave me alone. I know already. I had to watch for three days and nights as you animals argued about whether or not that specific localization choice counts as a war crime. I nearly ripped my eyelids off when my former friend Esposito drunkenly called me to ramble about “ethics in anime localization” because he was so pissed off about it. Let me clue you all in on a really scary fact: You have every reason to be worried about localization, because Moscow has been influencing it for years. I have seen some extremely malignant and untrue lines about the United States in anime subtitles, such as “It's an illegitimate settler state” and “their infrastructure sucks gorilla balls” (slightly paraphrasing). To spread their propaganda, hostile agencies target huge media platforms with undiscerning audiences, and anime is #1 in that category, closely followed by Marvel “movies”.


But the thing that finally spurs you all to action is a character in this dumpster-fire of a show saying ""Sus""? I don't know who or what is responsible for that one insignificant line, but I can promise you that it is, cosmically, the least significant issue you could ever have with subtitles. You need to be worried about the real problems, like unknowingly reading anime subs funded and influenced by notorious Russian mob-boss Semion Mogilevich. Ever wonder why you started humoring dangerous, economy-destroying ideas like nationalizing the hospitality industry after watching Little Witch Academia? You are not immune to propaganda. Direct your vigilance to a rational place.

Despite all my issues with Nagatoro, I can still recommend the show to the emotionally immature young men who comprise its target audience, although I'm not sure how they'd ever get around to it with so many Marvel movies and first person shooter games keeping them busy. As for me, I'm going to wash my hands of the show, because it's bloody dreadful. Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san gets a fat and definitive 3/10 from me. 

Please don't watch it."
19603,"If I'm being honest this has to be one of the best anime I have ever watched if not the best. The only thing that can compete against this anime for me is probably going to have to be Re:ZERO. Not watching the Prequel to this I don't believe was necessary due to the fact both anime spoil each other no matter which way you watch them. The way this show grabs on to you and hooks you into binge watching it is incredible, I've actually never felt so invested and hooked on to the characters before in any other anime, In fact I actually almost felt sad and depressed when it was over because I felt almost like I was actually in the show with the characters. This anime to me means so much because I had never felt the incredible feeling as I was watching it but there was a couple of minuscule things as I was watching I didn't like. Most of these are selfish but I believe adding these could have made this show a 100/100 for me personally. To start off I believe the romance between Emiya and Rin could have been advanced a little farther within the story, having Rin act all cute and embarrassed around Shirou was cute and all but could it have been better if she would have been a little more adventurous  with Shirou? Secondly having some sort of way where the warriors would have been able to stay or live with Shirou and Rin forever would have been great and also took off a lot of taxing depressed feeling you get when they say their last goodbye. Lastly this is probably one of the most generic things ever and probably the most ridiculous improvements would have to be make the seasons longer, I just personally felt so apart of the show and loved it so much it would have been great to keep that feeling a bit longer but beggars can't be choosers as they say. To finish off this review I believe this should be a must watch in anyone's book because the emotions stirred up throughout the show can't be compared to a regular anime I just firmly believe this anime is leagues above any other out there. One more thing before I leave this as is, you must give this the 3 episode rule because at the very start and introduction things may seem confusing or way out there but everything comes together once you keep watching I promise.

121,"From what I have seen, this is a show that goes rather untalked about because of the huge shadow Brotherhood has cast over it. And to my dismay, time and time again I see people who love Brotherhood, who either where unaware of its predessesor or just choose to ignore it. Which is a fact I'd love to change because 2003 is well worth watching, whether you loved or hated Brotherhood, as past a certain point the two are almost unrecognizable in both plot, themes and characters, and 2003 rivals Brotherhood in alot of ways. Whilst Brotherhood takes the story in the direction of an all out war with the entire military and beyond involved, 2003 tells a more personal tale about the brothers (seemingly on their own) against the world. We see them time and time again battle the military, or the humonculi and even Scar. And I think that in some aspects of this part of the anime, 2003 superseeds Brotherhood. For example the entire twist invovling The Fuhrer is basically cut from Brotherhood, where it is revealed in the first episode, wheras in 2003 it is something only hinted at for most of the series and only revealed towards the end. As well as this, the Homunculi, and in particular the character of Lust is much more interesting then her counterpart in Brotherhood, as instead of being a target for Roy to practice on, she has an entire arc spanning the shows run time where she becomes a really sympathetic villian and is one of the shows best characters. Another huge aspect to consider when comparing the too shows or just talking about 2003 is its production, which is very impressive for when it was released.!webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a360258ba9319fdb4314aeb28cb6efe8.mp4)!

Even though the series is now 18 years old some of its sakuga rivals anime airing today, and its soundtrack is absolutley phenomenal, almost every track is brilliant and makes every scene memorable and exciting. Its been along time since I watched FMAB so I cannot say anything about the ost in referene to that, but I will say that I consider Fullmetal Alchemist 2003's to be world class. Other then that, something else definatley worth note about FMA is its voice acting. (I cannot speak to the subs quality as i watched the dub and i have zero regrets) FMA has an amazing dubbed cast that really carry the emotions and motivations that their respective characters  hold dear. In particular I'd like to mention Ed and Al's VA's Vic Mignogna and Aaron Dismuke respectively, as their chemistry is brilliant and carries alot of the series.

Overall Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) is a fantastic show that everyone can and will enjoy if you give it a chance, and is 100% worth watching even if you have already watched Brotherhood

107660,"You know the saying: one should never judge a book by its cover? That goes for Beastars undoubtedly. Many people might dismiss it as an anime meant for furry lovers. While not even have given a proper shot first. Although, there are definitely those kinds of details here that could make one think that way. Beastars is a lot more than meets the eye, and should not get glossed over that easily. It's a story centered around anthropomorphized animals. Meaning they are human-like. At least when it comes to behavior, actions, feelings, and so forth. One can't merely justify everything with the front and go on with your day. That's a down-right insult. To [the author] Paru Itagaki masterful writing of this great story. Beastars is a coming-of-age tale about self-acceptance with psychological elements to explain or assess our characters thoroughly. 

What I mean by that, is Itagaki uses things like acting as a form to express one's psyche and what really makes one click. Let's see a person that comes off as genuine and caring, could actually hold some ill feelings, and those are realized through acting. There are many examples of such moments, and it's better to experience them yourselves since words can only accomplish so much. Moreover, Itagaki does a great job of exploring human emotions. Like how teenagers act, their frustration, issues, and so much more. Plus, the added bonus of animal instincts for both carnivore and herbivore. Our story centers around a young, naive male wolf Legosi who is living his life normally. Until one day, his beast instinct makes him accidentally injure a small animal. Legosi is thankfully able to stop himself in time before things get very dicey and dangerous. Legosi is a wolf that is scared of his instincts and of the fact that one day he may truly hurt someone to the point of no return. 

It's more than that, but Beastars is first and foremost Legosi's life and how he comes to terms with his nature as a wolf. Maybe he might ultimately give up and take a drastic measure. But that's up the audience to figure out for themselves. We feature three protagonists in total. All of them are likable and charismatic. Beside Legosi, there is Louis, who is a very striking person. His interactions with Legosi are some of the best I have seen. Their dialogue is so realistic and impactful. Both affect one another in either a positive or negative way. Then Haru, who is the main love interest for Legosi, and she has lots of personalities and is an overall lively character to watch. More importantly, she is a dwarf rabbit. So you can only imagine how the romance aspect will work when Legosi is a large and heavy wolf. Itagaki does, in fact, do a very sensible job of explaining those aspects, and it's realistic to boot. Haru and Legosi are not your typical protagonist who lacks common sense and a means to think for themselves. They get to an answer slowly over time. But while some of the setups could use more work. 

It didn't affect my enjoyment much, and the disappointment factor is overshadowed by all the greater points of Beastars. I can't forget mentioning the love-triangle we have in Beastars, which is properly executed, unlike some media and literature. It's hard to go into the nitty-gritty without spoiling some stuff, but essentially the logic of love seems to be more realistic when in action. As I've said prior, the main characters are not stupid and can make their own decisions. So the romance is not one-sided or feels lacking in substance. Both parties, through many trial and error, eventually start climbing the stair to adulthood on their own. While we're on the topic, there are some occurrences of close intimacy between our cast members. Some might find this slightly offensive if you are not used to seeing anthropomorphized animals in the act. It's to be expected because of the nature of the story. But a heads-up has never hurt anybody, so this is a fair warning. 

I will also throw this in here that he comedic elements in Beastars are quite funny. It's also big thanks to the voice actors. One of my favorites consists of a carnivore and herbivore recreating that one gold meme not knowingly. You know the one that a shota gets chased by a onee-san? That's the one, and it's down-right hilarious. I love how Orange cuts it from the carnivore walking to the herbivore running after them in a quick act. It'd add to the charm of that moment. When it comes to the story of Beastars, it's told uniquely, to make us feel as close to the characters as possible. Every decision or action someone could make is explained in a detailed manner through the use of inner monologuing. As an example, when Legosi was trying to stop a fight from escalating against carnivore smaller than him in size. He went through in his head any way possible to break the two from brawl without using his own nature as a wolf. This goes to add credibility when I implied Legosi lacks confidence in himself, and this possibly explains my other point as well.

When it comes to the art-style and the animation, it's full-on CGI but absolutely beautifully produced. Studio Orange is back in action from their top-notch adaptation of Houseki no Kuni. We see they have not lost their touch and are doing a good job of depicting the complex elements in Beastars. For instance, the psychological aspect or even the animal's appearance. While art-style might come off as simple in overall nature, it contains every detail unique to an animal. It's not shoddy or low quality, and Orange can be flexible if need be. The background is nothing short of stunning either since many of the scenes shown are no doubt wallpaper material. Nothing but praise for the CGI animation as well. It's quite fluid and versatile, as we saw during some of the action scenes we had. Yes, there are elements of gore, but it's definitely censored. But we had a man offering his finger for a huge amount of money on the street, and the sinister aura and gritty feeling still didn't fail to deliver the right emotions. 

Lastly, I have to throw a massive appreciation for the voice actors. They all did a superb job of putting themself in the shoes of their respective characters. I feel like most if not the whole cast voice acting was spot-on, and suiting them perfectly when it came to overall energy, personality, and appearances. That being said, Orange is not stopping there and takes a step further. Throughout Beastars, you can see them experiment with many things with their production value. A notable one was the play with different camera angles, or how the darker elements are shown on the screen. Whatever the case may be, Orange seems to be successful in all categories. That again goes to also complement the beautiful soundtrack and the many lovely and impacting insert songs we have here. The opening song is very fitting, and the jazzy nature somehow works too well with Beastars. It's a catchy tune that gets stuck in your from the first listen. Did I forget to mention, we have all those exquisite ending songs, which are different every episode? It's no doubt in my mind Orange is an epitome of what a CGI animation studio should aim to become like.

Now, what's actually negative about Beastars? There is, of course, some flaws here and there. If I had to point any fingers, it had to be the second half of the Beastars. We got this dangerous organization story out of literally nowhere, and it could've been fleshed out more and executed with the terms Itagaki set prior. What I mean is there are some cliche troupe here such as ""damsel in distress"" and twist around the story to a point it felt like your typical shounen. Itagaki does, however, conclude it on a satisfying note. All those loose ends that where setup previously was fully realized and got the conclusion it deserved. But some of the stuff in this one arc was definitely rushed, and I don't think Itagaki was in his right mind when writing this story arc. This is the only part that irked me slightly, but I didn't ruin my complete enjoyment either. I still had a blast with Beastars all the same. I am unquestionably going to read the manga at some point. For now tho I am gonna try my best to wait on the sequel, which was announced right after the ending credits. I'll probably jump on the manga once either the sequel concludes, or I get swallowed by my own curiosity to see more of this great story unfold.

Overall, Beastars is a unique story that centers around anthropomorphized animals, with profound and moving elements. And a somewhat tastefully executed romance that blossoms over time slowly. There are unquestionably people that won't like Beastars for many kinds of reasons. Still, I would highly recommend to give it a solid shot and let your eyes and heart be the judgmental core that leads you to a decision. You might be pleasantly surprised and come to love it. As many others might've while being reluctant to try it out first. I was one of those persons, and boy, am I glad I didn't gloss over Beastars. It's personally one of the best anime of 2019 to me, despite some flaws. I can only hope the sequel which will be coming very soon will be just as impactful, if not a lot more. Not to mention, the story on the level of something we saw in the early stages of Beastars. Anyway, it's one of those stories that might make a meaningful or massive imprint on you. But it's up to yourself to decide if it was positive or negative. I am the former personally."
98437,"“...Until we know more about this world, we must always move forward believing the enemy is stronger than us."" Ains-sama

Before getting into this second season, the one piece of advice that was constantly given to me was: “Be patient.” At first, I had no idea why I needed to be patient with an anime that was STUFFED with so much action and development. Within the first few episodes though, I soon realized why such advice was given to me. Overlord 2 is very different from its predecessor because of what it chooses to focus on for the main storyline. While we do still get to gaze upon the glory of Ains-sama, this season focuses more on the “behind the scenes” events of the servants under him. This may be a turn-off for some, especially when the first few episodes may seem like they have nothing to do with him. But I too will give you some advice, be......PATIENT. Everything soon seems to fall into place, and you’ll realize that it was all according to plan. So don’t worry! This season definitely has its strong points, one of these being in character development. Before we get any further into that, let’s get on with the review!

Art and Animation: 8.9/10
- In terms of pure consistency, I believe that this season performed the best out of the 3. My reason being that it played to its strengths, without much of the unneeded CGI. There were a lot of great characters added to the storyline, and I loved a lot of their designs. When it came to the action scenes, there were a lot of great moments that I’d definitely enjoy again if I ever did a rewatch. The character animations were very well done, with little to no mistakes in this department.

Storyline and Character Progression: 9/10
- While the storyline itself was very entertaining, it had suffered from a reasonably slow start. I personally enjoyed the newly added perspective of the servants of Ains-sama because it had given them a lot more depth. We were able to really see why they all hold Ains-sama in such high esteem, despite his lack of experience. This made for interesting character interactions that were able to develop them more as a relevant character while preserving the progression of the storyline. I never felt that a single episode was meant to be a filler, and this is thanks to the great pacing we see throughout the season. Even with the newly introduced characters, a select few of them received a lot of attention in order to hint at their possible motives. I really enjoyed watching as some of their personalities were revealed to be a lot more complex than what I first imagined them to be. The events later in the season were definitely worth the wait, and the 3-D chess was even more apparent. The only downside? VERY little Albedo.....

Soundtrack and Audio: 8.4/10
- All the amazing parts of the audio quality from the first season pretty much carried over into this next one. Even a lot of the newly introduced characters had some pretty decent voice actors, which maintained the atmosphere very well. The sound effects were also of the same great quality of the previous season. Only real complaint was the below average OP, it didn’t give me the same drive as an Overlord-worthy song. It lacked the true representation and energy that this season had to offer, but was ultimately saved because the ED was decent enough.

Overall, this seasons focus was definitely on character progression. It had executed this very well because it delivered events that had meaning to the storyline and to the characters themselves. The development felt very natural and unforced, which helped the overall enjoyment of watching a season with ample Ains-sama. You really got to grow a greater appreciation for the servants as you saw some of them work behind the scenes in their day-to-day activities. And the things that they did were far from uninteresting, because even the servants of the great Ains-sama see some action from time to time! When it comes down to it, just be patient and enjoy the new perspective this season has to offer. I can guarantee you won’t be disappointed once the ball gets rolling and Ains-sama takes the stage once again! I’m comfortable giving this an 8.7/10 because while everything was great, it definitely felt like a platform for the next season. That’s all for now, thank you so much for reading and I’ll see you in the next one!

4898,"Is Black Butler worth a first-time watch today? Probably Not, Unless…

Disclaimer where one is due: This is review is much more subjective than it is objective. My approach to recommendations is based on personal experience and how much I enjoyed a work rather than a critical rating. This review is also less about analyzing specific qualities so much as outlining what to expect from Black Butler for the uninformed. Anyway...

Overview:
To me, Black Butler will always be the epitome of a ""middle-school anime,"" a show that is easily digestible enough for a younger audience, while ""darker themes"" serve as a point of intrigue. The ideal time to watch Black Butler is as a young teenager with chipped black nails and a plastic choker. All that is to say that any present-day enjoyment of Black Butler has much to do with indulging nostalgia. I feel that the modern culture around anime has grown past this silly show as the anime community expects media that is not only entertaining, but a genuinely good story besides. Black Butler is much more the former than the latter. This is not a show I would recommend to anyone looking for something substantially meaningful. If you start with high expectations, you will be thoroughly disappointed. But I can't, in good conscious, fully disparage Black Butler without outlining why I will still find myself sneaking in rewatches like a midnight cookie. 

Problems:

Black Butler is a ridiculous show, and it knows it most of the time. I would call it campy if it did not, in the same breath, want me to take seriously some truly outrageous melodrama that resorts to child sexual abuse to shock the viewer. Oh yes, that is indeed here, though much more egregious in later seasons than the first. Black Butler has a habit of using shock value, both in gore and abuse. This is not to say those things can't exist in shows and be portrayed well, but Black Butler is not that show. Even if its handling wasn't so clumsy, the abrupt tonal shifts of the cast's looney-tunes antics would give the watcher a whiplash like no other. Black Butler has no shortage of slapstick humor and the like on the other end of this show's spectrum. This is no problem on its own but, as stated before, can be a bizarre dissonance. One of Black Butler's most significant objective flaws is the Flanderization of its cast. Many side characters introduced with intrigue - Grell being a prime example - are later relegated to these one-note gags stuck on repeat any time they are on screen. It is not nearly entertaining enough to not get old and could potentially bastardize characters you might want to care about. If you think this would bother you, Black Butler is not your show. 

The series also has an often...uncomfortable portrayal of adolescent boys, with Ciel the shining star. We all know that anime has its problems with sexualizing very youthful characters. Black Butler teeters on the knife's edge of what could be seen as ""acceptable."" This does not even have to do with Ciel's penchant for gothic-lolita-like fashion and crossdressing - I couldn't care less - instead, the show lives on its boys-love baiting between Ciel and his very-adult demon butler. Prepare for plenty of scenes like Ciel Phantomhive in his barely butt-length nightshirt being tucked into bed or a gag where we're shown a close-up on Ciel moaning Sebastian's name only to pan out and see him struggling with a tight corset. I am far from a prude, but I think it's important that prospective viewers know about this aspect of Black Butler before they watch it. There is, of course, the part of Black Butler's audience that lives for this sort of thing, but I would rather not think about them. If you think this would bother you, Black Butler is not your show. 

Black Butler is also not a very narratively-complex series. I would best cast it as a hot-topic victorian-England soap opera given anime form. It is some of the hottest trash out there, but you might enjoy this particular strain of garbage if it's to your tastes. You're not going to get anything beyond a demon butler and the boy of English nobility who bosses him around, the cults they dissect, and the different supernatural beings they face. No battle hype, no breathtaking animation (the quality is like downright cardboard sometimes). The premise is, to be fair, decently intriguing, one about a child orphan forced to grow up too fast and a demon preying on that vulnerability by becoming a servant in exchange for consuming his soul after death. But if you want to see his concept at its full potential, you will have to imagine it yourself. It often amounts to not much more than set dressing. 


Now, For What Black Butler Does Right:

If you are someone who enjoys watching something stupid and comfortable with this stupidity, Black Butler might be for you. It's low-brow anime edge at its finest, but with a certain je ne sais quoi that sets it apart. Somehow, its iconically eclectic cast, baffling tonal whiplash, peculiar alternate history, and occasionally genius art direction have, by working together, endured to me what would otherwise be just a bad show. I can't help but feel affection any time I see Ciel or Grell out in the wilds of the internet or a fourteen-year-old in a busted Sebastian cosplay at an anime con. Black Butler's charm is linked with nostalgia, yes, but that nostalgia would not exist in the first place if there wasn't a little something to earn it. 

Final Note:
In my opinion, the ideal watching experience would consist of nothing beyond the first season and, if you truly want more, perhaps the Book of Atlantic movie, which gives a lot of love to the often-neglected side characters such as the Shinigami, and even beyond that is a lot of dumb fun for anyone who ever wanted to see what would happen if there were zombies on the Titanic. Yes, the actual Titanic. What did I say about guilty pleasure? I absolutely mean it about not touching the later seasons, though... I would mark those as the point where Black Butler's flaws far outweigh its charms. 

Thank you for reading! This is my first review on this site and it's a bit all over the place, I know. All the same, I hope it could be helpful."
14227,"it feels like my little monster starts out fine, sets up the idea that we are going to have a series of miscommunications and so on, you're like ok cool we get confessions episode one so lets get on this rollercoaster. but the characters fall flat. the backstories of haru and shizuku who are supposed to be so bad at socializing aren't explored in a way that explains them properly. (such as, shizuku being lonely since childhood and haru being... what, stifled by his dad and dealing with his dead mom?) the cause and effect simply isn't clear. 

more importantly, the characters don't progress enough on an individual basis. especially haru, which makes him unlikeable and ultimately makes the viewer not want to root for him and shizuku to end up together.... which is kind of the point of this whole story. (i.e., having him threaten yamaken's life because he his jealous of the time he is spending with shizuku, repeatedly disrespecting shizuku's personal boundaries, accidentally hurting her in his violent outburtsts.) and with shizuku, she never learns truly to consider other's needs. her problems pale in comparison to haru's though. 

also, especially during the latter half of the show, it has a tendency to solve problems between characters in an unfulfilling and even problematic way at times. natsume, the girl who's set up as someone who has trouble standing up for herself and gets bullied constantly by other girls because boys won't stop hitting on her, is the one who gets dealt one of the worst hands with this. it's just shitty writing to make a character like this have to apologize to the group of boys who won't stop tormenting her with their desire when she finally blows up on them. it's a shame because the dialogue between characters when they're talking about how they feel is actually good, but then they do something like tell this fucking girl to apologize. okkkk. or like when the audience is told shizuku should feel bad for telling haru to respect her space. HELLO? what the fuck is this. i think the writers confused having her regard her friends needs, for letting ppl have their way with her. i dont fucking get it. the show has a good mix of personalities and tropes and then after episode 6 all the writers exposed themselves for either being Men or being women who fetishize being in a relationship with a psycho who will kill someone who looks at you. 

i think the most interesting thing about this was the relationship between shizuku and yamaken which is fucking stupid because he's just some arrogant guy. but they actually wrote him to change. to be interested in her, which was big for him, and then to go out of his way to help and offer council when she didn't know what to do about haru. or maybe it's just that haru's behavior was so fucking cringey that i was relieved to see this poor bitch shizuku spend any iota of time with another person who wasn't him. 

stupidly, the fact it was only 13 episodes combined with the drama between the characters did keep me watching because i was genuinely curious as to what it would look like when haru and shizuku finally got together. EXCEPT. they DIDN'T!!!!!! around 10 the episodes start geting more and more off track and finally it's like... oh shit. they thought they were going to have a season two. 

and i looked at the synopsis for the volumes in the manga and i gotta say. even if they thought they were going to get a season two. they really set up the backstories so shittily that i dont think it would have fixed a thing. 

such a shame. what a waste of a fun group of characters."
20458,"Edit 2023: Leaving up for historical reasons, I don't fully agree with everything I said here anymore.

This review contains a minor spoiler in the fifth paragraph about the main characters abilities.

Irregular at Magic Highschool is probably the most infuriatingly incompetent anime I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Do not watch this. Just save yourself the pain and don't. Writing, story, characters, plot, animation, sound, every single part of this anime is mediocre to average, barely scraping an acceptable pass or failing entirely due to its sheer lack of trying.

Pretty much all that happens in the story is this, but three times: Some random terrorist organization with no clear or sensible motive that is set up as bad because they want to shoot people or whatever makes a stupid move to piss off the main character. Main character strolls in and kills or captures everyone without any difficulties because he is a god, end plot arc. Riveting stuff, truly. Not even kidding, this same plot happens three times, with very minor variations in scenario. And yet, the presentation of this story somehow still manages to be janky and weird even with how basic it is. I often found myself confused as to why I was even being shown something. Many scenes could simply be removed and nothing would change, due to being completely pointless or introduced in such a confusing way or way too early so that you forget about them by the time they are relevant. If the story wasn't already lacking anything compelling, the writing is something a tenth grader could write, causing actions that are meant to make me care more about the story or characters to fall completely flat.

Well, what if you want to watch for the characters? It's simple really, don't. Almost all of the characters, dare I say maybe even every single one, are forgettable and bland basic characters that have been boiled down to one or two simple personality traits, along with no character development throughout the entire runtime. None of the characters changed from episode one to the last episode in any meaningful way, they're all exactly the same. This is partly due to trying to handle too many characters, many got barely any screen time to the point where you almost forget they exist. The main character is the worst of them all, the writers were clearly trying so god damn hard to make him the most badass character ever, giving him way too many abilities, taking away his emotions so he seems cooler, and writing in a bunch of cheesy lines.

Interested in the lore and universe? Don't watch for that either. The backstory makes barely any sense when scrutinized, as no explanation is given for any of the presented history and it doesn't hold up much to common sense. The world is pretty much just modern day, even though it's eighty years in the future with magicians, plenty of what is shown could be made today or is made today, this problem being especially prevalent in the beginning of the anime. But don't even get me started on the magic system itself. Every time they introduce a new spell or element they try and explain how it works, great right? Except every single explanation in this godforsaken anime is a bunch of technobabble nonsense using made up words that are never clearly defined. It took me approximately fifteen episodes to even have an elementary grasp of the simplest and most vital of the terms they use to explain every other phenomenon. Even then it's only a rudimentary understanding that still leaves you with no actual comprehension if you stop for even two seconds to try and figure out how any of this magic actually works. This is a huge over-arching theme with the explanations in Irregular at Magic, is that every single one is missing some huge key point that fits it all together, but without this piece, it all is just nonsense babbling filling the time slot. This is never fixed in any of the twenty-six episodes.

Another huge problem is how there is never any tension in the plot, as every situation is dealt with by some new ability of the main character that we haven't seen until now. And every time it happens, every other character is shocked because it is some top secret military tech or some new tech created by the main character. They then give one of those infamous technobabble explanations that don't really help you understand anything at all then move on. What makes the lack of tension or stakes even worse is that the enemies they face are almost all idiots, especially in the first half of the anime. Anyone who is not on the side of the main cast instantly loses about fifty IQ points. As well as that, anything that is thrown at the main cast is handled with extreme ease. Guns, mechs, tanks, bombs, everything is dealt with as if it was a marble thrown by a toddler. What is even worse is that by the ending episodes it has devolved to the point where even if a character were to die it isn't a big deal because we can literally just regenerate them instantly. Where are the stakes at that point? The most egregious part, and I cannot stress this enough, is how over-powered the main character is. He has so much power he is on the level of a god. I cannot comprehend a situation in which he would ever be defeated, apart from possibly, maybe being sabotaged, somehow. What do you even do when your character is so powerful that there is not a single scenario I can foresee where he would ever be defeated? There are simply no stakes at all by the time you know the full extent of his powers. Even before he starts using the full extent, he can still bring down almost anyone he wishes while barely trying.

On top of all the other terrible factors, the animation is simple and basic, the absolute minimum that is acceptable to look at all decent. It only barely scrapes by as looking okay, with the barest of movements for characters to look alive, even at the peak moments of the story. They also made the terrible decision to employ 3D CG throughout some of the more difficult scenes, and while I can handle a little use of 3D in the right places, they go overboard here. There is some truly terrible CG, but the true sin is how they went and used it for a major portion of the final few episodes, making what I assume are meant to be formidable mechs and interesting fight scenes look laughable.

Audio work is also barely passable. The opening is extremely average and nothing new or special at all, and the background music often just sounds like a bunch of crap being mashed together. Need it to sound techy? Add in a bunch of annoying computer-sounding bleeps. Sports event? Add in some whistles or something who cares even at this point. There was never once a piece of music or sound work that actually stood out at all. It was all just passing.

The entirety of Irregular at Magic Highschool is the definition of aiming for a passing grade and not going any further. If you stripped the entire anime down to the most bare-bones form, then fleshed it out with good content, it would be fine. But that isn't saying much as, instead, we are dealing with this trash heap. Everything combines to create a boring, generic, brainless piece of nonsense. There is not a single thing I can find to praise. Save yourself the time, and watch something better."
130298,"The Eminence in Shadow is a dark fantasy Isekai, action-comedy light novel by  Aizawa Daisuke. The first 2 volumes were adapted into a 20-episode anime series by Studio Nexus. I haven't watched any of their previous works, but the popular opinion is that this is their best anime.



The story at first seems like a generic Isekai, with an overpowered anti-villain MC and his equally overpowered harem organization, where they fight and hunt the evil cult that controls the world or whatever. 

So why is The Eminence in Shadow so enjoyable? I believe it all points toward the MC, Cid Kagenou. 

When you look at Cid, you’d think he is as bland as his Kirito clone design, but the genius lies in his characterization... to put it bluntly, he is an unbelievable psychopath. 

Cid is a character that suffers from a severe case of chūnibyō. His goal is to become “The Eminence in Shadow” aka some unstoppable Batman wizard that fights in the shadows and wears all black and shit. 

The very 1st episode shows his life before being Isekaid. The viewer sees his delusions firsthand and how severe they are, as he literally went around assaulting criminals as a discount high schooler Daredevil. His insanity is further elevated when you realize how he died, by bashing his head against a rock he screams about magic and then willingly throws himself in front of truck-kun. 

Upon being reincarnated he quickly becomes the strongest with supernatural dumb luck. The gods of Anime essentially said, “fine be an OP Isekai mf”. He creates the secret identity as Shadow, and tries his best to look cool and edgy while acting like a wimp in his real identity.  He essentially roleplays in his new life. 



While killing bandits and laughing like a maniac, he saves a bunch of girls and gifts them powers, they become his followers and form the organization Shadow Garden, with the goal of defeating an evil cult... That Cid made up.  

BUT it turns out to actually exist, by some weird dumb coincidence. Only Cid becomes oblivious to this fact, his followers end up expanding his organization, recruiting numerous new members, and creating multi-million-dollar businesses to support their master’s 6D chess plan, which he himself doesn’t even know exists. 

The humor is subjective as the anime’s main gimmick is Cid being unhinged and ironically acknowledging the tropes in anime and manga, while the side characters unironically acknowledge them. An example of how fucked Cid is, at one point he literally creates a nuclear explosion with his magic to flex on fodder, while in the process killing hundreds of people and destroying a good chunk of a city.  Yes, just to flex. 

img650()

One thing to note is that the anime doesn’t forcefully shove the humor in your face every minute, it still wishes to tell a semi-serious power fantasy story, but every so often it does make fun of itself to remind you what you're watching. I feel this approach allows the viewer to be sucked in and enjoy both the funny and serious moments in the anime. 

If you find this interesting, then I highly recommend this show. I had a blast watching it, I busted out laughing and embracing the epic moments as they were executed very well. 

The art & animation of the show is fairly good, it doesn't do much to distinguish itself from other shows. The anime’s pace is pretty solid, with a good amount of content. The voice acting is very good and the music is passable, with solid ending and opening songs. 

You should give it a chance. My major con would be that the 1st episode doesn’t really capture what the show is really about. Try to at least watch 3 episodes before deciding if you like it or not."
17895,"- Before reading the review:

Mi review will have ONE spoiler of episode 3, but even with this spoiler you can watch it perfectly. Actually some friends started watching the anime cause I told them this spoiler.... and they loved it, so read or not, your choice. I did choose to use that spoiler (wich I don't even consider an spoiler, but it is not told till episode 3) cause honestly, without it, the explanation would NOT be what Golden Time is about. Also on some sites (like MyAnimeList) they tell you about that spoiler too on the synopsis. So really, IMO, don't be afraid of reading this, I think it really helps to know what is the anime about, and the real reason to watch it.

- The review:

What makes this anime so good is the situation it tell us about.

Golden Time it's based on a Main character (Tada Banri) that got an accident and because of that he has amnesia. Because of the amnesia, he can't face his old friends/family, cause he think they will expect the old Tada Banri, so he starts a new life alone traveling to an university on Tokyo. 
Everything is fine there, he even got a really nice girlfriend that he loves so much. BUT... he start to remember some things about his old self... he start to remember he loved another girl that is actually on the same university and they are friends now. So now he has a internal fight between his old feelings to that girl and his new feelings to his actual girlfriend.

This anime show you how cruel life can be... you have someone that you love so much, and he/she loves you so much too, then... he forget about you cause an accident. He forget the feelings and the bond you both chad... and u remember everything. It breaks my heart so much to imagine a tragedy like that, and the fact that it could really happen to any of us anytime, without warnings, without nothing... and that; is why Golden Time is so good.

- Extra stuff:

This is the best review I can give you about Golden Time, so I'll leave it like that and tell you a few extra thing to reach minimun amount of characters required for reviews on Anilist hahah So you don't really have to read more to be honest.

Art is good, is not outstanding but is is really good. Characters and plot are the real deal here and what makes this anime really special. The soundtrack... after years, I honestly don't remember/have any song/theme in particular, and I usually do have a lot of openings/endings/ost of animes I watch, so that means it is probably just ok, good on the anime but nothing really special. It definitely wasn't bad. The pacing is good, not too slow or too quick, and every episode is enjoyable."
113538,"Season 4 Episode 24 “Monster Ball” analysis 
Minor Post Time Skip Spoilers Along with Seasons 1-4  

“Monster Ball” functions as an epithet to the maturing of the “monsters” not only physically but also in their interpretation of the game. “Monster Ball” not only works in reference to maturity but also represents the level of play that the “monsters” will rise to.


In the opening sequence, Kita is responding to Inarizaki’s backup setter’s comment saying that “But I do think monsters exist” (S4EP23 18:58). Kita responds “so do I… there are monsters who profess their love for volleyball every day”. This term “monster” is relatively new, throughout the first 3 seasons we hear Kageyama called a genius due to his talent level but never a “monster”. It’s fitting that we first hear this analysis of what a monster is from Tendo “They totally seem like monsters! Karasuno’s #9 and #10”(S4EP3 17:54).  Tendo has been established as a character that makes judgments based on his own intuition. His recognition of Hinata and Kagayama as monsters not only for their overwhelming ability but also their drive and love for volleyball. This is reinforced when Tendo then thinks to himself “you’re basically a monster yourself, Wakatoshi-Kun”. 
This final sequence of the third set is framed through Kita’s name for the game and the subsequent title of the episode “Monster Ball” not only a game of geniuses with overwhelming talent but a game where they “profess their love for volleyball” through their play. 

With this understanding of the lens that we view the game under, we can now delve into the episode itself.
The first notable part of the analysis is Kagayama not reaching the overpass and Hinata landing a miracle shot to take the point. Kagayama then tells Hinata to “complain” (S4EP24 2:43) then cuts to a scene of Hinata complaining which is then followed by Hinata responding “Complain? Why?”. What's important about the image intersected of them arguing is that Hinata is not complaining about a bad set in this image but rather that Kagayam would not try the new set. Hinata will never complain about a bad set, but will if he feels as if Kageyama is holding back. In a way saying. “Your level of play will never be an issue, the only time I will complain is if you get scared”. The most notable scene this moment references is after the season one loss when Hinata does not allow Kageyama to apologize for setting him. Hinata’s expectations for Kageyama beyond his limits continue the narrative that even though they are teammates they are also each other’s greatest rivals. Hinata's understanding of his setter and his effort inspires Atsumu as a setter as well with Atsumu muttering “I’m moved, Shoyo-Kun” foreshadowing their time playing together in the V-league.

The ending of this game is reminiscent of the end of the Shiratorizawa game, as in Dachi’s speech he says “If we win it’s not because a miracle happened” (S3EP9 12:00) which is echoed by Ukai when they are facing match point against Atsumu’s serve. This a subtle reminder that while they are a freakishly athletic team, they have to settle down and continue to play how they always do and not rely on their miracle but their own skill. This is followed by an overpass by Daichi, and again Hinata jumps with full faith that Kageyama will set him, and in contrast to the last time this happened (referenced in the last paragraph) Kageyama is motivated by the belief that Hinata has in him, and instead of only barely reaching it with one hand, he reaches it with two hands and takes the point. This point is followed by Atsumu thinking “You’ve got one scary partner there” referencing how high of a bar there is to meet when setting to Hinata.

The next sequence is in my opinion one of the most rewarding of the series. Throughout the match, Tsukishima can’t beat Suna head-on. Tsukishima throughout the series has seen Hinata as an animalistic freak athlete with dreams far bigger than reality a direct foil to himself, but in this scene, Tsukishima acknowledges Hinata as a legitimate player on the level of anyone else on the team. Even though through this same block scheme both Dachi and Kagayama have missed the receive. Knowing this Tsukishima still chooses to put his trust in Hinata, now acknowledging not only his athleticism but also his skill. This acknowledgment extends past Tsukishima, as the players from the neighborhood association team say “Shoyo-san” rather than “Shoyo-Kun” subtly showing that they now view Hintat as more mature than he was before. This is then followed by Hinata saying “He’s just so damn good at blocking”(S4EP24 9:01), this is very reminiscent of Lev’s realization but as a blocker. Lev and Hinata are both inexperienced but have lots of talent, they both have similar realizations. Lev comes to understand the importance of creating a block that won’t kill but give your receiver the best chance ( Haikyuu!!: Riku vs. Kuu EP2 17:44). Just as Lev came to understand this Hinata came to understand the opposite, Tsukishima created the lanes and he learned to receive around them. This parallel in growth shows how they are both real players with a deep understanding of the game and how they will continue to parallel each other as growing players in their emanate match. 

The following sequence is well explained by Date Tech. With the reestablishment of Azumane as the ace with Tankas heavy presence throughout the match. To avoid regurgitation go to 11:00 in the episode.


The following scene delves into Osamu as a character, functionally he is what Hinata is to Kagayama. He has the best connection with his setter and furthermore is his setter’s rival that pushes him harder than anyone else, along with the fact that Hinata often doted on as the player with the most potential in the series, but Osamu actually has the highest base stats in the show, with Atsumu’s passion Osamu would have been the best player in the series. Both players are the extremely talented duo to their passionate setter counterparts. This why Osamu took offense to Atsumu being moved by Hinata (he believes he is the same). This match was filled with great players but this match revolved around the monster duos. In this sequence, Osamu wants to prove to Atsumu that he is the same as Hinata hence the aura only seen on Ushijima indirectly demanding a set. An excited Atsumu would set him just to see what would happen but as the level of the game elevates so does Atsumu’s decision making, resulting in  Inarizaki taking the point. 

The moment following the point was a small detail but very telling of Atsumu’s outlook of the game with him boasting that Karasuno “just keep picking up my attacks” which is followed by a Suna “I’m the one that actually attacked, though” which is followed by a laugh from Atsumu. This moment is a reminder from the Olympic arc where his ego and arrogance are on full display, as he genuinely feels like he is in full control of the game and spikers are only his tools(His coach even says he is “sure Atsumu wants to use new toys” only further proving that Atsumu sees his teammates as tools). (or maybe he's laughing because he's having fun playing volleyball lol this one is a reach, but I think that Atsumu’s upbeat attitude overshadows his intensity so this was a reminder of how arrogant of a player he is).

The next point is relatively straight forward Aran is underrated as an ace the point if you think about it is amazing. 

The next point is Kagayamas dump, very reminiscent of his dump against Oikawa, and also a battle of the ego that both setters have as a result of their deep passion.

This sequence encompasses the purpose of season four, in the first season Karasuno was fast, thus they lost Aoba Josai. In season two they were still very reliant on being fast but some adaptation came with Hinata opening his eyes. In season 3 we saw the last adaptation to being fast, being slow, mixing timing made their fast attack more powerful than ever but in essence, the team still was built on the basis of speed. The reason they beat more technical, more powerful and taller teams was their speed. So when the game is on the line, Karasuno reverts back to what has always won them games… speed. As the play continues Karasuno begins to revert back to their season one self. When in reality the last 3 seasons have been growing around speed the most important being Hinata, Hinata grew from a blind quick to a dynamic player just as Karasuno has. As the screen darkens illustrating Karasunos vision for the game narrowing. It is fitting that the player that grew the most reminds them how much they have grown. The high pass saying “we are more than just speed now”. (The reference to the training camp is shown does not need further exposition) 

A note on the eyes of all the characters, yes they look really bad, but here’s my attempt to explain the intent of this art style. I think that they are trying to accomplish the same effect that they did in season 2. Oikawa has the same style of eyes (obviously the art is far better) when he then the game is close and he is desperate to win (S2 EP24 20:09). So the janky animation (18:56) shows the desperation to win just as Oikawa felt at the end of the season 2 game. (This is also a reach and I think this art is a substantial knock-on the episode and it sucked to see but this was my attempt to justify it lol)

The final point, this point shows the growth of Hinata and Kageyama, as they beat what they once were. This point mirrors the final point of season one (S1EP24 13:40) the dialogue “this position, this timing” is the same, showing that in season one Hinata and Kageyama truly believed speed would win them the game just as Osamu and Atsumu thought. I would offer more analysis, but Tsukishima’s monologue encapsulates this moment perfectly “speed is a very strong weapon… but it’s not invincible… those two know that a little better than anyone else”, Hinata and Kageyama used to live by speed, but now they understand it and rather than live by it, they use it. This final point capped the underlying character arc of growth from a freak duo to a duo of two of the best volleyball players in Japan that was persistent throughout the whole show.  What started as a crazy idea in a practice match lead to both of them elevating each other to the players they are now. That is why I believe this is the best episode in the show, the themes it explores and concludes from the 4 seasons of growth is masterful."

Plastic Memories. Many people dislike it due to premises do this anime has promised to the audiences. It's written by the same author of Steins; Gate, so, of course, people would expect more from this anime to tell more about the inherited level of science fiction based on the creator. Yet, they won't find it here as it's another bittersweet premise and a slice of life with sci-fi as its background. People always oddly value a show by its previous quality. I must say it's good yet means you can't see the hidden value behind the authenticity of the anime itself. The philosophical value of humanity and the morality of Giftias who want to be treated as human it's somewhat a very good premise to start with.

"" Sometimes, it takes a little bit of sadness to know what happiness is.""

Her true words prevail in the story about the anime itself. It's very sad and joyful, at certain times, it happens simultaneously throughout the story. It tells about Tsukasa Mizugaki, a boy who accepted to SA Corp., an android company that produced a Giftia,  a new form of android that has the most amount of emotion and artificially human qualities which much better than its model predecessor. At first glance, he met Isla, a Giftia which he thought that she is also a human yet she's not. !He had been introduced to the terminal service, his duty was to take the Gitias which have past their age before it's turned to be a dangerous creature as they start to lose the memories. He has formed to a group with Isla and of course, there will be some unwanted obstacles and risky chance while they execute their job, death is not the exemption. The main story comes from Isla and Tsukasa who fall in love with each other even they already understand their difference as a creature, both mentally and psychically.! 

"" It's hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.""

This quote truly tells about the characters. How can I forget them? They are so memorable, given to the story itself. Isla, a clumsy yet adorable girl who formed into a team in the terminal service. She has the most of it as she is the first main character besides Tsukasa (even though the story's point of view told about Tsukasa himself) who curious about emotions, happiness, and sadness. She had her crush to Tsukasa and she wants her memories to not be erased as she doesn't want to lose ""the one who gave her beautiful memories"". Tsukasa, a boy who also had a crush on his beloved girl, and he had taught her a lot of things about this world. !He made Isla thought that the world isn't that dangerous, it's beautiful. For the supporting characters, I'll give some views on Michiru Kinushima, a tsundere mean Giftia girl who admires Tsukasa yet also supports Isla and had a tragic past trauma about her family. I can tell a lot about the other characters but it'll waste your time to read this review.!

"" Memories do not always soften with time, sometimes some grow edges like knives.""

I must say the song is not so strong trait for the anime but it has a very deep meaning. I love listening to ""Ayasake no Starmine"", it has a soft and playful tone of a song yet so deep meaning and gives you the warmth about this anime for worthwhile. For the roles, I'm very satisfied with the voice actors, althought Isla's voice isn't that loud, I can hear and feel her words deeply and it's pretty for me. I want to cry and smile, or even laugh every time I hear her voice, it's well fitted to her character as a playful, cold, and caring yet clumsy and childish personality. About the other characters, I don't see any problem with the other voice characters, they are well fitted to the roles as well. 

"" Having happy and beautiful memories doesn't always bring salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become, it can even become more terrifying. Both for the one who's leaving... and the one being left behind.""

Plastic Memories is an underrated anime which not only teaches you the morality about being a human, it also gives you the sentimental feeling between two different creatures who fell in love with each other and will always be together even when the death separates them. It also has a premise which is simple and understandable for most of the audiences and will give you the warmth of both joyful and sadness at the same times. It gives you solely of a slice of life and drama with sci-fi as the background. So, for whom it may concern, don't watch if you expect an anime with a scientific premise like Steins; Gate. It won't give you something similar to the show, as it doesn't match the same pain with it. Do watch if you love series like Violet Evergarden, Clannad, and Angel Beats. I haven't watched Clannad and Violet Evergarden, but I'm sure it has a similar premise as Plastic Memories. Overall, I enjoyed this show so much as I have watched it five times and cried with the same number of times too. The story was thoughtful, joyful, playful, and hurtful at the same time and I should recommend this to whom love the slice of life genre. You can say that I rate it too high, but it doesn't mean that I overrate this show. Plastic Memories is the most underrated series I've ever seen in the slice of life genre and I'd give it a very high score to not forget about the memories do this show have.

That's all and thank you for reading this review. Feel free to check [any of these](https://anilist.co/user/CynicalOptimist/reviews) if you enjoy this one."
112301,"Countless amounts of anime are out there where the central focus is the overpowered main protagonist alongside loads of waifus. Most of these tend to get boring in the long run or quite fast, barley passing an episode or two. Unless you are like me once upon a time where I was fully dedicated to torturing myself by finishing up everything I put on my plate. That being said, rarely did I find any of those entries worth my time or all that fun. It was just me being stubborn and telling myself this, which is good when nothing actually was worth it. I have seen more than a fair share of these kinds of anime, but only a few have hit the right marks. It's been a norm that every season, a big chunk of the selection goes to typical fantasy anime. Out of them, more or less everything gets a place in the dropped or the trash can. But by a stroke of miracle, a solid show does actually get dropped someday. One was Cautious Hero, released a few seasons ago, and made me pumped about seeing where its story will go. Yes, I am talking positively about those classic light novel's where the title tend to be blown out of proportion when it comes to length. Now we got another such title, which is ""Maou Gakun no Futekigousha: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shison-tachi no Gakkou e Kayou."" 

Don't expect me to write that long and unnecessary title over and over again. I will just call it MisfitMaou since it's short and still informative to an extent. MisfitMaou starts after 2000 years later after the war against humans, and the demon had passed. The former ancient progenitor, the demon Lord Anos, is reincarnated as a misfit student. Not gonna get into it too much, but basically, instead of being with the royals, he messes up on his test and ends in the class for misfits. Anos is the backbone of MisfitMaou and makes the show so damn fun. He got acalm and collected attitude at the surface, nothing like a real demon lord. But when he does get enraged, he can be vicious and merciless. Anos is such a good and gentle guy who cares about his people and does not throw any hands at the humans unless someone forces him. Just goes to make those moments when Anos get down to business mighty satisfying, and it's incredible fun. Yes, Anos is overpowered, but calling it even extreme is not a sort of justice. He can literally blink someone out of existence, destroy enemies with his heartbeat or cause actual unimaginable miracles that make no sense in the grand scheme of things. 

Even so, those overused tropes of being invincible never seem to get old for me. The story itself is nothing to write home about, but it's addicting and lots of fun in other areas. For one, MisfitMaou's got a solid but typical waifu cast. Misha is the quiet and shy type, while Sasha is the tsundere (my best girl). Both make some romance progress. That's right, we don't have to wait untill the end of the story and get some sorry excuse of romance development that doesn't leave one sated as you'd hoped. Anos is fully aware of the girls' feelings from early on. When it comes to the overarching narrative of MisfitMaou, to cut a long story short. Someone replaced the history with a fake demon lord. Now it's up to Anos to find out who it could've been and restore things to its proper order. It's been a blast to watch MisfitMaou from start to finish, despite how simplistic and shoddy the premise truly is. Other areas, such as action, Anos, and the waifu, were handled well. We got a good side cast that feels necessary and is not suddenly long since been forgotten. 

There are some laughably bad executions of plot elements, one of which is the tension of a dire situation. It's just poorly handled and lacks that oomph of genuineness, it ruins the moment's flow in question. At one point, a character was playing the bad guy role, but it was never convincing and fell flat on its face. Many others of such segments are scattered across the anime adaptation. Also, the main bad guy was such a boomer that made me want to rip his head of an revive him to do it over again. Besides that, it's really not all that bad and could've been far worse. For a typical fantasy, I gotta say the production was decent. I didn't notice many derps, and the animation was okay. Overall, if you're like me who enjoys your overpowered badass main guy and harem with cute waifus, then give it a go. Sasha was the true best girl for me tho. What can I say? I am so damn weak when it comes to tsundere and if you add twintails on top of that then that's one killer combo. Well, you get the point. MisfitMaou was certainly a good time for me, despite its shortcoming later down the road. I would certainly watch a sequel if it dropped at some point."
21613,"Once upon a time, there was a a man who died. 
 
A staunchly pragmatic Japanese business man, he had just fired one of his lesser coworkers...  A common duty for him, as he held no sympathy in his heart for anyone who didn’t have the fortitude to climb the ladder as he had.  On his way home, however, the man he had just terminated decided to return the favor, in the ultimate act of vengeance, by shoving him in front of a subway train.  The man’s story should have ended there, but his imminent death was paused by a being calling himself God, who chided the man for his lack of faith...  A trait the man was NOT ready to give up, claiming that faith was foolish, and anyone living in a comfortable society had no need for it.  He even denied the being’s identity, labeling it “Being X” rather than God.

As for what happened next, well...  You know that old cliche where you insult someone’s manhood by calling him a little girl?  God just sort of does that.  The man is reborn, with all of his memories intact, as a female infant in a war torn fantasy version of Germany in the early 1910’s.  His goal was to show the man what true suffering felt like, but that goal quickly backfired as that girl, now known as Tanya, signed up to join the war, combining her encyclopedic knowledge of real world military history with her surprising magical aptitude to become the most significant and consequential soldier in the entire Empire.  Driven by unquenchable ambition and pure spite, she set her sights on a new goal.  God would pay for meddling in her affairs, and the whole world would tremble as they witnessed the Saga of Tanya the Evil.

At first glance, the names involved with this show do not look promising.  Director Yutaka Uemura only had one anime attributed to his resume before this, and while I can’t speculate on Punchline’s quality as I haven’t seen it, he still comes off as a rookie.  The same can be said for Nut, an animation studio that’s only been around for about five years, and who’s first production was, in fact, this one.  It’s also worth noting that they’ve suffered endless mocking over the internet for their name, and it’s hard not to understand why.  I will repeat, they’re called Studio Nut.

The final product, however, would turn them from a laughing stock to one of the most promising and highly acclaimed rookie studios in the industry, the 2017 answer to Studio Trigger.  For a debut effort, this anime is absolutely gorgeous.  It’s not the first anime to incorporate soldiers using magic to fly around the battlefield in intense aerial combat, but it had to have taken some cues from the first season of Strike Witches, because those battles are fast paced and exciting, blending traditional animation techniques with sparse CGI to deliver some absolutely breathtaking combat sequences.

Admittedly, the CGI does look a bit clunky when it’s being used on the ground to showcase soldiers marching in formation, but it’s easy to ignore when juxtaposed against the beautifully gritty backdrops of a wartorn civilization.  It’s weird to use that word when talking about dirt and debris, buildings that have been blasted to ruins and skies full of dust and smoke, but it’s all so intricately designed in every harsh detail that you can’t call it anything else.  On some level, it reminds me of Barefoot Gen in it’s ability to showcase the horrors of war, the destruction of both property and humanity on a visceral level, never holding back while at the same time captivating you with it’s artistry.  The visual direction and cinematography of the series are immaculate, regardless of Uemura’s apparent lack of experience.

The character designs tend to lean towards realism for the most part, with characters sporting believable facial structures, proportionally accurate frames and lips...  It feels really weird to me that they all have lips, anime characters do not usually have lips...  But unfortunately, the exception to this is the female characters, who have all the same realistic proportions as their male counterparts, apart from the fact that they have giant anime eyes that look really off-putting when paired with lips.  It can work at times, of course...  Tanya’s close confidant Viktoriya Serebryakov looks adorable most of the time regardless, and Tanya herself is an absolute roller coaster of facial expressions, but a lot of the time it feels awkward to the point of being downright memeable.  Still, she looks absolutely terrifying at all the right moments, so I’ll take it.

The high production values don’t stop with the visuals, however.  The music is equally appealing, as Shuji Katayama...  A composer who actually does have a decent resume behind him...  has put together an amazing soudtrack that not only perfectly matches the tone of the series, but even adds depth to several of it’s characters, like how the songs The Realist and The Individualist both explore two warring side of the title character.  There are suspenseful tracks that put a chill up my spine even when I know what’s about to happen, as well battle music that’s both intense and adrenaline-fueled in a way that I haven’t heard since Bastard!

Also, I don’t know, maybe I’m the only person who’s noticed this, but even though Tanya is the main character and driving force of the story, some of the music that plays when she gains the upper hand over a foe or clinches a significant victory is downirght villainous in it’s orchestration, and yet it still feels entirely triumphant...  A decision that had to have been deliberate.  I also appreciated just how on point the sound design was, with each explosion, bullet and flying effect sounded authentic amd impactful, even when mixed with the more futuristic sounding magic effects.

For the English dub, it sounds largely similar to the sub, especially in the case of certain characters like Jeannie Tirado’s Viktoriya, who sounds unsettlingly similar to the seiyuu.  There are two noticeable stand-outs, however.  The first is J Michael Tatum, ever the smooth talker, playing Erich Von Rerugen, the officer who can’t shake his apprehension over Tanya’s success after witnessing her ruthless methods first-hand, and his delivery sells his character’s trepidation way better than the seiyuu did, as he sounds calm and cool most of the time, adding a subtle shudder to his voice when faced with evidence of Tanya’s cut-throat true nature.

The other difference is Monica Rial, an actor who sort of has a reputation for being over-saturated in the industry, getting type cast in a ton of similar sounding roles, but the work she can do when she plays against type is the stuff of legend.  Thankfully, Tanya Degurechaff fits firmly into the latter category.  Much like Aoi Yuuki, Monica sounds totally believable as an adult in a child’s body, but she tweaked the character ever so slightly, taking the bar of eccentricity that Aoi set and lowering it just enough to add a level of world-weariness and long suffering frustration that you’d expect from a middle-aged business man dealing with unexpected inconveniences and only truly letting loose in the character’s more intense moments, making Tanya feel both more in control AND more insane at the same time.

Both audio tracks are brilliant, and while it’s possible that I’m just leaning towards the English track because of my monolingual ignorance, the characters just sound more natural to me, both individually and in their dynamics with each other.  Aoi Yuuki is famous for voicing the Pokemon Eevee, however, and that’s an endless source of joy for me.  I’ve also heard good things about the German dub, so do with that what you will.

I’ve been watching anime for a long time.  A long, long time.  If you’re counting my exposure to televised anime of the nineties like Pokemon and DBZ before I started going deeper down the rabbit hole, I’ve been watching this stuff for almost 25 years.  In that time, life has obviously changed.  I’ve accrued more responsibilities over the years, as well as less free time, but nothing put as much of a damper on my ability to watch anime for fun like, ironically, my decision to start writing reviews.  No matter how good an anime is, it’s become extremely rare for me to rewatch anything, which has led to me selling quite a few beloved DVDs on Ebay, a lot of which were not easy decisions to make when the need to pay my bills outweighed my need to have a five star classic on my shelf just to look at.

There are a few anime series I’m able to watch over and over again without getting tired of them, however, and Saga of Tanya he Evil is definitely one of them.

If you were to tell someone who’s never heard of this show what it’s about, well, you’d start with a brief summary of the plot, because this is an isekai anime, and when you consider just how many of those there are these days, it’s important to mention just what sets it apart from other titles in it’s genre.  Like Konosuba, the circumstances surrounding the main character’s death and rebirth are engaging, unique and immediately make you want to see more.  Much like That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, it involves actual reincarnation, a surprising rarity of the genre.  I personally really like Slime and Konosuba, so these are attractive comparisons to make.

You could also call it Strike Witches without the fanservice...  Honestly, the style of combat both shows feature is so similar I’m surprised more people don’t make that observation...  But considering the fact that Strike Witches without fanservice is just Brave Witches, I’d take it a bit farther by saying it’s like Strike Witches, but they’re fighting actual people.  Actually, you know what?  Let’s drop the Strike Witches comparison right there, because the fact that they’re fighting real people is by far and away the most unique thing about this series.

I want you to think back to the last Marvel movie that you watched, and tell me who the main characters were fighting.  They fight terrorists, people so removed from humanity that their entire personality is Death to America.  They fight and kill scores of generic nameless bodyguards, who HAVE to be evil because of who they’re working for, right?  They fight hordes of aliens, they fight hordes of robots, but with the exception of a few specific arch-enemies that rose above convention to become the most beloved thing about their movies, the heroes never fight anyone that you’re allowed to feel sympathy or understanding for.  Even when the humanity of a minion IS acknowledged, it’s usually played as a joke.

In Saga of Tanya the Evil, the story is explicitly set in the middle of a war that’s threatening to turn global, and I’m not exaggerating when I say that every single character is portrayed as a human being.  Nobody is othered.  There are no attempts at pulling punches, and the only way they try to justify the main characters keeping their hands clean is by the logic of ‘we were just following orders.’  This could have turned out to be a very bad move if either side of the conflict were stated to be especially in the wrong...  Humanizing a nazi is an incredibly dangerous road to walk...  But the war itself is kept as generic as possible, to the point that unless you took the time to sit down and analyze it, there really isn’t a clear consensus on how the conflict even started.  

Soldiers on both sides have familiars, they have diverse relationships and dynamics, they talk to each other like brothers in arms.  Higher ranking officers on both sides talk about strategy, the losses they’ve taken, and the pride they have for their countries, with no attempts made in the dialogue to quantify either as more just or unjust than the other.  When Tanya kills an enemy soldier, you cheer for her.  When you see that soldier’s grieving family right in the beginning of the next episode, you feel bad for them, and you don’t feel conflicted over it, or even the slightest bit manipulated.  The only reason you root for The Empire is because that’s the side that Tanya was reincarnated into, which leads me to the main reason her series is able to walk that tight rope so well.

The main conflict of this series isn’t the war.  It’s Tanya’s ongoing battle with Being X that takes center stage, and it feels just as important as it wants to feel.

Let’s be honest, we’ve all dealt with someone like Being X before.  Someone who didn’t approve of the way we live our lives, and had the authority to do something about it.  Maybe they were an asshole boss, or unsupportive parents, judgemental faith figures...  Maybe it was something intangible, like God, karma, Murphy, or some vast conspiracy that we swore was happening all around us.  Unlike the rest of us, though, Tanya gets to meet her meddler, and while he mostly pulls the strings behind the scenes, he is not shy about showing up every once in a while to brow beat her and chide her for not yet developing the kind of faith he demands from her.

But what about Tanya, you ask?  How are we supposed to root for her?  Is she not evil?  Well, yes, but context is important.  She’s certainly no humanitarian...  Honestly, I’d go as far as calling her a full blown sociopath.  She never hesitates to commit atrocities in the line of duty, both to the enemy and sometimes to her own subordinates, but she never does so without some kind of wartime justification.  She never disobeys orders or breaks the rules of engagement, even if she has to occasionally stretch their definitions and exploit some downright egregious loopholes.  She is, therefore, a lawful evil.  From some perspectives, she is the perfect soldier, but more importantly, she’s also the perfect survivor.

It’s this survivability, this cut throat methodology that she very amusngly developed through years of Japanese social-climbing, that makes her war of attrition against Being X so engaging.  Every time Being X meddles in her life, she has to find ways to overcome his influence without bowing to his will.  Even after she suffers some small losses, such as having to pray to use magic, she still has every intention of taking the dreams she had in her old life and realizing them here, on her own terms, even if it means fighting a never ending war, even if it means living as a woman in a fantasy version of the early 1900’s, even if it means giving into the base desire for blood that she’s always lived in denial of and climbing a pile of bodies to her destiny, because at it’s core, her character arc...  and the story at large...  Is about adaptability.  

It’s about the indomitable human spirit, and it explores this concept in the most cynical and misanthropic way you can possibly imagine.  Not even a political cartoon depicting Jeffrey Dahmer finding inspiration in a “Just be yourself” poster would be this darkly satirical.  Is that why the series works so well?  Honestly, it’s hard to say.  As it is, there was never any guarantee it would have been successful.  This show took a lot of risks, and just because it never pulled any punches on any of it, doesn’t mean anything was certain.  Hell, it white-washes Nazi Germany to a level that feels disturbingly like how some southern history books handle the subject of slavery.  That alone should have been a massive stumbling block, but because they were so careful to avoid any references to Germany other than the word ‘fatherland,” it was really easy to ignore.

On a similar side of the coin, because Tanya is almost always portrayed as the smartest person in the room, and someone who knows more about war and human psychology than literally anyone around her, she should be easily identifiable as a Mary Sue, but because her silver tongue tends to get her into more trouble than it helps her avoid, that doesn’t happen either.  There are also several nagging plot and lore questions that never get answered, like, if Being X wanted Tanya to know hardship, why give her so much magic potential?  If the Empire is a non-patriarchal meritocracy where someone like Tanya can flourish, why are there no other children volunteering, if for no other reason than guaranteed rations?  Why are the no women in the military other than Tanya, Viktoriya and one other lady who failed to make Tanya’s Battallion?  They’re allowed to join, right?  That’s a thing, right?

In spite of all of this, I feel like the biggest factors to this anime’s success boil down to execution, production values and personality.  Saga of Tanya the Evil is tightly paced, moving elegantly between fast, exciting action scenes and heart pounding suspense, between intriguing dialogue and just enough beaurocratic deliberation to to inform of you of where the plot is moving without ever becoming boring, and they still have just enough time left over to flesh out the cast.  Even Tanya, in all her evil glory, is both relatable because of her struggle against an outside force trying to control her life, and likeable through sheer force of personality, making this a series that’s way more fun to watch than it has any right to be.

Saga of Tanya the Evil is available from Funimation.  The original light novels and manga are available from Yen Press.  There’s a sequel movie that hasn’t been dubbed yet, but I’ll be seeking it out after this review goes live, and an upcoming second season has been greenlit.  I’d also like to recommend Isekai Quartet, a chibi comedy show featuring several characters from this title, and Tanya has a nice little starring role in it.  It’s also available from Funimation.

This show is lightning in a bottle.  I had some issues with the worldbuilding and character design choices, and there are a few plot points that don’t add up, and it doesn’t feature much depth outside of Tanya as a character and some pointed social commentary regarding capitalism and society’s tendency to reward ruthlessness over compassion, but it’s a blast to watch, and it’s just as exciting every single time.  The isekai genre may be a bit of an over-saturated market at this point, but there are unique titles in every genre, and there is no other anime quite like this one.  I could see the gritty depiction of war-time violence being too explicit for some viewers, but the production values are top notch, the action is electrifying, the comedy is gallows black, and you will find yourself unexpectedly rooting for a person you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley.

I give Saga of Tanya the Evil a 9/10."
853,"“Only those with excellent social standing and those from filthy rich families are lucky enough to spend their time here, at the elite private school of Ouran Academy. The Ouran Host Club is where the school’s handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands. Just think of it as Ouran’s elegant playground for the super rich and beautiful.”

These are the words that greet Haruhi Fujioka, one of the only commoners with good enough grades to actually enrol at Ouran, as she slips into an abandoned music room for some quiet study time. Instead, she finds anything but peace, as the academy’s infamous host club mistakes her for a boy… Thanks to her ultra-short haircut and lack of an expensive uniform… And they assume ‘he’ is there to enjoy some man-on-man entertainment. In her efforts to escape this collection of carefree casanovas, she accidentally destroys a renaissance vase that’s worth more money than several generations of her family combined. And she winds up on the hook for every yen of it!

They recruit her as their dog… Well, we’ll use the term ‘errand boy’ to be nice… And by the time they’ve all realized their mistake, Haruhi Fujioka has already been inducted as an official host! Which unfortunately means posing as a boy for the remainder of her non-compulsary educational tenure.

Haruhi is a practical, level-headed girl, which is the direct result of her upbringing in a low income, single parent household. Her background and thrifty ways fascinate the club’s charismatic president and cofounder, Tamaki Suoh, a half-white airhead who lived in France until the age of fourteen. He’s the last person in the club to realize she’s a girl, and since he’s emotionally unable to deal with his instantaneous attraction to her, he instead decides to adopt her as the daughter of his host club family.

This all works out very well for the highly meticulous Kyoya Otori, the cofounder and accountant of the host club, as Haruhi’s natural chemistry with their female clients presents a business opportunity that he just can’t pass up. The rest of the club is rounded out by the infamous Hitachiin twins, Hikaru and Kaoru, both of whom are troublemakers from Haruhi’s class, as well as the adorable sweets-loving Honey and his strong, silent protector Mori, both of whom are highly skilled prodigies from respected martial arts families.

Together, these six… No, these SEVEN hosts… serve their squealing, insatiable clients as your typical reverse harem archetypes… Tamaki plays The Princely Type, Kyoya plays The Cool Type, Honey plays The Boy Lolita Type, the twins play The Mischievous Type… As well as delivering heaping helpings of implied twincest… And Mori pretty much acts as an accessory to Honey, because aside from that, I can’t really recall anybody actually requesting his company. And now, with Haruhi playing The Natural Type, their harem is complete!

Ouran Highschool Host Club was produced by Studio Bones, the producers of equally popular shows such as Soul Eater, Black Butler, and… Oh man, what was it called? Something about an Alchemist… It doesn’t matter, that one’s pretty obscure. Anyway, in typical Bones fashion, the production is beautiful at first glance, but somewhat unbalanced when you look a little closer at it. There’s fluid, graceful movement going on all over the place, from the characters themselves as well as from the flowers that occasionally fly across the screen. Because of the distribution of the budget, however, it still has the ever-present problem of people freezing into statues in the background, and this isn’t just limited to background characters. It’s a fairly common problem in anime, but in this case, it actually kind of works with the humor style of the show.

This aside, Studio Bones makes up for any technical failings with some of the most captivating art design you’ll ever see. I’ve praised a lot of shows for having impressive detail in their artwork, but Ouran really is a cut above the norm, as it takes the flowery aesthetic that you’d expect from a shoujo manga and uses it to it’s very best potential. The characters and their outfits are designed with bright, lively pastels, and they stand in stark contrast to the much softer, darker pastels that make up the beautifully lit, cleverly shaded backgrounds. Every inch of Ouran Academy, as well as the few other environments that we visit, are detailed from the architecture down to the very last flourished handrail. It’s beautiful, and so is the music, which is conveyed almost entirely with classic style violin and piano. They never seem out of place, complimenting the comedic scenes as well as the dramatic. The only place you’ll see consistent modern style music, like drums and guitar, is in the opening, which stands as probably one of the most well made openings of all time.

Unfortunately, the original Japanese opening is all but absent from the DVDs, only really appearing for one episode. It’s otherwise replaced by an English language version, which may be inferior in the eyes of purists, but it still holds up well on it’s own.

That opening is really the only aspect of the dub that I can see raising some irritated eyebrows, as the acting in the english dub is a very close match to the outstanding Japanese track. Caitlin Glass, who’s mostly known for giving really big, enthusiastic performances, proves she’s just as good on the other end of the scale, going low and throaty but adding just enough femininity to make Haruhi’s exasperated cynicism palatable. Vic Mignona proves to be the perfect man to play Tamaki as a foppish, ignorant spastic that he is, and J Michael Tatum slithers his cool demeanor comfortably into the manipulative, meticulous Kyoya.

The Hiitachin Twins are played by Greg Ayres and Todd Haberkorn, and while they do have significantly different voices, they play the personalities of their respective characters perfectly, while still retaining the same relative pitch, and they complement each other very well. Luci Christian is mercilessly cutesy and childish as Honey, while still somehow carrying a sense of maturity that defies appearance. It’s hard to talk about Travis Willingham’s performance as Mori… Not because he does a bad job, but because he does a good job, putting genuine effort into a character that any talentless shmuck could play. In other words, it’s a job that even Mark Laskowski could pull off, so you can imagine how thankless a job it really is.

There are a lot of minor or otherwise one-shot characters in this show, but the two I’d like to call attention to are Chris Sabat, who plays a tough looking guy who’s sick of people always being afraid of him, and Monica Rial, who plays the group’s excitable manager Renge. Renge often appears on-screen via a mechanical stage that can pop up out of the ground anywhere and everywhere, and she acts as one of the two commentators on some of the many shoujo tropes that Ouran likes to make fun of. She handles fanhoods and character archetypes, shamelessly explaining them to us when necessary. Yes, it’s exposition, but it’s really, really funny exposition. And the other commentator? A little girl, who blatantly points out that Shoujo mangas are full of reverse harems and debauchery.

In my review(s) of Okami-san and Her Seven Companions, I mentioned that Ouran is really good at transitioning between comedy and drama. Well, the truth is, I was underselling it. Ouran can transition smoothly between many different types of comedy and drama, while never feeling forced or pretentious about it. A show like Family Guy falls flat on it’s face when trying to deliver dramatic or serious storylines… The one about Quagmire’s sister was a particular low note… But Ouran pulls it off naturally, as every second of it is used to develop either the characters or the story. Every single character has a rich, complex backstory, with more than enough room to grow. Okay, maybe Mori is the exception. The Hiitachin twins in particular get some of the deepest, most introspective material of all, cementing them easily as my favorites in the cast.

The only time Ouran isn’t funny is when it’s not trying to be funny, and that’s a rare trick to pull off. A lot of it comes from the fact that it’s able to ruthlessly satirize and deconstruct the shoujo genre and many of it’s sub-genres without ever becoming mean spirited about it, so in effect, fans and haters of that material will both find plenty of things to love about it. So even if you can’t enjoy this show for it’s girlish presentation and buckets of cartoony shoujo fan-service, you can still enjoy it for it’s pitch perfect comic timing, chuckling along with the joke as it lampoons those very elements.

If there’s one element that Ouran doesn’t tackle, it’s romance. This is supposedly a romantic comedy, but the only romance that ever takes place is with the occasional star-crossed couple that the Host club has to mediate. There are a lot of affections being thrown around, but when it comes to the main cast, none of these affections are ever really reciprocated. Thankfully, unlike School Rumble, Ouran doesn’t back itself into a corner by making these affections the main hook of the series. Instead, the main focus is on friendship and character development, and while the ending can be a bit unsatisfying from a plot perspective, this is a character driven story, and the subtle maturations of our hosts will still bring you to a very heartwarming place by the conclusion.

Ouran High School Host Club is one of the funniest anime ever made. It’s executed flawlessly, trying it’s hand at a surprisingly large number of tones and effortlessly succeeding at nearly all of them. The artwork, animation and music are all breathtaking, which is clearly indicative of the love and time that went into this project. While it may not carry the label of “Ironically bad-ass” that Princess Tutu has been blessed with, it’s still one of those few shoujo titles that’s just as enjoyable for male viewers… Perhaps even more so… As it is for female viewers. The characters are rich, complex and loveable and care deeply for one another, but not so much that they can’t antagonize and prank each other in the process. So if you’ve got too much time on your hands, then please, step into this series and allow the hosts to pamper you just like their actual clients. I give this series a 9/10."

Dragon Ball Z. Where do I even begin? One of the most iconic animes in the world, the godfather of shounen, the animanga that paved the way for countless of animangas after it. It's regarded by many as one of the best animes of all time, garnering millions if not billions of fans across the world. It's also regarded as among one of the worst animes of all time. It's plot is often regarded as nonsensical and the story has nothing of value other than extremely buff men punching each other. It's usually seen as either one of the best animes ever, or one of the worst. Does it truly live up to the hype? Or is it really nothing more than a bunch of buff man yelling and throwing fists?

Protagonist - Goku makes for an amazing protagonist who just explodes with personality. Despite being the baseline for most modern shonen protagonists, Goku is still one of the most unique among them. While other protagonists are extremely heroic and fight for the greater good, Goku is a warrior to his core who's main motivation isn't fighting for justice and the greater good, but fighting the strongest people he can find and push himself to the limits. Goku can be extremely selfish throughout the series and that's what makes him so interesting. He's not some Superman that the dub of the show tried to make him out to be. He's someone who will put other in dangers just so he can push himself to the limits. He's a lovable oaf that you can't help but root for and has truly cemented himself as a timeliness protagonist.

Side Characters - One of the weaker aspects of the show definitely has to be the side characters. Don't get me wrong, there are great characters like Trunks, Gohan, Vegeta, and Piccolo, but other than them everyone else tends to not really do a whole much in the series. Chichi is just there to yell at Gohan to do homework, Bulma is there to just give the Z fighters cool devices, Roshi hardly exists to do anything outside of pervert jokes, and Goten and kid Trunks serve to do nothing more than fuse with each other and fight Super Buu. The main problem with the cast is they don't really get to do much without Goku (an exception is in the Cell arc and half of Namek). I still love the cast however as they're all extremely loveable with their own personalities. 30 years later and they're still endearing as ever and I simply wish Toriyama wrote more for them so that I could love them more.

The art throughout the series is nothing short of FANTASTIC. It evolves and changes over the course of the series, but every single art style in each era looks absolutely mesmerizing. The art starts out a lot more simple in Saiyan saga and ends up a lot more detailed by the time the Buu saga comes around. Each art style has its own artistic merit and works in different ways.

The animation is also amazing. While it can be a little repetitive sometimes, It has tons of fluid moments that are showstopping.Dragon Ball Z is where household names like Naotoshi Shida and Todayoshi Yamamuro made their marks in the industry.

While the show could look a bit wonky every now and then, the highs are EXTREMELY high and the show manages to look pretty great for a weekly show in the 90s.

Saiyan Saga - I'll be in the extreme minority here but I am not a fan of the Saiyan saga. I'll start off positive with things it does right. I think the introduction into it with a grown adult Goku with his son Gohan is pretty sweet and lets us know off the bat that some years have passed since Dragon Ball. I also enjoyed the absolute bomb of a drop Raditz was as an antagonist. His introduction completely flipped the status quo on its own. Goku has a brother? Goku is an ALIEN? This opened massive doors for the franchise and uses this introduction as its first stepping stone. I also enjoyed Vegeta as an antagonist a ton as he had such a swagger to him. His design making him so small with such a large ego was a very great choice by Toriyama. Now unfortunately I'll have to go into the negatives. The arc structure is easily the weakest one to me. It's basically just Z fighters training and then proceeding to get beat up by the main bad guy and having to wait for Goku to return. While there are solid moments in the arc, the arc doesn't become anything of note to me until Goku vs Vegeta, the literal climax/conclusion of the arc. It's very boring having to sit through Tien jobbing against Nappa, and Chiaotzu having a very non emotional sacrifice to me. The arc finally gets going to me however when the main stars of the saga finally come head to head.
img220()  
The fight is extremely brutal and pulls no punches. Goku and Vegeta have an interesting dynamic of one coming from a bloodline of royalty, destined for greatness! The other came from a family who's nothing of real note and was born with a mere power level of 2. Despite their differences in upbringings, they still clash head on as equals.
img40%() img47%()
The fight drags on and it FEELS bloody and no holds barred. Seeing everyone struggle in the fight and Yajirobe actually contributing a ton and cutting off Great Ape Vegeta's tail was a blast to watch. I of course can't forget about the  ICONIC Kaioken Kamehameha vs Galick Gun

The way vegeta ends up getting defeated is pretty stupid however with Gohan going great ape and falling on top of him in a fit of rage. I do enjoy Goku begging Krillin to keep Vegeta alive however not because he thinks Vegeta will become a good person, but so he can fight him again and defeat him in a 1v1. The arc is overall not that great to me but the final fight is pretty good.

Namek Saga - The Namek saga starts off extremely dire, yet hopeful. Majority of the Z Fighters are dead, yet all hope isn't loss. With the introduction of Piccolo being a Namekian, the gang heads off to planet Namek to find the Namekian dragon balls. I think the premise is absolutely great and the Namek saga probably has one of, if not the most best story structures in the show. With Goku having to recover, we're able to get Krillin and Gohan taking over as the main characters for a good portion of Namek. They hold the position great as they bounce off of eachother pretty nicely. We're soon introduce to our main villain very early. The most iconic villain in the entire series, Frieza.

Frieza makes his mark extremely quick by ordering his minions to kill an innocent Namekian child. Knowing that this galactical tyrant is also on the look for the dragon balls, it makes the stakes much higher than they've even been before. Vegeta also returns in the arc looking for the dragon balls too. This makes this into a death game of cat and mouse with Vegeta, Gohan, and Krillin having to sneak under Frieza's nose and reach the Dragon Balls before he does. The arc keeps you engaged at all time because the main characters simply can't go in and guns blasting, they have to think extremely carefully as their lives and the z fighters lives are all on the line. The arc has some solid side villains as well, the most notable being the Ginyu force.

The force (Outside of Guldo really) is just a huge blast to watch. They all have interesting designs, great fights, and a banger theme song.
The arc has some pretty nice fights throughout the saga but the real highlight of the saga is Goku vs Frieza, the final brawl. Before the fight truly starts off, we're treated to a nice heart to heart with Goku and Vegeta, with Vegeta dying, crying, and begging for Goku to avenge the Saiyan race. Goku accepts this and for the first time, we see Goku, or rather Kakarot, accept his Saiyan heritage. It's one of the most heartfelt moments in the saga as we saw Vegeta, the man who looked down on Goku as an inferior warrior, turn to Goku and have to beg him to avenge his pride, and his race. The Goku vs Frieza fight has some pretty nice action and solid animation. It unfortunately peaks at Base Goku vs Final form frieza as the fight feels a lot more even at that point. Goku pulls out the iconic spirit bomb for the first time and it's such a great scene. Seeing Goku gather life energy from the entire planet and seeing the spirit bomb go from a small orb in the Saiyan saga into the huge ball here. The fight at this point feels extremely intense and you can't help but be constantly drawn in with all the different tactics Goku has to use just to keep up with Frieza. The climax doesn't come until the Spirit Bomb fails however, and results in frieza killing Krillin. It's one of the most horrifying deaths in the series as Goku has to simply stand there and watch powerless. With the Spirit Bomb failing, Piccolo injured, and all hope is lost, we're treated to one of the most Iconic things in the series. The legendary Super Saiyan.

This transformation changed the game not only for Dragon Ball Z, but for the entire anime medium as a WHOLE. Your favorite transformation is most likely inspired by Super Saiyan. It's impact 30 years later is still felt and for good reason. The Super Saiyan was nothing more than a mystery as Vegeta alluded towards it the entire arc, we simply thought it was a powerbuff like a zenkai boost. It was however so much more and while it's design is pretty simple nowadays, it works amazingly well. Less is sometimes more. Super Saiyan itself is an amazing transformation, but unfortunately the fight starts to dip in quality. There are some good animation every now and then, but as a whole the animation quality starts to dip. We also can't talk about Super Saiyan Goku vs Frieza without talking about pacing. The 5 minute meme is a meme done to death but it holds weight in its criticism. The fight drags on LONG. Like, it's the longest fight in anime history LONG. It quite frankly drags out longer than it has to, but there's still a lot of cool lines to kindaaaaaaaa make it up. The fight though I will say has one of my favorite conclusions in anime. Goku's ""YOU FOOL"" is so fantastic and his sorrowful face followed by it looks incredible. 

Overall, the Namek saga is a great high stakes arc that I can't help but enjoy. It is dragged down a bit with the second half of Frieza vs Goku, but it still changed the game massively and you can't help but respect it even with its share of flaws.

Cell Saga - This arc is a mixed bag for me. It's very nonsensical a good portion of the time and the cracks of Toriyama's winging it with his writing shows very hard. Yet it also has some of the highest highs in the entire series. Trunks is a very much welcome addition to the cast and easily has the most raw introductions in the entire series that has yet to be topped even remotely. Sorry Ultimate Gohan, but this is a REAL entrance.

The main villains of the arc are pretty good but I won't lie are a bit underwhelming compared to Frieza. 19 and 20 are literal whatever characters, Android 17 and 18 are pretty great and are my favorite in the arc, Perfect Cell is also a good villain but he's definitely no Frieza. The plot is pretty much always engaging but even for Dragon Ball standards it can get convoluted for zero reason. We go through 3 different sets of villain and our final villain has to go through 3 seperate forms until we FINALLY reach our main antagonist for the show. It's still pretty nice however as this arc actually gives a lot of shine to characters other than Goku. Trunks of course is a very vital character to the saga and is the reason the Z fighters survive the attack from the androids, Vegeta finally achieves the Super Saiyan transformation and oh boy does he add such finesse to it.

Though the real star of the saga is no one other than Son Gohan himself. 
img420()

This is the arc where all of the foreshadowing to Gohan's true power finally pays off. He slowly is able to hold his own throughout the Saiyan Saga and Namek saga, but the Cell saga is where he's able to really come into his own and carry the torch from Goku. While the Gohan vs Cell fight isn't nearly as well choreographed and animated as the Goku vs Cell fight, it's a lot better narratively. Gohan's refusal to kill Cell leads to the Z Fighters getting harmed and nearly killed. Gohan has to try and figure out if he can compromise his morals for the greater good and save the Earth. It's only then where Android's 16 head comes out of nowhere to talk to him. These characters have never interacted once in the entire saga, yet they have one of the most heartfelt conversations. Android 16 telling Gohan that it's okay to let go, and fight for whats right. Some people simply can't be reasoned with and fighting to protect what you love doesn't make you a bad person. It's a powerful message that speaks not only to Gohan, but us as the audience. Android 16 proceeds to get stepped on and crushed by cell, leading Gohan to lose it entirely. Leading to one of the most beautiful transformations in anime history.
youtube(https://youtu.be/iZVJq6aP4)   
Everything from the music, to the roar, to the visual of the bird is all just so perfect. Unmei No Hi makes an already incredible scene and makes it even more perfect. Gohan's transformation from boy to man is such a great journey to see as we've been there with him since day one. Even though he's stepped up to finally truly fight Cell, his recklessness and cockiness ends up to Cell almost destroying the World. With everything lost, our hero Goku has one last idea. A last resort. He decides to sacrifice himself to save his friends and planet. It's such an emotional scene as we see Goku give one final goodbye to all his friends. 
img420()        
Just as he heads off he gives one final message to Gohan. a ""Good job son"". Goku in the moment has no worries, he simply makes peace with the situation he's in and accepts it, as the most calm as he's ever been. It's a real tearjerker and I love everything about it from it's music to the voice acting.
Unfortunately though, Cell manages to come back. I don't think it takes away from the weight of Goku's sacrifice as it's still emotional either way. Cell's sacrifice also gives us one of the best attack in the series. The Father-Son Kamehameha. 

img420()
It's one of the best moments in the series as it represents so well how Goku is passing the torch to Gohan, and giving him one final push to become Earth's new protector. With Cell finally defeated, the arc fantastically wraps up in its conclusion with Goku dead, and Gohan as the new savior and protector. The Cell saga could've been structured and planned out a bit better, but it's still such a great watch with a lot of high moments that defined the series. It definitely has glaring flaws, but I think the clear enjoyment and passion Toriyama had when creating the arc was was able to make it work well and persevere through its issues. 

Buu Saga - This might be another uncontroversial opinion, but I really fucking love Buu saga. As in, It's my favorite Dragon Ball Z saga love. Does it have ton of issues? Yea. Is still one of the most fun Dragon Ball arcs since the original Dragon Ball? Extremely yes. The arc kicks off with a new opening, that lets us know that Gohan is indeed Earth's newest protector and savior.
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsBaC3S-As) 
We gotta power has so much energy to it and is just an all around great opening. Seeing old faces and new ones is a pretty good sight to see.
The saga kicks off with Gohan going to highschool, and while it doesn't contribute much to the overall saga's plot, it's still a great watch and a nice slice of life bit. Trunks and Goten are our newest additions to the Z fighters and they're not given the most depth ever but are still a blast to watch as they conspire and do their silly little shticks. The Saga doesn't really get going until we get to the World Tournament arc, and it's a pretty solid arc. Pretty much my least favorite arc in the entire saga but it still does it job fine enough and seeing Goten and Trunks do their shenanigans is pretty funny. I think the real thing that stuck with me though in the arc was Goku's return to earth and meeting Goten for the first time. It's such an incredibly emotional moment that still manages to get me every single time even today.

After the World tournament arc we're finally treated to the amazing rematch of Majin Vegeta vs Super Saiyan 2 Goku. It's a hyped up fight that has been anticipated since the Saiyan saga and oh boy is it worth it. It's a fight that drags on and is just as brutal as their initial match.

The fight ends up leading to our main villain of the story who you can guess, his name by the name of the saga. Majin Buu is probably my favorite villain in the series besides Frieza. Nearly all his forms have a great personality outside of Buuhan who's kinda lame and a poor man's Perfect Cell. Fat Buu comes into the scene bursting with his child like personality. He absolutely demolishes Majin Vegeta, so what does Vegeta do? The only thing he can do. In one last ditch effort, Vegeta decides to sacrifice himself, his final atonement.

It's a beautiful scene that serves as a nice prologue to the conclusion of Vegeta's character arc. There's a reason why this is such a beloved scene for Vegeta, and for good reason. Never in a million years would anyone imagine Vegeta sacrificing himself, but he does it because he has a family who he loves and wants to protect.
The saga after the introduction of Buu introduces some pretty cool things including the concept of fusions and Super Saiyan 3. Both of these are such great addition to Dragon ball and just feel like so much god damn fun. I do think one of the biggest weaknesses about the Buu saga has to be Gohan though. In the Cell saga he's left as Earth's protector and then immediately in the Buu saga, he instantly gets relegated to nothing more than a side character quickly. He gets his Ultimate Gohan form and it seems like he'll be able to defeat Buu and become the savior of Earth like he was meant to be, but he instantly fumbles and ends up dying when Buu destroys the planet. It's just such a shame because Gohan is a pretty great character who I think deserved to get better treatment than he did in the Buu saga. 
One of the things I love most about Buu saga on the other hand, easily has to be the final showdown. The Goku/Vegeta vs Kid Buu has to be one of the best animated fights in the entire series. Vegeta's ""You are number one"" moment is truly spectacular as for the entire series, we've seen him in a rivalry with Goku, but being a changed person, he finally admits Goku is in a class and realm of his own.

The fight proceeds to end with what I think is the definitive best final attack in the entire series. One last Spirit bomb.
img37%() img49%()
Seeing everyone on planet earth, including both old friends and new helping Goku makes this ending feel so powerful. With everyone giving Goku his energy, Goku launches his final attack against a main antagonist of the series. As he deals the final finishing blow, he uses the last Dragon Ball wish, wishing for Kid Buu to come back as strong as he was, except good so that they can fight again.

The reason I love this scene so much is because even with all Buu has done, Goku can't help but only thinking of wanting to fight him again in another life. Even through thick and thin, through 286 episodes, Goku is still Goku. He's still just a man looking for a great fight. And it's a beautiful conclusion to what I consider my favorite arc.

I think Dragon Ball is a show with a ton of flaws and it isn't the most deep anime ever. It's pacing can be kinda bad and the story can become pretty nonsensical at times. Yet even with all that, I just couldn't help but falling in love with it. This is a series where you can tell the mangaka has so much fun writing it and it's characters and it's constantly beaming through the story. The music, the action, and the animation are all so beautiful to me. Is it the holy grail of anime? Perhaps not. It's still however just a great show that feels pretty genuine and has clear heart in it. The anime landscape would be so much different in void of it and I think I'd also be a lot different as I met a ton of friends through Dragon Ball. After 30 years and going, I still am proudly to say, Dragon Ball does indeed live up to the hype.

6880,"Disappointment: that's the word that fully describes this anime. A lot of potential being wasted as the episodes progress leaving a bitter taste in the mouth.

Ten years before the story begins, a massive anomaly called the Red Hole caused an earthquake that destroyed most of Tokyo (Japan: a giant magnet for unexplained disasters).

img70%()

Returning to the present, the story shifts to Ganta Igarashi, an ordinary student that is a survivor of the Red Hole. During a normal day of school a mysterious figure, the Red Man, massacres his entire class, leaving Ganta as the sole survivor and implanting a mysterious red crystal in his chest. Ganta was immediately named as the main suspect in the carnage and, after a sham trial, was sentenced to death at Deadman Wonderland, a private prison that is also a theme park runned by the warden Tsunenaga Tamaki who posed as Ganta's lawyer.

A lethal poison is injected into the prisoners by a special collar, only one candy taken every three days can guarantee salvation, but you can only get it with Cast Points. To obtain Cast Points, prisoners must participate and survive in deadly games. Fortunately, Ganta meets a girl, Shiro, who apparently knows him, and who will help him several times (let's say all the time) during the story.
During his stay in the prison Ganta develops a strange power: he can manipulate his own blood and use it as a weapon. For this reason he is taken to a hidden branch of the prison where experiments are carried out and 1vs1 fights (the so-called Carnival Corpse) are fought to the death between the owners of the Branches of Sin (the Deadmens).

img70%()

The idea and the development of the plot in the first episodes is really interesting.
Who's the Red Man? Why did he kill those boys? Why did he let Ganta live? What really caused the earthquake that destroyed Tokyo 10 years before? Why the false trial? These questions permeate the series, giving it a very fine atmosphere suffused with mystery.
Unfortunately, however, as the episodes pass, the story becomes confused. Too much! Not in the sense of not understanding the reasoning of the characters or the various events. It's as if it began to lose its narrative power, becoming, all of a sudden, an almost banal series. Nothing happens to keep you glued to the screen. It's just boring, the pace is no longer sustained and the events become monotonous.

img(%22&x-id=GetObject)

Ah, the characters...
Let's start with the main character, Ganta Igarashi: whiny, without being particularly understandable or humane in his choices, obnoxious, illogical and very, very transparent. His actions are all dictated by the plot, not by the personality of the character.
Paradoxically the co-protagonists, Shiro and Yoh, result much more incisive because, in a certain way, both of them seem to ""follow"" the role of Ganta's dead friends, inducing the spectator to think that the boy will rebuild his life inside the prison with the strangest and morally ambiguous versions of his friends. Instead the character of Shiro seems to have been put as an assistant who appears in the moment of need to advance the story, while Yoh, although he is probably the most characterized and multifaceted character of the whole anime (he is a kleptomaniac who wants to free his sister, also locked up in the prison, buying his freedom with the money he steals...) after about five episodes will be defenestrated into oblivion.

The rest of the characters are nothing but a jumble of muscle men, oversized policewomen, guys with super powers and characters that, once introduced, disappear in the great nothingness that is this anime (just think of the characters of Promoter Tamaki and the super-crazy monk).

The drawings and anatomies are well realised, the grotesque and sometimes disfigured faces are perfect for the setting in question.

It even deserves a 9 in this aspect

As far as the soundtrack is concerned, the opening and ending are very good (the dominant use of red in the opening introduces the viewer to the bloodstained world of Deadman Wonderland while the ending gives a feeling of almost unnatural calm and tranquility) while the OST is rubbish. The main theme is catchy only for the first part, while the rest doesn't remain impressed.

youtube(https://youtu.be/3YuBbmUkPA)

Furthermore, it can certainly be said that this anime manages to use splatter in a more than decent way, managing not to be ridiculous or annoying and at the same time entertain lovers of this genre very well.

img(%22&x-id=GetObject)

The idea of the prison-amusement park was very original but the conclusion came in a flash, blocking a story that could have provided so much more backstory, a pity because such a plot, if well exploited, could have resulted in something of much higher quality.
It can be summed up by saying that Deadman Wonderland is a halfway successful anime, as if it were a stepping stone that entices you to read the manga.

21049,"ReLIFE is one of the greatest anime I have seen, lately. This review is different as I went in completely blind with high expectations. I wasn’t let down and I don’t even know what I was expecting. The TL;DR is here. Stop reading this review, go in blind. Don’t even read the synopsis. There’s also a TL;DR at the end, but it’s more packed.

I did not know what I expected by watching ReLIFE. I only watched it because I kept seeing it over and over again by my friends and I was getting triggered at the fact it kept appearing. I challenged myself to have high expectations and I was not let down.

Story:
img()

ReLIFE… touches on something that isn’t easily handled. And that is the ability to relive certain moments of your past. ReLIFE is about a man who is given the chance to relive his highschool years. I’m sure many of us would like to change what mistakes we did. Even me, who is fairly young has many things that I would like to change. 
ReLIFE handles many things aside from this. They tackled an “isekai-ish” setting without ruining the character. I say “isekai-ish”; I really mean that it’s because he gets to live in a different environment. I’m not a 27-year-old who has trouble with jobs yet, so I can’t exactly relate to how someone would act upon becoming a highschooler again. The main character, Kaizaki Arata, is… realistic. His character did not waver upon a body change. The same cannot be said for isekai.
Perhaps the subject ReLIFE does well are the stakes. As an adult, your mindset changes heavily. Compare a child to a teenager. There’s already a large difference in minds. I’m sure most of us were called smart as a child, but became dumb during their teenage years. Kaizaki has to act like a highschooler, which isn’t easy as he has possible slip-ups. In ReLIFE, everything is on the line. Your memories, your friends and your future. I’m stopping here to avoid spoilers.

Art:
img()

I’m actually unsure whether the art is good or not. I’m not a picky person when it comes to animation, but if I had to put it in terms, it was average. The volleyball scenes were well animated, and the stills were fine, I guess. ReLIFE has a style. One that I’ve never seen before. I was turned off initially at the start because the style was weird, but it’s unique, and I respect that. However, my friend said it looked like hentai animation which I disagreed with. But taste in art is subjective. Or I’m just focusing on subtitles too much. (Hopefully, not.)

Sound:
img()

The opening was nice, though it’s not exactly an opening you’ll remember every day. I guess if I had to rate it, it would be a 7/10, for being catchy but not memorable. I appreciate the number of subtle spoilers in the opening, though. I cannot say the same for the endings. The endings changed every episode, but some fit the theme of where the episode ended. It wasn’t memorable, so I can’t really give you an honest opinion on ReLIFE’s endings. It hits hard always… depending on the episode.

The voice acting was nice. I was dying of satisfaction of Kaizaki’s voice as he feels SO CRISP! His accent, too. Everyone did their role nicely, but there was one girl with red hair who took a bit of getting used to. She sounded more realistic than the others so it was refreshing.

Characters:
img()

I think the characters were the ones that carried the show. I’d watch an entire slice of life anime about these characters, or One Piece but the pirates are ReLIFE characters. They’re just so realistic and fun to watch. Admittedly, the story raised their characters higher. (Am I using that right?) This is the type of anime where the characters and story compliment each other.

All the characters have significant traits to them. One is a popular kid, but is pure and doesn’t truly understand his feelings. One has social problems but is academically smart. The show also manages screentime really well, as there are a large amount of characters.
One character I’d like to talk about is Red hair girl. She, by far, was the most realistic character. Humans… are annoying. They slip up way too much and they make mistakes. Red hair girl has a lot of problems that she can’t talk about, because we are afraid of losing our friendships. I thought she would change in the end, but she ended up being the same. Because it isn’t easy for humans to change. And I’m sure most of you can relate.


TL;DR
img()

There’s just so many things that I could talk about and how ReLIFE became one of my favourites out of nowhere, but I don’t wanna drag this review more than I already have. 
This is the type of anime that you won’t be judged for watching. And there’s only like 2 short boob jokes (less than 10 seconds at most) , no fanservice at all. I’m not sure about you guys but this ruined my mood so much because my sensitive self got so depressed at the end of every episode. (I still am at every chapter of the manga.) I got so caught off guard because I was having so much fun for 3 episodes and now everything got gloomy.

Final words: I’m actually unsure how to recommend this show. Do watch it."
16782,"A movie with an okay story and amazing visuals.

[(SPOILER AHEAD) STORY:]()
The whole premise of the show is that an upcoming shoemaker ""Takao Akizuki"" meets an older lady when he skips school to go to a garden. He meets her only on rainy days at the garden. They bond together during those meet up and become really close, until the rainy days stop.

He soon finds out that she is in fact a teacher at his school who is getting not the best treatment from the students. He goes to her house and begs to change and open up. That's basically it. I'm not sure what the ending is supposed to symbolise or mean, and I watched the ending like 2 times just for this review. My guess is that its something about maturity and growing as a person to overcome those things we are scared to go through. Ever since that last scene with the teacher the student character attended school much more often and even made some friends instead of going to the garden every day.




[CHARACTERS:]()
There is really only 2 character that matter in this whole movie.

Takao Akizuki - The guy who keeps going ot the garden each rainy day and meets up with the mysterious woman. He falls in love with that gal, even after he finds out she is a teacher. He feels like your generic student who would do anything for their love interest. As we seen during that fight scene.

Yukari Yukino - The mysterious woman who always goes to the garden on rainy days and meets up with the upcoming shoemaker. She is calm and collected, like a mature adult (Cause she is one). Nothing much about the character, it feels like  a normal adult.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
Now this is where the movie really shines.
The animation and art style is amazing, just like ""Your Name.""

It's smooth, especially the rain, so pleasing to look at non stop.
The character design is also really good. All of the animation and art-style aspects feel realistic.




[MUSIC:]()
The OST is also really good. Its calm and beautiful and reflects those peaceful rainy days really well. Really good for calming down any day.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
I don't hate this movie, I liked the animation and the OST. But the story is not something I put that much care into, it just didn't connect with me that much. So don't let that 60/100 scare ya, this is a good movie, but just more on the boring side. If that makes sense."
1689,"After watching Makoto Shinkai's Weathering with You, I fell down the rabbit hole and became religiously obsessed with his other films. His other work, notably Your Name, Voices of A Distant Star, and Garden of Words center the themes of distance, longing, and loneliness. I'd like to add that as I write this review, I, too, am going through my own internal heartbreak and self reflection as I say goodbye to my own unrequited love and all feelings attached with that.

5 Centimeters per Second heavily relies on beautiful art and scenery to paint emotions that otherwise would have not been visible to the audience. Scenes of the empty fields with gusts of winds blowing through the grass, waves crashing down the beautiful ocean, and stars and galaxies glimmering in the night sky show how vast and wide the world could be. And yet, with the right amounts of fate and destiny our two protagonists, Takaki Tono and Akari Shinohara, are able to meet and fall in love. As the two move around, we are able to see their worlds and how strikingly different they are.

Our heartstrings are pulled as we see Tono experience his longing for his first love all while technology advances, but their communication does not. We see the inevitable downfall of their relationship as they miss chances to relay their feelings. This particular theme hits hard for many people, especially millennials who now have to heavily rely on algorithms in dating apps in order to make meaningful connections. How do we form relationships without having to meet face-to-face? How do we close the distance between us just by text messaging? These are all questions Tono, too, has to ask himself to cope with his crippling loneliness.

Though set in the 90s, the themes of this story are timeless and Makoto Shinkai uses that to his advantage. I saw someone in the comment section say that 'sometimes the greatest types of love are the ones that can't go anywhere'. That's a hard pill to swallow as both a Makoto Shinkai fan and someone with a broken heart. Maybe this review is my attempt to come to terms with my own reality, knowing that even with all this advanced communication and technology that we truly could never really be together. Maybe the greatest part of this love is being able to be strong about not being able to go further, preserving the version of the person we love the most.

Perhaps we can find each other falling in love in our next life."
11741,"Brace yourselves, because this review will be chock full of spoilers of both Fate/Zero Season 1 and 2.

It's not often you get a show so captivating and entertaining as Fate/zero. With its battle royale plot, where 7 masters and servants fight in order to attain the holy grail that can grant any wish. It includes a variety of adrenaline-pumping and fierce fight scenes, as well as it's many remarks to philosophy, history, mythologies and old legends, including f.ex alexander the great from ancient greece (Rider) ,the legend of King Arthur from Great britain (Saber), etc. It’s safe to say that Fate/Zero is a show that pushed both my intellectual and emotional buttons.

 Fate/zero has many great things that I value in anime, like f.ex stunning and vivid visuals from Ufotable, entertaining and charming dialogue from the its writer Gen Urobuchi and a slow-paced but exciting and entertaining plot by Type-Moon. If there is one single person who was the reason for me watching this in the first place, then that would be both the infamous and famous writer Gen Urobuchi, who has made a well known name for himself as ""butcher"" since his shows often contains dark material, like f.ex gore, dystopian and even rape and severed heads, etc. 

Overall, I would define Fate/Zero as a shocking tragedy. The biggest tragedy in Fate/zero was the journey of one man's realization that his idealistic worldview was skewed from the beginning and caused more damage than good. The other being one man's repressed and unknown desires that where actualized in a corrupted and evil way at the very last episode, his wishes could’ve been done differently if he had integrated it rather then repressed it for so long. These two men, Kiritsugu Emiya and Kotomine Kirei where made to be rivals. Kirei being a christian mage who is a traditionalist who tries to be a “good man” by executing those that in his eyes perform evil and Kiritsugu, a merciless killer who tires to execute every single mage out there from childhood trauma that lead to utilitarismen. In banal terms, the bad guys won and the good guys lost.

Speaking of Kiritsugu, he was easily my favourite character in this show and the one who I wanted to see win the most. His philosophy of the world is similar to mine, i.e in order to save the whole human race, you have to sacrifice few people. As a viewer, I can admit to many of his actions going too far. As to f.ex killing his own father and his caregiver, Natalia Kaminski. But, I do empathize with him. 

Apart from him, Gilgamesh and Iksander where also great characters in the story. Both being servants who were overall had the strongest personalities. Gilgamesh being a arrogant guy who called everyone “morgels”  and Iksander being the reincarnation of Alexander the great. What I really liked about this was how these two where legendary kings who tried to integrate with modern society. Seeing f.ex Iksander commenting on books about him and watching war movies was really fun to see. Gilgamesh also appeared in a human form, who gave advice to Kotomine Kirei.

One of my biggest problems with Fate/Zero was the anti-climactic nature of many of its spectacular and enthralling fights. There are surprisingly few fights in this show that leads to a death in this battle royale, but like I stated in my introduction, almost all of the fights here are really cool to watch thanks to the clear and high-budget animation by ufotable. What also bugged me was that almost every single servant was so friendly with each other. F.ex in Episode 11 of Season 1, they have a wine meeting where they talk like they’re close friends, but they had the intentions of wanting to kill each other for a price! The dialogue however thankfully saves a lot of things about Fate/zero, with Rider and Saber f.ex in that episode talking about their experiences with their own kingdoms and their motives for the war, tying again into the glorious philosophical side of this anime. 
I can’t also forget the 40-minute long first episode was also too much of an exposition dump, they could’ve spaced out the theory parts a bit more into the later episodes where we got to know the characters a bit more and not introduced almost every single character in the exact same episode. I think this makes the show hard to get into by not really inviting the audience, instead just blasting exposition at you.

Overall, Fate/Zero was a show that pushed both the intellectual and emotional sides of me. It started out slow, but got more entertaining and interesting the longer it went on. The philosophical aspects of the show where its virtue, with its many anti-climactic fight scenes being its vice. Kiritsugu Emiya was my favourite character, and I liked seeing every character and their perspective and what desires they had on winning the holy grail.

VERDICT: 9/10"
116742,"This is going to be a review of the entire second season, thus including part 1.

How far we have come from season one. The first season was a joy, it took the concept of isekai and brought it down to what made it such a fun genre to begin with. A really positive tone, tons of likable characters and a constant feeling of progression. It wasn't without its flaws, especially the arc with the kids was quite the borefest, but as a whole it was fun.

Now with season 2 here... yeah, the positive tone is basically gone. The anime has completely steered into ""oh shit"" territory, with Rimuru facing some actual challenges. The positive tone is still there in some form, but most of this anime is misery and politics. And this change... it has some mixed results.

Let's talk about what I really like in comparison with the season 1 first. The politics in Season 2 is something I really enjoy. It expands the world and it makes me constantly crave to know more about what is going on this bizarre isekai world. What I also like is that the highlights of this season are way bigger then in season 1. While progression is fun, only progression and little result can get stale quick, and this season finally shows those results and it feels amazing. It really makes putting your time even through the more frustrating/boring parts more worth it in the end. The climax of both parts are especially a joy. Lastly, I think the character additions this season have been fun all across the board.

Now let's get to my biggest problem with this season: The story is incredibly flawed. It is probably the worst part of the entire anime since it fluctuates in quality so much throughout the season. Part 1 is probably the worst offender with this, in which the entire middle really drives home how much misery there is. At this point the drama isn't well constructed enough to pull these kinds of misery arcs, thus the entire middle of part 1 is frustrating as hell. Not to mention, part 1 has many episodes that are just bad. One episode a huge plottwist happens, but by the second half of the episode the emotional impact of the plottwist is completely ruined. And the episode after that, which is supose to be the aftermath of that plottwist, it is largely devoted to flashbacks. 

But with my gripes with part 1, that doesn't mean that this part 2 comes of scott free. The entire first half of part 2 is basically exposition. Exposition, exposition, comic relief doing something funny, exposition. It does feel like it is constantly building up to the climax, but so much building tires even the best workers out, letalone an anime watcher. I binged part 2, but even I got a bit exhausted by the end with the amount of exposition, so I can't imagine how people who watched it during its airing felt. Besides that, I also noticed a drop in animation quality towards the end. It seems weird that they split the anime in two parts so that the animators could catch some breath but they still produce poor animation. Feel bad for the animators. 

Overall, I still liked season 2. Despite my many complaints I have about the anime, I think my love for progression and the characters is what kept me going back to this anime. The characters are still all so lovable and that makes all the difference in how much I care about the anime. I also prefer part 2 over part 1, that's for sure.

If you like season 1 then season 2 is still worth checking out, just be aware that a lot of episodes are worthy skips and that the tone is a lot darker from season 1."
100876,"“When it comes to gambling, there’s always a risk involved.” – No one in particular, FACTS and LOGIC speak for themselves here.

Gambling is a concept we should all be able to relate to. Maybe not as the premise of a series or with having ever put one's own money on the line, but wagers are constantly made in our own minds regarding quality when a new show comes around. A mere glance at the seasonal lineup will inevitably lead to first impressions being made despite how little is known about an anime. But make no mistake, this is to our advantage no matter where in the life cycle of anime fandom you lie. Slowly but surely these thoughts act as effective tools to determine whether an anime will be to our liking. However, for this to happen, gambles must be made. From newer fans learning of disappointment for the first time by not ‘dropping shit like it’s hot’, to hardened viewers having learned what garbage lies amongst every season’s dark trenches – we all made bets one time or another, and we all suffered for our ignorance. As Kurt Cobain said: Nobody dies a virgin, life fucks us all.

Kakegurui was one anime that served this purpose for me. I had hopes for the show to be the standout of its time, only for that hope to be taken and buried six feet under its own morally bankrupt excrement, all while the protagonist stared back at me with a smug, crazy-eyed look on her face. Jesus may not have wept when he felt betrayed, but I could not follow his example. I felt the need to release these pent-up emotions; I wanted catharsis and my review on its first season is where you can find it. I detested Kakegurui for the suffering it put me through and have now seen hundreds of anime to have awakened my third eye. So naturally, one may find themselves asking me ""hurr durr poohead, if you don’t like, why still watch? And to that, my answer is simple: I am Jesus, or at least I like to believe such. One value Jesus promoted during his time on Earth was forgiveness, and like Jesus providing us the ability to atone for past sins, I approach Kakegurui in the same fashion. This is Kakegurui’s chance at redemption and despite already disappointing with the title clearly missing one more “X”, it deserves at least that much from me.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

Following last season’s anticlimactic finale, Kakegurui x(x)x was put in the awkward position to follow a plot and characters left with practically no conclusions nor a clear sense of direction. Instead of establishing clear intentions of how this season would approach the narrative, no time is wasted introducing viewers back to the main appeal of the series: gambles featuring raunchy females and their sadistic facial expressions. The academy still appears to be lacking in faculty members to ever properly function as an academy, although we are welcomed with new faces. After Yumeko single-handedly decimated the Student Council’s stranglehold over most gambling-related affairs, an election looms over the school for main antagonist Kirari Momobami’s position as president. This causes the emergence of a new threat in the form of the “Momobami clan”, all family member related to Kirari with their objective being to banish Kirari from their family. It’s also revealed that Yumeko is related to the family in some way and also becomes a target of the clan, challenged to a series of gambles throughout this season. It’s an admirable attempt to drastically shake things up and deliver on more creative, unpredictable moments to keep fans invested. Unfortunately, the intentions still fall short as Kakegurui x(x)x comes across more like a rehash of the first season than otherwise, unable to move away from issues that plagued the previous season.

Kakegurui x(x)x as a series thrives on its gambles as they are the easiest way for the series to create any sense of thrill and excitement. This season puts a greater emphasis on them specifically by decreasing the number of gambles taking place and in turn increase the amount of time and focus given to each gamble. Most games take two episodes to complete instead of one and do better in allowing more character development and motivations to take centre stage. In theory this should be a more successful way to structure this season compared to last, however these changes manage to come across in practice as a detriment to the show overall from my perspective. Aside from removing the idea of stakes from their gambles almost altogether, using several episodes to explore the inner workings of games is usually effective when the games themselves have a certain level of complexity to them. Here's the problem: barely any games shown in the series thus far have that level of depth purely in their construction, with games like the “Finger Cutting Guillotine” only being effective as a game of chicken. It also does no help for this show that every gamble is extremely predictable in their outcome, with Yumeko only allowing for games to end in her favour, as proven from S1 and is the way of the Mary Sue. For a piece of entertainment, these drawn-out gambles are unable to adequately capitalize on the initial suspense and excitement viewers wish to feel each episode. 

Because Kakegurui x(x)x is always following the almighty Yumeko and her deus ex machina abilities, it’s the other characters who are required to do the show’s heavy lifting. She may be the main character, but their perspectives are the ones always shown when standing opposed to Yumeko and end up changing as a result. In the first season they were barely more than obstacles for Yumeko to swiftly overcome but they still contained something about them that defined them as a character besides their design. Yumemi is an idol singer, Itsuki had a fingernail obsession, even edge-queen Midari had her revolver fetish of all things. In Kakegurui x(x)x, we have a clan full of new characters that we know little to nothing about regarding personality or motives aside from the their clan’s objective. Sorry, but simply having a cool-looking design does not make them any more interesting as characters. They just look cool. Although these new characters do break away from the stereotypes birthed from last season; no longer are all the females psychotic or grotesque, and the introduction of new male characters breaks the idea of males in the show being no more than pathetic beta males. But that’s far from a high positive for the season. So far these new antagonists have been relegated to just fulfilling mandatory roles as Yumeko's opponents. There still lies development present here for secondary characters that is noteworthy, but the way Kakegurui x(x)x treats these characters so sparingly in the narrative does it no benefits. I’m not fond of seeing a side character to return for two episodes looking like Ken Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul before being pushed to the side again for however long the narrative demands. 

With how the series handles both its plot and characters with such recklessness, Kakegurui x(x)x is the kind of anime one can find easily detestable. Not to say one cannot find enjoyment anywhere here, but when trying to depict characters created clearly immoral as admirable in a story centred around malevolent aspects of gambling, I’m left asking myself serious questions. Who is this being made for? What is this show trying to say? Clearly the show's focus is on addiction – why else would the anime title be translated to “Compulsive Gambler”? It’s not shocking that the characters with the most plot armour are the ones with the worst cases of addiction. But what has the series done so far in 24 episodes to really delve into this theme? Yumeko has yet to show any signs of distress or psychological torment while the punishment for losing is constantly raised to astronomical proportions. Is she a sociopath? If so, how is anyone supposed to know when it’s not even remotely close to a realistic depiction? Kakegurui x(x)x seems to be the kind of show that likes to have its cake and eat it too. It wishes to be a commentary on the dangers of gambling whilst holding the act up proudly on a pedestal, unabashed in sympathising with those clearly contemptible of such deeds. A show that sets up stakes and never follows through with them. Trying to impress with intellect and logic while simultaneously having the Tower of Doors arc end with the loser jumping out the “correct door” because she’s apparently so smart that she SUBCONSCIOUSLY CALCULATED what door was the one that wouldn’t kill her. The show has so many glaring holes, I could probably order it on the menu at Subway. 

Kakegurui x(x)x from a visual standpoint is likely to either make or break the experience for viewers, and it’s almost solely because of the facial expressions. Once again Studio MAPPA tries to bring out as much insanity from these designs as humanly possible. While it does convey the kind of lunacy viewers are in for when watching characters lose themselves in their games, it’s still far from aesthetically pleasing and will no doubt have its fair share of detractors. Although if you’re already this far into the show I’d assume you can tolerate it. The character designs for the main cast are certainly eye-catching especially compared to new characters. Background art is usually typical and unimaginative but fits perfectly fine during games. The visual effects are still a strong part of the series and CGI usage is improved upon from last season. As for the soundtrack used, it never particularly stood out throughout the season but I was pleasantly surprised with the new opening and ending themes used here. Honestly I found myself preferring both themes over those from S1, despite the first from my perspective working as a better introduction to the comical madness this series indulges in. The voice acting also felt like an improvement, not coming across as off-putting when it came to the crazier parts of the script. They all do a great job in their respective roles, with Yumeko Jabami’s performance by Saori Hayami capturing a wide array of emotions in her voice to match the character’s absurd behaviour.

At first, I called Kakegurui pretty awful and feeling like it wasted my time. Now having given the series a second chance my thoughts haven’t changed that much. Making a second season that blatantly imitates key events of its predecessor only to fall victim to its shortcomings is not what I had expected or hoped for, but I still found a silver lining to this season. While Kakegurui initially felt more of an insult in what it set out to be, Kakegurui x(x)x has a clearer identity about it that I can respect. Instead of trying to encapsulate far too much in so little time for its own good and as a result failing in every way, this season is more inclined to take a step back from the intensity in order to bring more detail and focus on something grander. Whether this is a significant improvement remains to be seen, but the potential is there, building to something hopefully greater than anything the series has shown us yet. I still dislike the series, but I cannot say that I haven’t developed more respect for what it sets out to be. And for that, I do not consider Kakegurui x(x)x a complete waste of time."

Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl, the sequel movie that we all looked forward to releasing, hoping that it would bring the same beautiful emotions that we had felt before. Without a fresh rewatch or a sharp memory, you’re sure to instantly be lost in the storyline because it doesn’t wait for you to catch up. This film focuses on Shouko Makinohara, the girl that gave Sakuta the strength to push through a tough phase in his life and leave a lasting impression on him. Aside from the odd pacing of this movie, the story it tells is one that can have a great emotional impact. The message it carries of accepting fate and appreciating what you have can be clearly seen, but the way this movie executes it makes the task a very difficult one. All the emotion was definitely there for the taking, as long as you didn’t mind the faster pacing. But it may affect a lot of you who may feel like the story is being cut short, as if not enough attention is being given to the emotional moments. You’re not wrong in those feelings, this movie had to cram 2 volumes of content into just around an hour and a half. If I’m being honest, this film would’ve reached its full potential with an extra hour so they could take their time on the more emotional parts. Also, you’re more than likely gonna have to rewatch it in order to get the storyline straight, because a lot of the events occur back-to-back without any breathing room. Overall, I still really enjoyed what this film brought to the table. It had a more serious and dramatic mood to it than the anime, and this was due to the focus and development of Shouko. Without further ado, let’s get on with the scoring!

Art and Animation: 9.3/10
- The same beautiful art style was incorporated into this film, but with added benefits. With more attention being brought to the detail of background settings, the overall atmosphere felt much more authentic. The color palette had matched with the seasons, resulting in a realistic winter that contributed to the mood. When it came to the character designs and animations, nothing was especially lacking. The camera shots though, were at some places a bit excessive. This may be due to the quicker pace of the storyline though. I enjoyed the attention to animated details such as the snow or water, which added to the mood even more.

Storyline and Character Progression: 8.2/10
- While the storyline was deep and complex, it was just too much content to fit within an hour and a half. You could get easily lost in the plot, which means rewatching this movie isn’t a bad idea. The only main thing I didn’t care for was, again, the pacing of the storyline. The reason for this was because I felt like the emotional moments derived a lot more “screen time” than they got. I felt like some of the scenarios were just so natural, while others felt forced and rushed. There wasn’t too much character progression either, but that’s mainly because most of the focus is on Shouko. We did get to see a more unique side of Mai though as the storyline progressed, which added to the even more dramatic feel of the movie. This movie didn’t nearly have as many funny moments as the anime, but it was rather focused more on the drama aspect this time around. Without rewatching it, you may feel lost or even forget the significance that Shouko has in Sakutas life. So I highly recommend you do so before starting the movie, as this will increase your appreciation for the overall storyline. The character progression that Shouko did gain was somewhat average. There just wasn’t enough time to develop her fully with the complex plot at hand, since more time was put into trying to bring the storyline together and explain it along the way.

Soundtrack and Audio: 8.7/10
- Nothing too special here that stood out. The soundtrack wasn’t the main focus of the environment, but it played a role in giving certain moments the emotion it needed, I definitely wish that the overall musicality featured more content, but I’m glad nothing bad was present. After all, we still got to listen to that beautiful ED we’re all on love with. Audio was as good as always, and even though some emotional moments were rushed, the emotion itself was still authentic and honest. The voice actors had done their jobs very well to give as much emotion as they could to the scene.

Overall, I still really enjoyed watching another entry of this series. While the ending was a bit odd, I didn’t mind it too much. The quality of the art and audio was kept to either the same quality or higher, and remained consistent. With only an hour and a half to crunch over 2 volumes of character development and storyline, I don’t blame them for having to pick up the pace throughout the whole movie. I still just wish certain moments were given the time they deserved so that we could just emotionally accept the events taking place. If you don’t mind a quicker pacing, then you’ll have no problems at all with this movie. In fact, the pacing was just about the only thing that really held it back. That’s why I’m comfortable with giving it a 8.7/10. While it was pretty consent in keeping its quality, this movie is DEFINITELY a hit or miss due to how you may feel about the cut and rushed storyline. After giving the entire series a rewatch and then rewatching the movie, I was able to appreciate more the storyline and connect with it WAY more than my first watch. So I definitely encourage any of you to rewatch the series before continuing on to this movie. That’s all for now, thanks so much for reading this far. See you in the next one!

Preface:

There comes a point where bad reviews on a series lead to more bad reviews. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think that it's always necessary for the communities of people that do enjoy a particular series to speak up. Whether you want this narrative to be about not blindly hating people for appreciating something that you don't, or just the simple fact that negative emotions are expressed much more often than positive ones - regardless of the series or subject matter. 

Guilty Crown is a series that I think perfectly represents this. You see many people giving the series high praise, but also equally as many that absolutely hate the series. The issues comes in when you might realize that negative emotions and thoughts speak much louder than the praise, and as such result in a series being interpreted much more negatively than what might actually be the case. For the sake of this narrative, I'll include that amongst 500,000 raters on MyAnimeList, Guilty Crown has ammassed an average score of exactly 7.50. On AniList, as well, the series sits as the #115 most popular anime of all time as of me writing this, with as many ""100"" ratings as there are ""60"" ratings. For clarification, most ratings lie in the 70s and 80s in terms of score on AniList with a fairly even split.

This would, realistically, lead anybody to expect that a series is enjoyable and entertaining; that the series was good, but not excellent. To put it shortly, that the series is controversial in viewer criticsm and thoughts. This is exactly right. 

But a series can't be controversial and contested in ratings and reviews if there is nobody sticking up for the other end, right? Surely you don't see many positive reviews, though this can be attributed primarily to the fact that ranting about something positively is much less common than doing so negatively - especially when most of these existing reviews are negative, and there is an expecting hostile reaction from others to your own positive ramblings. As such, we see a lot of quiet people rating the series higher than what most might expect. Such is life not only on the internet, but in general; a fear of losing face. 

THE SHOW:

img()

Characters. Often-times the main element of a show that pulls everything together and decides whether or not a viewer can identify with the experiences seen within it. Guilty Crown, to its own detriment, does not succeed at this. The characters in the series are all twisted in their own ways, and are very distant in terms of writing and narrative such that the viewers are not really able to easily identify with them. Manipulation is the name of the game, and watching the effects of this unfold in Guilty Crown was tragic up until the end.

Whether it comes in the form of Inori being planned to have been used as a tool as effectively cloned for the sake of fitting the narrative of others, is a broken and confused character. Her experiences have lead to some very drastic moments of clearly unhealthy thinking and behavior, including her romantic engagements. 

The main character, Shu Ouma, fulfills this role (unintentionally) for Inori. Shu takes on this role of a tool to be used, caught up in a plot bigger than himself. Every Shu turns, no matter who it is - his friends, Funeral Parlor, the government, his romantic interests, etc - Shu is constantly being used and manipulated by those around him. There are always alterior motives at play regarding any kindness that he is shown. 

Every character in this show is full of their own variety of self hatred and disgust. This isn't a feeling that can be reconciled or easily accepted by anyone, especially in real life. As such, these characters end up pushing off their feelings onto others. If they can not accept the cruel nature of their life and nature, then they will exploit the others around them as to feel less alone in that pain.

Have you ever gotten in trouble and felt like you wanted someone else to get in trouble with you? Just so that you weren't alone in that experience? I'm certain that everybody has felt this to some degree, though it is certainly amplified in the context of Guilty Crown.

IMPORTANT QUOTES:

img()

This theme is constantly hidden throughout the quotes of the show, as you are seeing a world packed full of self hatred and desperation. I've included some quotes to help and further this concept, one from each major character, below (alongside a brief explanation of the symbolism in a few of the more discreet examples):

“I was wrong, kindness is pointless.” – Shu Ouma

“There are only two paths you can choose. You can sit quietly and be selected out of this world, or you can adapt and change.” – Gai Tsutsugami
The above quote by Gai sets a narrative that being yourself is not an option in this world. You must change who you are for the others around you, or be pushed away and rejected.

“I’m afraid of myself, because… I’m a monster.” – Inori Yuzuriha

“Sympathy only gets people hurt.” – Tsugumi

“I’m not going to apologize. This is an absurd, unfair world.” – Yahiro Samukawa


The world is desperate and full of hate. In guilty crown, the only forms of kindness genuinely shown take the form of understanding the self-loathing of another. The most ""comfort"" or happiness you can see from a character in this show is when there is even a glimmer of acceptance shown towards a character.

THE CONFUSION:

img()

Even I found the middle portion of the series to be hard to watch. But this wasn't because the show was tragically bad. It wasn't because I lacked interest in seeing how things continued. It was because I was roped into that hatred that the characters that they had for themselves. The main character, hoped to become a shining light in the world of hate, just falls victim to it and develops into yet another manipulator. If you can't beat them, join them. 

The ending left many feeling confused. Eventually in the series, Shu and Inori come to find a shred of acceptance between eachother. They felt as if they were only accepted and welcome in their own little circle. Everybody outside of their relationship was an outsider, or was an 'enemy'. Though the vicious cycle of self-hate continues, and Shu grows unable to force himself to live out the rest of his life with the same morals and behavior as those that caused him so much grief in the past. The ending of the anime shows Shu attempting to rid not only himself, but also the other around him, of what had effectively become their burden and hatred. 

Throughout the series you grow to hope for Shu to find it in himself to... well... find himself. To live for himself, and to be himself regardless of the thoughts and pressure of those around him. The ending of the series results in its own form of tragedy. While Shu accepts the death or loss of the one person that he felt connected to, that one person continues on within Shu. To clarify further, this tragic loss was of Inori. Inori finally was given a release, and the ultimate form of acceptance for her ""fake"" and troubled soul. This did, however, come at the cost of Shu's own sanity. Shu was granted his chance to survive, but this was only done by the voluntarily loss of the only person that he had grown to accept and hold dear. 

The music and art in Guilty Crown is absolutely beautiful. There is no sane viewer that can see the series and find it detestable. Though I think the importance of this music is downplayed significantly. This leads me to part of what makes the series even more unique.

EGOIST:

img()

Music in Guilty Crown is not just pleasing to the ears. It is a story. It is a part of the series that must be interpreted and considered.

I find it difficult to understand how this is as under-valued as it is. Inori, the main heroine in Guilty Crown, is an embodiment of the actual singer Egoist. Egoist is an existing singer and artist not only within the world of Guilty Crown, but the real world as well. This is a raw implementation of the real life artist and the persona that she holds.

I mentioned previously that Inori effectively lived on through Shu as she died. Although I was a bit sporadic in my wording for the sake of avoiding spoilers (I apologize for any confusion that might cause), this is a fantastic example. Within the opening song of the anime, you can hear a line which specifically plays into this:

""So everything that makes me whole, belongs to you; I'll give my heart and soul, I'm yours...""



Recall that this isn't just a fitting line for the themes of the story. This is Inori - this is Egoist. The character in the anime, the singer, and the persona of the artist in real life. 

Music does not have to exist just to make a story more enjoyable.

Sometimes, in the case of Guilty Crown, it can exist to make a series work. It can be a part of the narrative.

FINAL NOTES:

img()

Is Guilty Crown a masterpiece? Absolutely not. Does it have plot holes, and cases of just outright missed opportunities? It sure does.

I don't think that Guilty Crown is a series that can just be recommend to someone with 100% certainty. It's not something that can easily be esteemed as one of the narratively greatest anime series.

But a viewer can help to define what is beautiful. I mentioned at the start of the review that negative emotions speak louder than positive ones. I included a nod to the fact that negative feelings influence further negative feelings in others, as well as suppressing positive feelings that some might have.

I find this awfully ironic. It's an undeniable fact that these things do happen in the real world, and it's shown in the Guilty Crown reception. However, isn't that the exact thing that the anime so deeply ingrains into its story? Evil creates evil; negativity leads to negativity; the good is suppressed by the ever-louder ""bad"". I'll happily be that one voice for the good - I won't make Shu's mistake and allow myself to be altered by those around me in opinion or person. I am me, and my opinions are mine. 

Although accepting and giving into the emotions of the majority can be more welcoming and can be easier... how valuable is that? I'll take the stronger bonds and relationships gained by enforcing the minority than wanting to be mindlessly accepted by the majority that is much more negative and often-times hurtful.


I'll leave you with the lyrics of the opening, which is not only indicative of the series and its themes but also is full of extremely important ideas to consider.

21679,"OVERALL COMMENT (8.8):

- Season 2 is a whole new level compared to season 1. 
- Sometimes deep, other times, cheesy.
- The storytelling in ep 13 - 16 is MUY BIEN. I really wished the main storyline took the same somber feeling as the mafia backstory.  

(I) VISUALS, DESIGNS, CINEMATOGRAPHY (9) & AUDIO (9.5) 

(A) General Comments:
- Just like season 1, Bungo Stray Dogs greatly excels with their visual style. 
- The transitions between scenes is smoothly done. 
- I particularly like how the black screen comes in as the dialogue continues, giving the conversation a mysterious and ominous vibe. 

(B) Title Screen cards: 
- I appreciate they way they design Title screen. I also like how they start off with one-liners which sets the tone of the episode. 

(C) Intro/Outro (Audio and visuals): 
- Intro AND outro song is a VIBE.
- The neon noir visuals in Intro #1 is gorgeous. The use of neon typography over saturated scenes gives off dark mafia vibes.
- Intro #2 is also sick af

(D) Use of Audio/Music:
- Unlike s1 which used a lot of techno music, this season used classical instruments to depict a deeper and solemn atmosphere.
- Ep 15, the ringing, the muffled voice.
- Transitions between title screens, intros, and outros in this season is impactful. 

(E) Character voice:
- The actors ARE the characters. They blend in so well and display emotions as if they were real (esp with Odasaku). 

(II) CHARACTERS (9)

(a) General Comments
- Unlike in season 1, the atmosphere surrounding characters is much darker. 
- Characters are mysterious, dimensional, and human. No one is truly bad, nor is anyone truly good either.
- Makes up for what season 1 had lacked. 
- I really enjoyed seeing in the perspective of the Mafia, It was so well executed.
- The way they wrote in the character's perspective (esp with Odasaku) is chef's kiss. 

!(b) Dazai – visually aesthetic. I really enjoy his dark aura. Being able to divulge into his back story gives him more life. 

(c) Odasaku – ANGEL. Daddy vibes with the biggest heart. His dialogues were impactful and nicely written. The depth of character and complexity of his emotions was executed so well to the point that you can hear it through his voice and see it in his eyes.

(d) Akutagawa – Has a Danzai complex. Puppy at heart. 

(e) Relationships – The relationship between Dazai and Odasaku, which explains the backstory of Dazai and his decisions, yet giving Odasaku the main platform. Well executed. I'm interested to see how Akutagawa grows next season and his relationship with Atsushi. 

(f) Growth – Character growth this season is well done. Not just for the Armed Forces, but also the mafia and the guild was dimensional. 

(g) Mafia – Has love for the city and has their own way of protecting it. A nice touch.!

(III) PLOT (8.5)

- Ep 13 to 16 has the best story telling. Smooth and touching. But kind of went downhill after that. 
- Some dialogues felt a bit forced. 
- I'm glad they finally explained how Atsushi had gained control of his powers.

(IV) PACING (8.5)
- The first four episodes was such a BIG improvement, however, that momentum did not last. The consistency in story-telling is a bit weak. 
- The beginning of the season started off so strongly. Oda's background and character, the dialogue and premise was memorable. If I could rate ""Oda's arc"", it would be a 9.5/10. But because I have to rate the whole season, it drops to an 8.8 (which is still good in my opinion). 

(V) ENJOYMENT (8.5)

(V) PERSONAL IMPACT (8)

!- Ep 15, with the ear-piercing ring, Odasaku screaming. 'I can no longer write a story'. This scene really makes your heart break along side his. 
- Ep 16, The fact that the mafia became a licensed govt organisation, which explains why they're virtually untouchable in s 1. Odasaku's fight scene and final words is a 10/10 sad. He was such a beautiful and complex character. 
- Ep 20, the end bit is nice, I like how the mafia is multi-dimensional, not good, but not bad.  
- Ep 24, 'all we have is the right to waver. Like stray dogs that have hit rock bottom'.!

(VI) ENDING (9.5)
- Great wrap up. 
- Connection to the beginning and an intro premise for the next season is nicely done. I also appreciated the humour."
98436,"This review was taken from my reviews blog, [link to the original here](https://haxoscript.wordpress.com/2018/07/04/review-mahoutsukai-no-yome/)

I was really excited for this anime. I really wanted to love it. But there's a limit at the amount of bad elements that you can ignore. While the premise was very interesting, it failed to deliver any expectations that I could have.

Story: The Ancient Magus' Bride tells us a story about a girl named Chise who, after living a life of abandon, gets adopted by a mysterious mage called Elias. The story will be about that pair getting closer to each other while discovering all the magic elements that exist in their world.

Plot: That's one of the points that fails the most. I admit it, the first half of the story (ep. 1-12) was great, as it presents more interesting  characters that will stay with the main ones, tells us about the rules of that world, and bases the conflicts that the story will have to resolve. But then the second part arrives, and for some reason it proceeds to ignore all what they build in the first part. The pacing gets messed up, those episodes get repetitive, in them they try to resolve conflicts that apparently were already solved, and it just throws the characters into trivial situations that won't matter for the plot, the character building, or the message. And in the end, the most important conflicts get suddenly resolved without previous building for it. Another point is the ""funny moments"", they constantly make little scenes with the characters looking chibi and saying something funny in an attempt to make some comedy, and sometimes it works, but on other occasions they just insert them in the middle of a serious situation and it just breaks the mood.

Characters: Another aspect where it fails miserably. If i had to define all the characters with one word, it would be inconsistent. The main characters act differently from one situation to another, and this just ruins all the building they could have. Additionaly, some of the most misterious characters' past or motivations are never revealed, so at the end they seem lackluster. Regarding the side characters, they're used in a terrible way. Major part of them just show up for one episode and won't be seen again for a long time, and when they appear again they have a trivial role on the conflict. And yes, some of them are an attempt to develop the main characters, but it's worthless if that development is continuously ignored.

Visuals: The best aspect of the show. The artstyle, the colors and the animation are truly beautiful. Wonderful landscapes, original looking character designs, and effects that really makes the world look ""magic"".

Sound: Another good aspect. The first opening is excellent, and a few tracks are really great and they improve those ""magic"" moments along with the great art. The rest is forgettable but it does its job.

At the end, this show tries to make several points without reaching any of them. If you decide to watch this show, do it for the visual aspect, because regarding the plot and characters it leaves a lot to desire.

Overall score: 5/10"
20596,"Well I figure I'll write a more positive review since the other two are more on the negative side of this show. I have nothing against their reviews, I just figure I'll write one that shows the good quality of what made me enjoy this show. And I will say it's not for everyone, as it tackles a topic that some won't understand or appreciate as much as others. And I'm not talking about the relationship aspect of it, but more with dealing with death, loss, and depression. 

So with the not spoiler free review lol... here we go...

Blue - often can stand for many things. As we look at the ocean or sky, we see how open it is, representing freedom and life. As we know there is more life in the deep blue sea there anywhere else in the world. But also at the same time, we know blue can also stand for sadness or depression (feeling blue). Blue Spring Ride, depends on how you see it, I feel like it capture the two, as they are off the same coin. 
We open up with the two lead character in a very beautiful scene. We also see how it is raining and you know what color usually represent rain, blue. And rain often represent either new life (mainly spring) or sadness (tears). As the character grows and goes through different trails in life, as they face different issue, either with dealing with letting go or finding new friendship. 

First let's get the friendship part of it out of the way. I don't really want to spend too much time on this part of it, though not saying it isn't important. 
img()
Basically we start the series with Futaba having these friends who you can call ""friends."" Where she just wanted a place to belong and fit in. And anyone who's been too high school will know how hard it is to enjoy school by yourself. But this never felt genuine as she can never really be sincere in this friendship. She just tried to belong and fit in but when she finally show how she really felt, she loses her ""friends."" It isn't until after this that she befriends Yuuri who she really can be herself. Building a true friendship, one where she can be sincere. 
There's more you can talk about the friendship part of it but I'm not really in the mood to say much about it. As I often talk about this too much I'm just too lazy to write it out, so my apologize if I am sort of not fully writing out my whole thoughts on this part of it. 

Romance
img()
Honestly there isn't much to say about this part beside, if you really want the romance aspect of it, it's best to pick up the manga. As the anime barely even touch the surface of it. As it just gives us sort of, ""will they or won't they."" I mean I don't hate it, but I'm just saying, don't come in here expecting a romance anime where you are left with feeling satisfied. So that's all I really have to say about this. And the other romance subplot is just kind of there.... I feel like that if I was to say is a negative... sure I guess? Since it kind of got introduce but didn't really go anywhere. But no I'm not complaining about it lol... I'm just stating the obvious fact. 

Loss, depression, and letting go... I feel like this is more of the core theme of the show. 
img()
You only know what loneliness feels like once you feel what it is to be loved. When you no longer see the person you used to see, no longer hear their voice, knowing they no longer are around. Everyone person deals with loss differently. Either that is a friend who moved away or a love one who has pass on. No matter what, it is a painful experience. But the thing about life is that it is always best spent with others and never alone. 

""Even if death will eventually tear you apart, it’s better to meet someone than not meet them.""

Frederica (from the show 86)

I feel like Blue Spring Ride really capture this more as it's core theme then anything else. Overcoming depression is something that takes time and each person deals with it differently. One thing I do believe is that it is often best with those who genuinely care about you. A burden is lighter when we all carry it together. Some people will shut themselves out and sometimes it's up to us to knock down that wall/door to get to them. As this seem to be the main theme of the show. 
As winter will come and everything seems to freeze in time and place, we know that Spring will come soon after. It may be the end of one journey but it will be the beginning of a new one. We want to look forward by having so much ahead of us that we don't have to look back. Our past is meant to be there, but it is a part of who we are. In helping shape you and your future, to helping you grow, learn, and understand that there will always be struggle... but with them comes memories we can cherish. Those friends you have now, one will too be gone, but does not mean they weren't important. 

I'll end with this beautiful quote 

""All these moments will be lost like tears in the rain."" 

Agree to disagree with me but thanks for reading to the end. It was a beautiful ride with great visual and a unique cast of characters. A great OP and ED, each setting up and ending the anime beautifully. It's worth a watch, but as I stated if you really want a romance... you have to pick up the manga. (Sorry if there's grammar issue or anything since I'm too lazy to proof read and I just write it all in one go - whatever pops to my head lol)"

I'm pretty sure Date A Live saw these options: A) Give me harem and cute girls, B) Some cool sci-fi concepts please, and C) Dating sims would be nice, but decided to scratch choosing just one of those and instead incorporated them all into one weirdly entertaining piece. Everything is so silly, so dysfunctional, and so absurd, that I can't help but to humor myself in this show.

Seriously though. When you have a premise that basically takes dating—uh-huh, dating—as a way to save the world from mysteriously strong entities called Sprits, and they look like attractive girls I might add, things can spiral out of control very quickly. This show actually looks as if it embraces ridiculousness more than logic. It took common sense out of the game with the clichéd developments, theatrical dialogues, and generic character tropes like it's the most normal thing you can do. At one point, we see these Spirits demolishing buildings but the next thing, they swiftly fall in love with our protagonist, Shidou, after he spews out some good-sounding yet bland lines. Then there's also that episode about a weird food battle between militarized girls that takes form in fetishized ways. If the story sounds ridiculous, it definitely is. But somehow, it manages to turn an unwanted feature into a fun comedy-drama of farce nature.

Narratively speaking, I guess Date A Live can pride itself the most in two things: the dates and the girls. Even though Shidou is a surface-level protagonist in the more serious moments, he's quite a hilarious guy if we're talking about the slice-of-life scenes, a.k.a. the dates. His awkwardness when it comes to love comes out strongly when he's interacting with the Spirits, which brings us to our next topic about the girls. Forgetting the fact that they're not that fleshed out and embody known character tropes, their double personality of being cute and strong is definitely a charming quality. Every girl is given traits with enough distinctiveness from one another that they become enjoyable to watch in both the fighting and adorable aspects. And sexy aspects too, because their attractive looks will come to waste if we didn't get any fan services right?

Regarding the sci-fi elements here, most of them are seen in the military groups that fight against the Spirits. Not much explanations are given to how their technologies or operations exactly work, so don't expect much other than them existing for the sake of the dating sim premise and some display of cool-looking futurism.

When it comes to the aesthetics, this is where the girls are able to truly shine further with what you can say is the quickest way to a person's heart. The visual boasts a vibrant color palette which—when combined together with the great character designs for all the girls—is pretty darn appealing to look at. Its animation might not be the most immaculate out there, but the consistency helps to provide linear enjoyment. Even for the dating scenes, the quality hardly dips down and did really well to express the differences in tone when you compare the cuter liveliness from the explosive action scenes.

One other thing this show has strong rein over is the adaptable set of soundtracks. Variety comes in with galore as scenes are backed up by music that specializes in different moods, whether those are the cheerful colors of dating or the orchestral tension in powerful battles. The seiyuus did a solid job in personalizing their respective characters with fitting temperaments, especially when you consider the regular switches between the fun and the serious sides. Something else worth pointing out is the amazing deep vocal sang by secret ARMS for the opening song. I personally find it to be one of the better elements you can get here.

So, what can I say about Date A Live? It's definitely not a tidy show by any means. The story has this peculiarity to it that frequently gets to ridiculous levels, to the point where it doesn't follow the correct laws of rationality. But! If you can somehow find leisure in all that ridiculousness, it'll become somewhat of an amusing aspect. And if you're just here for all the strongly adorable girls, then I suppose you've come to the right place.

Be prepared. It's a date-eat-date world out there.

101167,"I tend to call the first season of Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon – AKA Danmachi – a pleasant surprise. Go in expecting harem schlock, but actually get a solid adventure with lovable characters and great worldbuilding. The good news is that those same elements are still around, and generally speaking this season of Danmachi is quite similar to its predecessor. But at the same time there are changes, with some fairly core aspects of the series being tweaked and fiddled with. I also think it's fair to say that some of the new topics and plot threads around the periphery are a little heavier tonally, and the production stumbles in a few places. On their own these factors would be easy to dismiss but together they add up, with the result being a season that may have bitten off a little more than it can comfortably chew.

Kicking things off basically right where the events of season one ended, Bell and Hestia immediately find themselves at odds with the much larger, more powerful Apollo familia. Bell’s feats have garnered the attention of many gods including Apollo, who has become hyper-fixated on getting the upstart hero to join him, by any means necessary. After forcing a “war game” (essentially a mock battle between two familias) revolving around the siege of a castle to decide things, Bell and the Hestia familia, now bolstered by new members Lili, Welf, and Mikoto, are forced into a lopsided fight to prevent what is essentially a kidnapping attempt from a god.



Shortly after the war game wraps up, a new crisis rears its head. It comes to light that one of the members of the Ishtar familia, Haruhime, is one of Mikoto’s childhood friends, and she’s being kept as a slave in Orario’s red light district. As Bell and Mikoto look into her situation a little more, they discover that the Ishtar familia plans to use her as a sacrifice to create an item that will allow their members to immediately level up. Obviously needing to do the heroic thing and save a friend in danger, a plan is formed to go and rescue Haruhime.

These two arcs take up the vast majority of Danmachi II’s runtime, and after everything is said and done I can’t help but feel a little let down by them. Granted there are some quality moments, like Lili’s confrontation with her old familia, the resolution of the war game, and Ishtar’s fall from grace. This season also manages to shift the tone somewhat, going from a traditional adventure story to something that embraces more mature themes so that Bell’s journey has a little bit more “oomph” to it. But there are also issues, like the fact that both antagonists honestly just suck. Apollo and Ishtar are very similar, as they’re vain narcissists who allow their familias to be managed by unrepentant psychopaths. Awful gods creating awful familias could work, but the gods don’t come across as intimidating whatsoever; their actions are more creepy than threatening, with Apollo in particular making my skin crawl. 


""When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""

Watching the conclusions to these situations and seeing the good guys win is cathartic, but that doesn’t change the fact that there are quite a few really uncomfortable moments that occur as the story progresses. It also needs to be stated that Danmachi II represents a major shift away from the dungeon as a setting and catalyst for action, which it was in season one. This might not turn everyone off, as the dungeon is somewhat cliché. However, I really enjoyed Bell’s exploration of the dungeon, and his trials against monsters like the minotaur or the goliath back then felt like the stakes were much higher. The monsters were trying to kill Bell and those fights felt incredibly close, but against other adventurers Bell tends to either lose horrifically or win decisively, with little inbetween.

Unfortunately, these issues spillover a bit and also impact our protagonist in other ways. While Bell already knew what the mindset of a hero should be at the start his journey, he wasn’t yet able to live up to that ideal – however, he was consciously molding himself to eventually fit that definition. This is abundantly clear when comparing Bell’s attitude and mental state at start of season one against the end, as he is more confident, more assertive, and has direction, as well as some goals that aren’t totally vague. In some ways he feels like a new character altogether. But to be frank, I don’t see that same growth or development at all when making that comparison for this season. Bell overcomes ridiculous odds and two gods, yet nothing really changes whatsoever other than his level going from two to three. In a story about a character’s quest to becoming a hero, the fact that major events like these feel insignificant is, like the other issues previously mentioned, quite disappointing. 


Ishtar's relevance getting slapped out of her

It's a shame too, because its very clear that Danmachi II is trying to set up more character driven moments with the shift to man vs man (man vs god?) conflicts. Bell is no longer just fighting against creatures with no intelligence or moral compass, he’s butting heads with people whose worldviews are diametrically opposed to his. Even though I enjoy the content that revolves around the dungeon, the fact of the matter is that if Bell were to spend all of his time in there it would become harder for him to grow as a character; the minotaur and golem from season one are great adversaries, but they would eventually just be “Big Bad Monsters #1 and #2” in a long list of close, hard-fought battles. Giving Bell other humans to face gives him different, less tangible obstacles to overcome, ones that he can’t simply punch, kick, or stab. So, I still think that from a character development perspective the writing misses the mark, but I can appreciate the attempt, and think the potential is clearly there.

Interestingly, the character who I think has the most well-crafted journey is probably Aisha. She’s one of the members of the Ishtar familia, and for most of the Haruhime arc she serves as an antagonist. At the start she wipes the floor with Bell, and after that she serves as a roadblock of sorts, preventing him from accomplishing his mission. She’s an irreverent mix of crass, aggressive, and horny, and for a while it doesn’t seem like there is more to her character. But as things progress, we see how close she is with Haruhime and what she’s done, and is still doing, to try and help her. Aisha is no saint but she’s also not exactly an awful person, even if the concept of being “polite” is something she hasn’t heard of before. Truthfully it seems like she just finds herself in a horrendous situation with no way out until Bell arrives, which is why the atmosphere of their last bout is different. It’s clear to both that the Ishtar familia has lost, and they aren’t fighting to see who is going to get Haruhime – they’re fighting so Aisha can make sure Bell can provide the protection she couldn’t. Yeah, an antagonist who is "" secretly alright beneath a jagged exterior and just in a tight spot” is a tired trope. But Danmachi II executes effectively, and turns what could have been a very forgettable character into a memorable one.



Production-wise, this season is largely unchanged. For everything that isn’t a fight, you’re going to see clean character designs and background art, okay animation, and decent directing. The biggest change does come with the high impact fights, however, which do not get the same attention they previously received. They're choppier, with less interesting framing than before, and even though the choreography is much simpler the animation still struggles to keep up at times. And while the OST and voice acting may still be fantastic, the reduced attention to action in general is felt in the effects audio as well. There are multiple times when in one-on-one combat the slashing of a sword or dagger is audible, but the noise doesn’t really sync properly with the animation, or the mixing is off and an effect is way too loud. While high quality fights aren't really what Danmachi is about, the first season did a good job of making them interesting, and even though they weren’t mind blowing I was still on the edge of my seat. Now they're barely adequate, and that honestly might be a little too nice.


The sword he's holding is a grower, not a shower


If I am being too nice though, it’s probably because I still like the series. I know a lot of what I said was pretty negative, but that’s because a sequel inevitably is going to get compared against what came before (and I really enjoyed season one). Even if this was something of a step backwards, it’s a step backwards to being average, not bad or unwatchable. I also have a good amount of respect for recognizing that the formula needed to be shaken up and then doing it, even if the final product stumbled as a result. Here’s my opinion summed up succinctly: Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeron II is not God’s gift to anime. But, it’s not exactly a painful watch – and it’s a necessary evil in order to watch season three."
151801,"Parody anime can be a hit or miss. Tropes of various settings in anime or live action settings are made fun of, but in order to stand out, it has to nail its comedy, and while comedy is always subjective, this one just didn’t nail it, all the time. It obviously is an attempt at parody of magic academies like Hogwarts, but unfortunately, it just fails to stand out at all in most ways. Perhaps you’ll think I’m “taking a parody anime too seriously”, but when most of the characters are the most stuck-up jerks with little meaningful depth, there just wasn’t much to enjoy. To be honest, this kind of feels like a generic isekai or fantasy anime in a way, with the main character having none of the powers that the people around him have, but still ends up overpowering everyone in some way or another. Way too predictable and frustrating to watch at times, though it’s still watchable with some moments of goodness. 

The premise centres around Mash Burnedead, a boy in a magical world, but without any magic power of his own. People without magic are persecuted and captured, so Mash has to blend in with his environment, and pretend to know magic as he attends a magic academy. Mash’s specialty is having huge physical strength, which allows him to overpower his enemies with sheer force rather than magic. I haven’t watched One Punch Man myself, but I assume that’s what the comparison comes from, along with Mash’s overall deadpan, quiet personality. The story plays out like any shounen would, the baddies come along, and Mash and his friends conquer said challenges. Not anything special there.

The animation isn’t bad, but it felt disappointing considering what A-1 Pictures has done in the last few years. This was probably the product of rushed production, mainly due to the poor schedules of Aniplex, which has resulted in many issues and delays in this year of anime already. It had a couple episodes with more standout animation, but otherwise, it wasn’t all that stellar, just okay.

Shounen anime mostly have similar formulas, so the characters are huge part of how one can stand out from the crowd. Other than Mash, the rest of the cast was very forgettable, with generic archetypes and poorly written villains. In terms of its comedy, it was funny at times, but it wasn’t enough to make me dismiss the poor writing. The deadpan humour worked more than the some of the other comedy that was attempted.

Perhaps this was just the beginning, and it gets better down the road, but for now, this anime hasn’t done much to keep me invested beyond a couple chuckles here and there. It’s a very light hearted anime, so maybe you’ll find some enjoyment in that though. It just wasn’t my cup of tea, but it might be yours.

If this anime was an advertisement for cream puffs though, it most certainly succeeded, as I got a box of cream puffs last week."
20807,"Prison School is the death note of comedies with a hint of romance. Each arc in the anime is filled with thrill, and whenever the thrill dies down, comedy replaces it. Those two genres aren't the only ones involved though. Ecchi is littered throughout the anime and is active in nearly every scene from the camera angles to the situations. I watched the anime on Crunchyroll so it was censored, but if it wasn't, it would be bordering the upper limit of ecchi. In fact, this was the original reason I had ever even heard of prison school. However, the ecchi in this anime is outshined, literally, and figuratively by its other elements.
Whenever I rate an anime, I consider five different categories: music/sound, visuals, characters, story, and ending. The reason I separate the ending from the story is that the ending of an anime or season of an anime can make or break it; take death note for example.
The first category is music/sound. Sounds are the background of anime, even more so than the music. Sound doesn't make or break an anime unless it's outstandingly good or bad. For Prison School, the sound was perfectly fine. As for the music, I didn't really notice the background music, which isn't a bad thing, and I liked the opening. The ending wasn't as good as the opening to me, but it wasn't bad by any means.
The second category is visuals. The visuals in this anime aren't phenomenal, but they are good. The expressions of the characters are perfect, and I never found anything lacking. The only reason they don't stand at the head of the pack is that anime that aren't action-related don't have the opportunity to outdo their counterparts.
The third category is characters, and the characters in prison school are awful. Awful in their values, but fantastic otherwise. There are five main characters, and Gakuto is the most developed of the bunch with Kiyoshi right behind. 
Kiyoshi seems to be the least perverted of the bunch, but that doesn't mean much. The main interest of his personality is his battle between perversion and self-control. This takes place throughout the season and is never really solved, but it doesn't need to be. For the first season, the choice to take its characters without any seriousness was the right decision. 
Gakuto is the best character in this anime. He's the brain of the bunch, and his knowledge of history is an interesting quirk. !The reason he's the best character is because of the extremes that he goes to when trying to accomplish his goals. From absolutely embarrassing himself in the computer room to shaving his head to a classic military look, he'll do practically anything for the sake of his personal goals. I used the word personal for a reason. Gakuto isn't a selfless person, and this troubles him in the second arc during Shingo's antics. He chooses to save face, not in spite of Kiyoshi's wishes, instead of standing with Kiyoshi, and this grates on him until it breaks him. He breaks his limited-edition figure to save his friends, and he tells everyone about his collaboration.!
Moving on from Gakuto, we have Shingo. Shingo doesn't have any interesting quirks, but he seems to just fit right into the group. !We see a little of his personality within his dates with Anzu and his betrayal of and return to the group, but we don't get any more than that.! Andre is the fourth member, and his only personality is being the embodiment of masochism. Because he is the bridge between Shingo and Joe and the rest of the group, he has an important place in it. Joe is the last member of the group, and his quirk is his obsession with ants. !Joe wouldn't be an interesting character if the anting scene didn't take place. Because of this scene, however, a conflict was developed in Joe, and it made him interesting.! I won't go into too much detail about the female characters, but they don't change the rating. I find most of them to be well developed and all necessary. I do think that Mari and Hana need something. It makes sense for Mari and Meiko to be obsessed with student council work, but I haven't yet seen a reason for Hana being there or her other interests. Mari is also lacking somewhat in the personality department. The chairman isn't very interesting, but his quirks don't get tiresome.
The fourth category is story, and the story in this anime is near without flaws. From the thrilling escape plans to the well-executed comedy scenes, this anime's story shines. !The only flaw within the story might be Gakuto's choice to poop his pants instead of just farting, but there could be arguments against that.! Other than the comedy, ecchi, and thrilling scenes of the anime, there is also the bromance that took place, which filled the emotional section of the brain.
The final category is ending, and the ending of this season was perfect. !The satisfying escape of the characters, the reveal of Gakuto's potential partner, and the imprisonment of the USC by the OSC left only one need untouched: a second season.!"
32,"Introduction:Hello. My name is Neill or ""MiNi."" This will be my in depth review of Hideaki Anno's brilliant Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion. With all my reviews I will score the anime discussed based upon 5 categories that include: Story, Characters, Art, Music, and Personal Enjoyment. Each category will be given a score between 0 and 10. The ending score will be what I determine the show deserves overall. Keep in mind I will be talking about spoilers that occurred during the anime along with possible spoilers of the manga. Now, without further ado, let's get into this.

 STORY (10/10):



In order to watch The End of Evangelion, it is recommended (although not completely necessary) to watch the full Evangelion series which runs 26 episodes long. The End of Evangelion is the direct sequel to the events of the Evangelion anime series and works as a sort of alternate ending, but I consider it part of the main series. I personally wasn't the biggest fan of the anime, but I absolutely love the movie. Keep in mind however that at its base the story of Evangelion is a complicated one. YOU WILL BE CONFUSED WATCHING THIS. I promise you 100%. It is a series that has a lot of lore and backstory that will need explaining. That being said, I still believe that reviewing this purely as a movie even without the context of the anime or any other references it is as perfect of a story as you can get.

In The End of Evangelion, everything is cranked up to 100. The stakes are higher, the action is bigger, and the story is more incredible than you could imagine. From the very beginning you are pulled in every direction to follow several different characters watching their hardships and turmoil unfold during the end of the world. There is never a moment of ease as a roller coaster of emotions fills your entire body throughout its 90 minute run time. 

The story unfolds with our main cast filled with hopelessness and despair, but as the film progresses and continues to unfold we see such powerful moments of fortitude. It truly is a coming of age story that reflects the hardships so many people have to go through. Although it portrays it in a fictional type setting, you are easily able to relate to the character and how they grow.

One thing I absolutely loved in The End of Evangelion was the action. In the main anime series the violence and conflict seemed very toned down and almost childish in some way. In the End of Evangelion all the stops are pulled. There is actual death, there is actual killing. It pushes the envelope and cements itself as a real mature film. This isn't to say that an anime film needs action and violence to be considered good, but I was extremely impressed with the change in tone that was taken with this film compared to its anime counterpart.

With some loose ends were left untied at the end of the main Evangelion series, The End of Evangelion does a great job and explaining what happens to certain characters along with huge plot point elements that are finally brought onto the big screen. The main focus point of the EVA series is the dealings with NERV and the third impact. It is extremely cool to see this even brought to life before our very eyes. If you've watched the main series it is a well worth wait and the sequence mirrored alongside the 'Kom Susser Tod' theme is absolutely breath taking.

The story in The End of Evangelion is something extremely unique that is a once in a lifetime experience. Never before will you see something like this on the big screen. It does everything right when it comes to storytelling and that's why it gets a perfect score.

 CHARACTERS (10/10):



Shinji One of the biggest bitches in anime finally shows up. I will admit I was a little hard on Shinji during my first watch through. The hospital scene in particular was something I was extremely unsure of, but after a second watch through I appreciate it so much more. In fact, I believe it's one of the best scenes in the entire film. It shows Shinji at his lowest. No one in the world is there for him he just wants to hold onto something that is real, Asuka. She was the only person in the world that could understand what he was feeling at that moment. 

We see him sulk and pout throughout the first half of the movie, but once the third impact hits and he sees Asuka dead his mind completely snaps. He goes into overdrive mode and wants to fuck shit up. This is the Shinji that we've always wanted to see. He's always been shy and timid, but once he finds his confidence he literally is the most powerful being on earth.

Asuka Asuka has the coolest scene in the whole movie. Her battling the 9 EVA series was amazing to watch. Her finally coming to the realization that her mother was with her the entire time was extremely satisfying. Although she could be kind of bitchy at times in the anime, she brings all the kick-assness in the movie. Asuka is the character that sees the most change throughout the film and plays such an important and cataclysmic role during the third impact. She is the one person Shinji can trust, and possibly the only one that he loves.

Rei Although the character of Rei doesn't see a lot of screen time she plays a vital role during the third impact because she basically causes it. Rei doesn't pilot an EVA rather she merges with the one angel above them all, Lilith. She's also the one that allows Shinji to choose or accept instrumentality. Rei can be overlooked at during her role in the movie because of how little she says, but her actions speak much louder than her words.

Mistato One of the strongest female leads in all of anime, Misato Katsuragi does all that she can to save the world. Her sacrifices and bravery are incredible to see in the film and although she doesn't have the most satisfying ending, she does have one that I will always remember. Her authoritativeness and will to take control is what allows the world to be saved. Without her the world would be doomed. She will sacrifice herself for the greater good without a second thought. This is what I love so much about her.

Other Characters There are a lot of side characters that although they don't play a important role in the film still add to its greatness. The WILLE crew in particular were some of my favorite characters in the film. The crew deck members all have unique personalities that add to the overall humanized feel of the film. The characters in The End of Evangelion are some of the best written characters in all of anime and deserve so much praise for their portrayal. 

ART (10/10)



With using the context of this film coming out in 1997 I will compliment that the art and animation looks amazing of its time. The extra budget compared to the anime shows especially in its action sequences. The colors are flashier and the extra detail in each frame is noticed. For an animated film coming out in the late 90s this is as top tier as it gets. I will point out however the Rebuild movies do look much better in my own opinion. Everything about them scream modern which is something I'm a huge fan of. Regardless, taking into account the age of when this film was produced it looks stunning in this department.

MUSIC (10/10)



Not only is The End of Evangelion the greatest anime movie of all time, but it also contains the greatest anime song of all time as well. I will always be firm with my belief that Komm, süßer Tod will be the most beautiful song ever written. The sequence of the third impact finally happening while it plays in the background is just simply emotional. The lyrics sung by Arianne couple perfectly with the orchestral piano and strings. The whole sequence is exhilarating and I believe to be one of the best scenes in all of anime. 

If you haven't please check out [Komm, süßer Tod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIscL-Bjsq4) along with its unused alternative [Everything You Ever Dreamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfsMvXJxV94). It was the song that would've been used had they not chosen Komm, süßer Tod. It is equally as beautiful but I do personally prefer the later slightly more.

Komm, süßer Tod on its own would give the music category a 10/10 but the film also has an incredible OST. Some songs form the original series make an appearance in the movie along with other originals that add to the amazing effect of the movie.

PERSONAL ENJOYMENT (10/10)



If you couldn't tell already, I really like this film. I love it so much in fact it is one of the only two perfect scores I've ever given to an anime medium. The End of Evangelion does so much right in every department it deserves nothing less than the recognition of a masterpiece. It should be considered a classic and a must watch for anime anime fan as it truly is an inspiring work of art.

Every minute of this movie is incredible, I cannot stress it enough. The themes of loneliness, disrepair, self isolation all portray themselves in such a beautiful way. Each character works in sync with all the others and in unison with such a powerful and moving story. It's almost impossible to describe the feeling I felt while watching this. It was such a euphoric experience that I doubt I'll ever experience watching another piece of film.

Did you really read the review, or are you just looking at the score?"
101474,"“There was no need for me to fight someone of your level seriously. In other words, you weren't even an enemy worthy of using magic on.” -Ains-sama

When it comes down to sequels, Overlord never utterly disappointed. It had always delivered what we wanted in the end, despite some of its shortcomings along the way. For an anime that is notorious for its debatable CGI, it still holds its place as a well known seinen that many have come to love and enjoy, myself included. And Overlord 3 is no different in this regard, it still manages to hold a great storyline thanks to the buildup of the previous season. With increased talent and effort put into the art/animation and soundtrack, I knew I was in for a ride. So without further ado, here’s my review of Overlord 3!

Art and Animation: 8.3/10
- I immediately noticed an increase in quality when I first began this season, and I was thoroughly enjoying it. Most of the new characters had great designs that were interesting (anyone else get Archer vibes from the King?) and entertaining to watch. I especially annoyed the action scenes that were to follow, the great vibrancy of colors added more intensity to the scenes. Unfortunately, this season presented the CGI very poorly, ESPECIALLY towards the end. After doing some research, many Overlord fans were displeased at the results of the CGI. After looking at the “what could have been” I can confirm that there was A LOT of wasted potential in the ending episodes because of the unneeded CGI. I had also noticed a few CRITICAL mistakes in terms of animation. There were a few moments where the lip syncing was mistimed, which ruined the immersion quite a bit. A simple mistake like this shouldn’t even be happening, especially for a well known studio like Madhouse.  This is why the art/animation score is lower than it’s predecessors.

Storyline and Character Progression: 8.7/10
- There wasn’t too much to expect from this season to begin with. Most of the stage had already been set for most of the character cast, and the ones that were added had received ample development. As far as the storyline goes, I really enjoy the events that had unfolded. There wasn’t any point where the storyline dragged on unnecessarily, and the pacing of the storyline was comfortable to follow along with as well. In the end, this season was above average when it addressed both character progression and storyline.

Soundtrack and Audio: 9.2/10
- I honestly may be a little biased when I say this, but this seasons OP was AMAZING!!! It’s without a doubt my favorite of the 3, but it’s also one of my top 5 favorite OP of all time! When it came to the pure quality of the soundtrack, it was used very well at the appropriate times, without it being used too much to the point of becoming stale. The ED as well was very decent and held to the environment fit for an Overlord anime. The character voice actors were just as good as the previous seasons as well, with great emotion and convincing acting.

When it came down to raw entertainment and soundtrack, this season was definitely my favorite. In terms of character progression/storyline, Overlord 2 had executed this department the best. And as far as overall enjoyment and consistency, the first Overlord held its place. In the end, this series had some of the best entertainment to offer, especially in regards to its world building. Unfortunately, it was stained with the reputation of having some of the worst CGI that took away from the mood. In conclusion, don’t focus too much on the moments of CGI, because everything else is such a joy to watch! That’s why I’m giving this season an 8.7/10, because while it was such an entertaining watch......it definitely made some crucial mistakes that couldn’t be ignored. That’s all for now though, see y’all in the next one!

889,"First of all, I want to make one thing clear. This show is fantastic, but it's definitely NOT for everyone. If you can't handle over-the-top ultra-violence, common sense dictates you won't like this show very much. I have a couple of friends that fall into that category and since I wouldn't recommend this show to any of them, I can't recommend it to you either. However, if you do like some gore in your anime, you've hit the jackpot by stumbling across this amazing gem.

Black Lagoon explores the harsh reality of the world we live in. It’s not fantasy or sci-fi, in fact, it doesn’t feel fictional at all. I can legitimately see this story happening in real life, so I kind of feel bad for finding it so entertaining. It's no surprise it's maintained such an enduring reputation, even after all these years. Even regarding the base premise, the show presents something fresh and exciting as it follows a rag-tag group of smugglers that terrorize the southern Asian coasts, offering plenty of unique villains to cross with.

Black Lagoon opens in the middle of the action, with the protagonist Rokuro Okajima aka ""Rock"" stranded on a boat with two guns in his face. Having been snagged as the courier middleman in a backroom deal of his uncaring corporate overlords, Rock finds himself marooned in the south China sea, hitching a ride with pirates as his old company hires mercenaries to retrieve his cargo at all costs. Therefore, Rock quickly realizes his company intends to leave him for dead. Upon seeing a kind of mad freedom in the way his new pirate acquaintances live their lives, he ultimately decides to stay with his former captors. And so Rock joins their captain Dutch, the mechanic Bennie, and the psychotic gunman “Two-Hands” Revy on their gritty adventures, stealing loot and transporting contraband and occasionally running up against some less than savory individuals of the criminal underworld.

Black Lagoon plays out as a series of multi-episode arcs, whether it be a heist or a gang war, or even a death-match between Revy and a terminator-esque housemaid named Roberta. No, I'm not kidding about that. The crew also comes across a ship full of actual Neo-Nazis at one point too. Things are never simple for the Lagoon company as you'll soon see, since basically every job they take inevitably devolves into a complete shit-show. Though Black Lagoon is full of details alluding to the various characters' tragic pasts and grudges, violent absurdity tends to be a prominent trait of the show's run. How much you'll enjoy this material will ride very heavily on your appreciation for over-the-top ultra-violence as I mentioned at the beginning of the review.

If you do enjoy that sort of stuff, Black Lagoon is insanely good at it. The show will occasionally build up an action duel in a way that feels a little drawn out, but most of the time scenes charge forward at breakneck speed, varying perspectives and introducing new variables and keeping the audience from ever getting bored. Stories here aren't just a series of direct battles - there are thrilling escapes, high-stakes negotiations, well-laid traps, and all manner of other compelling turns. From the settings to the villains involved to the narrative structure, Black Lagoon rarely uses any dramatic trick twice.

Personally, my favorite aspect of the show is definitely the love-hate dynamic between Revy and Rock. Ever since the very beginning of the show, Revy has always been portrayed as a ruthless and sadistic killer, with little to no conscience to stop her from making poor decisions. Rock, on the other hand, was always a bleeding heart, who ultimately still cares about others despite the hardships he's forced to deal with over the course of the series. Because of this, Rock is forced play the role as mediator whenever Revy goes off the rails, much to her displeasure. Rock's overwhelming urge to find a diplomatic approach to any given crisis is why Revy can't stop herself from trying to kill him every five minutes. Eventually, their relationship grows and they obtain a mutual respect and admiration for one another and that journey is truly fascinating to watch.

img800()

Overall, this show is an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys some good old-fashioned gore, and even offers some fun for those who just love to watch a thrilling adventure in the making. By the end, I can safely say that I was firmly on board with the whole production. If wild action is your scene, Black Lagoon is more than worthy of your time."
124153,"At first, I was quite hesitant about whether I should watch SK8 the Infinity or not. As cool as a skating anime may sound, I wasn’t sure if it would be done properly or if I would actually enjoy it. But looking back at things now, I’m definitely glad I picked it up. 



SK8 the Infinity follows Reki, the redheaded high school teen who loves skateboarding and enjoys watching the underground skateboarding race called “S”, and Langa, an exchange student from Canada who grew up snowboarding before moving to Okinawa with his mother to start anew. At first Langa seems to be a very stoic and indifferent kind of person, barely showing any emotions, but that changes when he meets the easygoing and affable Reki. Reki has no issues befriending Langa and soon after introduces him to skateboarding. Having found a common interest, the two of them start hanging out and the more time they spend together the closer they become.

The story is compelling and exciting, jammed with action and flair. But what is most surprising is that the story is also emotional and touching. I had imagined that a skating anime would mostly be dramatic, thrilling, and intense and while it certainly is like that sometimes, the anime also puts great attention on the complexity of the characters and their feelings. Watching Reki and Langa go up against other skaters like Shadow, Miya or the notorious Adam, certainly is exhilarating to watch but I also enjoyed seeing the main duo grow significantly as the story progressed. Reki who adores skating so much, finds himself in a slump halfway through the season, as he realizes he’s not as talented as the other skaters and begins to doubt his self-worth. He distances himself from Langa and both boys begin to lose that spark in them that really love skating. However, soon after, Reki realizes that his love for skating isn’t because he’s good at it or not but because it is super fun. Similarly, Langa realizes his love for skateboarding comes from the fact that he gets to skate alongside Reki and not because he super talented at it. Their spark ignites once again, and the boys discover what skating truly means to them. 



Besides the main characters, the rest of the cast was excellent as well. While they are not on the same level as Langa or Reki, characters like Miya, Joe, Shadow, and Cherry were a treat to watch. They are charming and lovable and there is never a dull moment with them around. The interactions between each other were either always hysterical or impactful such as when Joe gives advice to Reki telling him to never be alone, or when Reki assures Miya that he won’t abandon him like his old friends did. It’s moments like these that had me smiling from ear to ear, glad that I was getting to experience such a great show each week. The animation was good, and the beautiful visuals were dynamic and impactful when needed to be, making the anime even more immersing. 

When I see Reki skating and having the time of his life I think of my old friend from High School. When he first started skating, I didn’t think it would last very long. I thought it was another one of his phases and that he would get bored of it easily. But boy was I wrong. In the end he managed to rope me and a couple of other friends into buying skateboards and learning how to skate. While I was never as passionate about skating as my friend was, I certainly did enjoy spending time together with everyone. And because of SK8 and because of Reki, I think I now understand why skating was so special to him and why it meant so much to him as well. Nothing is wrong with being competitive. But you should also remember to have fun along the way. That is something Haikyu!! taught me and SK8 reassured me.

If I’ve learned something today, is that the animes that you’re most skeptical of  can end up being a huge favorite of yours, so don’t hesitate to pick something new to watch and enjoy. SK8 the Infinity went beyond my expectations and delivered tremendously. There are a bunch of insignificant things I can nitpick about this show such as pacing and characters, but that’s not important to me. I’m just glad I had something fun to watch this winter season. And yea the skating may not be super realistic but that’s what makes it fun. Plus if it were possible to do such insane tricks you can bet so many skaters would be doing stuff like that. Why? Cause we’re extra. That’s something the anime got right. SK8 captured the true meaning of the sport for me. It was wicked, radical, gnarly, totally tubular and all that other stuff. Check it out if you can."
17265,"Name: Log Horizon – SPOILER FREE REVIEW
Season 1
Episodes: 25 
Premiered: Fall 2013 
Studios: Satelight 
Source: Novel 
Genres: Action, Game, Adventure, Magic, Fantasy

Log Horizon – An isekai with a true MMORPG setting.
The story begins in the midst of action with our main characters fighting off monsters and then quickly cuts off to present time, this was probably done to quickly catch the attention of the viewer as I’ve seen most times that even good anime don’t usually bother with any dramatic stuff in the first few episodes which often leads to people putting it off despite it being good. That being said the start wasn’t bad, it was good enough.

Much like the “game-themed” isekai of recent times, Log Horizon starts with the protagonist, Shiroe realizing he has been transported to another world which at first looks very similar to the game he played “Elder Tales” or so he thought and has the same looks and abilities of his character as in the game, but worry not he wasn’t one of those OP main characters (actually no one was) or “I have to win because friends” kinda guy. He was a strategist he won his battles with the help of his teammates as you would see in any MMORPG by using very clever and thought-out tactics and strategies for which he was already famous among the other players before the game turned into reality for all of them. 

The whole story or concept wasn’t that complex it was simple and easy to understand as you would expect from a MMORPG, players leveling up through battles, questing, exploring the new world, establishing a base but that doesn’t mean it was any less entertaining – No, it always had a trick or plot twist hidden up its sleeves which was a pleasant surprise. Though at times it would get dialogue heavy, because Log Horizon isn’t an isekai focused mainly on action, it had its battles with the sword but it was more focused on the battles of the minds, rather than some flashy battles on the battlefield we got the battles behind the scenes, the mechanics of battles you could say. It was a lawless world where any option could be opted for victory.

I would say one thing that Log Horizon is an isekai done right by that I mean it takes on the whole spirit of MMORPGs right down to the core mechanics and follows and implements the rules as one would expect in a game. Like, for example the difference of classes and levels, the use of spells and skills with cool down time or MP drain, tanks and healers etc (probably easier to understand if you have played some similar games). There wasn’t a moment where a character would bend the rules of the world because of his feelings or something, just some good’ol skills and tactics. They did a pretty good job of keeping it as close to a MMORPG as they could, definitely a plus in my book.

Now for the characters, the main characters other than Shiroe weren’t too bad, but some of them felt unused in the latter half of Season 1. This was a shame because they had potential as shown in the beginning but were mostly used in some comical stuff or minor roles later on like Akatsuki and Naotsugu. Though the side characters were good enough as side characters can be, they had their roles in the plot progression, had good interactions with the main characters.

The anime mainly focused on Shiroe and honestly I don’t think it would matter that much if the other characters were involved because Shiroe was the one pulling the strings behind the scenes. His plans though simple to understand when explained were executed complexly and in ways you’d mostly be unable to see for the most part. Don’t wanna spoil so, what do you think you could do with the knowledge of being able to make some tasty food? Make some profit? Shiroe had a keen sense of observation and picked up on small details others missed. He wasn’t all that powerful but he was more intelligent than the average person. His devious plans earned him the title of “The Villain in Glasses”. Oh on that note there were a lot of those “adjusting your glasses in success” moments, would’ve liked to tone them down a bit. 

The animation, the character designs, close-ups and expressions were good. The background was detailed and perfectly showed the fantasy-game like world setting. Though the character animation would become lazy at times and the action sequences felt short (I did say it wasn’t all that on the action part) but nothing that would come in the way of watching the anime, the animation was good enough considering this is an anime from 2013 we’re talking about. Again I am not usually big on judging OSTs very much but I think it was lacking on the OST part, the OST was good don’t get me wrong but that single OST was used a lot I guess it didn’t have that diversity in OSTs. The Opening had that Lets- Go vibe but I absolutely loved the Ending it was fun, cute and relaxing, the kinda music I’d like to end my episodes on, keeps reminding me of kawai ninja Akatsuki.

I’d give it a RATING of a solid 8/10
It’s been a LONG time since I’ve enjoyed an isekai as much as this and with some good plot twists.
FUN FACT: Took me almost a week to complete it and in that time its MAL rating went up from 7.98 to 8.07, which was nice to see as it at least deserved an 8. I'll be saving its Season 2 for later, hoping that's a good watch as well.

If you’re a fantasy or adventure fan then this anime is a good choice for your next watch or if you’re just looking for a fun watch which keeps you entertained with decent plot twists then pick this up as well.
Oh, and best girls Serara the Maid Healer and Akatsuki the Kawai Ninja."
10165,"Nichjou is a surreal, exaggerated comedy, but I don't think surrealism or exaggeration are what Nichijou is about. Instead I'd say that Nichijou is about giving meaning to the day-to-day. What Nichijou has to say is that, although our small lives might seem meaningless and shallow in comparison to the grand scheme of the world, they still have the same importance as the spectacular, the awesome and the unbelievable. And Nichijou delivers this message in in two main aspects:

First, the obvious. Nichijou is Slice of Life comedy in which every day-to-day scenario gets exaggerated to the absurd, elevating the mundane to a new level. This is made using exaggerations in the animations, which is possible thanks to the general art style of the show, because if it had a more detailed look, like other Kyoto Animations shows, such as Hibike! Euphonium, the exaggerations would look out of place and would be incoherent with the tone evoked by the art style. That is why the simple design of the characters fulfills its purpose greatly.

Secondly, there is something wrong in what I said. Not all characters in Nichijou are what could be called ""normal people"". Hakase is a mad scientist, Nano is a literal robot and Sakamoto is a talking cat. But, although the apparent unbelievableness of these characters, they are treated in a normal way. The central theme of Nano's character is how she wants to be a normal girl, because at the end of the day, she acts and thinks like one. Behind the apparent strangeness of Nano there is in fact just a normal person. And through the series, all the characters end up treating her as just that, a girl, a normal person; and the only character that doesn't, her teacher, fails every time she tries to uncover any ""secrets"" about Nano. Nichijou is presenting these incredible, unbelievable situations and taking them down, and making the viewer realize that these characters are still human.

What Nichijou is telling us is that the incredible and amazing people we see are as human as every other mundane citizen, and their lives don't have more meaning that every other person lives, because the meaning of life is not in life itself, but in how you perceive life. What Nichijou is saying is that your life, as meaningless and useless as it may seem, can have the value of the unbelievable.

Lastly, I want to remark one element of the series that is more notable in the rewatch. All the gags in Nichijou seem unconnected, but once you have already watched the series once, and kind of know the characters and some events, you can see how some gags foreshadow others, and expose a development in the characters. This development doesn't happen in the main scene, but in the background, and it holds great importance, as it gives the school on Nichijou a real feeling. Like you are not just watching some random characters, but an actual community of humans that interact with each other, being an element that grounds the elevated style of the series.

As I have explained how Nichijou perfectly achieves its goal, and, personally, I find its message to be very good, I award this series with a 10 out of 10."

TL;DR: Not a bad anime, just, unfortunately, the only reason you should watch this is for the aesthetic.
Intro: 
Guys, I really wanted to like this show more, from the trailers you might expect a rich intriguing mystery surrounding ghost and other supernatural phenomenon (at least I did), but unfortunately, that is not really what you get here. Of course, these are aspects the narrative tries to incorporate, but ultimately it is significantly brought down by an entire cast of characters who stay just as one-note as they begin, and by a plot that is so disorganized as it randomly meanders from one seemingly unconnected side story to the next, that any semblance of an overarching narrative is unfortunately lost in the clutter. I don't feel like this is an anime that necessitates a long review like many of the other series I have reviewed, thus I'm going to try to condense some areas and make this review shorter than usual, so here we go. 

img500(

Story:
The biggest glaring flaws regarding this series are connected to arguably the two largest pieces in any series, the characters and the story, so let's start with the latter one first. The biggest problem to me with the story in this twelve episode anime is that there isn't one, there genuinely is not a single narrative thread that is strongly maintained throughout the entire season. The show starts off with our main character named Yashiro, a first-year high school girl who decides to meet a well-known spirit trapped in the school who goes by the name Hanako-kun (hence the title), because this spirit is known for granting wishes in exchange for an equal price being paid, and after inevitable hijinks play out in the first episode, Yashiro inevitably falls into the debt of Hanako-kun and now must spend the remainder of her time (they literally do not say how long) working off this debt. 

So, you might think that naturally a straightforward premise like this might be followed by a straightforward narrative where Yashiro spends the rest of her time paying off this debt, and you would be absolutely wrong. This premise is almost immediately thrown so far back on the list of importance that it is never brought up again unless it is convenient to the plot. Instead, the show spends the majority of its time jumping from one side story to another, so much so that you would almost consider this series episodic, except for the random few times characters call back to previous events, reminding you that there is a set order to these otherwise unconnected side stories. It genuinely feels like the narrative of this season couldn't decide if it wanted to focus on a single goal, or be a conglomerate of a bunch of side stories, and instead, it fails at both of these tasks by not committing to either of them. 

img500()
-
Characters: 
There is then also the characters, which are infuriating because of how little they progress throughout the entire season. Every main character in this series basically ends in the same place they began, maintaining the exact same personality virtually the entire way through. Of course, there are conflicts during this series that as expected invoke a variety of different reactions within all of our main characters, however, none of these changes last the rest of the season, since these conflicts are almost always immediately resolved in the same episode they arise in. Other than the ones that are intrinsically tied to the premise of this series, there are zero lasting consequences for any of the decisions any of our main characters make. For brief moments you almost think there are, but they are almost immediately undone by later events within the same episodes. In fact, the only thing more infuriating about all of this in regards to the characters, is that throughout the series there are hints that there could be more. Throughout the entire season, the narrative leads you on with little moments hinting that there might be more to these characters, but ultimately nothing comes from it, and that is the critical downfall for these characters in my opinion.

The Look & Sound:
Like I said at the beginning, by far the most enjoyable and interesting part of this anime is its aesthetic. Everything from the thick black lines outlining almost everything, to the cutesy designs for all of the characters, to the bold color palette used to fill in everything on screen, everything about this anime’s aesthetic is extremely appealing to the eyes, and honestly, it is this aesthetic that carried the majority of my interest for this anime while I watched it. I really can't understate how influential the entire look of this anime was in convincing me to finish this series once I already started it. Throughout all of the times I became disinterested in the characters, or the times I became empathetic to the convoluted plot, the beautiful animation and aesthetic present throughout this entire season always kept me coming back for more. 

There is also the music for this series, and while it is by no means groundbreaking when it comes to the plethora of anime focused on high school, it does significantly enhance the aesthetic this series has the entire way through. While some might consider the music cliche at times, ultimately I felt it did add a nice layer of cuteness and light hardness in all the scenes that warranted it, while also enhancing the few serious or intimate scenes that are within this season, so in this regard, the OST executed it’s job quite nicely. The OP and ED were also nice additions to the soundtrack of this anime, the OP does a great job highlighting the playfulness throughout this entire season, while the ED highlights a slightly more somber note, which is typical in high school anime. To me personally, while the ED was definitely more typical and in some ways cliche considering this is an anime centering around a high school, ultimately I did find it to be the more enjoyable one of the two.

Conclusion:
In the end, while I did quite enjoy the visual and audio aspects of this anime, ultimately its biggest flaws are the aimless narrative and undeveloped characters that are entangled with these aspects. Which is quite disappointing, I promise, like most people who started watching this while it aired, I went into this with pretty high expectations because of the very well put together trailers, however, the series ultimately didn't turn out the way I feel many of us expected it to. I don't necessarily think the plot or characters are so far gone that they cannot be salvage in future seasons, (so who knows, maybe in later seasons this show can become much better), but as of right now this is how I feel. 

All of this is why I ultimately finding myself giving the series a 75/100, and honestly the only reason that it is not getting a 70/100 is because I truly did really enjoy the aesthetic of this series, but an entire show cannot be carried alone on aesthetic. If you are willing to read the manga afterwards where it theoretically can fix some of these problems, or if you are into it just for the aesthetic, by all means, go right ahead and embark on this journey, but otherwise, I wouldn't particularly recommend watching this series. If you ended up enjoying it great, but as for me this is where it ends, so until the next review,  じゃあね👋

140439,"“One and only one.”

Simple words but a powerful meaning. Between a master and a disciple, not only one of them is capable of growing up. Choosing a person and putting their trust in them can be hard. They both do but there’s no one can break the bond that strengthens them.

This! This is how you make an action show with a perfect blending of humor and life! Not just a show having an identity crisis. Yeah, I’m talking about that show of massive disappointment.

I remember when I watched the first season months back and I dropped it because it didn’t hook me. The best decision that I made is to give it another chance, and I’m very glad I did it. I witnessed a unique and spectacular action anime filled with bright colors and fight choreography. A story filled with humor, friendship, heart, and self-discovery of a middle school child, his massive psychic powers, and how they affect the people around him.

Mob Psycho 100 is written by ONE, which is also the author of the famous action-comedy One Punch Man. The only difference between the two is that Mob Psycho is a solid action story while OPM is a gag action. There are differences but it is impossible to compare since they are both masterpieces. But why am I comparing those two? Let’s start the review of the story from beginning to end.

Mob Psycho 100 is an antithesis to self-insert fantasies. This isn't about a bland, blank character wreaking havoc when showing off their cool power. This is about a genuine person as protagonist with his own personal philosophy and take on the superpowers. This isn't about the protagonist being admired by regular people because of his great power. This is about the protagonist admiring regular people and looking up to those who managed to improve themselves through their own efforts.

What I like about Mob Psycho 100 is the uniqueness of the story. There are thousands of animes where the main character is overpowered and they showcase their power to the viewers. But Mob Psycho is different. The main character who has massive psychic power hates it and only wants to become normal. The main character, which is Shigeo “Mob” Kageyama, relates to the audience who had everything to themselves but wanted normal things. He works with his master in exorcising spirits, and his master had a delusion that he’s a powerful psychic while Mob does all the work. What I like about Reigen and Mob’s tandem is their chemistry. They aren’t perfect human beings. Even Reigen is Mob’s so-called “master”, he also has the capable of growing just like Mob. He isn’t that kind of person who is superior to anyone else. He seems powerless if Mob isn’t around but he is independent and capable of doing the right thing in his power. Even Reigen isn’t perfect, what I love from him is that he advices Mob to become the person he wanted to be. This shows that he believes and putting his faith in Mob’s hands to become the person that he can be.

Throughout the series, he meets different psychics and some enemies like Dimple, who allied with him. He meets also his schoolmates and classmates from his club and school, and also his only crush. I like the fact that he doesn’t rely upon his powers to impress someone, or even defeat someone. He has good intentions and he has ways of making something better than using his powers.

Mob defeated a group of evil psychics in season 1, while his group defeated its leader. In this final season, he encountered two battles; a battle with his first friend Dimple, and the greatest enemy of all, himself.

I really how he matures from the previous two seasons. His character development is superb because he learned how to value himself and become independent. The fight with Dimple is one of the peak moments in this show. Dimple, who’s greedy for power and to become a leader of the whole world, while Mob wants to convince him that having great power or becoming a god wouldn’t get what he wants. He made him realize that there’s something better than power, his true friendship with him. Mob realizes what Dimple meant from the first season, but nothing ever beats the power of friendship with him. Sadly, he did die for the sake of saving him. Dimple is truly the best sidekick in this story.

The last one is the dreadful battle between Mob and Shigeo himself. He plans to confess to his crush but he ended up being in an accident, awakening his 100% power and rampaging the whole city. I like what happened in this part because fighting with himself is one of his challenges. It’s unique and refreshing to watch. I was curious about how Shigeo would wield his true power or if he can defeat his power with only the bare hands of a mortal. The final battle is the culmination of all battles that he had since the first season. The pacing, direction, dialogues, and writing are well-crafted. They did the trilogy consistently a perfect job, just like the trilogy of the Fruits Basket series.

The animation and art style are so unique. It made me think that this is the reason why the quality of the latest Boku no Hero Academia degraded at some point. The art isn’t the same for most of the animes but it’s a damn great one. The fight choreography is so flawless like in Demon Slayer. You can see the animators’ passion, time, and effort in animating the series. As expected from Bones, this could be one of the landmarks in their history of animation.

The sound and music deserve a standing ovation. The openings from the first to the final season are epic. I like when the title of the opening of the final season is “1” rather than 100 because it signifies the complete trilogy of the series. All I can say is EPIC! The animation sequences from the first season up to the final never cease to amaze me. The part at the end when Mob growing up and Reigen standing up gave me chills. It symbolizes how Reigen cares for Mob when he was a child. The Mob growing up symbolizes his growth throughout the series. The OP celebrates Mob Psycho 100’s most epic story that has ever been told. The ED is good but nothing ever beats the epic OPs.

Bones have outdone themselves for this season and the whole trilogy. You can see the love and effort in producing this series. I enjoy this story filled with wonderful characters and colorful animation. It’s been a journey and such an amazing adaptation from beginning to end. I honestly don’t think there’s anything they could have done better.

Thank you for being part of this wonderful journey. Thank you, ONE. And mostly, thank you, Bones for producing such an epic series.

Don’t be sad because it’s over, smile because it happened.

21709,"The world of competitive figure skating can be a harsh one indeed. That’s not to say the competition is cut throat or anything… Hell, the atmosphere between competitors seems to be downright friendly. On the contrary, the strain it puts on your body and mind can be absolutely brutal, as Japanese prodigy Yuuri Katsuki finds out after suffering a crushing defeat in the Grand Prix Finale. Already plagued by anxiety and self confidence issues, the downtrodden skater disappeared from the sport, looking to find himself, but eventually giving up and going home. All looked lost for the dejected and now portly 23 year old until a video of him skating the legendary routine of his idol Victor Nikiforov, and when it manages to catch the champion’s attention, Yuuri’s world is turned upside down when Victor shows up at his home and demands to become his coach and help him to realize his true potential. Unfortunately, Victor isn’t the only one taking an interest in him, as the international media comes knocking, and a fiery young rival decides to challenge him for Victor’s tutelage. Will Yuuri be able to realize his dream, or has his career been put on ice for good?

img660()

When I first started watching Yuri on Ice, I was honestly surprised that it didn’t have any strong connections to Studio Bones, as certain elements of the visual style seemed really close to some of that studio’s more goofy comedic work, like Soul Eater and the two Fullmetal Alchemist series. It was actually animated by a studio called MAPPA, or Maruyama Animation Produce Project Association, which was founded in 2011 and released it’s first title in 2012, and which was created by former members of Studio Madhouse. Now that I know that, I do kind of see it in a lot of the show’s more serious moments, but the fast paced comedic moments are still such a dead ringer for FMA that I can’t help but think it was at least partially inspired by it. Granted, this may just be because the animation style and visual direction feels really loose and experimental in the first episode, where it feels uncannily like they were still trying to figure out what the visual aesthetic should even be.

Whatever the case, I’m glad they were able to nail down a solid direction before episode two, because beyond that sort-of-messy first impression, the series is absolutely gorgeous. The fluidity of motion isn’t exactly consistent, as there’s a very clear divide between the content that had a lot of money poured into it and the content that didn’t, but despite this, it never allows itself to look bad. One of the tactics MAPPA uses to achieve this is going through the cheaper scenes via some really fast editing, using short cuts to keep your eyes from ever getting bored, although this does come with the drawback that at times, the story can move a little too fast. There are quite a few transitions, and even some entire scenes, that fly by almost quickly enough to give you whiplash, especially in the first episode. Thankfully, the scenes we rush into are usually fun and memorable enough to justify whatever we might have lost getting there, so it’s really not that big a deal in the long run.

But as far as the animation goes, the one thing everyone seems to remember the most strongly is the animation of the skating routines. Whenever someone steps out onto the ice in this series, the animation changes, at least for that character, so something that feels like a cross between rotoscoping, and the 3D dance animation from shows like Love Live. Now, both of these animation styles on their own have their pros and cons, but Yuri on Ice really does seem to combine the best of both worlds, as long as you’re not concentrating too hard on the characters faces, and the routines look absolutely beautiful as a result. Not only does it look amazing, but it seems to also capture the feel of performing, and of being in the spotlight to showcase everything you have in front of millions of screaming onlookers, almost as if you’ve transcended humanity itself for one fleeting moment that you’re able to shine. It’s as if the characters performing on the ice are in another world, and the rest of us are just living in it, which unfortunately does lead me into my only real complaint about the visuals.

Well, specifically, it’s a complaint I have with the character design department. When we catch up with Yuuri in the beginning of the series, he’s gained a considerable amount of weight in his off time, which creates a weird inconsistency with his actual weight. His gut seems to be working via ecchi boob physics, as it’s about three times larger when unclothed, which wouldn’t be such a problem if it didn’t also create an inconsistency in the story. Upon becoming Yuuri’s coach, Victor insists on making Yuuri lose weight so he can skate properly, but wasn’t Yuuri still fat when he inadvertently got filmed dancing the routine that caught Victor’s eye in the first place? Yeah, for that first routine scene, his girth suddenly disappears from both his gut and even his face as he performs, which alludes to the ‘feel of performing’ idea that I brought up earlier, but that kind of inconsistency should stay psychological, and not creep into the physical world of the story. Aside from that, the character designs are still more or less fine, with skater characters being designed as wonderfully flamboyant and sporting realistic-looking physiques, and outsiders generally taking on more cartoony looks.

Also, does anyone else really want to try a pork cutlet bowl now? They just make them look so freaking good.


Being that this is a story about ice skating, you’d expect there to be a very high bar to pass in regard to the soundtrack, and good God does Yuri on Ice deliver on that front. I wish I could go into explicit detail about the plethora of beautiful tracks that are featured, but my research had unfortunately refused to bear fruit. Aside from covers, I can’t seem to find any of the actual music on youtube, and outside of a thirty-seven dollar physical CD, I can’t find the soundtrack on Amazon either, so I’m going to have to work off of memory when I tell you just how amazing the compositions are. I don’t know how much(if any) of it came from the public domain, or if it was all original, but not one of these tracks felt out of place in the setting, and they matched the characters dancing to them exquisitely. My favorite tracks that I can remember would have to be the classic rock inspired tune that Kenjiro Minami uses, and Love Eros, the salsa-esque tune that inspires Yuuri to finally discover and define his sexuality.

If there’s one piece of music in the series that I’ll probably never forget, it’s the opening, History Makers, which is easily one of my top ten favorite opening themes of all time. The song is performed in English, but despite being an original piece for the anime, it doesn’t sound even remotely Engrish. It’s performed by Japanese megastar Dean Fujioka, who not only wrote the song in perfectly coherent English, but he belts it out with all the power of Freddy Mercury, who I’d bet was a major inspiration for the piece. The ending theme is called YOLO(Yeah, I know that’s not actually the title, but somebody had to point out the connection), and unlike the opening, it’s only partially sung in English, with the music being EDM. I’m not a fan of this one, but it’s okay. It’s also worth noting that several insert songs that previously had Japanese lyrics have been translated by the dubbing team, and while most of them range from good to all right, the dubbed version of JJ’s theme is a bit on the cringey side.

Speaking of the English dub, it’s clear that Funimation knew they had something special on their hands, because they pampered the fuck out of it. They gave directorial duties to Sonny Strait, who’s always been a smart and responsible choice, and he churned out a translation that was both respectful and accessible. Starting with the main cast, Josh Grelle does an outstanding job taking a character that could have been comparable to Shinji Ikari in the wrong hands and presenting his insecurities in a relatable way, drawing a distinct line between the shades of hope and despair that he goes through in the story. Jerry Jewel, in turn, plays off this sense of vulnerability in an appropriately lovable and goofy manner, but is still able to convey drama when Victor has to be serious, and inspiration when he has to be supportive, all while sporting a fun but somewhat cartoony Russian accent, and thankfully, the two of them are able to portray a very believable level of sexual and romantic chemistry, giving their character’s admittedly ambiguous romance some much needed gravity.

Of course, while Victor’s accent may not sound the most believable, Micah Solusod makes up for it in spades with his portrayal of the ambitious Yuri Plisetsky, who he plays with an accent that’s unbelievably perfect. He apparently studied the language vigorously, and even hired a dialect coach, and the result sounds so authentically thick that you’d be surprised to learn he isn’t a native speaker drawing from personal experience, like Todd Haberkorn was in Baccano. The rest of the cast is filled out by Funimation regulars, all of whom put on strong performances. While Sonny Strait and Vic Mignona didn’t have to do very much in their roles as skating commentators, they’re still a joy to hear either way. Despite being famous for his deep voice and low, gravely register, Chris Sabat dazzles in the opportunity to go against type as a highly effeminate Swiss skater, and Jeremy Inman pulls off a nicely subtle Canadian accent as the cocky JJ. Colleen Clinkenbeard, J Michael Tatum and many more show up in small but still enjoyable roles in a dub that I’d definitely recommend checking out.

Yuri On Ice is an anime that comes with some pretty high praise behind it. No matter where you look, it was easily the most popular title to come out in 2016, and it garnered rave reviews from both critics and general audiences alike. You’d normally expect a title that’s been held up on that high of a pedestal to have suffered some backlash as a result, but the negative reactions have been fairly subdued. It’s probably the most mainstream LGBT-themed anime that’s come out since Revolutionary Girl Utena, and while it’s certainly a lot more accessible than Kunihiko Ukihara’s seminal classic, it’s somehow inspired just as much debate over whether or not over whether the alleged queer elements are even really there, or if they’re just the product of a bunch of delusional shippers and frustrated LGBT otaku just seeing what they want to see in it. Actually, considering the fact that there’s an upcoming movie for the series that’s carrying the ominous subtitle of ‘Adolescence,’ that comparison might not be as wild as it sounds. What kind of car do you guys think Victor will turn into, anyway?

As for me, I’ve seen the show a few time, and I have to admit, it does have a lot of things going for it. In addition to the amazing visual and audio quality, and the stellar English dub, the story is built around three incredibly strong main characters. Between the two Yuris, I can find different parts of my life where I find both of them intensely relatable. With the main Yuuri, I can easily identify with his lack of confidence and personal anxiety, wanting to run away from things I feel I’ll never be good enough for, getting crushed over my losses and wondering why I should even bother wasting my time at things that I just don’t think are going to work out. With Yurio, I can relate to the exact opposite… When I actually am good at something, I just want to dominate at it, prove my superiority, and be recognized as the best while people I feel are less deserving should move out of my way and fall by the wayside. And yet, ironically, my favorite character is actually the one I don’t relate to at all, that being Victor, just because he’s the kind of supportive, kind-hearted person you just want to be friends with.

This all ties in to the main thing Yuri On Ice gets praised for, it’s LGBT elements and over-all homosexual overtones. There are a lot of people who consider Yuri and Victor to be one of the best, if not the best, queer relationship in anime, and the backlash to this has mainly been confusion over whether or not they were ever in a relationship in the first place. The first time I watched it, I was in this camp, and I was disappointed that the series never ‘went there,’ AKA the two were never canonically confirmed to be a couple. On a second watch, however, I feel like I can confidently say that, oh yeah, they went there. They just didn’t tell you that they went there, which in some ways makes the representation even stronger. If you know where the show’s going ahead of time, it’s a lot easier to read between the lines and pick up on all the subtext without needing some grand romantic moment to confirm what you’re seeing, and I honestly feel kind of dumb for not picking up on it all the first time… But this had some consequences that you may be a little torn about.

If you’re going to have a subtle romantic plot that never makes itself obvious, then the other elements of the story have to be strong enough to support it, and depending on your perspective, that might be where the series falls flat. For starters, the cast is bloated with seemingly random side characters, and while they were all given at least enough attention to have unique identities and backstories, they wind up being forgotten about so quickly that they honestly just wind up feeling interchangeable. Sure, there are a few moments when the thoughts going through a character’s mind might carry some parallels to Yuuri and Victor, but their actual connections to the main cast or the main plot are tenuous at best and non-existent at worst. Is that a bad thing, though? You’re not really given any reason to care about them or their problems, but I don’t really think you’re supposed to. I feel like the series was going for something more along the lines of a real life feel, which is a bold line for a fictional story to walk.

In most stories, I want everything I’m seeing to be somehow important. But that doesn’t mean everything has to be deep and interconnected. In Toradora, one of my favorite moments was the reveal that one of the side characters had actually managed to get a girlfriend, because it was a reminder that the characters had lives outside of Ryuji and Taiga’s drama. Well, in Yuri on Ice, everybody in the competition has their own life, everyone has their own problems, and the glimpses we get into their lives remind us that, like Yuuri, winning the gold isn’t the most important thing in the world, but a goal that they’ve placed some symbolic meaning onto. It actually kind of reminds me of Bojack Horseman, who got everything he ever wanted, but still wasn’t happy or fulfilled at the end of it. Success doesn’t denote happiness. This series is painfully aware of the age old trope called ‘the McGuffin,’ and it’s story very deliberately deconstructs it’s alleged importance in a character’s story arc.

It’s because of this that there are no real stakes in the competition. I won’t give away how things end at the Grand Prix finale, but Yuuri could have scored literally anywhere in the rankings and it wouldn’t have affected the conclusion of his arc. The same thing goes for all of his costars, even JJ, who defines his entire brand on success and perfection. I don’t think it’s an accident that the only character who never really feels fulfilled or complete is Yurio, the character who puts the most importance on getting that gold in the first place. He has the greatest thirst for gold, but one has to wonder, what happens if he gets it? What comes after that? More competition? More gold? He needs a true reason to compete, and he’s the only person there who doesn’t have one… For now. He’s young, and you have to figure that he’ll eventually move past his petty rivalry and find something more meaningful in life, but once again going back to Bojack Horseman, the opposite could also be true. So no, I don’t think the story is too weak to support a subtle romance. I think it works just fine.

While I get that the lack of confirmation in Yuuri and Victor’s relationship can be a sticking point for some, I would also like to point out that this is a series about finding something more meaningful in life than just the goals we set before us, and as such, it would follow that their relationship offers something more meaningful than confirmation. In terms of queer representation, there’s been a long trend of homosexual characters being plagued by two very negative tropes; The tragic ending, and the struggle against homophobia. To put it bluntly, a disproportionate amount of gay characters die, and a lot of straight audiences generally don’t accept queer characters as anything other than porn unless their plight is framed sympathetically… Things like bullying, disowning, societal stigma, etc. What Yuri on Ice presents is something we don’t see nearly enough… A positive, healthy same-sex relationship that’s been normalized to the point that it suffers issues beyond the obvious, which is both important and life-affirming, taking the high road and presenting a queer romance in such a way that completely desensitizes it.

Yuri On Ice is available from Funimation. There’s an OVA included with the English release that’s just three minutes of Yurio doing a new performance, but despite the lack of content, it may very well be one of the best things in the history of things. There’s also a movie scheduled to come out next year, which I already mentioned, and I’ll be damn disappointed if it’s either A) a condensed retelling of the series because I hate those things to death or B) anything but a completely incoherent mindfuck like the last LGBT anime movie with Adolescence in the title.

It’s true that Yuri!! On Ice won’t work for all viewers. I personally had to see it a few times to understand it, and I actually had to rewrite this particular review after hearing some of the thoughts that a friend of mine had on it. I did have a few issues with it, like how you had to watch the same skating performances over and over again with only slight variations in them, but it was a problem I was able to get over fairly easily. Even my issue with the side characters isn’t really a big deal, as the series may not give you a reason to care about them, but whether or not you do is entirely inconsequential. There’s more than enough to them to justify investment, and yeah, they all have their very loving and devoted fan followings, but even if you don’t give a shit about them, it doesn’t hurt the story or diminish them as people.  I’m pretty sure it’s the first sports anime I’ve ever seen that dared to suggest there was something more important to competition than just the fleeting euphoria of victory, and that’s pretty special.  I give Yuri!!! On Ice a 9/10."
16592,"I played Trigger Happy Havoc three years ago. I liked it. It was Saw meets Ace Attorney with high schoolers and could have taken far more risks than it did, but you know what, I enjoyed it. I also played Goodbye Despair, which I liked more than THH. It had the same amount of non-risk taking but it had better characters and more variety in locations. I own Killing Harmony but before I play that, I wanted to watch the animes. Will they be good? Nope. But I’ll watch them anyway!
First up is Danganronpa: The Animation and wow this is a horribly rushed adaptation that is way too short and represents my problems with the constraints of anime length.
The idea of adaptation is to translate a property from one medium into another. Danganronpa should be one of the easiest visual novels to make into an anime. It’s not long (for a visual novel), it’s a very clear-cut story with no branching paths, multiple sequences are already animated. So what the fuck happened? A 13-episode order, that’s what. Structuring this into 13 half-hours is what ultimately killed this adaptation. Does that mean I think it should have been 26 episodes? Well, no. That would be too long. Anime series (for TV) have to be structured at either 11-13 episodes or 22-26 episodes. Of course anime can have more cours, several have them all the time, but the point is that if it’s 3 cours then it has to be 36-39 episodes, if it’s 4 cours then it has to be 47-52 episodes and so forth. For an anime adaptation of Trigger Happy Havoc to truly work (in the way this show WANTS it to work), it needed like 17-19 episodes. Or have the episodes be longer than 24 minutes (hell, the last episode is 34 minutes on the Blu-ray, which I would have preferred if every episode was that long). But you can’t have either of those in anime! Not in 2013 at least. If it had to be 24 minutes per episode, I think I honestly would have preferred if this was 22 episodes and had a shitload of filler. Because I like these characters! I want to know about them from the anime. I had to pause after 4 minutes of the first episode because I couldn’t stop laughing at how the characters were introduced. They shove EVERYONE RIGHT IN YOUR FACE and everything is shown lightning-fast. I can’t imagine someone who hasn’t played the games to know who these characters are based on the anime. I should feel something when someone dies but I really don’t because I’m not allowed to get to know someone unless they’re about to die. In the game, there’s a WHOLE PORTION OF THE GAME dedicated to you going around and picking someone to talk to so you can learn about them. The anime does not allow you to breathe, IT’S TIME TO GO KILL SOMEONE ELSE! After the first three episodes, the pacing gets gradually better now that it doesn’t have to introduce everything, but it’s still too fast. I don’t entirely blame Makoto Uezu for this structure (I blame whoever only gave them 13 episodes) but it’s still the worst part of this adaptation.

The second worst part is the fear of change. In the process of adaptation, it is expected that you change things so that they make sense in the medium that the adaptation will inhabit. For Danganronpa, keeping the story identical is fine, but what should have changed is the PRESENTATION of the story. The investigations are ignored so that they can get to the trials. But that means that when evidence is brought to the trial, all I can think is “WHERE THE FUCK DID THAT COME FROM?!” Every “discovered murder” is hand-traced from the game and presented identically, it is not possible for me to stress how much the executions are the EXACT SAME with some slightly more fluid animation for character models. The trials reference things like the minigames which look stupid in the anime, but even stupider is the truth bullets, which should not have been anywhere near this adaptation.

Since I figure people will want this, I’ll bring up some technical qualities about the show. The animation is fine, but not exactly “great”. When it’s not copying the game it does the job well. The music is identical to the game but THAT’S common for visual novel adaptations so I’ll let it slide.

Danganronpa: The Animation is an amazing anime, in that it is somehow exactly how you should NOT make an adaptation. The first few episodes are “so bad it’s good” levels of extremely rushed, and I think I would have liked it more as an unintentional laugh riot had the pace been the same. Being forced to squish this story into 13 episodes makes it a rushed mess that people who haven’t played the visual novel probably wouldn’t enjoy. It is far too much like the game and far too short to do the story justice. I recommend playing the game for Danganronpa. If you don’t want to play the game, then watch a walkthrough of the game instead. It’s not funny how much of a disservice this anime does to a game THAT WASN’T EVEN THAT GREAT BUT DAMN IT'S A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN THIS."
21647,"Orange tells the story of a high school girl named Naho who receives a letter from her past self, telling her about all the regrets she wishes she could erase. Most of these are centered on a recent transfer student named Kakeru who is immediately ingrained into her group of friends. The letter tells Naho that she falls in love with him, but that he was taken away from them by a death that could have been prevented.

It’s revealed early on that his death was not an accident, but a suicide. With so much on the line, Naho is forced to try to overcome her timid, self-sacrificing nature in order to save Kakeru from the depression that will kill him.

The question the story posits then, is this: if you had the opportunity to prevent something from happening, how much would you be able to change? Could you change the future? And could you change your own nature to accomplish it?

Orange is an anime that has major glaring flaws that it makes up for with incredibly powerful strengths. Let’s start with the good though, shall we?

One of Orange’s strongest aspects is its characters. You have Naho struggling with her timidity and Kakeru struggling with his depression, of course, but the core cast is rounded out by Naho’s four other friends. There’s Suwa, the kindhearted, dependable jock. There’s Hagita, the sharp-tongued self-deprecating nerd. There’s Azusa, the cheerful and energetic girl, and Takako, the quick-tempered tomboy. They’re all well-written as individuals, but the real strength of the cast is the cast’s dynamics with each other. As a group, they all feel very much like a group of friends, and you can see varying different friendship dynamics between them clearly.

In addition, the sound design is fantastic. The music hits the emotional beats it needs to wonderfully, and the world itself is filled with all sorts of conversation and background chatter that add to the realism of the world and the sense of place. The visuals also work well for the series, with colors that pop vibrantly, but are also washed out and muted, emphasizing the bittersweet tone of the show.

This is not to say that the show is not without flaws. As strong as the characters are, they sometimes behave infuriatingly. Naho’s constant hesitance in particular can be frustrating, because she’s so afraid to take certain steps even when she knows what’s on the line. In addition, she can be dense. At one point, Kakeru offers his hand for her to take, and she’s completely unable to read the cues he’s sending her.

The show can also be heavy-handed with its metaphors. They’re emotionally powerful, but there’s not always a lot of nuance to them. The art also falls apart at times. Episodes in the mid-late range take a noticeable dip in quality.

Perhaps the biggest problem of the show, however, is an unfortunate result of the premise. The entire show relies on the letter that Naho receives, and leaving how exactly she received a letter from the future unanswered would likely feel unsatisfactory to many. However, it’s instead explained through some bad science fiction in what is otherwise a very realistic story. When the entire premise of the story hangs on something as hackneyed as what we got, it’s hard to look past.

That said, I think Orange is a series I would recommend everyone, not just anime fans, watch, because it covers such an important subject matter so well. Yes, from an objective, detached standpoint, it’s a flawed series, but when it hits, it hits well and hard enough that these flaws don’t matter. At its core, Orange is an emotional, cathartic story, and it’s that catharsis, not the story details, that will carry the show. In this sense, Orange succeeds fantastically.

Orange is, ultimately, a story about people stepping in to save a friend’s life, which is an incredibly relevant story for almost everyone. There are so many people in this world who have been touched by depression and/or suicide, and unfortunately we don’t have the option of getting letters instructing us how to prevent it. Orange attempts to offer up at least some perspective and understanding, though. What sort of signs someone who’s depressed and/or suicidal will display. What sort of phrases might send the wrong impression. What they’re wanting, needing someone else to tell them.

Orange might not be the best anime in existence, but it’s easily one of the most important. I honestly think it has a huge potential to impact lives. Maybe it’ll even be able to save a few. Five stars."
102976,"That was simply a wonderful watch from start to finish. It was beyond good to see all of these lovable dorks animated again in their full glory. Just watching them get into trouble or somehow bringing it to them without even trying, and straight-up not be up to anything good. I didn't realize how much I had missed KonoSuba before I watched this movie and had an absolute blast. It was truly worthwhile, and gosh, I am still waiting for that much-needed sequel. But studio J.C Staff no doubt knocked this one out of the park and blew my mind apart since I didn't think they had it in them to deliver this kind of exquisite quality and pure passion once more. I almost forget J.C Staff was good back in the day. I hope this is a sign of them rising up even more from the ashes. Toaru Railgun's third season that is airing as of 2020 Spring season looks quite beautiful and is far better on the eyes. But, there are many other shows they missed the mark with, or you just don't feel the overflowing sense of passion like this movie.

For one, how about Shokugeki no Slideshow: Powerpoint edition— or maybe they are using Google slides nowadays. Who knows? I don't wanna find it out either. I was initially going to just write my thoughts on a completed post. But that was a wall of text which would look so bizarre, so I decided to just do a full review and include my honest feelings here instead. I have a lot of stuff I wanna get off my chest and share laughter and joy about, so let's just get to all that snazzy stuff. The incredible explosive shipping teases and moments we got. Megumin's fans especially are really gonna love this movie. There is never a dull moment with the quirky-dorky group of Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness. It had everything that made you love KonoSuba and much more elevated to all kinds of higher levels with outstanding production value. I absolutely had such a great laugh watching this, and man was the comedy over-the-top odd as always, but so damn charming and just natural fitting our cast's personalities. I had a blast to see them all interact again and give us an extremely good time while they are at it.

J.C Staff were going all-in and made us really realize again in a spectacular manner why we just can't get enough of KonoSuba like ever. Megumin and at last YunYun had a pivotal role in this movie. We went to their Crimson Demon village, where they were born and raised. Hence tons of character exploration background, life, and family friends were dished out to us, which made use grow even a stronger bond with them. Suffice to say, if you previously disliked any of them, this movie might've changed that for you like damn big time. All kinds of Megumin-like characters were on screen and others just as quirky and over-the-top as her lovable self. It was about damn time, but we got lots of comedic, wholesome, and adorable Megumin x Kazuma moments as well. The fans are gonna love that. Yunyun was finally not shafted to the side at the end of it all and had lots of moments to shine and kick some major butt. That final scene for one with Megumin and Yunyun's very explosive teamwork was terrific, and the animation was so stunning.

Kazuma had lots of experiences in this movie. He'd rather forget, I am sure, and many scarred him for life. My boi almost got ridden by a gang of female orcs who have not seen male flesh in a very long time. Gosh, that whole moment was so damn hilarious and Kazuma voice actress, Jun Fukushima is killing it big time as ever. This was by far his most flexible, strongest, and enjoyable work yet from KonoSuba. Kazuma shined every damn time he was on screen with this sassy, bold, confident, and outright funny, charismatic personality with no regard for how he looks to others. Kazuma is the embodiment of not giving a shit and just yells out all his bottled feelings or what he wants to say at the moment without getting embarrassed. Aqua and Darkness took a step back, but still had lots of moments in the movie that would make you laugh or adore these two sights for sore eyes. Megumin had the most focus out of them all. Rie Takashi was killing it just like anyone else with her voice filled with so much energy, emotions. That you knew she loved and truly missed being Megumin. When it came to the production value as already hinted at multiple times, it was simply scrumptious, and the sakuga was absolutely fluid. 

Sheesh, you should've seen Kazuma's hands moving with such precise motions. I am sure fellow fans know what I am talking about. It's a very iconic moment, after all. Every moment of the movie, even a minor scene looked full of life and didn't seem dull or cheap. Although the movie had derps, that might just be Studio J.C Staff trying to emulate and paying some homage to Deen's quirky art. Yes, they totally killed it. Expect to see an insurmountable amount of weird facial expressions that will have you busting a gut without letting up. The soundtrack was great, hyped up the right moment, increased the comedic value even higher to really strike you. I also loved the outro song, which had our beautiful main female trio singing in union and separation. It was such a lovely and soothing song to end the movie on a pleasant note. I got a bit teary-eyed by the end, not even gonna try to sugarcoat it. I truly missed KonoSuba from the bottom of my heart, so this movie was a dream-come-true moment for me. Btw, I love how in the movie chomesukeI almost every scene to add to the fluff and wholesome vibes, it's such a simple gimmick, but it simply so damn effective, and hence I adored the amount of Chomesuke we got in the movie.

If you are feeling bored or need to laugh at your heart's content, break out some snacks, and sit back and watch this joyous KonoSuba movie. It will not leave you dissatisfied if you want everything that makes KonoSuba so popular and beloved packed in an hour and half of the pure utter entertainment without letting up for a moment or even a single dull moment. Fair warning it might have your side hurting a lot by the end as a cause of laughing way too much.I've said it a lot of times already, but I just loved and enjoyed this movie so much. I will tell you, however, if you're not caught up to the anime, this will spoil the events of volume 5, so just be sure about that before you decide to watch it. Now I need a new season of KonoSuba, and everything will be damn peachy."
139630,"I try not to be too smug when talking about anime. Discussing media always works best when you keep an open mind to all perspectives, so if someone has an opinion I disagree with, I do my best to disagree politely and present my side of the argument fairly. I’m not always successful, but I always make the attempt. Today, though? I feel justified in being a bit of a smarmy jackass. So allow me to present a couple of quotes from my review of My Hero Academia’s fifth season, back when everyone was calling it the worst show in the world because it made a couple arcs 50% less bloody.

“All this is to say, don’t be surprised when My Hero Academia once again becomes the most beloved shonen on the planet heading into its final stretch. Because this show has far from run its course yet.”

“Season 5 may be a low point in its history, but the fact that its low point is still so damn high is a testament to why this show deserved to conquer the world in the first place. My Hero Academia is still good, and I’ll be happy to say “I told you so” when the final seasons blow everyone’s socks off and make them fall in love with it all over again.”

Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between, allow me to state, on record, that I FUCKING CALLED IT.

God, do you know how long I’ve been waiting to get that off my chest? I’ve suffered through years of mediocre actioners being worshipped as the new best thing ever, watched as bottom-of-the-barrel crap like Tokyo Revengers and Fire Force tricked everyone into liking them, listened to a flighty, tasteless fandom turn their backs on one of the modern era’s greatest shonen because their lizard brains couldn’t concentrate without a thousand particle effects popping off every second. But no more. No more do I have to carry the torch solo as I have for far too long. Because at long last, after two subpar seasons that still blow most of its contemporaries out of the water, the second anime I ever watched has clawed its way back to the front of the pack and forced everyone to remember why My Hero Academia remains one of anime’s greatest modern standard bearers. The king is back on top, and I look forward to apologies from everyone who ever doubted it deserved the crown.

Okay, maybe that’s a little harsh. It’s not like My Hero Academia has ever been a perfect show, despite its self-evident excellence. Even in this fantastic return to form, plenty of its old issues still carry over. There’s the stupid unnecessary title cards all the characters get every episode, like the show thinks we’re so stupid we’ll forget everyone’s name in the week’s time between episodes. There’s the comedy that never quite clicks as well as it needs to, often disrupting otherwise fantastic scenes. The cast has grown overstuffed enough to officially qualify as a problem, with some characters frustratingly underutilized and some given way too much attention (seriously, who thought Best Jeanist was interesting enough to take over the tertiary protagonist role this season?). And it has a bad habit of stopping at huge moments and pausing the action for unnecessary flashbacks that we didn’t need to understand how the characters got where they were. If you’re the kind of shonen-head who just wants to turn your brain off and enjoy a bunch of flashy fights, it’s no wonder you’d be seduced by the sakuga-laden likes of Demon Slayer and JJK, despite their far more glaring issues in the story department.

But if you’re someone who actually appreciates a good story as a backbone to all those fisticuffs? Then you already know why MHA stands head and shoulders above its competition. And after five seasons watching this pressure cooker of a society boil hotter and hotter, it’s finally time for the lid to pop.

Season 6 is an explosion, plain and simple. It’s over a hundred episodes of peeling back the layers of hero society finally coming to a head and bringing the whole damn house of cards crashing down. The season’s first half is entirely taken up by a massive heroes vs villains war, a war in which everyone is pushed past their breaking point and forced to make climactic decisions about who they are and who they want to be. Characters die, self-actualize, rise to their ideas and shatter beneath them, on all sides of the conflict and sometimes all at the same time. If the All Might vs All For One battle back in season 3 was the end of My Hero Academia’s first act, then this barn-burner brawl is the climax to its second act. It’s the destruction of the status quo, an inflection point for all its characters, and as definitive a no-going-back mic drop as you can imagine. This is the end of the world as we know it, all the mistakes and hypocrisies of heroes past finally coming home to roost as Shigaraki puts his master plan into motion and the foundations of the earth itself tremble in response.

And once the rubble has finally settled, the season’s second half turns to tackle the aftermath. What happens when the world falls apart? What happens when everything people believed in turns out to be a lie? The heroes they put their trust in failed to protect them, and many revealed themselves to be little better than the villains they were supposed to be fighting. Fear and hatred compound, safety nets fails one after the other, and this society that once seemed so perfect reveals itself for the sham it always was. And Deku and his friends are caught right in the middle of the chaos, thrust far too soon into the role of the world’s hope for the future. They always wanted to be heroes: now, it’s time for them to come to terms with what that really means.

There’s a level of moral complexity to these developments that I don’t think any of us could have predicted. My Hero Academia started out as one of the most outwardly inspirational, optimistic stories on the market, but it’s proven itself more than capable of deconstructing its own premise. Heroism in MHA isn’t a static state of affairs; it’s a question that must be asked, re-asked, and asked again through the contradictions and imperfections of the real world. What does it mean to protect? To save? Where does the responsibility lie when we fall short? Is it ever too late to fix your mistakes and start over again? A lesser show might shy away from those questions, but MHA relishes in teasing out their intricacies. And it makes this season- especially the second half- some of the most captivating drama we’ve ever gotten from this genre. Watching the world come undone, and watching the heroes struggle to face the new task before them, results in not just some of MHA’s best moments, but some of the most hard-hitting resolutions in all of shonen history. The Deku/Shigaraki parallels! The return of You Say Run! Uraraka’s climactic speech re-cementing her as one of the   all-time  great shonen love interests! Payoff for not one, but two of the best goddamn redemption arcs this side of Zuko (and with Shigaraki, that number may climb to 3...)! Twice! Hawks! Lady Nagant! Season 6 is a portrait of a world falling apart, but it’s also a portrait of what rises from the ashes it left behind. As Deku himself says at one point, the world is far more complex than simple black and white, but that only makes it even more important to stand up for what really matters when the chips are down.

I’ve been watching My Hero Academia for a while. I started it back when there were just two seasons out and everyone was still riding high on the hype train. I’ve experienced its highs, its lows, its brilliance and its stupidity (Mineta has done nothing pervy this season and I am SO HAPPY YOU GUYS). I’ve been with this show for a long ass time. But no matter how its perception has shifted over the years, no matter how much anime I’ve consumed since then, I keep returning to the simple fact that MHA is really goddamn good. I don’t just like it because it was one of my firsts, or because of sunk cost fallacy, or anything like that; this genuinely IS one of the smartest, richest, most emotionally resonant works of shonen storytelling to ever appear in Jump’s pages. And watching so many of its threads come to a head in season 6 has only confirmed that it’s going to stand the test of time. I can’t count how many episodes left me weepy, how often I was left astonished at the courage and intelligence of Horikoshi’s writing. This isn’t one of those stories that squanders its potential along the way and leaves you indifferent by the end: this is a story that’s going to fulfil every last promise it made, pay off every last idea it set up, and bring it all together in a complete package that makes the entire show better in hindsight.

Because even in its slowest moments, this show was so much more than a mindless punch-em-up. This is a story all about the nature of heroism itself, and what it truly means to be a hero in a seemingly perfect world that actually has more cracks in its foundation than a log cabin built atop the San Andreas fault. This is a story about what happens when golden ideals run up against reality, how good intentions go awry and send an entire society down a path to ruin. This is a story about what drives villains to be villains in the first place, and why they deserve our understanding even in spite of their crimes. And it’s a story about how to rediscover and reforge hope, learning all over again what it means to make the world a better place. Unlike so many of its contemporaries, My Hero Academia actually has things to say about our modern world, ideas it wants to convey that run deeper than “just believe in yourself!” Demon Slayer can lavish as many pretty lights and spinning cameras as it wants atop its cardboard world and stick figure characters, but that momentary flash is nothing compared to this slow-burning tale of what it takes to rediscover heroism in a world that’s forgotten its true form.

Season 6 of My Hero Academia is phenomenal. It’s a lightning-bolt payoff to a story years in the making, sending it hurtling into its final act in as staggeringly brilliant fashion as I ever could have dreamed. It’s not just a new high water mark for this show, finally surpassing the bar set by season 3; it’s cemented this show’s status as one of anime’s all-time classics. When we look back on this period, it won’t be the vapid flashiness of Demon Slayer or the agonizing stupidity of Tokyo Revengers that stand the test of time. It’ll be the story of how a crybaby with green hair became the greatest hero... and how the entire world became the greatest hero right alongside him."

Such a cute chubster, isn't he? There! Now that that's out of the way, let it be known to the jury that OP isn't a soulless loser who's incapable of enjoying cute things at surface level. I feel it's kinda necessary to point this out, as it seems that any discussion surrounding Tonikaku starts and ends with these three words: ""It's so cute!"" If this was seen as pure fluff and nothing more, I wouldn't bat an eye. Instead, we're dealing with what is supposedly the SOL blockbuster of the season, and I'm not content with ending my observations by stating the obvious. So without further ado, let's figure out where this seemingly innocent show goes wrong as we take a closer, cynical look at the undeserving SOL darling of the season. This review is spoiler-free, but feel free to skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you'd like to go in completely blind.




 img100%() 

We've seen the same love story play out countless times before. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they struggle to confess, and the show ends right as the relationship finally gets off the ground. It's tried, it's tested, it's tropey as all hell. Aside from the ""Will They, Won't They"" conundrum, shows typically avoid romantic conflict like the plague. For whatever reason, audiences are sadly subjected to this constant retreading of material.


 img100%() 

The series forgoes platonic courtship in favor of finally giving audiences a lighthearted take on married life. Our newly-wedded husband is Nasa Yuzaki, who at 16 almost had his life end abruptly in a disastrous accident. Miraculously he survives, thanks to the intervention of his future wife Tsukasa. On that fateful night, the infatuated Nasa asks Tsukasa out. Two years later, they get hitched, and this all happens in the span of the first episode. Sounds wholesome and sweet… cute even. But in spite of its promising premise, one can tell right away that Tonikaku has little interest in doing much else than what we've already seen before.


 img100%() 

Several segments of the show are fun mini infomercials, dedicated to going over the spending habits and practices of middle-class residents in Japan. The Yuzakis face practical problems on a daily basis, and learn what it's like to share a living space with someone from the opposite gender. The young couple also spend time dealing with the consequences of suddenly getting married, and Tonikaku does an impressive job with making their matrimony make sense in a lifelike setting. Topics include purchasing marriage rings, property guarantor laws, and dreaded visits to the In-Laws. These tidbits may be enough to placate audiences looking to get invested in some semblance of realism. While I did find those parts of the show inoffensive, any goodwill I may have had gets thrown out the window once the show settles into its repetitive groove.


 img100%() 

On one hand, you have a show poised to deliver its spin on relationships not often popularized in anime. On the other, you have a show that intends to explore marriage only in name; even though Nasa and Tsukasa are a registered couple, they AREN'T married. They may go through daily-life struggles and share moments similar to those between married couples, but fail to put on a convincing relationship. Watching Tonikaku was watching two innocent children, whose pairing makes no sense outside of its shotgun-marriage premise, declaring sweet nothings and grandiose monologues about romance. The show trivialises and simplifies life-long intimacy to the point where the Yuzakis are barely indistinguishable from your stock ""puppy-love"" couples. That's not a bad thing on its own; not every romance SOL is required to provide some insightful truth on the subject. However, it's worth stressing that what the show is attempting is woefully at odds with what is advertised. Tonikaku is fully content with leaving its ambition at the altar, in favor of playing on familiar ground and formulaic jokes. The former greatly diminished my excitement for the story. As for the latter… well, let's get into it.


 img100%() 

By far the biggest offender is Nasa, who is kind, ever-prepared and intelligent… except when he's not. Tonikaku constantly destroys this positive image by instead handing us a daft teenager, who simped so hard it accidentally scored him a wife, almost at the cost of his life. Unless the plot demands him to be the purest snowflake alive, Nasa is possessive and downright horny. He finds strange obsessions within the most unassuming of situations; ranging from following his wife to the lingerie section, to awkwardly cuddling his wife as she sleeps, to undressing his wife in his mind as she changes in the other room (this occurs multiple times, mind you.) Not all these instances are bad, such as the scene in Episode 2 where the newly-wed couple share their first night together. It's at least a scenario unique to the show, and in small doses I'd find these scenarios to be mildly amusing… cute even. But then the joke just keeps going... and going… and going, ad nauseam. This Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Horny Hyde dichotomy does the character no favors. I'm constantly told he's this unselfish and thoughtful individual, but I'm witnessing a child given the means to act out his flights of pubescent fantasy onto a fellow virgin. Speaking of Tsukasa, her utilization in the show is equally irresponsible. While her charming character is inoffensive, what sucks is that she's constantly objectified by her Hubby Dearest. These disturbing interactions make up a huge chunk of Tonikaku, leaving me unimpressed and unconvinced whenever the show takes a break and preaches how kind and compatible and lovey-dovey our power couple are. It's kind of appalling how immature these characters are at times, and how they get away with their creepy implications and one-dimensional characterization just because ""they're married.""


 img100%() 

Kaname's sketches are the saving grace of the series and always put a smile on my face. Most of her gags are low-brow comedy, but they're enjoyable in a way that Nasa's simping is not. The key difference is that Kaname's jokes are very clearly meant to be provocative, while Nasa's testosterone-driven desires are framed as ""wholesome."" Aya's cluelessness is also pretty entertaining, with some of the series' funniest bits under her belt. Nasa's parents received quite a lot of build-up but fell disappointingly short of expectations. Lastly, Chitose and her maids are pretty awful, with Chitose in particular playing an uninspired tsun. She somehow makes Nasa look less dumb when she's on-screen, so that's quite the impressive feat.


 img100%( 

Some shows' chibi slapstick asides look more detailed than the entirety of the series. Sure, it keeps in-line with the mangaka's drawing style, but the simplicity of the presentation makes me wonder if the studio picked up this adaptation knowing they could get away with a cheap cash-grab. The monetary cost-cutting devolved to unintentionally silly levels, when about 1-2 minutes of Street Fighter V screen-capture footage was spliced in throughout Ep 11.^ Tonikaku's OP could have nearly been the best of 2020, if the budget had not run out as the title card dropped. Nothing stood out to me in the score, and the VA performances are nothing special. Konomi Kohara (Chika Fujiwara, Yuuko Yoshida) sounds like she's phoning in her performance as Chitose, and doesn't sound like she's having nearly as much fun as she did in [Machikado Mazoku](https://anilist.co/anime/107490/Machikado-Mazoku).


 img100%( 

There is no honest attempt at exploring married life, outside your everyday I-Love-Yous and embarrassed kisses. What we have instead are immature characters involved in a series of formulaic sketches that are either unfunny or disturbingly horny. I'd like to think that Truck-kun really was waiting in the wings to transport Nasa's soul into another world. A world only slightly different from our own, where the perfect girl falls into your reincarnated lap and is wholly submissive to your every request. And judging from the love Tonikaku is getting, there may well be an audience for this proposed isekai. Unfortunately, I'm just not a huge fan.


 img100%( 

In forgoing the confession phase, Tonikaku attempts to mislead you into thinking it sets itself apart from a typical romance story. Unfortunately, it's hard to see much merit with this decision when the characters are written with the same, if not greater, lack of maturity that plagues its contemporaries. Missed opportunities with exploring married life leaves a sour taste in my mouth. There are some moments that make for laid-back viewing, but Tonikaku's warped perception of love ensures that such opportunities are the exception and not the norm. Tonikaku comes across as a cheaply-produced ""flavor of the month"" SOL, that I wouldn't get nearly so riled up about if it wasn't so widely hailed as the Romance of the Season. 4/10




- ^I get that the mangaka is fond of retro games and such, but this scene is just ridiculous to me. Kinda sad that this production goof happened to be the best joke of that episode. A [Hi-Score Girl](https://anilist.co/anime/20574/High-Score-Girl/) this is not.
- By Ep 5, I was so desperate to find something funny that I let myself laugh when the show mentioned The Human Centipide out of nowhere. Not my proudest moment, Ik.
- Too lazy to pay attention to much else in the show, so allow me to throw in some peak-cringe Nasa quotes for the rest of this section. E. L. James would be impressed.
> ""This is a bath episode!""


> ""I can feel her body temperature directly through my arm!""


> ""It's like I managed to pull an Ultra-Rare variant of my wife!""


> ""I want to try all kinds of embarrassing things to [my wife]!""


And my personal favorite: 
>""I want to hug my bra-less, panty-less wife so much!""


- BEST GIRL: Giving this one to Kaname. She's deadass the most mature, sensible character in the show, I wish I was joking.

OK, that's it for now. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to write about an actual good [romance story](https://anilist.co/review/8867)… more on that soon enough. Thanks for making it this far in my rant, I apologize if I failed to communicate my critique effectively here.

21092,"Chivalry of a Failed Knight is a masterpiece in terms of what I want to see out of an anime both visually and formally. I'll start by putting and pointing out the first thing people notice and see when they start watching; the art, designs, direction, and animation. Then onto the story, characters, and plot which leads into lastly the fights and sound direction before giving my final thoughts. 
The character designs seem basic at first but through the seamless lighting makes all the characters pop from the backgrounds, including the background extra characters are hand drawn in most scenes. You notice a lot of glow effects on characters during most scenes and although simple in design the lighting gives everything a magical appearance as everything is happier, and the glow effect is seamlessly lost in serious moments to contrast the light-hearted glow with the drab darker tones. 
the cinematography in fight scenes is astounding to watch. There are a lot of interesting camera shots, angles, and wide shots while limiting establishing shots trying to put us in the eyes of our protagonist and it all works extremely well, it's rare to find camera angles without an important character in the frame and personally, I really enjoy that aspect as the anime is character focused and not world focused. The animation plays with the camera in mind and focuses on making a scene look as stylish or fluid as possible and there's never a dull moment in a fight scene. Even in the last few episodes (which are arguably the most hated episodes because of the drastic changes in color and art design) while true that it looks iffy at times, it is important for the story and our lead Ikki Kurogane and showing his depression via the drastic colors. While looking bad overall, I respect it whole-heartedly and I liked the change for that reason. Throughout the entire anime, the animation is really nice and the way everything animates around the camera is pleasing to the eyes.
The story is a basic start from the bottom get to the top through human potential kind of story, but it isn't a shounen and it isn't fully based on action. It is more than anything else, a telling of two lovers from episode 1 and 12. Ikki and Stella's dynamic and their character arc is out of respect and understanding, and has the story of the climb from worst to best play second fiddle to the love story between these two, and the transition of slice of life to action in the blink of an eye works really well and isn't jarring. Smaller plot threads are interesting or at least entertaining, such as Shizuku's background story and her love for her brother and wanting both him and her to succeed and the rivalry between her and Stella is a fun one to see. Every character has a role and their own reasons for everything they do including minor characters such as Alice which shows how tightly written aspects of the plot are. 
The fight direction is entertaining, and the characters in most fights have to find ways to outplay their opponents, one thing in particular that I like about this animes fights is that characters do not announce what actions happen, are going to happen, or have happened. While there are commentators to fights within the anime it leaves a lot of shock and awe to the viewer and when big surprises happen within the fight they legit become unpredictable making every fight enjoyable and satisfying.
Unfortunately, the soundtrack is lacking and most fight music is incredibly basic or not catchy. There's also a repeated tune that loses it's charm a little early that you can recognize. However, the OP playing in the final fight while cliche is by far my favorite use of this motif found in anime. Not much can be said about this soundtrack other than it is lacking, unfortunately. The sound design throughout the show is as well basic and can be very 50/50 in terms of it being a hit or miss. The voice acting in this anime is very average and I have no problems with any character's voice work, however, I will praise Shizuka Ishigami the voice actress of Stella as she went above and beyond with her voice acting for her character. 
All that being said, I loved Chivalry of a Failed Knight. I can work with and get past the flaws with the show to see the beautiful unappreciated gem behind them. While being cliche and basic on the surface if you dig just a tad deeper you get a wonderful narrative in a well designed, pretty world through the eyes of a flawed and wonderful cast of characters in a mystifying world with beautiful action scenes. I love Chivalry of a Failed Knight and I'll happily say it."
339,"Serial Experiments Lain tells the tale of a 14 year old girl, Lain, trying to find out what her role in both reality and the internet is. That is obviously a very vague synopsis, and my reason behind this is that the story is truly something that must be experienced firsthand. I feel obligated to mention how weird (but by no means bad) the pacing is. The actual story doesn't even really begin until halfway through, but that doesn't make the first half, which is focused more about Lain discovering both herself and ""the Wired"" (SEL's version of the internet) any less gripping. Serial Experiments Lain does not spoonfeed its story and purposefully leaves you in the dark at times, which only heightens the engagement level and makes the payoff that much more rewarding when you actually do figure out why all these strange events surrounding Lain are happening. Later on in the series there are a few ""exposition dumps,"" but luckily they are executed perfectly. Even one mistake in this aspect would result in a plethora of plotholes considering how intricate the story is, but the way the exposition is handled allows Lain's masterful plot to truly shine.




This is not a story for those in search of action and borderline naked girls, and to a further extent not a story for those looking for any sort of casual watching experience. I consider this the opposite of a “turn off your brain” type of anime - through each episode of Lain I found myself questioning what I was seeing, constantly looking to connect the abstract imagery and symbolism presented, and generally just figure out what the hell was going on. Rather than the more direct exposition of most anime, Lain tells its story through a combination of sparse, but philosophically dense, dialogue alongside a ton of symbolic, and often trippy visuals. Much of the allure of the show is in how much intertext and hidden meaning there is, and this is something immediately apparent from episode 1 with the first 7.5 minutes having a total of 10 lines of dialogue, opting instead to set the tone with a depiction of a young girl committing suicide. 

Even after a rewatch or two you will consistently find little connections and cryptic visual messages you missed that tie into the overall narrative of the show, such as this subtle shading connecting the aforementioned suicidal girl from the beginning of episode 1 to the Wired, as the same shading is frequently used later on when hinting at the protagonist transitioning between “reality” and the Wired. 




 

It can be very information dense and very easy to lose yourself the first time watching, but by the end you will have your mind blown even if you didn’t fully understand everything (you likely won’t). And it isn’t only the story that’s given in an experimental manner, the ways Lain conveys its message is equally unorthodox. It is often hard to distinguish between when the show is depicting reality and when it’s depicting the Wired, but this emphasizes a central question it asks – what is the difference between reality and the internet? What does reality even mean? Everything you see is shown through Lain’s perspective, which is very distorted. This blur between real and virtual gives SEL a sense of unreliability to the viewer, akin to Satoshi Kon’s works at times, but this only serves to strengthen the message it presents.


If I had to find one shortcoming of Serial Experiments Lain in my mind it would be the small cast of relevant contributing characters. Despite the complexity of the story, because so much of it is told through visuals and the protagonist’s self-questioning there isn’t a need for a lot of characters like you see in many other psychological anime. However, what SEL lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality, especially with the simultaneously endearing and mysterious MC. This show entirely focuses on one character, Lain, and yet I still wanted to see more of her by the end. This is partly due to how much Lain evolves throughout the series, her personality can change so much that it sometimes seems like a different character entirely.



I could count the characters that actually affect the plot on one hand, and even then their contributions aren’t all that significant, apart from Lain obviously. In saying that, the supporting cast did lead to some particularly poignant moments. In addition, very few of the side characters are given any backstory whatsoever, but the way they are presented more than makes up for this. I never felt like I needed to see anything relating to a character’s background because I already knew everything I needed to know from their dialogue and expressions. After all, this is a story about Lain, not the people around her. 


Though individual animations can be clumsy at times, SEL’s approach to its visuals is nothing short of spectacular. A rather dreary color pallet is used which contrasts nicely with the neon blues and greens of the Wired. One of the first things that stuck out to me when watching Lain was the use of light. Lighting in the show is very harsh and distinctive, typically using a blinding pure white light that interplays beautifully with the frequent use of inky and dismal shadowing, further lending to the mysterious and at times almost nightmarish atmosphere.





But that's not to say the animation isn’t without some faults - the characters are drawn in a fairly realistic fashion compared to the standard of the medium, which to me is preferable for an anime such as this; however, it isn’t always executed perfectly and occasionally leads to some awkward looking character expressions. 

As far as sound goes, Lain takes an extremely minimalistic approach. Sometimes there are minutes, or even entire episodes, with little to nothing as far as a typical soundtrack would go. However where the OST is prevalent it is utilized wonderfully, often using eerie synths and sparse percussion to set the mood. 
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zee9uX7MC0E)
Rather than traditional songs, Lain’s audio is filled with sounds such as the bustle of pedestrian traffic, noises of trains passing, the hum of electrical currents through telephone cables, the clicking of a computer keyboard. Sometimes even these are absent, leaving the viewer with extensive silence. 

The unique artstyle and complementing approach to audio masterfully succeed in creating one of the most enigmatic and memorable atmospheres I’ve encountered.


Serial Experiments Lain is one of the most thought provoking shows you’ll see, with themes such as identity, modern isolation, and humanity’s reliance and combination with technology prevalent, yet still hidden under a blanket of unconventional exposition. Lain doesn’t look to prescribe advice or answer questions – in fact it raises far more than it answers. If anything, it’s trying bring a series of ideas to attention by offering a layered (heh) postmodern commentary on them. SEL covers some philosophical topics that are very grounded in reality and have only increased in relevance since its release alongside the increasing connectedness of the information age we live in. Subsequently, Lain is an anime that will likely change the way you think about the internet, and possibly even the way you think about humanity and what it means to be alive. A must watch for any fans of the medium."
21857,"The first few episodes were leading up to an amazing anime, too bad the other 7 episodes had to ruin it by getting worse and worse and further from the actual plot of the anime, it felt like filler, and rashly patched up in the final episode being like ""they might be liking eachother more but that fake childhood friend guy that's only out for the heroines family wealth DIDN'T HAPPEN ANYTHING TO. HE'S STILL JUST SORTA THERE BEING A FAKE""

This is honestly something i could fall in love with, the chemistry between a girl that has rejected every boy that's come after her and someone from her past coming back for revenge. Even as far as scheming with one of her closest friends & servants to give her a taste of how it feels to make her a better person. Them being caught meeting up together was a turning point, but not what i wanted for a series like that. After a close traffic accident and being saved by the hero, it felt like some amount of trust would have been gained between the two of them, but some random girl just comes out of the car that almost killed/ seriously injured the heroine being like ""HEY I'M THE NEW MAIN STAY SIDE CHARACTER OF THE SERIES"" Then she's weird for a while during the summer vacation just being a romance rival for romance rivals sake, the hero sure is stubborn to go after a girl he says he doesn't like when ""more his type"" are forced in his face all the time, but that's the part i love, he's sacrificed a lot of nice chances of relationships he would probably be really happy with, just for the heroine. But its not mutual, as soon as someone came in literally the final 3 episodes she's like ""take me daddy pig"" when she knows nothing about him other then him being all deceptive and lying and etc etc. That's the part i don't like

This show has a lot of things about trust issues, and its given me trust issues of romance anime because they always pull shit like this out of nowhere. I would love to rate this 1/100, but the first episodes was showing me how much i liked both the main characters, they had chemistry even though one tried to trick the other, and by doing so falling in love himself. Like they could have redeemed it in the ending being like ""i exposed your shady past with your poor family and you're only marrying the heroine for her money, get dabbed on"" that would have been a more satisfying ending, but instead its just season 2 bait, and i honestly hope it doesn't get a season 2, and if it gets one I'm sure not watching it."
6045,"I’ve been beating around the bush for a bit when it comes to writing this review. To be honest, it took me longer than it should have to watch this anime. Some of it is due to watching other anime that’s currently airing, but most of it is due to laziness. I didn’t have much motivation to finish this anime. Not that it’s bad or anything, it’s just kind of boring to me. I’m not the target audience for Kimi ni Todoke. With that being said, I’m still going to review the show.

img1000()

Kimi ni Todoke follows Sawako, a girl who is cursed to look like Sadako from The Ring. At the beginning of the anime, she is friendless. That changes when Kazehaya, her classmate and most popular guy in her grade, goes out of his way to talk and become friends with her. She also befriends ‘delinquents’ Yano and Chizuru, along with the absent-minded Ryu. As with any shoujo series (or anything in the general direction of romance), the plot of the anime advances by misunderstandings forming and being resolved.

img1000()

Watching Kimi ni Todoke felt like I was watching someone else’s dream. While the anime doesn’t have any metaphysical properties, it imitates it with how slow Sawako speaks and thinks. It makes it seem like we’re in a world of her creation, while in fact, we’re just seeing her interpretation of the world around her. Her naivety turns a world that has been very harsh to her into one where she’s constantly misunderstood. While Kazehaya and the girls becoming friends with her helps to turn around the rumors about her, they also start up other ones.

img1000()

Kimi ni Todoke suffers from the same problem that most other romance anime does--it’s stuck in neutral most of the anime. While I know why it’s like this, it still annoys me that I have to watch two people fumble around with their feelings for 25 episodes. Good thing is that Kimi ni Todoke is not just about Sawako’s romantic mishaps. The anime also explores Yano’s and Chizuru’s romantic life, which honestly is more interesting than Sawako’s. There’s some good comedy in there also, especially any scene with Sawako trying to talk to someone who doesn’t know her. I should be fair though, the misunderstandings that make Sawako’s love life go nowhere aren’t THAT frustrating, it’s just annoying from time to time.

img1000()

I think the worst thing about Kimi ni Todoke was that it was boring to watch. I took my time finishing this anime since I didn’t have any drive to watch more than one episode a day on most days. While watching several airing anime can take some time I would have to watch this away, it still was at the bottom of my list to watch. Like I said at the beginning, maybe this anime isn’t meant for someone like me. Kimi ni Todoke isn’t bad--it can be quite funny and the characters are charming. It just isn’t something that pulls me in and gets me to watch episode after episode. I would only recommend it if you’re into shoujo anime, otherwise, you might find it a drag to watch."
111321,"Spoilers below

After watching this season, I can safely say, Malty is the reason why I even finished Season 1. The biggest problem with Shield Hero is that it just isn’t as satisfying to watch anymore, because the revenge plot is done, and now it’s just a generic isekai. I’m sure the studio and animators realized that, so what did they do? They proceeded to milk the living heck out of Raphtalia and create some fan service, because they know there are many people watching this show just for her. I had low expectations coming into this season, because I didn’t think Season 1 was that good to begin with, especially in the second half. Somehow this season still  ended up being disappointing. This season of Shield Hero was paced poorly, was uninteresting, the characters got even worse, but it did have one saving grace, and I’ll highlight that down below.


My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 5.5/25

An awkward mess would be an understatement. Granted, I didn’t expect a whole lot from this season, but this was not good. I’ll talk briefly about the two main arcs of this season:

The spirit tortoise arc. Absolutely atrocious, and I’m sure most of you agree. I started the arc and the first thing I wondered was who Éclair was. I looked back at the previous season, skimmed through wikis, and I found nothing about her. So, you’re telling me she just showed up? YUP! That was the first sign that this was getting extremely rushed, even though I’ve never read the light novel. I don’t blame them for rushing this though, because it’s just a boring arc, and I can see why this rushed it, but you can’t introduce an important character without letting us know who she was beforehand. The biggest problem to me was how they deviated from the plot of season 1, which was fighting the waves, and seeing the video game mechanics in play. This time, there’s just this random tortoise thing that’s supposedly a danger to the world, which felt so random.

After a few episodes of meandering about doing a whole lot of nothing, Naofumi and company face off against Kyo Ethnina, who is officially one of my least favourite villains of all time. The way he just shouts so annoyingly, but honestly has the same intelligence as people in Team Rocket from Pokemon is just near unbearable. All he does is shout arrogantly, and when he gets defeated, WHOOP-DEE-DOO, he has yet another trick up his sleeve. Very poor character writing, and one of the lamest villains I’ve laid my eyes on, Malty was actually frustrating to watch, in a somewhat good way, and vastly superior to Kyo.

Next, we have the New World arc, which started off decently, but once Kyo came back on the screen, I realized that it’s still horrible. The first few episodes of this arc were the best of the entire season, and those were the episodes where virtually nothing happened, and they were exploring the Infinite Labyrinth. Obviously, the writers knew that the series was struggling at this point, so how should we save the story? SMOL RAPHTALIA IS DEFINITELY THE ANSWER TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS!!! Yikes. Though, the reason for my increased enjoyment to start this arc was the addition of the Cardinal Hunting Hero Kizuna, who was a fun and bubbly character with at least a little personality. Another reason is that Shield Hero finally got back to its roots and focused on levelling up and gaining items, which was the best part about Shield Hero in Season 1. Twists and turns happen, the gang eventually reunites again after episode after episode of absolute nonsense and Raphtalia somehow becoming the Katana Hero and also becoming OP as all heck. The villains were uninteresting, and the ending of the arc was rushed heavily as well. At least Kyo’s gone.

Overall, just hugely rushed. The development of the characters was poor, the villains were lame, and the amount of plot holes was crazy.

ART: 4.2/10

Huge step down from Season 1, and it became abundantly clear that Kinema Citrus was already setting their sights on working on Made In Abyss Season 2. Character expressions were awkward, fight scenes took place in stills, and the Spirit Tortoise looked like a huge, heavy pile of CG. Yikes.

MUSIC: 8.4/10

I will say, Kevin Penkin is still the saving grace of this show, and the music is pretty good in important scenes. Looking forward to his work in Made In Abyss Season 2. The opening was not as good as the first two, and the ending was alright.

CHARACTERS: 5.5/20

Uninspiring, boring, and just stock characters. Maybe they’re kinda cool in fight scenes, but what could you tell me about any type of reasonable character development? Let’s go over some of the characters.

Everyone’s favourite character, Raphtalia! I’m convinced she’s just here since the fans love her. She can fight, and keep Naofumi level-headed, but that’s no different from Season 1. The romance is just there because you just gotta have some kind of a harem in an isekai for the fans to be happy. When the story gets bad, they just show some smol Raphtalia, and expect the fans to be satisfied.

Let’s talk about Filo and Rishia now. Filo barely got any screen time, and there was no development for her, she’s just there. Rishia got my character development this time, by being more brave I suppose, and building up her skills. Her plot armour is crazy though, as not even Kyo’s gravity attack can oppose her. The question though is, why was Rishia wearing that Filo outfit in the tortoise arc???

I mentioned Kyo earlier, and how bad he is, so let’s talk about our saving grace, Kizuna. Definitely the best character in the series, because she’s strong, and has a pretty fun personality. Still a very bare-bones character that would benefit from some development. Would love to see more of her.

Finally, let’s talk about our protagonist, Naofumi. He seems like a smart guy right? To be honest, he’s just an average protagonist, but he looks smart because everyone around him have very low intelligence, and rely on him to do the heavy lifting, though we do see this theme quite a lot in other shows as well, it just seems more noticeable here. He’s a solid character, but his only intriguing aspect is when he gets angry and the wrath shield tries to take over. I still don’t understand how he can attack when he’s supposed to be a defensively oriented hero.

ENJOYMENT: 2.5/15

I found myself completely checked out at times, and there was little to no elements that had me enjoying this season.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 4/20

What this show does, is fix bad thematic execution, with what the writer and director thinks is good themes. For example, if a fight was underwhelming, or if the story was convoluted, they’d try to fix it with some fan service. If the plot was boring, they’d try to spice things up with a hint of romance. It just doesn’t work. No themes were executed well, as a lot of things felt forced and rushed.

OVERALL: 30.1/100

Definitely the worst show I watched in the spring season. The story was massively rushed, the characters were uninspiring and bland, the villains were lame, and I didn’t enjoy it at all. I even heard that they didn’t follow the light novel very well from the readers. It’s a shame, though I kind of expected this, since the second half of the first season gave me signs that the story would go downhill, but I didn’t expect that this would be this appalling. The production and animation overall was very janky as well. The saving grace for this series was definitely Kizuna and Kevin Penkin’s composing. I believe that Season 3 might be a bit better than this season, but I’m not going to be expecting much at all."
21875,"Remember when I did my original review of No Game No Life? Yeah, that review. I talked about how I watched it when I was 11/12, and I loved it. To this day, it's still at a high score. I wouldn't say it's a 10/10, but more-so a 9.6/10. I still rate it highly because of how nostalgic it is to me. 

Now, I left the anime scene when I was moving to the Philippines. At the time, I did NOT knew about there being a movie for No Game No Life. So I went to it when I started watching NGNL again, and I thought it wasn't as good as the original. Oh boy.. I took a look at it again, and I was SO wrong. Allow me to explain why.



So this movie explains all of what happened in the Disboard 6000 years ago. It is nothing but a BIG war. A war with endless battles and multiple deaths. We have Riku, the main character who wants to finish off this entire war and lead to a past that humans wish for., and then there's Shuwi, an Ex-Machina unit who wants to learn about the heart of the human. Both eventually will pair up to put a stop to this war. Exactly how? Will it be pulled off? How will they end the game?

That's all I can really tell you about this movie. Nothing else really. I don't really wanna ruin this unique experience. Or downfall... idk, it just truly depends on how you see NGNL. As a nostalgic memory, yeah, it's amazing.



As I've said, this is all what happens 6000 years ago. Way before Sora and Shiro were brought to the Disboard. I find it really interesting to actually go back to the past and visit and experience all of what happened in the past. It's like saying that you wanna go ahead and experience World War I, how Earth was made, or even how everything in this earth was brought together. The story does have it's moments to shine, and it brightens up amazingly. 

Riku's character development makes me wonder how much he has suffered. I mean, he did got his home destroyed, he tried to plan out everything, but it would end in a loss, and he did order a lot of people to die in order for him to live longer, but that's just an excuse of there being no way for him to continue on without any of his comrades. Idk if this is just me, but that is antagonizing if it was me. He had it hard. As the movie progressed, he eventually came to having a lot more confidence in him. Now he has high hopes for his plans to work out. Take note on this: If you're confident that your plan will work, then pull it off. If not, then it could end in failure. There's only a 50% chance rate for it to work. I say, he had the most in him, and I would like to say that it's all thanks to Shuwi.

Shuwi's development was indeed interesting to say the least. Her reason as to why she stayed with Riku is as simple as it follows, to find the meaning of having a human heart. She could've just killed him off or throw him off the cliff, but no. Instead, she wanted to play a game of chess with him. Why? She estates that it's because it's the only thing that made Riku smiled. She eventually learns more about the human heart, and because of it, she got close to Riku very quick. The two would oftenly plot what the next move would be, and eventually, when they had the time, they'd play chess. Call this the origin as to why Tet made the Disboard a world of games. 

Both their development brought an interesting story to the table. They have their moments to shine, and their game plans to plot. It's nice to see them grow and plot things out. 

I'm a sucker for visuals, and there isn't much of a difference between the anime and this movie. They're both equally amazing as it is. It's a whole lot colorful, and the character designs... they haven't changed much, but it's good to have them be the same instead of them having a different design. The battle sequences, I find it to be wild. much of all of what's happening is just going real quick, or it's just a cluster-fuck of magic. Welp... MadHouse is now on the list for ""Visually unique anime"".



If you've enjoyed No Game No Life like I have, then this is indeed something worth watching. It ain't no Season 2, but I'll take it with what we have with this movie. Wanna know more about the world of the Disboard? Then watch it. Especially if you have seen No Game No Life first. 

Well with another shit review out of the way, I bid you a nice day. See you again with another one. Maybe"

(May contain spoilers for previous seasons)

 It started in summer 2014 with the first adaptation of [Tokyo Ghoul Manga](https://anilist.co/manga/63327/Tokyo-Ghoul/) airing. The anime remained faithful to the manga and the story itself was interesting combined with some gore and it attracted a large audience  and ratings were good too. Both manga readers and anime only watchers were happy.

Then came the √A. Now in the first season they had 12 episode and serialized about 50 chapters of manga that is good. But in second season they still went with 12 episode series but decided to finish it there. Now the options were either to compress 94 chapters in 12 episodes or change the story and omit some details and they went with the later which left the manga readers furious.

Fast forward 3 years, in spring 2018 came the adaptation of [tokyo ghoul:re ](https://anilist.co/manga/85611/Tokyo-Ghoulre/), now the RE manga itself was a bit tricky because fight scenes were not very well drawn and for some reason the author decided to revive every dead character. Now the anime adaptation decided to completely forget about the √A and assume that everyone has read the manga which was definitely not the case and this time it left every anime only watcher confused and scratching their head because they don't know most of the things that happened in the second half of the Tokyo Ghoul which Studio Pierrot decided to throw in dump.

And finally 4 years later after the starting of Tokyo Ghoul we've reached the bottom of the pit after descending every level for 4 seasons. That's right I'm talking about the Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2. Now with this one they had the same situation as in √A either follow the manga by compressing it or write it on your own like they did in √A. But they thought hey we've already done the later now lets try the former and not much to say they failed miserably. This time they somehow managed to make both manga readers and anime only watchers angry, confused and disappointed. Anime only watchers didn't even know what was going on half the season and manga readers were very disappointed with the terrible pacing.

Story: 4/10

(Just read the manga if you're curious about the story)

The story does follow the manga but at the same time it doesn't with almost every detail getting omitted which leaves characters as hollow as 1 dimensional objects with no development at all. 

Characters: 1/10
There is no character development. WIth almost every character getting revived we have about 3 times more characters than episodes which leaves no development to anyone at all.

Sound: 5/10
Only the OP by TK was good, rest of the osts were of the same quality as the anime.

Animation: 6/10
The animations were pretty ok compared to the previous season.

Overall: It's like a disappointment which everyone predicted and it came out to be just that way."
14513,"This is a review of both seasons of magi and its meant to be read by those who want to get into it. But hopefully those who have watched both seasons will also find something of value to extract from it.

Ive always been a fan of shonen, as a kid i would watch fma 2003, naruto, dragon ball, etc. But i actually never got to many shonens as i would have liked to during that period, so as a teenager i started seeking out these stories that i had missed out on. I watched Soul Eater, while being highly stylized and with a lot of charm, it lacked depth and a proper conclussion. Soul Eater to me has always felt like a pretty package that i want to open and find out whats inside, and every single time i try to open it i find nothing. The beauty of the package was all that there was to it.

And im not bringing this up just because, as i feel like this is a problem that has been prominent in many other shonens, even to this day. Bleach was another case of a cool, highly stylized and well presented story which ended up lacking in a narrative sense after its 2 first arcs which were the highlight of the series by far. And the funny part about this is that this is pretty much the same situation that Boku no Hero is facing nowadays. This was a series that started out with a bang, an incredible first arc that setted up what could (Upon further development in the future) end up being an interesting and unique world, with charming character designs just as bleach and soul eater, incredible animations from the very same studio that brought us soul eater, and an ost that could motivate even an old man to run for more than 50km without stopping a single second. The character development took the main stage during the second season and this series was building up to be the next big shonen, and with the first part of the third season being an absolutely cathartic climax to what had been building up to that point i was sure that i was witnessing the birth of the next great shonen. 

Im sad to say that after the poorly paced and uninteresting second half of that season, and with the lackluster narrative quality of the 4th season ive lost all of my faith in this series. Boku no Hero is the same as Black Clover, mediocre shonens that are aimed for kids and people who are able to turn off their brains while watching anime. Im not saying that these series are exactly bad, im just saying that ive been dissapointed in this newer generation of shonen, and that im even more dissapointed in the fact that ive seen these series making the exact same mistakes that the previous ones before them did instead of trying to be better. I ultimately enjoy both of this series, hell i enjoy all of the previously mentioned series. But once i get to it from an analytical perspective theres no much to extract or take away from them. Which is a shame as series like Fullmetal Alchemist, Death Note and Hunter x Hunter have shown us just how powerful this genre can be if done by someone who is willing to make a narrative with more depth than just ""i hit you, you hit me. i get a power up and friendship wins bitch""

I can enjoy mediocrity, but that wont stop me from pointing it out in hopes that one day ill stop seeing authors fall under the same mistakes as their predecessors did. I want to see more shonen from the likes of FMA and less of say, fairy tail and black clover. 

This is obviously a much more complicated thing than just authors and works, theres a lot of factors involved in the making of a manga. So i also want to point out that despite me mentioning the authors, if we were to point fingers at someone i feel like the one we should point fingers at is Shonen Jump itself.

And with all of this in mind we can finally get into Magi, what i believe to be one of the most solid and enjoyable shonens of recent times. For a variety of reasons, but ultimately i feel like the most important thing to take away from this review should be that i feel like this series is pretty close to what FMA did from a world building perspective and when it comes to tying its theme with its characters and world. And also, its a series that has managed to maintain its high narrative quality through both seasons, something that as previously stated i cant say of other works from this genre.

This series is based on middle eastern folk tales, which ultimately make it a breath of fresh air from the very beginning. It has a unique setting, and it can be clearly seen from the start just how much thought went into creating a believable and engaging world with its own identity. I can remember many names from this fictional world, from names of people, to the names of kingdoms. I can recall their cultures, how each kingdom even has different pieces of clothing, different weapons, different ideologies and overall it feels exactly like any fictional world should. Vast, magical, diverse and alive. 

There are many occurrences during this series that show how everything in this world works and how everything is tied together, during the beginning of the second season we start to see mercenaries and pirates using magical weapons, magical weapons that are revealed by a later arc to be mass produced and sold by a nation of mages that are testing out new war equipment in order to prepare for an assault. And this happens often in the series, something that was previously shown ends up being of importance later on and helping in setting up a new narrative arc. Which is clearly proof of just how well written and thought out this world really is, and even more if we compare it to modern shonens which are always introducing new characters and powers out of nowhere so that they can move the plot forward. Every nation is in motion, the world doesnt revolve around the protagonist or any singular character, this is a living and breathing world.

And its also one of well established rules and with a pretty smart and functional power system that revolves around the usage of an energy called ""magoi"". This is basically the mana of this world and its extracted from rukh, which is the life force of everything, including humans themselves. Upon completing a dungeon on this world one receives a genie, which often has unique powers and abilities based on a particular element. So theres a kind of ""pokémon type chart"" battle system, in which water is effective against fire but weak against grass and so on with each element. Also, as the energy necessary for these genies and their powers to be summoned comes from rukh itself, theres a lot of exploration and strategy that can be done. For example, if one character has a water genie but its running low on magoi, he can simply run to a place filled with water or take advantange over rain to extract magoi from that water and recover its energy so that he can keep fighting or make crazy powerful attacks. So we got a power system that has to be used in smart ways and one in which both elements and enviroments need to be taken into account aside from the usual battle tactics. Sounds pretty solid, and fun doesnt it? And theres even more than that! as later its revealed that there exists white rukh and black rukh, but i wont get into details about that as this review is meant for people who are considering watching Magi and not for those who have watched it. But im mentioning it just to show how much depth this system has.

Its also important to note the diversity of the characters that inhabit this world, theres multiple races, tribes, ideologies, etc. Theres all kinds of characters that reflect different kinds of struggles, from the usual rich kings that despise the poor and are even willing to sell the freedom of their citizens just so that they can maintain a position of power and welfare, to racists leaders who only seek to destroy the ones that they dont recognize as humans. Theres also contrasting ideologies that are completely opposite to these, kingdoms built around the idea of freedom and posibilities for everyone as equally as possible. Each of them with its own strengths and weaknesses.

The best part of these characters for me is how human they feel, every character has a fair share of virtues and defects. Imperfect people who try their best, marked by their past, individuals who seek evolution and who eventually find it through multiple stages. Every major character goes through some kind of development, and even minor ones seem to get love too and stay relevant. Ali babá is one of the most human protagonists that i have ever seen, he feels so real, hes just like a teen his age, filled with insecurities and fears which he slowly starts to get over. But even in the face of said insecurities and fears he still feels charming and likeable.

And the best part is that both seasons just feel like a gigantic build up that just keeps going and going, but theres also a lot of climaxing and cathartic moments that keeps one engaged and interested. So its not only a lot of build up, theres a lot of payoffs during and after each mini arc and even more during the big ones at the end of each season. And the best part is that often these cathartic moments share thematic similarities which ultimately just makes this series so much more fascinating and captivating. The author clearly had something that she wanted to get across with this work, and i feel like the message is constantly repeated in sometimes subtle and other times not so subtle ways. Which i love as i feel like having a prominent and central theme, and making a story that works to explore said theme is essential in order to have a coherent, fun, and satisfying narrative. 

Lastly, when it comes to the animations themselves these are just perfect. While watching the first episode of the first season i was so amazed by the animations that for a second i stopped to check if i wasnt watching a movie instead of a series, every single episode is filled with these breathtaking animation. Even the way in which the fucking mouths are animated has more effort in them than the entirety of those seasonal isekai shows that are constantly being aired. And when it comes to the soundtrack i would say that its memorable, solid and overall amazing. There are some real hype tracks in here. 

I had so much fun with this series and i believe it to be one of the best shonens of recent time, i would suggest it to anyone with any kind of interest on this genre or in well written stories in general, as I feel that it avoided a lot of mistakes that most shonens make. 

To close up this review i want to point out the only real bad thing that this series has that i feel like could be a huge problem for a lot of people. And thats the fact that its been a couple of years and there has been no announcement or confirmation for a third season. 

The ending to the second season for me was quite fulfilling and satisfying, closing up right after the most cathartic moment of the whole series. But this isnt a completely finished story and theres still a lot of manga chapters that need to be adapted. I will most likely check out the manga now, but this wont be the case for everyone and its perfectly understandable. Still, i feel like both seasons of this show deserve a shot due to how great Magi is at showing how this genre is much more than just 2 dudes hitting each other until one of them drops dead."
20668,"Anime humour is kind of a swing and a miss most of the times for Western audience members. Oftentimes, we may chuckle at a few jokes here and there, but it’s very rare that we ever burst out laughing. It’s not that anime tends to have unfunny jokes, but rather that they are not necessarily culturally applicable to us. Unless one is proficient in the Japanese language and culture, it’s likely that most of the wordplays and gags will be completely lost on the average Western anime viewer.

With that all being said, “Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-kun” is funny.

Actually, let’s rephrase that sentence.

“Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-kun” is hilarious.

It’s hilarious when you have a background knowledge of shoujo tropes, but it’s also hilarious even if you don’t. It’s a show that’s just funny for everyone.

Focusing around a motley cast of characters, “Nozaki-kun” is the tale of high schooler Chiyo who discovers that her crush, the titular Nozaki, is actually the author of a popular young girls’ romance manga in spite of him being extremely dense when it comes to love. Shenanigans ensue as her encounters with him result in a variety of interesting and hilarious characters to join the fray. 

Parodying common tropes in the genre and turning them on their heads, “Nozaki-kun” is a hilarious romantic comedy that is more comedy than it is romance. Of course, while there are moments where heartstrings are tug, viewers should be aware that the show is really there to make you laugh. Each episode has gags that will make viewers burst out laughing because of how absurd the punchlines are. ""Nozaki-kun"" never resorts to cheap laughs like many other anime comedies. Almost every single gag is unique, which makes watching this show a fresh one regardless of how many anime you've seen in the past.

Other aspects of the show are also great as well. The show's opening is perhaps my favourite one of all time, while its voice actors are perfectly cast for their characters. Character designs are great, with each character feeling distinct and easy-to-recognize. While the art is nothing to write home about, it's still pleasant to look at and fits the atmosphere of the show.

Detractors of this show may criticize it for lacking any real character development, but those concerns are arguably irrelevant as the focus of the show has never been about deep and realistic characters. It's about likable characters who find themselves in extremely absurd situations that will make your sides hurt. 

If you want romantic development, maybe look elsewhere.

If you want good laughs, fun characters, and just an amazing way to spend a few hours on a rainy day, then this is the perfect show for you."

“Carve it. Carve it into your flesh. Carve it into the land. Carve it into the sea. Carve it into your spoils. Carve it into your enemies. Carve it.”

The second season of Vinland Saga is a clear departure to the themes of its predecessor, with a much slower pace, and while the setting still has the backdrop of war surrounding it, a lot of it was in quite a calm, farming environment, at least for the first half. This season really embodied the Seinen genre extremely well, with much more complex themes than what the first season provided, and both seasons shine in their own respective ways. It’s meant for a more mature audience perhaps compared to the first season, which served as a good way to get fans into the series.

Sure, the first season had quite a lot of action, but as we keep moving along in the story, a question we could ask ourselves is, “Was the action really the main focus of what this story wanted to tell?” It’s set in the Viking era, so obviously there will be some combat, but it’s become clearer with this season that it’s not even close to the message that the author wanted to tell. Makoto Yukimura, the author, definitely put some of his ideals into the characters and the story, reflecting on the kindness and cruelty of the world, and its balance. If you haven’t already read his Twitter threads for each episode, I do recommend you read them so you understand his intent behind the story even more. If you are a huge fan of action anime, you might find this season a bit off-putting and not for you.

It’s a full 180 from Season 1 not just in its story, but also its characters. Thorfinn in Season 1 was in a way, kind of a protagonist you’d find in action shounen anime, with revenge being his main reason to keep on living after Askeladd slayed his father on the ship. He lost his reason to live after the events of Season 1’s finale, so at the start of this season, he was understandably depressed. However, if Season 1 was a tale of battles and what it means to fight and die on the battlefield, then Season 2 was a tale of what it means to live. His development this season was absolutely stellar, as he went from a very quiet, depressed character, to a character with lofty ideals, and one who influenced everyone around him, filling them to the brim with hope, and a reason to press on in a cruel world like theirs. Meanwhile, Einar, the other main protagonist, and some other characters as well, kind of feel like the Thorfinn of old back in Season 1. Snappy, quick to anger, and easy to provoke. It’s somewhat ironic that Thorfinn sometimes is the one to calm them down, but it just shows how far he’s come. He’s truly a beautiful man.

A big message, and perhaps the main one, was the fact that people draw their swords way too quickly, and don’t talk things out. It’s easy to resort to violence instead of trying to reason with others. Other characters on the farm had these traits, such as Olmar and Thorgil. Not everyone understands Thorfinn’s ideals right away, as they might seem laughable in a world like theirs, where people pillage and set fire to villages almost every day. Slowly and surely, the people understand, and get inspired by the kindness of Thorfinn, but not everyone comes around, although everyone can have the capacity to change. The contrasting ideals of what it means to be a “true warrior” will be a subject of debate always, in this anime, and in our real world. Is it someone who is physically strong, and fights with no mercy toward one’s enemies, or is it someone who has the wisdom and adaptability to prevent the conflict from ever happening to save lives? The different characters in this anime are on both sides of this spectrum, and I love how neither side backs down on their ideals. When such ideals clash, conflict will still unfortunately ensue, and it’s easy to just say that conflict is a part of life, that it’s unavoidable, but with that said, should we give up and not try to stop it, just accepting it? As Thorfinn said, “Anger begets more anger, it just results in deaths, one after another.”

All of these themes culminate in a very gripping story on Ketil’s farm, filled with very heavy episodes, raw emotion, and pure brutality on the battlefield. The violence was gruesome, with limbs lying on the ground, blood spilling everywhere, and I love how the production staff didn’t hold back in that regard. The raw emotion resulted in many painful times for the characters and for us viewers, but they don’t rely on sob stories and massive melodrama to convey such emotion, but rather, it just shows us how unlucky some people are, especially the slaves. Snake said a very interesting thing,""They say inferior people can't help but become slaves. That it's where they belong. But I don't think so. Slaves were just unlucky. That is all. If you and I had been unlucky, we might've ended up as slaves, too."" 

The animation was overall quite solid, though there were some episodes with rather limited movement and a few stiff looking bits of animation here and there. That would be my one nitpick, in that it wasn’t perfectly polished, but no production can be perfect, especially in these times where the production schedules aren’t the most healthy, especially from MAPPA taking on so many projects at once. There are also some scenes that feel a bit dragged to pad the episode time, but it didn’t bother me too much. That said, the background art was incredibly immaculate, especially in the important moments, to really convey the emotional weight of certain scenes. Props to director Shuhei Yabuta for doing a great job, along with the rest of the production team.

The soundtrack was also exemplary in making emotional scenes hit that much harder, with the somber piano tracks, as well as even a choir, and fitting music in more uplifting moments as well. Without this beautiful music, I wouldn’t have felt nearly as emotional as I did in some of the scenes, to the point of crying. The two openings and two endings were also quite solid, with providing the necessary hype in the openings, and the more quiet, emotional side of things from the endings.

All in all, this was most definitely my favourite anime I’ve watched this year without a shadow of a doubt, and one of the most beautiful, anime I watched ever. Truly transcendent material. It’s an exquisite story about mental and moral dilemmas that plague the world, and especially Thorfinn. It’s a tale of maturity for him, from a person driven by revenge and hatred, to a person driven by love and kindness. It was all about letting go of hate, and finding out what it means to live, to create a utopia that makes others want to live, and not resort to death as a salvation from an unforgiving, savage world. He’s well on his way to doing that.

And as a final message, the next time you encounter a fan complaining about the lack of action, or preaches their favourite shounen like the Bible, don’t make them your enemy, just say, “I have no enemies.”

97938,"So, I watched 74 episodes so far, I was realizing more and more how this series kind of irritates me for certain reasons.

Firstly, Boruto really annoys me and not just because of what happened in the beginning when he didn't respect or understood his dad, Naruto. I understood the reasons for that. I think it's how they were developing his character. He's cocky and unruly (I know that's a bit harsh to say, but that's how I feel right now). The reason for this is how he doesn't think of the consequences of his actions like time of the chunin exams when he used the ninja tools fully aware that he was cheating and also getting into situations that could have got him killed, but that plot armor protecting him. The recent one when he tries to find Mitsuki fully aware that the Hokage (Naruto) issued an order that anyone who leaves the village is going to classified as a rogue ninja. When Naruto was chasing Sasuke he at least had permission to do so as a mission to bring him back. Boruto doesn't get punished at all from these decisions even though he should have been.

And this brings me into my other reason, Nostalgia. Naruto chases Sasuke and Boruto chases Mitsuki. Like Father, like Son. Because its essentially a sequel of NARUTO (might as well say remake at this point), I can't help but compare it to the previous season. I keep wanting to see more the old characters again and see them getting some action. While it's a peaceful time, I don't think Boruto and the rest of the new generation are going to be stronger than the old ones because the harsh training they used to have. You have to had noticed that the chunin exams were a joke compared to the previous ones. Genins risk their lives in those exams and this one didn't have an epic tournament arc at all since the only one who seemed to be close to the strength from back then was Gaara's son. They also tried to do similar scenes that happened in Naruto at the end too. And the major upset was how they tried to fit Boruto in the fight with Momoshiki, who wasn't even as strong as Kaguya. Sasuke probably noticed Boruto's special ability to teleport the rasengan, but that wasn't the real reason he would bring him to the fight. Think about it, why would you bring a 'genin' to fight a powerful foe like that and they also purposely lessen Naruto's power at the time so they could find a way to give Boruto some recognition. It's his show now, not this dad's. Not trying to say it was a bad idea, but if Sasuke had said he had planned on Boruto's ability to defeat the enemy then it was going to be a great strategy and reason to bring him, but he didn't.

There's a bit more, but those are the two main reasons. It's hard to not compare Boruto to Naruto. It feels like I'm trying to find the same sensation of Naruto from Boruto which lessens my enjoyment even though I try not to. So, I decided to stop watching for the time being or until he becomes a teen when the story furthers on and things changed."
145545,"The title of this show is very misleading. I thought this school was for “elite students”, but instead, we had 4 classes of bozos participating in Among Us tests and school festivals. I’m not 14 anymore, so this isn’t as deep as I thought Season 1 was. After I finished Season 1 a few years ago, I was convinced that this was the smartest show ever with the best plot twists and the best protagonist in Ayanokouji, but now that I’m older, my views have changed.

That said, as an anime-only for this show, I still found Season 1 much better than Season 2, in basically every way. The story for Season 2 was quite boring, with events that felt very dry. The characters weren’t nearly as good as Season 1, because it seemed like everyone’s IQ except for Ayanokouji declined so much, and I questioned some of their decisions in the story. I’m sure that some of you have seen the bad animation frames posted on MAL and on social media as well, so the production was quite messy at times. The OST was nothing compared to Season 1, which I loved. Nothing felt as well done as Season 1, and save for some cheap enjoyment and satisfaction, this was quite the disappointing season.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 11.5/25

The story felt quite un-psychological this season. Last season, at least the focus was on studying, and the point system, while this season, the plot material felt very dry, and the point system felt very insignificant. All the activities were built on these overly complex rules that was dumped on us all at once, and that’s never really enjoyable for the viewer. There are better ways to get us to think instead of thinking of rules all the time. It’s really the wrong way of being thought-provoking. The character drama felt very dry as well, as some of the backstories were very surface level. Perhaps this was the product of a rushed series, nothing really felt fleshed out enough to be interesting.

ART: 7/10

A downgrade from Season 1, which would be expected given the amount of episodes that Studio Lerche outsourced to other studios. It got better towards the end though.

MUSIC: 8.5/10

Also a downgrade from Season 1, which had quite the OST. There wasn’t a whole lot of stand out music in this season, other than the OP and ED, which I enjoyed a ton.

CHARACTERS: 8.5/20

The character personalities in this show are rather blank, and with how rushed the show was, they weren’t fleshed out enough. There were a few characters that had rather awkward and out of place interactions this season, such as Sakayanagi and Katsuragi from Class A. They just showed up with not much build up, which was a bit awkward (perhaps a few skipped LN parts?).

The biggest problem however, is that in a school for “elites”, how much the intelligence of the characters dropped this season compared to the last. Horikita for example, being the top of Class D, fell into obvious traps, which was so uncharacteristic of her character. Ryuuen as well, while being an extremely violent person, didn’t seem like the dumbest person out there, but as a villain, he wasn’t that good. It seemed like he knew who the mastermind of Class D was, but then he didn’t know? That was quite disappointing.

Now, I’ll also talk about the fan favourites, Karuizawa and Ayanokouji. Karuizawa in Season 1 felt like a lazy, spoiled girl who mindlessly spent her points on unimportant things, and fell off my radar real early. In this season, she works with Ayanokouji in the hope of defeating other classes. She has a bunch of secrets in her past, which I wished they fleshed out more. The romance between her and Ayanokouji feels somewhat rushed as well, since there isn’t much of a key reason for her to love someone, apart from getting protection.

Ayanokouji is still a good character for the most part, as he creates most of the satisfying moments in the show. His character doesn’t change much, and that’s unfortunately a bit of disappointment. He’s probably the only reason this show is still watchable.

ENJOYMENT: 11/15

With all my criticism, I still enjoyed this show, because the payoffs were quite satisfying, and who doesn’t like seeing Ayanokouji destroying everyone he meets?

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 10.5/20

For whatever this show was trying to do, they execute everything decently, but with the show being rushed the way it was, the psychological factor of the show was not up to par, and felt very surface level. The violence and the romance, while not being the main focus of this season, felt better executed than the mind games to be honest.

OVERALL: 57/100

Just comparatively blander in every single way compared to Season 1. It only felt satisfying to watch Ayanokouji mentally and physically destroy people who opposed him, but in the end, it just felt like everything could have been done much better, if the season had more episodes. Whatever Season 3 brings next year, I hope Studio Lerche learn from their shortcomings from this season."
20727,"(Disclaimer: I will cover both seasons of Kekkai Sensen in this review, but I won't go into spoilers at all, except for maybe in the characters section.)
I had fun with Kekkai Sensen. It may have taken me weeks to finish 24 episodes and two ovas, but I had a pretty good time. However, I can't ignore the fact that it really polarized me overall. Sure, I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of times where I literally groaned and struggled through another seemingly pointless episode. These downs were what made me take nearly a month and a half to actually finish Kekkai Sensen, even though I'll say that it was a pretty good show.

You can't talk about Kekkai Sensen without talking about how beautifully and fluidly it was animated and how banging the soundtrack was, especially season one's. For the animation, the fight scenes are undoubtedly some of the best in anime, the way that each character has their own fighting style and applications create for some impressive sequences. Even if the character models weren't drawn immaculately all the time, you could always count on the animation of each episode to impress.

Before I go down the rabbit hole that is the soundtrack, I want to make a minor note about the voice acting, especially the dub being fantastic. It was always an epic moment when characters like Steven or Klaus went in for their final moves and suddenly started spewing their the names of their finisher in another language. Anyway, just wanted to show some appreciation for great voice acting.

Now, the soundtrack. I don't how I'm going to say more than, ""It's so good."" To be honest, it may be one of the best soundtracks in anime, if only for the fact that it's so varied and fitting to its setting. Every insert song or instrumental piece fits into the jazzy, urban atmosphere that Hellsalem's Lot exudes. However, nothing in the first 23 episodes could prepare me for getting blindsided in the feels by the best song to come from the soundtrack. Honestly, if I was more fickle, I'd raise my score for Kekkai Sensen by 5 to 10 points for Tortoise Knight alone, but instead of talking more about it, I'll just link it here:
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2u67JDNTEQ)

Favorite Character: Mary Macbeth (White)
img()

I mean, let's be honest, the only character challenging her for this spot is Chain. The thing about White though, is that she really provided Leo with interesting interaction outside of his work with Libra, which was a nice break from the chaos of Hellsalem's Lot. The first season really needed White to help provide you with more of a personal connection with Leo, who honestly, I thought was pretty useless most of the time. But around White, you couldn't help but cheer for him to get the girl, because their interactions were so damn cute.

This is the part where, I take a turn from my radiantly positive attitude. I mentioned earlier that I was extremely polarized by Kekkai Sensen. Most of that polarization is from the episodic nature, I think. It's so hard to binge out Kekkai Sensen, because it feels like there's no thread tying the world together. Instead, every episode is a single story, making the good episodes feel really fulfilling, but making the bad ones excruciating. I don't think this issue was helped by the fact that I wasn't interested in Zapp very much, and he dominated many of season one's episodes, which set the tone for me to watch the series. In fact, I can't say that I loved many of the simple, one-off episodes that dominate the series. There were a few that I really enjoyed, like Gilbert and Chain's episodes in season 2, the hospital episode, and the Aligula episode in season 1. There are a couple more that I at least was pleased with, but these few were the standout one-offs to me. I think a lot of the episodes that didn't impress me simply didn't have a good focal character, which made me bored of them from the beginning. A lot of this may be just my taste, but I feel if someone doesn't like all the characters, you're going to struggle through certain episodes.

Kekkai Sensen's greatest strength is loosely tied to my complaints too. See? Polarizing. Anyway, Kekkai Sensen's greatest strength lies in its world. Enter Hellsalem's Lot, perhaps the greatest world in anime:
img()

What makes Hellsalem's Lot so special? It's simple: the city is it's own character. Kekkai Sensen simply wouldn't be the same without the craziness of the city that they never fail to show us with each episode. We think we've seen the most unbelievable thing the city can throw at us, then it turns around and throws something else at us. The thing is, the city provides us with a sort of continuity that we take for granted after living in the city with the characters for a little while. It becomes the norm for us too, which is what makes it so special. All these crazy one-off episodes are basically created at complete freedom, because of how much room to maneuver the setting provides the writers. Honestly, it's really impressive. I think the fact that each and every citizen, alien or human, is drawn really helps immerse us even more in the world. We see the weirdness, instead of get told how weird Hellsalem's Lot is.

I find it hard to actually criticize Kekkai Sensen, because I realize how well it pulled me into the setting now that I've written all of this. In fact, I think all it would take to love Kekkai Sensen is more of an overarching rhyme or reason to the story. It gets touched on here and there, but mostly gets ignored. I guess Michella doesn't really matter that much after all. I kid, but it would be nice to see some progression to the plot behind Leo's eyes and her blindness. I'm probably asking for Kekkai Sensen to become something that it isn't though, so I'll be happy to be a fan of what it is, rather than what I think it should be."

If you can’t tell by my stupid username, I’m a pretty big fan of these cartoons. However, there are some localized quirks and tropes that would turn potential weeblets from giving anime a shot. How do I introduce friends to this cool catalogue of shows without them getting too big of a shock to their system and distancing themselves from me? Unless you grew up watching Pokémon or a “Big 3” show, I wouldn’t know many titles that would make for a good entry point into the medium. But ask me that same question today and there will be one name, right on the tip of my tongue. Spoiler-free coverage of both halves of the show, skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you prefer to go in blind.

as he dangles off the Hollywood Sign, tethered by his feet. Such an opening is probably one of the more memorable ones I’ve seen recently, yet that’s not even the most ambitious of this story’s intentions. Director Hiro Kaburagi previously demonstrated his Western sensibilities with 91 Days. But with GP, he trades that grimy noir tale for a homage to heist films. He’s playing a wildly different ball game, like a traveling team playing Away at the home of a foreign sport. There’s no falling back on familiar shounen tropes or localized references; the show is decidedly a Western, and an underdog at that. Yet, GP punches far above its weight and proves itself more-than-capable to sit right up there with the very best in the genre. Against insurmountable odds, not unlike those Laurent and his crew face, GP cooks a perfect plan for success rooted in style and confidence.

 img100%()  


As to be expected with your caper story, the show has tricks and twists aplenty. Laurent’s Band of Merry Men (and Laughing Ladies) take money from the rich by turning their own weapons against them. With millions of dollars on the line, there is no room for error; 

>One mistake and you’re gone.

 img100%() 


I’ll leave to your imagination the wacky plays our misfits come up with, as it’s an absolute joy to discover the many ways GP pulls the rug out from under you. Really respectable is how the show actually explains the secrets behind the many illusions, while adhering to the tropes it commits itself to and common sense. Shows along a similar vein, like No Game No Life for example, do this only when its convenient (still liked it quite a lot, DW.) GP plays by the rules but still carries a plethora of tricks up its sleeve. What’s fun is that on the off-chance you see the outcome a mile away, putting two-and-two together is still an engaging exercise likely to leave you with a goofy grin on your face.

 img100%() 


The show teeters on a tight-rope walk between the improvised and the calculated. A frantic energy dominates adrenaline-pumping action, ranging from car chases to dogfights. But the show never gets distracted with insane antics, instead meticulously building towards cathartic climaxes that cumulate in further excitement. There’s hardly a dull moment throughout the show, with a measured momentum that few stories can effectively match. Each episode provides a substantial sense of progression that I’d be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. GP achieves this with its brilliant use of parallels, foreshadowing and motifs. Elements throughout the show can both hint at how the various cons will work, while depicting a deeper picture of our characters – a story nested within a story. Be it the small capsule toys Makoto picks up or the fiendish criminals Laurent’s Merry Men (and Laughing Ladies) encounter, every detail in the plot says something about the direction our story is headed. As such almost all the scenes feel weighty and purposeful in a way, as if every step is going according to keikaku.

 img100%() 


The music is memorable stuff. Its OP is the second coming of TANK!, and few shows can brag about the great Freddy-frickin’-Mercury name-dropping the series title as their ending theme. Also notable are the specific music choices for each arc, which fit nicely^ as the story progresses. GP art style is easy on the eyes while showing more love for the genres it emulates. The show doesn’t shoot for hyper-realistic composition or lighting effects, choosing instead to derive its distinct look from clear straight lines and a diverse color palette. Neon-like backgrounds hammer home the vibrant pulp aesthetic its going for, and it makes sense. GP isn’t the most grounded of shows, with its globe-trotting escapades and zany twists. Such an off-kilter atmosphere revels in that playful tone and looks fantastic. GP maintains its creative liberties while being flexible in its approach;

""L.A. Connection"" introduces Makato Edamura, the self-proclaimed best conman in all of Japan, as he steps into the City of Dreams – and the world of crime. In ""Singapore Sky"" Abby, the de facto muscle of the crew, risks everything the clouds and is asked why she welcomes danger with open arms. ""Snow of London"" sees the sophisticated Cynthia return to the titular town and the love she left behind. GP’s episodic storytelling is takes on different appearances as a crafty chameleon would, with each arc as tightly-constructed as the cons themselves. It’s not dissimilar to the “Watanabe” approach, with the key difference being that Bebop and Champloo prefer to go all-in with its stylistic influences. GP may not display that level of versatility but balances that out by giving its themes and characters just enough room to grow. The series places a great deal of narrative confidence in its confidence men/women, compounding the stakes of their elaborate high-wire acts.

 img100%() 


“Wizard of Far East” was both the strongest arc in some aspects and the weakest in others. The few ""cons"" (pardon the pun) throughout the series rear their head in its last leg. It’s the story arc that stretches believability the most and is built around the uncomfortable recurring gag of Makoto getting manipulated by his friends. But although GP looks the closest its ever been to falling completely off the rails, it’s in these same conditions where the series performs its best. One might say the show takes on a “fake it ‘till you make it” attitude, but isn’t that exactly how cons are meant to work? The series as a whole is the master plan, and we’re its  dumbfounded marks. GP’s ambition lies not just in scamming rich crooks, but in playing tricks on the audience as well. Every arc strives to surprise, and this last arc is more of the shocking same. The schemes, more intricate than we’ve ever seen; the stakes, as high as ever; the buildup, deliberately paying off thematic threads introduced within the arc and revisiting story beats from prior cases; the presentation, well-handled, the central conflict; dark and compelling – all culminating in an explosive conclusion, an Abby-esque middle finger to anybody expecting any less.

 img100%(v) 


Great Pretender is masterful in execution. With the chips stacked against it, GP effortlessly translates Western story conventions over to anime in convincing fashion. A pastiche of the caper pulled off with panache, GP pays faithful homage to Hollywood. The team behind the project make their love for these Westerns known, while creating a fantastic piece of fiction of their own. Expect countless surprises and much more in store; effective storytelling, themes and pacing make this 2020 offering a must-watch. GP, my hands are up. You got me. Oh yes… 9/10


-	^Exception being the rap track reused for Case 1. WIT just couldn’t get the rap right, it was just cringe that I was sad to revisit when they replayed it in Case 4.
-	I expected something more complex for the final act, like pitting Makoto against Laurent. I think the show had time to get to that point, given that Laurent went a step too far by forcing Makoto to literally fall in his father’s footsteps. The direction they went with instead doesn’t ask too many questions about its morality, again speaking to the “fake it ‘till you make it” writing. It sure worked on me though, heh.

-	I can attest that no event as the “Pathfinder Air-race” will ever take place in a place as conservative as Singapore. I’d be surprised to find anyone crazy enough to sign off on the idea of having planes zooming so low above the ground and dangerously close to tourist attractions and infrastructure. Also, there were like 20 more “Supertrees” in the show than in real life, that scene with the planes weaving around that fake forest had me laughing the first time I saw it. Other than that, props for nailing the look of the city, cool stuff!

-	In “Snow of London,” Cynthia’s tin box is labelled “Farrah’s Toffee.” James Coleman, the art appraiser, manipulates a wealthy lady named Farrah Brown into building up his private art collection. In short, it is reasonable to infer that our boi James literally had a sugar mommy.
-	Let’s talk about the English: I know y’all found it pretty grating in the pilot episode, but I thought it was a rather neat concept. It got overbearing in “Wizards” though, all the linguistic switch-ups were embarrassing at times. I will say they got the Chinese VAs spot-on, really captured that “Hong Kong police show” vibe.

-	BEST GIRL: Cynthia. Cyn-thee-UH. Plenty of idiots in the show give her flak for being an “old hag” but she’s SMOKIN’. Also, her role in “Snow of London” made the Case closely edge out the other arcs as my favorite throughout GP (cheesy pick, I know.)

141391,"The night is a very unexplored landscape for many of us. Some of us perceive it as dangerous and scary, and some others perceive it as a time to party, to let themselves go, and for most of us, we’re probably fast asleep. I’m sure a lot of you have experienced a time in life when you just didn’t want to fall asleep, perhaps because you weren’t satisfied with what you achieved in the day, or you feared what tomorrow will bring, but rest assured, in Call of the Night, the night is viewed as a beautiful time, and a time to release all inhibitions, a time to have the time of your life, so dream on, and imagine yourself in the wonderful dreamscape!

Tomoyuki Itamura, the director of the highly acclaimed Monogatari Series, and the Case Study of Vanitas, is back again for yet another vampire themed anime, and what a job he did! The background composition looked absolutely immaculate, to the point where I have those purple skies as my phone wallpaper. The art direction really evokes a sense of imagination, as it allows us to imagine how alluring the night can look, and combined with great chill music from Creepy Nuts, the atmosphere is quite perfect for this anime.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 19.8/25

The story starts off relatively slowly, focusing on Kou Yamori, a boy who was quite despondent about his everyday life. He struggles to grasp the concept of love, and stops going to school altogether one day. Plagued with insomnia, he ventures out into the dark of night, and one night, he encounters a very peculiar girl called Nazuna Nanakusa, who has quite the belief about how people can’t rest until they release their inhibitions. Nazuna helps Kou out with his insomnia, and invites her over to her place, where she reveals herself to be a vampire! Having experienced this incredible night, Kou finds himself wanting to be in the night all the time, so he wants to become a vampire, but turns out, you gotta fall in love with a vampire to become one!

The story itself isn’t strong at the start admittedly, as many episodes were focused on the bonding between Nazuna and Kou, along with other characters as well, some of whom that eventually find out about their relationship.

Where it turned for me, in terms of enjoyment, was the fact that vampires, however attractive they look, and whatever fun it seems like they’re having, there’s a darker side to everything, and becoming a vampire isn’t the best thing ever to happen to a person. Aside from that, there are also a number of excellent themes this show tackles, such as how romance and friendships work, the sickness of the human condition, and every human’s inner narcissism, in that humans and vampires alike want to be liked, and paid attention to.

A quick comment about the fan service now, because I know that’s what a lot of you will criticize. The non-vampire fan service is a bit much, but the fan service of vampires I think was quite necessary for the plot, to emphasize the beauty of them, and when we learn about the other sides of vampires, it really makes you think how such beautiful creatures can have such difficult lives too.

ART: 9.8/10

The art is really quite spectacular, and definitely the thing that stands out the most. You can really see the experience of the director, and some sequences look as brilliant as some scenes in Monogatari, which is really saying something. The nighttime ambience is just done so well.

MUSIC: 9.5/10

Also amazing, as the OP and ED are excellent both visually and musically, as well as the excellent soundtrack by Creepy Nuts. Great vibes, and it fits so perfectly with the nighttime ambience, heck, it even adds to the ambience.

CHARACTERS: 19/20

Not only are the characters so fun to watch, their voice actors really do a great job. Nazuna’s such a fun character, really nailing the comedic aspects and also her badassery. Considering her voice actor, Sora Amamiya, voiced Chizuru from Rent-a-Girlfriend, and Nazuna, really goes to show how good her range is, and what different roles she can play. Now our other main character, Kou, is honestly a severely underrated character. From being quite the clueless and despondent guy at the beginning, to being able to stand up for others, and voice his opinions without holding back is great development, plus he was even able to gain some empathy for others. Even for his age, he feels oddly mature in a way, even though he is naive and misguided for sure, especially for skipping school as much as he does. One more character worthy of so much praise is Anko Uguisu, as her voice actor Miyuki Sawashiro really nails her character so well. The comedic aspects and the intimidating aspects of her character were done to perfection, and Sawashiro’s performance was incredible.

ENJOYMENT: 14.7/15

I enjoyed this a ton, with the production and the characters, really impressive stuff.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 18.5/20

With the ambience of the nighttime, the imaginative theme of the night is really done to near perfection, while Nazuna and the other vampires create a sense of playfulness and have such a jovial tone to them. When the story picks up, the themes of danger and intimidation are also done with great care. Just such thematic brilliance, and while there are slight jarring tonal shifts at times, I never found that a glaring problem.

OVERALL: 91.3/100

Probably one of the best non-sequel series of the year, as it creates such an immaculate atmosphere, and also featured some great characters and themes as well. Brilliant visual direction, and an engaging story near the end. This is a series I would wholeheartedly recommend, as it’s quite the easy watch. The night is short, walk on boys and girls!"
437,"Perfect Blue is the Directorial film debut of the late Satoshi Kon, and the film that rightfully put him on the map. It is a psychological thriller about idol-turned-actress Mima Kirigoe (also known as ""Mimarin""), following her descent into paranoia as the stress of an image change and a series of stalkings and murders slowly cause her to become disconnected from reality.

The film shows its strengths as early as the opening moments, where it juxtaposes scenes of Mima performing with the idol group CHAM and scenes of Mima living life as an ordinary girl, switching between the two with match cuts. It's able to immediately establish two things Kon has been known for: his top-notch editing style and his focus on blurring the line between perception versus reality. In Perfect Blue, the ""perception versus reality"" takes the form of the person versus the persona, the actor versus the character, the world versus the stage.

The plot of Perfect Blue kicks off when Mima quits CHAM to pursue opportunities in acting, quickly taking on a strong supporting role in the television crime drama Double Bind. However, the Double Bind role sees her playing a darker, more sexually involved character, and Mima's fans from her idol days aren't happy with her change from the more pure and innocent role she played as a pop idol. Among these disgruntled fans is a stalker known only by his screen name, ""Me-Mania."" Mima starts to become troubled as she encounters him more and more frequently, and when threats and murders start to plague the people around Mima who are forcing her into more explicit roles, Mima begins breaking down, seeing a ghostly reflection of her self dressed in her CHAM stage outfit who taunts her and claims to be the ""real Mima."" What follows is a wild ride of not knowing what the hell is actually happening and what's all just ""part of the play,"" so to speak. This is where the story really begins to pick up, but unfortunately, describing it in more detail is both difficult due to the structure of the film, and would also completely spoil the experience. I ask that you just trust me on this and subject yourself to Satoshi Kon's Wild Ride.

Perfect Blue's strength really shines in the visuals and editing. There is, of course, the aforementioned match cuts in the opening, showing that even pop idols live fairly normal lives. There's the constant reflection motifs, which emphasize that perceived identities, despite how much importance we place on them, are mere imitations of the true self. There's the constant abrupt cuts that disorient the audience (and Mima) and force them to question how much of what they just saw was real and how much was imagined. And then there's the fact that it's filled with just flat-out good visuals. In fact, Perfect Blue is so strong on this front that several western films have paid it direct homage, such as Black Swan lifting several themes and crafting similar visuals, or Requiem for a Dream flat-out [recreating the bathtub scream scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0ulBpi2zA). This extends from the opening scene (as has already been mentioned), to the final line, where (light spoiler) !Mima waves off two background character's speculation that she's merely a lookalike with the phrase ""No, I'm real."" However, we see this declaration framed in a rearview mirror, implying that the ""reality"" that Mima speaks of may still be somewhat subjective.!

Perfect Blue is overall just very well-crafted. It's one of those films that you can watch again and again and gain something new from each time, which in my opinion, is the mark of a great film. However, I understand that there are a few flaws, and while, in my opinion, they're excusable and arguably necessary, I can see how others may disagree. First of all, it pulls no punches in the depiction of otaku and idol fans in particular. In a film filled with subtlety, these idol fans, Me-Mania in particular, come across as gross caricatures or plot devices rather than actual characters. The other major issue people may have with the film is that it cheats. When the film begins to mess with the audience's perception of what's happening, it is not above outright lying or changing facts to cause viewers to question what's real. While this does reflect Mima's deteriorating mental state, it can feel a bit unfair, and on repeated viewings it's easy to look at certain scenes and say ""okay, well this is just outright trying to mislead me."" I can't give it a perfect score out of 100 because of that, but since all media is inherently subjective, I think this is the closest I can possibly get.

Despite those minor flaws, I still think that Perfect Blue is a film that's about as, well, ""perfect"" as you can get. If you're even remotely interested in postmodern works that lean on the fourth wall, themes that delve into identity, or just the thriller genre in general, Perfect Blue is a film I think you'll absolutely love. I give the film the highest of recommendations. 5 Stars."
223,"Dragon Ball, where do I even start with this iconic show. Well, I guess I'll take it in a part by part evaluation. Personally, I absolutely love this show maybe this is due to me watching an overflow of shows with heavy themes or stuff that tries to take itself to seriously but Dragon Ball has none of that. It's just about Goku and his adventures to get stronger, make friends, and learn how to live and iteract with other humans and I think that it has a lot of charm because of that.

Story:

This story follows our protagonist Goku as he travels with Bulma to (most of the time) find the Dragon Balls. Now, while Goku himself isn't interested in the Dragon Balls many events happen that entice him to chase them, examples being Uppa's father's death and Krillin's death. It's not the most insanely in depth or most thought provoking story but it's very easy to understand and is a joy to watch.

Characters:
I think this is arguably Dragon Ball's strongest point with many iconic characters such as Goku, Yamcha, Krillin, Master Roshi, etc... All these characters and their character interactions are what really make the show as great as it is. Goku and Krillin have one of my favorite dynamics in anime as it's so simple being two kids who are just friends and I think there's really something to appreciate there. All these characters have so much charm, and if these characters weren't as great as they are this show would be infinitely worse.

Art:
I think the art here was great for its time and still holds up pretty well today. However, there's a ton of lights flashing which made me cover my eyes a lot more than I'd like to. Nothing much to say here but I really like the art style and I think it fits the show very well.

Pacing:
Here's where I think this show could've been a lot better. I read the manga before watching this show and I have to say, the manga is one thousand times better in terms of pacing, something that you can read in fifteen minutes in the manga takes 5 episodes in the show. I understand that they add more details and everything but I really believe that it's way to stretched out for it's own good.

Conclusion:
In a time where all shows need to have an incredibly profound message to appeal to the public Dragon Ball shines with it's simple story, great characters and art. The thing that's holding the show back for me is the pacing and this is where it falls behind the manga. I think if the pacing was better I could bump the score up more, but as it is I'm going to stick with my score.

Apparently this review isn't long enough?"
4181,"Clannad and Afterstory alike are both masterpieces by Visual Arts Key, an emotional Slice Of Life/Drama that goes from mostly comedy and minimal drama in the first season, to drying out tear ducts in the second season.

Im going to review both the original series and Afterstory In this review 


Starting off with the Original Series, which is a mixture of mostly comedy and some drama nearing the end of the season.
Throughout the series, we follow Tomoya Okazaki and his daily school life, and his goal to help Nagisa complete her dream of of reviving the drama club. 


Starting off with a character analysis, Clannad has a wide variety of characters with various personas, the violent girls, the shy one, the silent bookworm, and of course the moe. 

Starting off with Kyou, twin sister of Ryou, she is my personal second favourite, I enjoy her violent attitude towards Sunohara and Tomoya, such as throwing dictionaries at then, and of course the casual insults towards both, despite having a secret crush on Tomoya, she still throws casual remarks at him. 

Next up is twin sister of Kyou, Ryou, she is the shy type, doesn't socialize much, I see her as a total opposite to Kyou, though we didn't get to see much of her, in neither the original or Afterstory, I can't say much about her, though I do enjoy her in the ""Another World: Kyou Chapter"" Episode, how she acts towards Tomoya in their relationship is quite heart warming. 

Let's talk Nagisa now, our main character from the girls throughout the series, now I can't really decide on her personality to be honest, in a way, she is a tad bit dumb, but personally I give Fuko the moe personality (more on her later of course), I personally think she is a mixture of being shy, dumb, curious, and possibly a bit of dream chaser in there. All in all, I can't decide on what her personality is.
Personality aside, as a character I enjoy her, when Tomoya bullies someone, or mock someone, Nagisa will proceed to critique him one way or another, I'm also fond of her ahoge.

Now our favourite Starfish enthusiast, Fuko, aka Fu-chan, Im a big fan of characters with dumb personalities such as her. During her arc she is Tomoya's primary target when it comes to pranks, and she often does fall victim to them.
In return though, she manages to bully Sunohara, many times, such as making her fanclub come after him, great scene, and of course, hitting his face with a starfish many times. Her disappearing and everyone forgetting her eventually was pretty sad though, but that's only the beginning of Clannad's emotional story.

Onto our silent bookworm, Kotomi is an interesting character, when we first meet her, I thought of her as the weird girl, but as we get to know her, I grow pretty fond of her, she's quite cute, and her silent personality is something im fond of, despite usually not really paying attention to these types of personalities. Eventually we learn her past, which I found pretty surprising, I did not expect this girl, who is always seen as happy with her books, and being smart, to have had a traumatizing childhood, I did not get much of an emotional impact here, but it was nonetheless a blow to the heart, seeing this happy smart girl, with a traumatizing past.

Now my personal favourite girl, Tomoyo, she has many similarities with Kyou, she is also violent, but in a different way, Kyou attacks whenever she feels like she must, Tomoyo will only attack when either A; Threatened or B; Sunohara is being annoying. She also appears to be much more athletic than Kyou, though I can't know for sure. Her headband is one of my favourite parts of her, don't know why, but I'm quite fond of headbands, Her hair and handband is probably what win her over Kyou for me personally.

Let's move onto our favourite comedian, Sunohara, who is the bringer of most of the comedy in the original series, without him, the comedy would have been much different than it is, I love his fight scenes with Tomoyo, and the other times he gets beat up by either Fuko or Misae.
Tomoya also enjoys picking on him for pranks, and being the dumbass he is, he falls for them.

Character analysis over, let's go over Clannad's other strong points.


Clannad's Soundtracks is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, unsurprising coming from Key, beautiful songs that hit you right in the feels after watching the anime, and nonetheless wonderful piano songs...

Roaring Tides

Roaring Tides II

Ushio
youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJNzehpxAmY)


As mentioned in the character analysis, our characters produce lots of comedy, all of them, I can't help but laugh whenever Sunohara gets beat up, or when Fuko falls victim to one of Tomoya's prank, or Nagisa getting drunk, and plenty more. 

The character arcs were personal favourites of mine, though I cannot be 100% credible since I have not read the visual novel ( I have it installed, but Im reading Little Busters! at the moment), whether or not they were adapted well is not my point here, but the arcs were surprising, especially Fukos and Kotomi's, as mentioned above again, Kotomi's took me surprise by having such a traumatizing childhood, despite looking happy as ever usually.

We end off Clannad with Nagisa and Tomoya confessing to each other, and an extra episode showing what they do during their summer break, leaving off on a good note.

We start off Afterstory with our characters returning to school, and the anime carries on it's comedic part of itself, at least, for the next few episodes, nothing unusual compared to the original anime, a baseball game, Sunohara getting beat up, just the usual.

Nearing the end of the school year, and the end of school for the Seniors, except for Nagisa, who unfortunately, catches yet another fever, which leads her to miss many more days of school, which again, causes her to repeat her senior year once more. 

Tomoya graduates, but he does not leave Nagisa behind, he ends up living with her for a bit longer at her home.

Up next comes an interesting part of the story, which Is personally, one of my favourite parts of Clannad, what some people call, ""The Work Arc"".
This is when Tomoya ends up getting a job and starts working with Yoshino as an electrician, this portion of the story is interesting to me because the anime begins to shift away from the ""Slice of Life"" part of it, It is no longer the usual going to school everyday.
This part of the story shows Tomoya growing into his adulthood, with a bad school record, bad terms with his father, and pretty much no money.
He manages to become an electrician with Yoshino, which ends up paying pretty decently, however Tomoya does not adapt easily to this new job, It's a complex job and becomes even harder with his damaged shoulder, in the end, he manages to get through with it, and adapt to his new environment. 

Fast forwarding, Tomoya ends up buying his own decent sized apartment, he lives with himself for a few weeks, with Sanae and Nagisa visiting him on a daily basis to help him get used to the new apartment.

Many weeks later, Nagisa catches yet another cold nearing her graduation, luckily, it was not as early as the previous ones, so she manages to finally pass her senior year.
She graduates, though, unable to attend the ceremony due to her sickness.

Nagisa ends up moving in with Tomoya as they get married and all of the main cast ends up hosting a private graduation ceremony for Nagisa.

For the next few episodes, the anime mostly stays comedic, mostly with gags between Akio and Tomoya, or simply the family all-together, 2 of my favourite moments was when Akio disguises himself as a rapper to go see Nagisa at work as a waitress, and of course Nagisa getting drunk, unforgettable moments.

Fast forwarding a few episodes, Nagisa is now pregnant with Ushio, and we start to lose comedy as the anime starts to shift over to a much more serious tone, of course, we get a gag here and there, but not as much as the episodes beforehand. 

Things change up a bit, Tomoya  cuts hours from his job to support Nagisa, things aren't looking great but nothing to worrisome either.
Nagisa ends up wanting to do an at home birth, although reluctantly, Tomoya accepts Nagisa's wish.


It is the day of Ushio's birth, everyone is there, Tomoya, Sanae, Akio, and the midwife (Forgot her name).
Tomoya does everything he can to support Nagisa during birth, moments later, Ushio is born, yet, In a few seconds, while holding her hand, Nagisa, dies at the end of her birth.

Tomoya falls into depression, giving Ushio to Akio and Sanae for 5 years, and mostly staying away from Ushio for the most part.

Sanae and Akio end up managing to get Tomoya to spend time with Ushio, he does realize what they are doing but nonetheless he ends up doing so anyway.

Tomoya, enjoys his time with Ushio, managing to spend his time with Ushio properly, like a father and daughter should.


this part is something I really enjoy, It sends a positive message to the audience.
Tomoya finds his grandmother, mother of his father, who Tomoya has been on bad terms with for several years.
His grandmother introduces herself and explains everything to Tomoya about his father, why he is how he is, how he used what little money he had to make Tomoya happy as a child, how he struggled after his wife's death, comparable to how Tomoya is with Ushio.

Tomoya realizes this, he realized how his father did everything he could to make Tomoya happy, but how he struggled due to his Wife's death, which hit him hard, and he understands why his father is in the position he is today.

He leaves with Ushio to go see his father, he ends up apologizing to him for all the flak he has given him, and helps him get out of the bad position he is in. 
He gives him a decent amount of money and tells him to go live with his mother, helping him move out of his home which is in quite bad shape. 
This short arc can be a message to a few viewers, who may have had these types of experiences in their life.

Past this, Tomoya ends up taking Ushio to live with him, finally out of his depression. 
The next few episodes allows us to get attached with Ushio as Tomoya and her enjoy their time together since they both had little to no interactions in the past 5 years. 


As winter approaches, it appears Ushio has the same disease that causes her a fever during winter, just as Nagisa did. 
Ushios wants to go on a trip with Tomoya, just as they did when Sanae and Akio set them up to, but Tomoya declines due to her illness and the weather.
Ushio still wants to go on a trip, Tomoya, hesitantly, decides to allow it, and go out for a short walk in the snow, Ushio begins slowing down as they walk, which worries Tomoya, but she Insists that she is perfectly fine.

Few moments later, Tomoya holds Ushio in his arms, and with her last words, ""I love you, daddy"", She dies, In Tomoya's arms...

This is... one of the most depressing moments I've seen in any anime, the only thing I can see beating it is Yuiko Kurugaya's Route from the Little Busters! Visual Novel.

Ushio, we get attached to her throughout the last episodes, yet we lose her only a few episodes later, right in Tomoya's arms... 


Shortly after Ushio's death, we are greeted with the  illusionary  world, It is revealed the girl from this world, Is indeed Ushio, and the garbage doll, is Tomoya.

As Ushio ""dies"" in the illusionary world, the garbage doll as well, Tomoya's wish of, Him, Nagisa, and Ushio living together, with neither dying, is granted, presumably by Ushio herself in the illusionary world. 

A flashback of the first scene of Tomoya meeting Nagisa appears before us, a time reset presumably, Tomoya hesitates to wish to live with Nagisa once more, or to leave her alone and not get involved with her at all.
He chooses the former, he runs to her and hugs her, It appears both of them are silently aware of the time reset during the flashback, since Tomoya hesitates to meet her again, and Nagisa mentions that ""I was worried you chose to not meet me"".

We are then fast forwarded to Ushio's birth, the same events play out, except, Nagisa does not die, she lives past the birth, and Tomoya and her enjoy there life.

What plays out next is one of my favorite endings ever, the music really fits in with whats going on.

We see how Nagisa and Tomoya live out their new life with Ushio, a wonderful, tragic free life.
It is also nice to see how all other characters are doing, we see Kyou doing her teacher stuff, Ryou is a nurse, Sunohara is... failing his driving test? Im not exactly sure whats up with him.
Kotomi is currently studying in the States, Mei is now a highschooler, and we see Tomoyo on a beach, though, unsure what she's up to, and of course, Akio and Sanae doing their usual.

In conclusion, Clannad and Afterstory are Slice of Life/Drama masterpieces, tragic and heartbreaking, yet, in the end, enlightening and heartwarming.
100/100"
130003,"A full season like few before, featuring a large number of top titles like Mob Psycho, My Hero Academia, Chainsaw Man, Bleach and more. Yet in the midst of this mass of shonen, to take (personally) the throne of the season and probably of the year was a musical comedy of girls playing in a band. Bocchi the Rock started out going unnoticed but managed to deservedly conquer its space with a story and a production of very fine workmanship. One could talk for hours about the qualities of this series so I'll try not to be too verbose. 
But first of all…


PLOT
Bocchi the Rock tells the stories of Hitori Gotou, a young girl in her first year of high school who has been battling her social anxiety disorder for years. Hitori discovers that she can become popular with music and she takes up the guitar, becoming a talented musician. Nijika Ijichi bumps into her in a park, begging her to join her band. From here Hitori (who will be nicknamed Bocchi due to her introverted nature) will begin a growth path to overcome her social anxiety.
webm(https://i.imgur.com/3MetraT.mp4)
Bocchi the Rock proves to be an anime particularly focused on comedy; many scenes are in fact centered on a comic representation of Bocchi's anxiety. However, this does not prevent the show from becoming serious and coherent in the appropriate moments. The first quality of this series is in fact the extraordinary ability to alternate comic scenes, serious scenes, important character developments and musical performances very well. Specifically, the development of Bocchi is one of the many strengths; her growth is realistic, perfectly paced so as not to be rushed or static and has allowed so many viewers to relate to her. Hitori embodies (with due comedic proportions) a very relatable social situation, especially for me and this has allowed me to become very attached to her personality.
Apart from the serious side, Bocchi the Rock has certainly managed to increase its popularity due to its incredible quality comedy. The way in which the series manages the funny moments is very impactful, amusing but above all the laughs that flow from its jokes are due in large part to the monstrous technical quality and directorial creativity with which the same gags are shown (but I prefer talk about it in the section reserved for animations).
webm(https://i.imgur.com/C6HiP4L.mp4)

CHARACTERS
The cast certainly represents one of the most solid aspects of the show. Bocchi turns out to be a funny, likeable but above all superbly realistic character. Although her situation is greatly exaggerated for a comic matter, this does not prevent the viewer from seeing himself very much in her and in her difficulties.
To support Bocchi are above all her 3 bandmates:
-Nijika Ijichi (Leader and drummer): Nijika, also commonly called MVP, is the leader of the Kessoku Band and the musical and character guide of the group. She is a very sunny girl, responsible but above all of great support for all the members. In addition to fighting to make her dreams come true, Nijika never disdains to help Bocchi overcome her problems by putting her in front of ever more difficult challenges to help her grow. She is also credited with bringing the passion for music back into Ryo's life and continuously supporting Kita in her progress as a guitarist. Nijika is a girl who is surprisingly easy to get attached to because of her positivity and selflessness.
-Ryo Yamada (bassist): Ryo is definitely the most peculiar and detached member of the group. She too, like Hitori, is a loner but, unlike the protagonist, she is loner by choice. Ryo is a lazy person, not used to talking to others, except when she has to get some money. At the same time, however, she appears to be a person of great principles, especially as regards music, and an excellent senpai for Bocchi who leans on her to be able to give the maximum possible contribution to the band. Ryo's apathy makes her a very easy and fun character to play comedy with.
-Kita Ikuyo (singer and guitarist): Kita is the merriest and most sociable member. She never fails to engage the entire group and keeps it cohesive with her friendliness. Kita, in addition to being Bocchi's pupil as regards the guitar, provides Bocchi herself with considerable moral support to help her socialize and not be seized by fear when she is in the presence of many people. Hidden by her aura of love and hope, Kita is actually a musically insecure person and Nijika never fails to give her input. She also has a crush on Ryo after hearing her busking.

A note of merit should also be given to Kikuri, a drunken bass player and Bocchi's mentor, very eccentric and unconventional but when she enters serious mode she manages to make a great contribution to Bocchi as regards her ability to play in front of many people.
The maximum value that this series assumes from the point of view of the characters is the great ability to manage their interactions. Each member of the group is equally important both musically and narratively. Their characterization is perfect and this allows for a cast of realistic, human and indispensable characters within the work. All the girls give the impression of having a life of their own and do not fall into one of the most classic (non-serious) ""errors"" of the genre: being dependent on the protagonist, living only for the protagonist as if one did not have a life beyond that person.


ART/ANIMATION
Passion and creativity are the key words to define the perfect job done by the CloverWorks staff. The series relies first of all on beautiful character designs and use of colors, which reveal all the cuteness and sympathy of the characters.
The entire show is a feast for the eye with smooth animation and superb character acting. The latter helps to increase the expressiveness of the characters and it's an aspect that is far too underestimated. I think that excelling in this field is now more important than ever, all anime desperately needs this element.
webm(https://i.imgur.com/j0IjSt3.mp4)
In this other clip the character acting shows (even if there were no voices) that it is possible to represent the difference between the personalities of Bocchi and Nijika in this way. Nijika walks upright, moves confidently, and stretches her arms to show things. On the other hand, Bocchi walks with her back hunched over, her arms close to his body in a defensive position and she trembles.
webm(https://i.imgur.com/i5D2Rnp.mp4)
However, the thing that is absolutely the excellence of Bocchi the Rock is its direction. The creativity of this anime is born in this element. Any comic scene is elevated to the nth degree by the infinity of ideas that are put into play to represent those gags: the LSD scenes, the use of clay animation, real videos and photos, the 3D animations, the many style changes. A crazy anime in which the simple touch of Nijika on Bocchi's forehead triggers a tear-jerking scene with very sad music in which Bocchi turns into ash that poisons and causes depression to those who breathe it, or Bocchi's fear of the sports festival represented in 4:3 with a completely different style in which the protagonist is condemned to the stake for not having contributed to the festival.
img300() img300()
img300() img300()
The technical side also enhances all musical scenes. The end result is a series of hilarious and always innovative jokes, the anime never gets boring for all the episodes, any slice-of-life scene is very colorful and transmits positivity, any serious moment is improved by the characters' expressiveness. Bocchi the Rock is a technical masterpiece and in an anime that depends so much on this element, this translates into an emotional masterpiece for many different reactions, laughter, reflections, relaxation, etc.
webm(https://i.imgur.com/OcLoNz9.mp4)

MUSIC
The musical aspect of the anime is obviously another flawless element. I don't want to limit myself to judge the band's songs individually (all bangers) but I would like to focus on 2 elements in particular.
The first is the use of inserts in comedy scenes, just to add an element that only improves the gags. The insert song during the LSD scenes and the one when Bocchi turns into ashes are the most striking example of this element.
The second is the incredible technique and study it takes to pull off a wrong performance like the one in episode 8. The song is flagrantly wrong even to the untrained ear, especially in Nijika's rhythm and Kita's intonation. However, this doesn't seem forced into an unlistenable song as if the whole group has suddenly forgotten how to play, but it actually seems like a situation due to stress and inexperience. I think this is an effect that can be achieved with great difficulty so I wanted to emphasize this too.


CONCLUSION
Bocchi arrived under the radar in a jam-packed season at the end of the year, it started out to be a slice-of-life like many others but all the passion and creativity of the people who worked on it have deservedly allowed it to carve out the place that it belongs. I really feel like recommending this series to anyone but especially to those who, like me, are always interested in seeing innovative, original anime that know how to detach themselves from the enormous amount of photocopied anime thanks to a well-studied project but above all managed by those who really love animes and love the anime they are producing. Kudos to CloverWorks for creating this artwork, I hope they announce a second season soon, but most of all I hope they continue to work this way from now on (even if already with My Dress-Up Darling and Akebi's Sailor Uniform have demonstrated great organization and ideas this year).

[Season 3](https://anilist.co/review/13321) 

Before I move on to season 4, I wanted to talk about the first MHA movie. You'd probably think I wouldn't talk about it since battle shounen movies are always shit and why bother, but I think it’s interesting to talk about from a production standpoint.

Like I said before, MHA's first 2 seasons look pretty alright. I can tell they're trying to keep it visually engaging and you can feel some of the animator's personality from certain shots and animations. That stops with season 3, and I think that's because of rushed production. After all, the same team works on the series and the movies. C team. And look at this production schedule.

img()

Brutal.

And before we go further; I want to make this abundantly clear: MHA looking like shit is not the animators or background artists' fault. It never is. If you have someone who is good enough to get hired by Studio Bones, they will produce something excellent if given enough time. And that's where I think the problem lies. Now, I'm not really willing to say Bones is overworking its employees or rushing production without any proof other than the way the show looks. I'm just saying, when you look at this movie and season 4...and then look at other recent productions from Bones, it’s hard not to wonder what went wrong; because a series this big should really look better.

Anyways, it’s Interesting how the visuals take a dive when the movies come into play. 

Visuals

Movie 1 is, to put it bluntly, an ugly piece of shit. I expected the movie to at least look better than the low bar the series is setting at this point, but somehow it looks ten times worse! The backgrounds everywhere are HIDEOUS, and why the fuck are the establishing shots ugly?

img()

You might not think this is a big deal, but Two Heroes is a movie that's based around its setting. These wides and establishing shots should be beautiful, yet they look like sloppily thrown-together dogwater. And if you're think I'm being too harsh, here's what the second MHA movie looks like:

img()
img()
img()

So yeah. It looks like shit.

The entire movie looks like this until the ending fight, which looks great. But it’s supposed to. Of course it was going to, that's the scene they spent all their time on. Like I'm not gonna complain that it looks good. It does, and it was clearly always the plan to make this scene look great no matter what the rest of the movie looks like. Plus, seeing Deku and All Might completely cutting loose side by side is the sort of non-canon action that battle shounen movies are made for. I just wish that much effort could have also been put into the backgrounds and establishing shots.

img()

As for the story, there's nothing really to note. It’s your generic battle shounen movie plot. The only things I found to be noteworthy were the Uno product placement, and All Might swears a couple of times.

Conclusion

The only way this movie works is if they make the setting feel real, and alive. But the backgrounds and establishing shots are so bad it all just falls flat.

And the backgrounds being shit isn't that big a deal. Like, you get sick of the shit backgrounds after a while but you can't have bad establishing shots in a movie that's based around the setting. It deflates everything when it always looks like shit!

img()

Overall, this movie just lacks energy, and it feels like the people that made it didn't care. It has no soul. Two Heroes' biggest crime is that it’s boring. A plot with nothing interesting going on, a setting that has no effort put into bringing it to life, and it all adds up to an experience that just feels soulless.

Skip to the ending fight, and then go watch Heroes Rising instead.

[Season 4](https://anilist.co/review/13414)"
47,"DISCLAIMER: This review was imported from MAL. Also, I'm fully aware that I'm part of the very minor percentage that didn't enjoy this movie at all. So before anyone comes to my comments with ""YOU'RE WRONG!!!111 AKIRA IS AMAZINGGG!!!"", keep in mind that this is just MY opinion. There are plenty of good reviews for this movie out there, let there exist at least one that is not positive.



Akira is one of those movies that when it came out it was revolutionary, but the more it gets old, the more it's evident of how... basic it is. And I'm being very nice by just saying ""basic"" (because, to be honest, I really hated it).

The plot is... oh man, WHAT EVEN is the plot? We have 2 hours and 4 minutes of the movie and most of the time I was lost and bored. I had to google so many times to understand what was happening, what was the objective, who was this character on screen and... oh, THE ENDING. WHAT????????!!!!!

Now, to be fair, I also googled about the manga and it sounds like it is more interesting, less rushed, more ""complete"" and just a whole different experience from the movie. I'm still debating whether or not I'll read it, but as far as the MOVIE ADAPTATION goes: I certainly don't recommend it!

The art is... not pretty. I get it: this is old, this is what anime looked like in the 80's, but still. The art didn't please me and it certainly pleased me even less when I focused on a character's mouth ""moving"" while they spoke (I put that word in between quotes because UGH it is so badly animated! It's like their entire face is still and only their mouths move, and barely so. I hated it.)

The characters are meh. I didn't like anyone, didn't feel a connection with absolutely any of them, I can't even remember most of their names! And some of them, I have no idea why they even existed (for example, Kei. Kaneda meets her for the first time and it's like love at first sight, he's all up for getting in her pants and I'm like: okay, but do you even KNOW this girl? who is she, why is she there, what is she going to do????)

I only started to actually get interested in the story in the last 20 minutes of the film. And by the end of it, I was back into being confused and unsure of what I had just watched.

Overall, Akira is one of the classics that I personally don't like, but as always, I have an unpopular opinion."
21127,"This review contains spoilers for Steins; Gate

I only very recently completed the original Steins;Gate - Steins;Gate 0 had already begun airing by the time I finished my binge-watch of the first series. Watching the two shows back-to-back, I can say that Steins;Gate 0 is a worthy successor (kind of) to the 2011 masterpiece.

I was excited just by the very premise of the show. Serving as a midquel (though you could argue that it's both a sequel and prequel (it's confusing, as time travel stories are)), the show follows an alternate outcome of episode 23 known as 23B, denoting it as the beta worldline. If you recall, in the original episode 23 Okabe becomes depressed after his failure to save Kurisu. He refuses to try again, but finds his resolve once Mayuri slaps sense into him. He then views a video sent to him from the future. 23B sets up the alternate timeline where Mayuri doesn’t convince Okabe to try again. This timeline is the one in which Okabe records the video for his past self to view.

While it’s not vital, I recommend viewing 23B before watching 0. Furthermore, I do not recommend watching this show before Steins;Gate. 

Besides Steins; Gate, OVA, 23B, then Steins; Gate 0, a possible watch order is Steins; Gate episode 1-22, 23B, Steins; Gate 0,episode 23, episode 24, then the OVA. Steins; Gate opens up a new level of depth to Steins;Gate saga that fans are sure to enjoy.

Like the original show, Steins; Gate follows Okabe Rintaro. In his depression,he’s retired the persona of Hououin Kyouma. It’s harrowing to see the difference. In 0, we see the depression he suffered in the original series taken to its logical extreme, and while it gives the show an air of dismalness, it’s quite interesting. You can even see the difference in clothing - with Kyouma of course sporting his white lab coat and Okabe donning a pitch black outfit.

The characters you love all return for 0 with their personalities intact. Given that their personalities are the same, it’s always interesting to see how they interact with a completely different Okabe. While some characters (such as Faris) have slightly reduced roles, others (such as Moeka) enjoy more screen time. There are also some new characters thrown into the mix to keep the story fresh. Among these are the amnesiac Kagari and Hiyajo Maho, a former colleague of Kurisu’s who’s still reeling from her death. A character that many won’t expect even makes an appearance down the line.

The animation and art direction is beautiful as ever. While there are some hiccups in action scenes, these don’t really detract from the experience.

The music is still top-notch Their placement helped make certain scenes that much more poignant. The new opening and ending themes are up there with the original. Tracks such as Gate of Steiner make a return, further tying together the shows while providing emotional gut punches.

Speaking of gut-punches, let’s talk about the story. It’s great, but it’s important to note that 0 doesn’t really have the same “punch” that Steins;Gate did. The first half is often stated to be slow, then episode twelve throws viewers for a loop with the sudden slaying of Mayuri. I want to emphasis that viewers shouldn’t go into 0 expecting this same type of “drop.” If they do, they’ll just have the feeling of holding their breath for a payoff that may not ever come. The big twists have already came, with Steins;Gate 0 dealing with their aftershocks. While this may make the show less “shocking” than its predecessor, it ensures that the feeling of dread and anxiety is always present. 

Still, Steins;Gate 0, does have some swerves, they’re just arguably not as impressive as the original’s. Part of this is due to the plot, but part of this is simply due to already experiencing the emotional roller coaster that is Steins; Gate.

As far as things I don’t like...they’re aren’t many. In fact, I can’t really think of any. While the plot-twists arguably weren’t as big as the original, the show is still quite tense. Despite the somber mood, the show still somehow manages to have its lighthearted moments. While this would normally detract from a story such as this, the creators know how to use it well, serving as a breath of fresh air, but never feeling intrusive. Given that viewers are expecting a foregone conclusion, it’s quite telling that 0 still manages to be suspenseful.

While I was inclined to state 0 as being slightly inferior to the original, there were parts towards that were even more awesome than the original series.

Going in expecting 0 to be just like Steins;Gate will undoubtedly cause some disappointment. But even if you do, I’m certain fans of the show will quickly learn to appreciate the differences. Some sequels falter, some rise to be better than their predecessors. It’s hard to be just as good as a 10/10 show, but Steins;Gate 0 manages to get there, all the same.

103139,"Don't you just hate it when a love that was already unobtainable gets even further away even when certain circumstances bring you closer? In what way, you ask? Why, that love becoming your stepsister, of course! Huh? Not enough for you? Okay, how about, while having feelings for that girl, having a one-night stand with another girl that turns out to be her younger sister, and now, SHE'S your stepsister, too? Congratulations! Your life is now a soap opera with the same premise as the anime we're going over today. I read some of the manga of said anime before it came out to prepare myself a bit for what was to come, but I never got around to actually watching the anime until two years after it premiered. One thing led to another, however, and here I am now, having gone through this so-called ""dumpster fire"" in just three days and about to dump my thoughts onto any unsuspecting reader who comes across this.

Lads, ladies, and non-binaries, here is my review of ""Domestic Girlfriend"", known in Japanese as ""Domestic na Kanojo"".

Domestic Girlfriend follows the trials and tribulations of Natsuo Fujii, a high school student and aspiring novelist with a huge crush on his teacher, Hina Tachibana. Unfortunately, he knows that his love will never be, as not only is she a teacher who claims to see him as a child, but there are rumors floating around that she already has a boyfriend. One day, when invited to a mixer, he sneaks out with one of the girls at the mixer, Rui Tachibana, and because of Rui's desire to know what sex is like, the two of them lose their virginities to each other. You would think that their association with each other would end with this simple one-night stand, right? WRONG! You see, Natsuo's widowed father soon gets remarried to a woman with two daughters of her own, and those daughters just so happen to be Hina and Rui!

From there, to put it one way, emotional chaos ensues.

Now, the story of Domestic Girlfriend is, by no means, bad. At the very least, it isn't boring; it's the kind of story that will keep a viewer watching to the end, even if for no other reason than wanting to see the main characters make a smart decision for once! However, I do have a major issue with the anime's pacing; skipped events I remember reading in the manga getting skipped aside, the story presented in the anime feels like it's going too fast, with little time for the audience to process what happened. For that, I blame whoever thought it would be a good idea to cram 76 chapters of the manga into a 12-episode series. If the anime had gotten a longer runtime - probably 24 episodes, at the very least - the pacing issues could be fixed.

No matter the pace of the story, though, there's no doubt that the characters are at its heart; unfortunately, the main cast is a frustrating one to follow. Perhaps the biggest source of frustration is the protagonist, Natsuo; while he actually seems like a nice guy, which makes it hard to me to say I hate him, most of his actions make me want to yell about how freaking stupid he is being. Neither Rui or Hina are that much better; Rui makes some questionable choices regarding her relationship with Natsuo, and while I can appreciate how Hina tries to go about her own relationship with him, it's hard to know what her true feelings are at times. As for the supporting characters....well, not a lot of time was given to develop them, so I didn't really care about most of them. However, there are quite a few supporting characters, such as Masaki - uh, excuse me, Marie - Kobayashi, who give decent advice to the main characters, and I genuinely appreciated their presence.

The art and animation, done by Diomedea, is solid overall. There were a few moments of still animation that felt unnecessary, and even aside from that, the animation isn't perfect; however, the colors, the backgrounds, and most of the animation was beautiful. The voice acting is solid, as well, although some of the casting choices, while not bad, surprised me; I don't know what I was expecting with Momo Kashiwabara's voice, in particular, but the softness of Haruka Yoshimura's voice for her managed to catch me off-guard, for some reason. The ending song, ""Wagamama"" by Alisa Takigawa, is more than solid; the song is a beautiful piece that I wouldn't mind listening to multiple times.

My favorite part of Domestic Girlfriend, however, is undoubtedly the opening theme, ""Kawaki wo Ameku"" by Minami. I had listened to this song several times and even watched the music video over the course of the past two years, and my feelings for it then are the same as they are now; it is a fantastic song with emotional lyrics that could be relatable for most people, sung with the powerful voice Minami has. It was already perfect for an anime like Domestic Girlfriend, and the visual part of the opening only helped it shine. It's clear to see that the animators went all out with this one, from the colors and movements to the visual storytelling that complimented the story of the actual series. I don't know exactly where it would be placed on my top 20 anime openings, but it's somewhere on that list, for sure.

Overall, is Domestic Girlfriend a trainwreck into a dumpster fire? Absolutely. Is it a bad anime? Absolutely not; those with a taste for melodrama and incest will definitely get a kick out of it. Just....be careful when it comes to the kinds of relationships it depicts, okay?"
99629,"My first impression is going into this anime I was expecting to finally get a good horror anime with the right amount of creepy to give you a chilling but thrilling experience all at once since it's been probably a decade last time we had some that were deserving of the genre.

Like Higurashi and Shiki to mention some of the most notable which gives justice to the horror genre it deserves. Sadly Angels of Death fell flat on its face after giving us somewhat of a promising first episode. Deeper into the story, it convoluted into something terrible and spat all over the horror genre and should not by logical means even be called horror, because it was a yawn-fest and never once did get scared or had an intense moment while watching this sorry excuse of an anime. To put it very simply, it was a waste of space in the Summer of 2018 when it was airing back then. 

StoryIt centers around a girl, Rachel Gardner who for unknown reasons are in this abandoned asylum. She wakes up there not able to remember anything and finds her self eye to eye with a mass serial killer. Something triggers in her as she goes through some messed up experience in the first episode to make her regain a portion of her memories. Now she is suddenly willing to die, but the serial killer, Zach only kills people who are in utter despair and those who tense up in the moment of death, which leads to Zach refusing to kill her. Being completely oblivious he finds himself needing her help to get out of this asylum, they team up and move on. Zach promises to kill her once they can escape from the place. 

The asylum has all kind of insane people, and everyone for what weird reasons want Rachel, whether it is out of some twisted form of love or something less messed up but not by much. The story is mainly to get out of the asylum and have Rachel killed; her wish fulfilled once they do so to say.

This anime tries too hard to make points but fails too hard. It lacks balance and things feel random and just an excuse to move on. The only saving factor is the combo between Rachel and Zach, with to some extent is possible to find entertaining. There are some arc's which I did enjoy, but not entirely.  However, unfortunately, that alone was not enough for me. 

Sound

The soundtrack is okay and nothing groundbreaking but not bad either, it gets the job done as much you can for this anime, in this case. The only memorable part for me was the ending song, which I enjoyed listening. Besides that, no OST stood out too much.  

The voice, on the other hand, was good, for Zach I mean. It fit his character but his laugh got very annoying further in the anime you come. Rachel's was annoying for other reasons, I am sure you can imagine why.

Art and AnimationAs for art, it's nice, and I do like it to an extent. The character design of Zach looks interesting, while Rachel I won't deny does look cute, and from my understanding, there were not too many moments where the art seemed too off. It got the job done, just like the soundtrack. No major annoyance comes to mind.

Lastly, the animation was not bad, when it mattered you could see the studio putting some form of effort. All said and done, as you might expect, it was not stellar and it mostly used still frames when it could.

CharactersBeing one of my favorite aspects to any literature or media, it didn't satisfy me for this anime. Beside Rachel or Zach, there was no other character that I enjoyed or wanted to see more. They just became a pain as they arc went on, and didn't add much to my enjoyment at all. For the most part, they were quite dull and boring. The main combo also started to annoy me further down the road for more many reasons; the most annoying was Rachel continually saying how she wants to die and so forth. While everyone got the backstory and proper characterization, it didn't mean much when the character themselves was not so interesting or entertaining.

Zach could possible save this anime to some extent, but the menacing and scary vibe he had going for him, was gone by the 2nd episode if not before.  In the end, he became comedic, and I couldn't take him as serious. Every action he took just made me giggle or cringe from how stupid it was and so on.

ConclusionIf you got time on your hand, then please don't sit down and watch this anime. It's not worth it, and although, this is my opinion, I still believe it be very accurate. If you want horror anime, then this won't satisfy you and likewise with the mystery genre. However, if you are having trouble sleeping, then this might be good medicine for that. I did almost fall asleep once or more times than I can count while watching it. This anime was without a doubt one of the most disappointing anime of 2018.

109261,"Note: This review takes into account both seasons 1 and 2, but does not go over the manga.

The harem rom/com genre has always been in a weird state for me. There always seems to be a big hit show from this genre every five years, yet each one always tends to be a derivative of the one that came before it. The show would hit the anime scene fast and hard, only to fade into obscurity a couple years down the line. None of the shows had any real staying power, and it became really easy to dismiss any show that fell under the genre's umbrella. So when I first stumbled upon The Quintessential Quintuplets during its first season run, I was pleasantly surprised with how fresh the show felt despite the character tropes it initially relied on. It only was during the airing of the second season that it suddenly hit me: The Quintessential Quintuplets is by and far the best the harem rom/com genre has to offer. I know this is quite the claim for such a new show that's barely broken through to the anime mainstream, but The Quintessential Quintuplets hits all the right spots of a show in this genre, but also excels in the worst parts of the genre that a lot of veteran anime fans tend to loathe.

I'm going to skip over the initial setup of the show because honestly, it is relatively standard to other shows in the genre. Our main character is a loner, and through seemingly convenient circumstances he ends up in a situation where he is essentially forced to be around the five main female characters of the show (who happen to be quintuplets). He also conveniently has a past connection to one of the girls, and this girl is the primary motivation to achieve one of his goals. This is how most of these types of shows start, and The Quintessential Quintuplets is no different. Before you roll your eyes and skip this show, trust me when I say that this show is different (like, for real this time). The key differences this show has to its contemporaries is its characterization of its female cast and it's ever shifting status quo. Though these two small things are par for the course in other genres, believe me when I say it elevates the quality of this show above its contemporaries tenfold and it cannot be understated how much of a difference it makes for a show in this genre.

The Quintessential Quintuplets biggest selling point, like many other harem rom/com shows, is its female cast. What separates The Quintessential Quintuplets' female cast from others is actual characterization and character development. The characters feel like they live their own lives, they have their own goals and aspirations, they have their own personalities, and most importantly, they aren't tied down to the main character. Obviously each of them are romantically interested in the main character, but it's highly important they don't just exist for the main character. The show never feels stagnant because of this, and it alleviates the problems a typical show in this genre usually has. On another note, the decision to make the female cast all be sisters might seem fairly pedestrian on the surface, but in hindsight it was genius call. The familial bond that the female cast has is so refreshing. While it's not explored that deep in the show, it made for some interesting, and sometimes heartwarming, moments between the main cast.

Keep in mind that this show is still a harem rom/com so some situations will feel forced and contrived, and it can feel like things are too convenient for them to happen. But these moments never detracted from the show's quality and are negligible at best, and mildly annoying at worst.

I can see The Quintessential Quintuplets being a staple in the harem rom/com genre for years to come and eventually become the gold standard for future shows, and for good reason. It has the right blend of comedy, drama, and slice of life to keep you entertained while also giving you some heartwarming moments along the way. It's the best show to watch if you want to get into the harem rom/com genre, and dare I say, the only one you have to watch."
146065,"Mushoku Tensei, baby. We all know it, we all love it. At least the first season. Up until now, Mushoku Tensei has always been defined in my mind similarly to Game of Thrones: the undisputable greatest in its genre, despite its many flaws. Unfortunately in Season 2, its status as the greatest suddenly becomes very much disputable as its shortcomings evolve from minor mishaps to thematic catastrophies, and the elements that elevated it above all other isekais disappear faster than Rudy's erectile capacities. 

Firstly, let's just get this out of the way: Rudeus Greyrat is a piece of shit. He is not ""morally gray"" as his last name might suggest and many fans claim, he is a complete scumbag. Not because he is horny, but because he is utterly reprehensible. It's very easy to forget that he's not actually Rudeus; he is a 30 year old man born in modern Japan that is roleplaying as Rudeus, and decided that slavery and pedophilia are okay. His reprehensibility works in his favor as a character in a very unique way in Season 1 because every time he starts acting up too much, he gets his ass beat, gets put in his place, and he learns from it to better himself and grow as a human being. His growth isn't voluntary, it's forced upon him by life; just like in the real world. 

This does not happen in Season 2. Rudeus acts up. He does some stupid, terrible shit. And he gets away with it with minimal consequences. Quite a few times. To continue my Game of Thrones analogy, it would be like if Theon Greyjoy skipped his Reek arc and kept raping and pillaging and being terrible with zero consequences for the rest of the show. Which is infuriating, because suddenly any justification for ""moral grayness"" gets thrown out the window. Moral grayness works because the grayness reflects the grayness of our own world. But if that grayness only exists to satiate the author's greed for edginess or to refute the existence of white and black, completely throwing out any semblance of realism or groundedness, then suddenly it's nothing but an empty, self-insert power fantasy for the author to write about getting women and being the strongest while pretending to be deep. 

And it's not just Rudeus that's morally reprehensible: it's the entire season. Sexism and objectification of women are such low-hanging fruit that I won't even go after them, but they're generally pretty bad, and have been pretty bad even in the last season to be entirely honest. But slavery??? You just gonna put that in there for an episode, pretend everything is fine, and carry on like nothing happened??? 



I'm not pretending that depicting problematic things automatically makes a show problematic; it doesn't. However, doing so requires a certain degree of responsibility and care that is entirely non-existent in this show. Depicting things that are undeniably morally pitch black as gray, or even white, without attempting any sort of social commentary, does make a show extremely problematic. Slavery may have been normal at the time, but it is also one of the greatest evils of the human race, and failing to even try to put that perspective into your story is utterly incompetent and irresponsible. Your story can take place in the most barbaric, backwards setting you can imagine, but no matter what, all people in that setting are human beings that reflect those in real life, and you as a writer owe it to your characters, your audience, and yourself as a writer to represent those people fairly and justly. 

That's the worst of it, but undoubtedly the first season also has quite a few bones for me to pick with. However, I don't do that, because elevating the first season and overshadowing its flaws are incredible animation, great character writing (as long as the characters are rich powerful white men), and captivating world-building. 

Two of these three protective shields staving off my criticism are not at all there in this season, while the third is only present in a greatly weakened state. The first season had countless breathtaking shots and fights, where even the most mundane of everyday happenings was gorgeous and immersive. Fight scenes were eye-boggling, spells were beautiful, and every frame truly felt like a painting. 

img200() img200() img200() 

I struggle to remember even a single moment in this season that maintains this standard. 

Rudeus' reunion with his father also made me cry, and I related heavily to both of their struggles with insecurity and to prove themselves. In Season 2, the peak of character writing is an arc revolving around Erectile Dysfunction, and Sylphie, the single sweetest and most precious character in all of anime who inexplicably falls in love with this travesty of a rat human being. 

The immersive world remains this series' one saving grace, as we meet new characters from different races and political factions and experience jaw-dropping revelations centering around Nanahoshi and the nature of reincarnation and the Mass Teleportation, all executed in a brilliantly sequenced and emotional reveal in Episode 9 that was only as effective as it was because of the painstaking set-up and non-stop meticulous detail maintained for the past 32 episodes. 

Mushoku Tensei is still widely hailed as one of the greatest isekais of all time, but after this season, I am struggling to understand why. Its blatant flaws spiral out of control as the glamour that concealed them in the last season disappears, transforming it into a barely-held-together string of mindless lust, senseless edginess and power-drunk fantasy. I could stomach most of its bs in the first season, but now, it's testing the limits of my patience. 

I'll still watch cour 2 though. Probably."
108759,"I’ll be honest with you right now, the only reason why I started watching SAO was because I saw that Underworld was coming out, and it looked pretty amazing. Never even thought of giving SAO a chance because of all the hate it received, and the prejudice that came with it if you were a fan of the series. This anime though convinced me to give it a shot and see for MYSELF what SAO really was. Thus began my binge of the entire series to catch up in time for the first episode of Underworld. I will admit, the previous season had some really good parts....and just some god-awful parts that were cliche, really cut, and cringe. Overall my impressions of the series have been more positive than negative, and I learned that SAO in itself wasn’t NEARLY as bad as people made it to be. After finishing Alicization, my hype for Underworld couldn’t be contained. The beautiful art style, satisfying and crisp sound effects, decent storyline, and AMAZING soundtrack made me look forward to the release of Underworld even more. It started to break away from the original “environment” and feel of the previous SAO entries, and Alicization carried a different air to itself. While the beginning of Underworld was somewhat on the slower side, it didn’t last for very long. The one thing I appreciated most about Underworld was how much effort A-1 was putting into making this a well-paced, well-animated adaptation that strived to do this cour of Underworld justice. I rarely felt like things were being skipped over or rushed, and the art/animation quality is some of the best and most visually stunning I’ve seen in a while since the Fate Series. Underworld really turned out (in my opinion) to be the most fulfilled and anticipated season of SAO for me, and each episode that came out somehow managed to top the last. Honestly, I really don’t see how people still manage to get stuck on the fact that this is SAO. Remove the name and what do you get? No one can deny the fact that it had some of the best art/animation to be seen in 2019, and also one of the best and most popular soundtracks. The numbers speak for themselves, SAO is still going strong despite all the unnecessary, dramatic criticism. And here’s why:

Art and Animation: 9.8/10
- A highlight of Underworld throughout the season that undeniably delivered the most. A-1 went into this anime with everything they had, and it was most apparent with all the attention to detail they put into it. The environment and world detail was an even more upgraded and polished version of Alicization, with action scenes being given more effort to in order to give a satisfying experience to viewers. The armament enhancement animations featured were unique, and stood out amongst the rest of the other Integrity Knights. These moments were some of the most exciting parts of the season, and I always looked forward to seeing what was next. Even without armament enhancements being thrown in our faces every episode, the other action scenes had great choreography and fluid movements. The lighting and shading in Underworld was very apparent and the details of sunlight filtering through the forest floor solidified its quality. All the colors used were effective in conveying the proper mood of the atmosphere, and even day-to-day moments were given proper attention. The only real weak point I could see in this season was the implementation of CGI, and the CGI used wasn’t really bad at all. The CGI was very minimal and wasn’t the main point in any of the episodes, so I didn’t mind it too much.

Storyline and Character Progression: 9.2/10
- Here’s where things get spicy, and controversial. The reason why you see a 9.6/10 is because how GOOD A-1 did with sticking to the source material. In the end, that’s what matters most right? Because a good adaptation not only effects all the haters, but ultimately affects the fans as well. And it’s an undeniable fact that SAO fans themselves are very pleased with how well A-1 did at adapting the Underworld arc so far. If you got a problem with Underworld and the storyline so far, here’s a simple solution I found that works for everyone: Just don’t watch it. If you don’t even like the source material of the Underworld storyline, then don’t watch any further. Overall though, the storyline is some of the deepest and most impactful in the SAO series due to the weight of the events occurring, and cour 2 of these events are gonna be even more hype than now. A-1 kept the pacing of the storyline very comfortable despite the onslaught of people asking “Where’s Asuna? Where’s Kirito?” There were almost no plot holes to be seen, and fans of the source material can agree that this was a worthy adaptation that did this cour justice. The character progression wasn’t anything crazy deep or emotional, but Underworld still had its emotional moments. The character interactions were both meaningful and helped to progress the storyline and give it more weight. No one has any reason to complain about the pace of Undeworld because at the end of the day, they stuck with the source material as closely as possible and delivered something that many people could enjoy. Lets be real, wouldn’t you rather have an anime with slower pacing rather than one that feels rushed and cut beyond recognition? Looks at Tokyo Ghoul: Re.

Soundtrack and Audio: 9.6/10
- LiSA does it again with this season, and it comes as no surprise. Underworlds ED is one of the most popular songs in Japan to date, and is undeniably one of the best I’ve seen in quite a long time. I feel like a lot of anime don’t really care too much about the quality of their ED, so I’m glad A-1 had paid such great attention to even this part of the anime in both the musicality and animation. While the OP wasn’t LiSA, it didn’t matter one bit. It’s become one of my top OPs to listen to, and for more than one reason. The musicality itself represented what to expect from this season, and increased the hype of each coming episode. The art/animation used in the OP was both dynamic and appealing, and the symbolic meaning throughout it all was much appreciated. So many little details in the OP made it quite impressive, and readers of the LN could definitely pinpoint the spoilers shown.

If you couldn’t tell by now, SAO Alicization: War of Underworld is one of my top anime of 2019. I enjoy quality anime, and I like to give credit where it is due. Underworld is not just another SAO that’s meant to be just eye candy, it’s an adaptation that did the series justice for once. You could clearly see just how much A-1 wants Underworld to succeed because of how much attention and care they’re putting into breaking the boundaries of what we know of SAO. One thing is for sure though, SAO isn’t the same as it used to be. Moving forward, expect to see even greater things coming from A-1 in the 2020 year because they definitely have their hands full. For those who finished Underworld: Didn’t care for the abrupt ending? Well, this is because A-1 didn’t want to start the next cour just yet. The reason why they stopped a little into Volume 17 of the LN is because they wanted to take their time with what’s coming next. If they went on ahead and adapted more of Volume 17, chances were quite high that a lot of things would’ve been cut in order to fit it into episode 12. So don’t worry too much, just be grateful that A-1 still cared all the way down even to the end of the season to not end it with a crappy and cut adaptation. Just know that the next cour might be too much to handle, because the events yet to unfold are going to be nonstop and packed with the beautiful and stunning action we saw with this season. And before I go, a word to the haters: You and me both know that even though you “don’t like” SAO and think it’s mediocre and shallow, you’re still gonna come back and watch the next season of it. Why? I honestly don’t know, maybe because it peaks your interest enough, or maybe because there’s nothing else better to do. Just know that A-1 has come out with one of the best SAO  adaptations to date, and if fans are happy, then I’m happy. Because when it comes down to it, the real thing that matters is whether a studio correctly adapts the source material or not, and there’s no denying the fact that A-1 passed with flying colors. Anyways, that’s all for now and I truly believe that Underworld deserves the score of 9.4/10. It’s one of the best shounen I’ve seen in a LONG while, and definitely a highlight of 2019 to close the anime year. Thank you all so much for reading eventhough it was pretty biased, but let’s be real: all the haters out there are being even more biased than me, and half of them haven’t even gotten through Season 1 of SAO. See y’all in the next one! :)"

This review includes no spoilers and is meant for both seasonsWhen it comes to the slice of life genre. It's usually a ""hit or miss"" situation. Since it's a genre that is one of the hardest to flesh out and give the viewers or readers alike, something they would find worthwhile. In many cases, things like character progression are uncommon and hard to fit in. I don't know how to explain it well, but more or less, it's hard to create a story that elevates the slice of life elements in a good and enjoyable way. However, there are few shows out there who can accomplish this and so much more. Sangatsu no Lion is such a phenomenon, and it does it incredibly well and thorough. This anime takes the slice of life elements and digs deep into the emotional aspect to really give us a feeling of what those characters are feeling. The thing is, it's not just related to the main character. More or less anyone, even a side figure you would find forgettable in the long run, gets that time in the spotlight. Not to mention, the author - Umino Chika, alongside the incredible - Shaft studio, does a tremendous job of adapting this story on the big screen. It's one of the few I would consider having a perfect adaptation. I have not read the manga myself yet, but from what others are telling me. I am confident in saying so. 

img750()

StoryFirst off, Sangatsu no Lion is a heavily character-driven story, there is, in other words, no set goal. Although, once you start moving places, you will see arcs with their own specific objective. That said, Sangatsu no Lion won't give the answer straight to you. One has to look at the whole picture and piece together what it's telling you. At least, at some points. Shogi is a crucial component and tool in Sangatsu no Lion. It's used in the most unexpected ways. There are times when we get to learn the rules of shogi through some cute stories of cats. But at the end of the day, I wouldn't be worried too much if you can't understand all those sharp and seriously in-depth games. As long as you acknowledge that it tells a story through shogi, you will be fine. Much of the psychological elements, to behavior, actions, mannerism, and all that good stuff is clearly conveyed through the games of shogi. That's one of the reasons which make Sangatsu no Lion stand out from other anime. It does it delicately and is not afraid to play the long game. But at the end of it all. The pay-off more than enough makes up for it, if anything. Oh, not only that. The sounds of shogi pieces smacking on the board are oddly satisfying. I can't be the only one that thought that, right? 

On top of that, Rei's inner monologuing adds even more flavor to an already fantastic anime adaptation. Above all that, Sangatsu no lion uses a good deal of metaphors through visual and psychological. In an incredibly fascinating, captivating way. In other words, it's also a highly complex anime and certainly not for everyone but more on that later. Among others, it does a great job of depicting life realistically. The good it carries, the bad, and how this affects anyone in either a terrible depressive. Or a more positive and happy way. In which case, it shows us how loneliness affects our ways of thinking and how it can be dangerous to not surround yourself with warmth if possible. Moreover, it shows the process of opening up to others in great detail, like many other aspects. It's not as easy as it sounds, a human being can be quite stubborn and shy even. It goes through all of that in extensive detail. Expect it to be quite comprehensive and delve deep, so, at the end of the road, you will understand the character far better than you would think at first.  I said it before, and I will repeat it once more. Sangatsu no Lion is not afraid to bring up any side character and totally take them apart. So you can fully understand their reasoning and philosophy for life among so much else you have to watch to believe.

It's true that Sangatsu no Lion tells a depressive and dark story, but there is some comedy to be had. In fact, it balances out that aspect so exceptionally well that it never ceases to astound me when the mood changes at the drop of a hat. Sangatsu no Lion will not only give you a highly impacting character-driven story. But the wholesome moments which will heal you when you are down in the dumps are here too. It's so cute and fluffy, all at once, that it will definitely ease the pain from the more darker parts of the story. I mean, if it was hopeless and gloomy all at times, it might have ended up as a double-edged sword. So this is a nice touch that gives your mind a break from the dark for a moment. When we do take a break, you can also expect to see some food-related themes and in a general sense. My recommendation is to always have something to eat with you. Or you will, for a fact, regret it when you see some amazingly tasty-looking anime food on your screen.

Oh, let me add this one too, but I won't delve too deep into this topic for obvious reasons. Sangatsu no Lion does have a slow romance that, in fact, builds up over time as our character progress. Just don't watch it for that reason since you would come out disappointed if you are a hardcore romance fan, I imagine. It's not the main topic. This anime is trying to mess around with. That said, it gradually and tastefully builds up in the background, and it's so damn cute not gonna lie. I also want to point out that Sangatsu no Lion has one of my top favorite arcs in anime and manga as a whole. Only a few come close if you ask me. So studio shaft did a fantastic job of adapting this one arc, especially. Everything to the direction and execution harmonized with each other perfectly and hit all the right notes. It's a common theme delved into anime or manga, but only some manage to a great job of executing it. Sangatsu no Lion is one of those very few that actually went the extra mile and blew this one out of the park.

Now the first season tells a great story by itself. Still, the second season is in a completely different league altogether. But one thing is sure if it was not for the first season is a significant success hitting all the right notes in the right place. The second season would no doubt be near as emotionally impacting. Expect to cry, expect to laugh, and expect to notice many emotions you didn't think you already had. Sangatsu no Lion is one of a kind in that way. You will definitely not regret watching this classic if you are looking for an incredibly intricate character-driven story with shogi elements and a dash of tasteful romance.

SoundWhen it comes to the instruments, effects, any kind of sound at all in Sangatsu, no Lion is impactful and feels real. Studio Shaft nails every little detail, regardless of what type of mood we are in at the moment. It definitely complements nicely with the art-style to boot, which is another highly positive component. More on that soon. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and hits right on the dot with different vibes. You will be surprised at how one tune will make you all happy-go-lucky inside, but the next might gives you immense goosebumps and hit hard where it hurts the most. On top of that, every opening song relies on symbolism, and the songs by itself are top-notch. My favorite is the first opening song by Bump of Chicken and OMG! I love the meaning of those lyrics. It's so vast and meaningful to Rei as a character. I also love the first and second ending song. One by the same artist and the other by Kenshi Yonezu. Both are wonderful, and I love it way too much. Let's not forget about the first season-opening two, which is also just great. Not my cup of tea in terms of the song, but it's just as important and impacting as the rest of the opening and endings.

ArtThe art tells its own story, and that's not empty words mind you. Since studio Shaft does an absolutely phenomenal job of conveying all kinds of emotions, feelings, regret, sorrow, and even sadness through that simple but extremely expressive art-style. On top of that, the coloring is spot-on. If it's dark, the art gets darkened and a more greyish tone but still being very colorful. For comedy, it feels fluffy, shiny, and happy, and so forth.  It never ceases to astound me since the art-style color palette always hits on the mark when it comes to our character's mood. This is Shaft we are talking about, and it should be as expected. But this is no easy thing to make a reality, so you have to give some insane credits for accomplishing this. Not to mention keeping it the norm as it gets even more intricate and intense as you move on to the second season. Let's also not forget to appreciate the highly detailed background. They are so damn beautiful, and more or less, each frame is worthy of becoming a wallpaper. Its amazing Shaft has been able to accomplish something like this and kept it going strong. I can't even imagine if the next seasons come around. It will surely be on another level once again.



CharactersAs previously stated, characters play a considerable role in Sangatsu no Lion. Let's talk about our main - Rei Kiriyama for a moment. I don't know how to put it without falling into spoilers territory. However, his progress from the first season to the second season is stunningly executed. It was realistic in terms of how long it took for him to change and accept reality and embrace it tightly. At first, Rei comes off as a negative and depressive guy who just doesn't seem to have any purpose in life. He seems to be at the end of the road and could break at any point now. You can't really blame him either when you learn his side of the story, and all hell he had to go through. Everyone is in for a surprise when they find out how he is still somewhat going and not completely given up at life. Regardless, what I am trying to get across here is that Rei is an entirely different person from his first season counterpart. Without a shadow of out, one of the best-written characters and the development is tastefully and very satisfying executed step by step. I am focusing more on Rei as to no spoil some other major characters. Don't let that make you assume they don't get the spotlight, though. Since as I have made it abundantly clear by now, they do and then some.

The NegativeSuffice to say Sangatsu no Lion is not for everyone. The pacing is very slow, but it gives room for additional brilliant and emotionally profound and thorough character development. That one arc, especially, just blew me away, and I was an utter mess through it. Though, that's only the beginning. During one of the shogi matches. I was conflicted with myself in whom I should root for. Both characters had their own noble reasons for fighting. However, fleshing them out through emotionally packing backstory and shogi put me in a tight spot. Who did I fancy more? Who did I want to win? All kinds of similar thoughts were swirling inside my head. And I was at war with myself more times than I could possibly count. Sangatsu no Lion made me feel all sorts of emotions I thought I didn't have to put it plain and simple.

But sadly, not without faults. If I had to point out some ""issues,"" It would have to be the inconsistency in pacing like you skipped an episode. This was not common, but when it happened, it was definitely a bothersome sensation. Sometimes it also felt like character bonds were established way too quickly with the supporting cast and not giving it enough room to develop first. On top of that, Sangatsu no Lion has en huge cast, and I wished many more got explored and revived attention. Regardless of all the mentioned problems, do take it with a large grain of salt. While I did want somethings were handled even more delicately. At the end of the day, I have much more praise than things to pick on with Sangatsu no Lion. Undoubtedly, I had an absolute blast watching it, and without a shadow of a doubt. It's now one of my all-time favorite anime and one of the best out there to boot, no question asked. Not to mention, it's not like this is not something a sequel or reading ahead in the manga can fix, so it's really not that much a problem if you look it at that way.

ConclusionI highly encourage and recommend Sangatsu no Lion with all my heart to everyone who wants to experience life and even characters depicted realistically in anime. And so much more, you can't even begin to imagine. It's one of a kind and an absolute must-watch absolutely. Definitely, one of the few I would say you should watch at some point in your life. Sadly, it's clearly not for everyone since it handles some rather dense and complex topics. It all comes down to if you are interested in that kind of intensity. That said, do not be afraid to give it a shot, and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. It's a unique slice of life and not the usual kind executed with a lot of love and care. Every frame had a lot of love care put into it. Studio Shaft embedded it all in warm light and made it feel so alive and colorful. You can tell this is a director and production team that actually cares about the viewers. Sangatsu no Lion is undoubtedly a classic and one of the best anime I have watched in recent years."

It’s the anime that got me into anime, for better or for worse. SNAFU S1 showed me that these seemingly simple Chinese cartoons could have far more to say than the tropes advertised on the tin. Zoku defied my expectations again by turning the genre subversions of an entertaining first season into an intimate character exploration that ranks among the most compelling arcs I’ve experienced across visual and written mediums. A pair of pretentious intellectuals and a hyper BFF’s struggles with actualizing their wants and needs opened my eyes to brand new ways of appreciating stories. Challenging my understanding of texts and the world around me, Oregairu has perhaps been the piece of media most formative to my growth as an audience member.

And at long last, it has arrived at a climax.

I’ll keep things spoiler-free for S3, but be sure to catch seasons 1 & 2 before going further. Skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you wish to go in blind. Let’s finally bring things to an end…



 img100%() 


Oregairu S1 made waves with its trademark joke delivery, utilizing every weeb’s favourite loner, Hachiman, to provide jaded commentary on SOL genre conventions. While the comedy was hit-or-miss with audiences (a hit for me,) the series also took time to lay the foundations for a stellar second season. The eye-opening S2 turned its caricatures into characters, its sarcasm into introspection, and its “parody” into a drama on its own right; all while maintaining the quirky wit that characterized so much of its predecessor.



The thoughtful experience built in seasons 1 & 2 deserved a continuation in the form of closure. The series opens immediately following the climax that was S2’s finale, as if the 5-year gap between seasons never existed. The relationship between our Service Club members remains as uncertain as ever. The search for something “genuine” is a burden that rests heavy on the hearts of Hachiman, Yukinon and Yui. Unlike the many subplots about students coming to the Club for help, this time our beloved trio face the task of helping themselves. Understanding how to reject the superficial impasse within the other cliques in school, fighting against expectations imposed by others, and making the inner desires of their hearts known.

  img100%() 


To achieve this end, the Service Club sets their sights on a single goal: organizing a school prom. This final arc looms large over the course of the season. Previous instalments of the franchise would cover two or three of such subplots at a brisk pace; S3 is a slow-burn that commits to paying off its threads on one last journey. The more-measured pacing has sparked audience discussions about what makes the prom such a huge deal. But the plan to get the prom off the ground isn’t important, rather it’s the varying character motivations amongst our trio that creates room for this story’s subtext and drama. The competition between Hachiman and Yukinoshita that brought the Club to where it stands today enters its final round; the outcome will decide the future of their friendship. The prom setup is a backdrop and metaphor for the inner feelings of 8Man and the gang. Unearthing the subtext between these complex individuals and their interactions has been incredibly engaging. Ideas and themes built up in S2 get expanded upon and explored in greater depth. Adding on to the payoff are well-written visits from familiar faces, as Hachiman makes his rounds and seeks help for the tasks at hand. Moments of character introspection are a common occurrence, as Kan shows its hand and lowers the defenses of several cast members. Getting into the heads of characters other than Hachiman further enrichens the story and caused me to look at things from different perspectives. Reinforcement of themes and payoffs cumulate in immensely satisfying fashion. Episode 8 of S3 is a triumph and arguably my favorite 20 minutes of anime this Summer. Heck, I’d go as far as to say that this episode deeply affected me as much as the Genuine Scene itself.

 img100%() 


And it’s in those aspects that Kan falls short. Most striking is how quickly the show shaved off its comedy tag. Fans of S1 tend to dislike the more serious tonal shifts of S2, and S3 brings even less of that to the table. Certain attempts at gags feel tired and forced retreads of older material, such as the spiritual sequel to the “Logical Thinking” bit. Somber undertones are present in most scenes, holding Kan back from hitting the comedic highs the series is known for. That’s not to say this season doesn’t pack any laughs; pick any scene with Iroha or Zaimokuza and you’re bound to get a few chuckles. Also a step-down are the visuals, in my opinion. Other than a slew of lighting effects, Studio .feel doesn’t add anything substantial in this regard. In the OP (once again performed by Nagi Yanagi,) a frame-rate drop towards the end gets pretty distracting after repeated viewings. Character designs and facial expressions also look a tad off at times. Another area of concern would be moments in the show that can come across as unrealistic or unintentionally silly at times. When the show leans too hard on driving in subtext and parallels, the surface-level interpretation can be pretty ridiculous to take in. Slow pacing of certain episodes is yet another issue. It takes a while to really get going, and I found myself getting frustrated at the first three episodes for its relative insignificance. This issue is exacerbated by the show repeating itself at certain junctures. Plot points are stretched and some scenes are essentially rehashed. For example, I found the first 15 minutes of Episode 5 to be a recap of ideas adequately explored in the last 5 minutes of Episode 4, which shares a very similar ending to that of Episode 6.

  img100%() 


Adaptations are a tricky business, and sometimes a show has only so much time to convey the key narrative that made its source material special. RELife is one example that comes to mind, being allocated a meager 4-episode OVA release to wrap up upwards of 50 chapters' worth of material. I found it that OVA series to be a success and the high-point of the anime series, because it had a strong focus to close out its story without throwing in arcs that have no chance of resolving in a satisfying manner. Unlike another high-school contemporary in Summer '20 (one that may or may not involve gods,) S3 rarely plays out like a hastily slapped-together highlight reel of its source material. I’m confident in saying that S3 handled its adaptation well, even without having read the manga, on the basis that the story presented in the anime holds up on its own. Aside from one tease of a line in Episode 8 with Haruno and Hayato, Kan remains true to its refrain to deliver on a strong narrative, and that’s enough for me. That being said, the LN/manga readers I’ve shared discussions with agree that plenty of content they consider “essential” got left on the cutting floor, and I won’t contest that. But I assure you that if you were to go into this season with an open mind and appreciate Kan as its own story, you will not come away disappointed.

 img100%() 



You would have noticed that I haven’t brought it up at this point, and truth be told I’d love to bring up my Best-Girl biases and opinions on how it’s handled in the anime. I’ve always thought the unofficial Waifu War could be built up a lot better, and like plenty of viewers I have my qualms on the outcome Kan went with. But personally, I’m not upset at how things played out, even if it came across as rushed for some. Because to me, S3’s titular climax is not one to do with resolving romance. Rather, it has everything to do with the friendship Hachiman, Yukinon and Yui share. This was the outcome they all wanted and needed – to think, to writhe, to struggle together. This was the closure they deserved, one that brought out their truest desires.

 img100%() 


Oregairu Kan is a triumph. The season deftly packs subtext and builds upon themes introduced in seasons prior, setting off the search for something genuine. Admittedly S3 is the weakest instalment in the trilogy, not quite managing to capture the comedy of S1 or the compelling character arc of S2. Content cut from the source material may concern fans of the original source material. Still, Kan achieves the goal it set out to do – providing a thematic and profound conclusion to the enigmatic franchise.
My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected is a story about challenging the norms. It mocked the mundane and transformed it into a unique, endearing experience. It got me to question the reality of friendships and what it means to share genuine intimacy with others. SNAFU will forever have a place in my heart, and I’m so happy that it’s over. Thank you, Oregairu, my wish has been fulfilled. 7/10

-- Really sad about the show not premiering in Spring, but I do sympathize with the animators and team involved. Taking the extra time to deliver on a project so near and dear to this audience is commendable, especially during such difficult recent events. What does tick me off, however, is the promotion of S3. It went strong even up till a week before the proposed season premiere, misleading me into thinking it would survive the COVID production delays that plagued so many shows this year. On April 1st a PV debuted, which was basically the main PV for the show entirely dubbed by Zaimokuza’s VA in-character. While I understand it would have been a shame for such a topical gag to go to waste, it was very upsetting to hear that the trailer got a green light. I find it unlikely that the people managing the show’s promotion were unaware of the show needing more production time so late in the game; and if that really was the case it was highly irresponsible to overestimate the capacity of the team tasked with bringing this season to life.

-- If I had a can of Georgia coffee for each time I saw a can of Georgia coffee on-screen, I’d have as many cans of Georgia coffee as the vending machine in Episode 4. Here's a montage of Georgia coffee cans in each episode:

  img100%() 

-- Never knew we needed a Kawasaki ship, but we sure as hell got one!

 img100%() 

-- Iroha was super perceptive and even pulled an 8Man on 8Man himself on many an occasion. She stole the show in every scene she was in.

-- As did Hiratsuka. Someone PLEASE marry her already, or I will.

  img100%() 

-- Copious lack of Totsuka this season, maybe that’s why I rated it lower than the other two.

-- Gahama-mama is amazing. Enough said.

-- The world would be such a brighter place if everyone had a little sister like Komachi.

 img100%() 

-- Haruno was still the more interesting of the Yukinoshita sisters for me. Really appreciated how they humanized her in Ep 10, almost all her screentime before that portrayed her as a Ryuk-type figure who observes Hachiman’s silly schemes. Really glad they grounded her character at the very end.

-- And Yukinon was… well, Yukinon. Never took a fancy to her in the anime, and that’s putting it politely. I’ll admit I did warm up to her a lot more this season, keep your pitchforks down. I also heard she gets far better treatment in the LNs/manga, so I’m keen to give that a shot some time.

 img100%() 

Last but certainly not least:

-- BEST GIRL: Yui. Yui Yui Yui. The beating heart of the club. I’ll always love my Genki Girl, no matter how annoying people say she is. Her role in the story is vital; the club could never exist without her. Even her most ardent of detractors will find something they like in S3; she pays a penance of sorts for her selfish act in S2’s finale, easily redeeming herself in my eyes.

  img100%() 



Welp, that’s it! Those of you who know me know I’ve spent an unhealthy amount of time talking about this season. I’m happy to say that I’m ready to put that to rest and move on. Thanks so much for sticking around during that strange and enriching journey, I took a lot from this show over the past few weeks. If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other [reviews](https://anilist.co/user/AnimeDweeb/reviews) for seasons past and present, peace"
108430,"(this review contains spoilers)

When I first heard about Given getting an adaptation, I was overjoyed. Finally, we got a tasteful BL manga where no one is getting fetishized, there isn't any problematic subtext, and the anime has an actual plot beyond their relationship. All of these things are what makes Given great and stand out from all the other popular BL anime. The anime (especially the first half) tends to be more focused not on the romantic development of Mafuyu and Uenoyama, but rather telling a story about the evolution of their band and how Mafuyu impacted them. 
img()

Story
At the outset, the story of this anime seems quite basic - a somewhat stagnant band is trying to light their fire again, and a mysterious person comes along and shakes things up. However, what comes with that person in this instance is quite complicated. The way the anime explains Mafuyu's backstory over time is very well done; we slowly learn why he has trouble expressing himself, why he carries around a guitar despite not playing it, and much more. Most of it was done through interactions with Mafuyu's former classmates, which I thought was a very good strategy of getting the audience up to speed with his past, and most importantly, puts ourselves in Uenoyama's shoes. The only thing Uenoyama knows at this point is that Mafuyu has a beautiful voice, but rumors start to circulate around the school about Mafuyu's past and Uenoyama is intrigued. We learn even more when Mafuyu clashes with Hiiragi, a friend who brings back painful memories of Mafuyu's former boyfriend. As the pieces of the puzzle start to come together, Uenoyama starts to develop feelings which eventually turn into love. I don't seem to remember too much agonizing over the whole ""we're both guys"" thing either, which is such a tired trope I roll my eyes after more than one instance of it. The story veers off occasionally to talk about the other members of the band and their relationships, but providing more context for the character's actions and emotions (especially when it comes to Haruki having a crush on Kaji for years) is helpful. It also provides good setup for the upcoming movie, which we just learned today is happening. 

One very interesting metaphor that comes up throughout the anime was equating love to music, and I think this is quite interesting. We see it with Kaji meeting Ugetsu for the first time, and in the second episode where Uenoyama said that Mafuyu's song ""shook him to his core."" Although Kaji (in his flashback) stated that hearing Ugetsu play the violin was love at first sight, it was very clear that music was a part of that attraction. The same applies to Uenoyama, at first he was amazed by Mafuyu's previously unknown singing talent, but this develops into physical and emotional attraction as they get to know each other better. Music is used most prominently as a vehicle for emotion in Given, and not only romance. When Mafuyu sings his song about his former love, the whole crowd can feel the emotion coming from his performance, and I thought this was very powerful. 

This is my BL-loving self talking, but I wish the ending was more fluffy. Mafuyu's confession was very well done, but I wish that we'd seen a more cute reaction from Uenoyama. We didn't even get to see them have a fluffy ""I love you too!"" scene, although what happened afterward was consistent with the focus of the show (music). 

img400()
How it all started


Character
I thought the characters in this anime were all very well done, especially when it comes to gay romance. There weren't many instances (as I stated earlier) where Uenoyama agonizes over liking Mafuyu, which is good. However, most of Uenoyama's reactions to things are just ""eh?"" whenever something surprising happens. This is both good and bad; Uenoyama doesn't have a negative reaction towards surprises: after learning Mafuyu was gay, he didn't say anything negative about that, which was good, but this reaction happened so often I wish they'd mixed it up a little. It's part of his character, but I would have liked to have seen Uenoyama be visibly happy after Mafuyu's confession. Mafuyu is a great character as well, his tragic backstory provides for a lot of interesting reflection by him, especially when it comes to expressing his emotions. Since music is the focus of this anime, it fit quite well for Mafuyu's ultimate expression of grief to be a song, and it was incredible. Although Mafuyu acts indifferent towards most things, his real moments of development were when he was pushed to face his dark past and come to terms with it. The best example of this is when Uenoyama is scolding Mafuyu for not having a song ready on the day of the concert and Mafuyu breaks his strings in anger. To me, the most compelling aspect of this was the fact that Uenoyama fixed them for him, just like in the beginning of the anime. The message being that if things are broken, they can be fixed, even if what was damaged before seems irreparable. I haven't mentioned Haruki and Kaji too much, but their characters are also quite good. Haruki's subplot of crushing on Kaji for years is very apparent and makes its way into many many cute moments. His realistic attitude towards everything has somewhat prevented him from confessing, but that is also a valuable trait to have when managing a band. Kaji is a much more carefree guy but his advice really helps Uenoyama and Mafuyu's relationship move forward; his perceptiveness about what's going on in the band was very good to watch. The last character I want to briefly mention is Mafuyu's ex-boyfriend, Yuki. I appreciate how they made him actually a good person. So often you see exes portrayed (not just in anime) as totally horrible people, but the amount of exposition behind Yuki's personality was quite nice! I didn't mention this in the story section, but the anime actually has quite a good sense of humor! The band's interactions with each other are usually fun and lighthearted. Kaji and Haruki add a lot of comedy to the group and seeing the band's internal relationships improve is always nice to see. 
img300() img340()
Okay, Uenoyama had his cute moments. Haruki was really cute the whole time as well.

Art
The art in this anime was surprisingly good! The character designs are all very nice, although I think some of the characters (particularly Kaji and Uenoyama) have unusually wide necks. Where the anime comes into its own in terms of art is during the performance in episode 9, which had some awesome CG with the guitars, drums, and bass. The detail of the instruments was always good throughout the anime. However, the art was not always stellar. There were moments in the anime where the characters were drawn with no faces for longer than I expected (I especially noticed this in the last episode). There were also 2 or so times where the anime would portray the passage of time by doing a slideshow to some background music (when the band was writing the new song and in the last episode where the school year just plays out). This was effective I guess, but I would have liked to see some animation in the background rather than the iMovie-style ""image pan"" slide show. Minor complaint, however.

I'll mention the song Mafuyu sang in episode 9 in this section, since I think it deserves to be mentioned somewhere. It was amazing. The first time I heard Mafuyu sing his ""la la la"" song, I wasn't too thrilled, but his live performance was incredibly well done. Both the lyrics and the song that went with it were so emotional, not to mention the fact that it sounded great. 

Overall
I'm really happy with the way this anime played out. It's a great example of how BL can be done tastefully: none of that ""dubious consent"" nonsense, no age gap, just straightforward romance. Although some people do enjoy those aspects of BL, I think they make the genre a lot less accessible for your average viewer, and when they see the ""gay"" tag (shounen-ai, boys' love, whatever you wanna call it), some people get turned off immediately. Given is different, however; it's a straightforward romance with satisfying development and conclusion. I don't think we've seen an anime that does this so well since Doukyuusei, and I hope more BL like this comes out in the future.  If there's any complaints I have about the anime, it would be that there wasn't as much romance as I'd like. It's a genuinely good drama, but it wasn't until the last few episodes where we got kisses and what their relationship actually looks like romantically. In the end though, this is still an incredible anime that I would recommend to anyone, not just BL fans. Given does an incredible job integrating LGBT characters and themes without making it seem taboo or weird, just people who are in love. 


Thanks for reading!

100922,"Grand Blue stands out more as a modern slice of life that adheres to a young adult cultural society. Here, we meet a guy named Iori Kitahara who starts his new life as a college student on the Izu Peninsula. His place of residence happens to be a diving shop known as “Grand Blue” and thus where daily life adventure begins.

Grand Blue’s storytelling mainly chronicles the daily life adventures of Iori although plenty of other characters are featured aside him. The main cast consists of diving club, also known as the “Peek-a-Boo”. He meets others including his cousin Chisa, Nanaka, Kohei, Azusa, Tokita, and Kotobuki.

Among this group, the male cast seems more like they are in love with drinking more than diving. The first episode immediately sets off the humor with the nakedness and adult jokes from the very start as we meet the core members. That is to say, Iori himself also lacks common sense when he attends his first day at college while being half naked. Judging from just this impression, it should be easy to recognize that the show love to make fun of its characters. It uses stereotypes that makes fun of college life such as young adults drinking and partying. Then, there’s meta-humor that plays on jokes with the nudity. It’s also self-aware being that it never attempts to disguise its humor. Certain characters are very aware of their actions regardless of consequences and this often sets off the wrath of others such as Chisa.

For the main female cast, it consists of a colorful group with a diverse range of personalities. The most level-headed person in the show is Chisa who takes many things in life seriously. She also loves diving and geniuely enjoys the feelings of being in the azure ocean. She’s like the anti-Peek-a-boo member in the show as she can’t tolerate being embarrassed. Because of this, there’s often a clash between her and Iori as the two gets into compromising positions. The end result is often Iori taking the blow and Chisa face palming herself. However, it’s also noticeable that she does care about Iori especially during brief flashbacks before them. Often times, I guess you could say that she misses her childhood with him and reliving those moments brings a peace in her mind. Then, we have Nanaka who seems to play the role of an older sister type for the main cast although at the same time, she also has an unhealthy infatuation towards Chisa. It’s the type of humor that makes fun of siblings but in a sarcastic way. Azusa is the senior student who behaves much more like the guys in the show. Her bisexuality is hinted at many times and often makes sexual jokes at others, especially Iori. Last but not least is Aina, a freshman who is much shyer compared to the others. She does go by another persona early in the series so watching her sometimes may remind you just how different her two personalities are.

Between the guys, a main selling point in the show is the character chemistry. Regardless whether you like it or not, there’s an abundance amount of humor when the guys interact with each other and it often comes off as absurd humor. The most prominent is between Iori and Kohei. They are often observant but says things that may be interpreted in the wrong way. They often get into trouble with the women in the show too given their actions that disregards common sense. The two also gets into many bickering moments. Early in the series, the series also makes fun of the guys with porn jokes. And let’s not forget about the drinking. Pretty every male character in the series loves to drink whether it’s alcohol, beer, vodka, wine, or whiskey. As you may expect from action that results in consequences, the guys behave like drunks while stripping naked and causing questionable scenes. The series pokes fun at this type of adult humor by covering their private body parts with black censored circles. It’s the type of self-aware humor that you’ll witness quite often.

So now what? Is this series just a giant ball of meaningless humor? Or is it something more deceptive that people misunderstands? To me, Grand Blue stands out as a show that deals with adult gimmicks and stereotypes but makes it into a humorous flick. It seems like a popcorn entertainment and you’re not wrong if it feels like the story went nowhere in the end. However, the shows knows how it operates and inserts every joke with a clear intention. The guys in the series acts bold and behaves in ways that wild college students do. The girls are slightly mild but it doesn’t detract them from getting into the party on occasions. There’s a lot of running gags with the drinking jokes, nakedness, and misunderstandings. It’s what the series uses to sell its humor. If you’re in it for actual diving, there are some moments too with info dumps. Don’t expect this like a relaxing slice of life as it’s far too hyperactive to be considered as such though. Watch this for the pure entertainment and forget common logic. That way, you’ll grow to love Grand Blue.

Also the animation is consistent thankfully the studio managed to step up to the plate and capture the magic for this show. It deserved a glorious quality and got treated such way with the beach setting, aquatic ocean, and sunny atmosphere. Character designs also feels real with the cast looking like they are college students (although Aina sometimes makes me question this) Fan service is literally in every episode but they take the extreme during party scenes and drinking segments. Finally, I love the way characters reacts that pushes the envelope to the extreme. Iori and Kohei are prime examples of this while others such as Chisa and Nanaka also have their own moments.

The voice actors, in this show, must be mentioned because they have to put so much energy for so many scenes that requires: screaming out of lungs, playing serious in a stupid act, and playing the straight man of course. It's not easy to voice act, but they have some very familiar voice actors that fits very well with each character. Opening is very catchy and it gives out this ""dive vibe"" The ending of the anime however reflects how absurd, weird and funny the anime is, Iori and the others are in the Karaoke booth then we see Iori and Kohei sing while the other two guys scream their lungs out and after they finished the song all of them stripped and got naked. Pretty fucking amazing right?.

Grand Blue is not for everyone, but it does deliver the college type of feel and I kinda skipped the part about diving in this review. Let's be honest.. this anime might look like about diving, but it's mostly focused on character interactions and how you should view your life as student in college. Animation are very nicely done and can be wonky at times, but that shouldn't really stop you from watching it. This show is a must try! If you are a college student or you just love comedy, this show is for you!
As a fan of the manga, I think Grand Blue established itself as a self-aware humorous showstopper. Taking the risk of glorifying its humor made this show look like a joke at first glance. However, once you get sucked into Grand Blue’s themes, you’ll find love with this show. From the adult humor to the numerous character gags, it’s an anime that plays with itself. It’s a Summer sensation."
100668,"Have you ever been excited to watch a dumpster fire? You know, that special kind of train wreck that reaches so bad it’s good territory, or the legendary ""schlock"" status”? It’s rare to find such titles in the current anime market, as Big Order and Inuyashiki are some of the last ones out there at the time of writing. Most bad anime are just frustrating or boring, especially when it comes to the prevalence of bad isekai anime. With episode 1 at least, Arifureta seemed to have done the impossible. It had become something so legendarily awful that it would be remembered as the best so bad it’s good anime of the year. Imagine my shock, my awe when we were told that isekai finally had a Big Order to call its own. 

Imagine my grief when Arifureta quickly went from the most gloriously awful anime of the year to the worst I’ve seen all year. Barring a few tolerable moments, the more the show went on, the more dreadful the experience became. Even when I thought I grew numb to whatever the show threw at me, it would always find a new way to make the viewing experience worse. I felt betrayed, as did fans when the premiere dropped. Now that this anime has ended, it’s time I get a little payback.

Let’s start with the least awful aspect of the anime, that being the music. The background OST, whenever it's actually present, is either fairly decent or downright awful. A lot of these tracks (inserts included, of which there are four and only one of them works) don’t even fit the scenes they’re put in half the time. Let that put into perspective how low a bar I’ve set for this anime. As for the OP, it’s trash with an obnoxious saxophone and weird autotune, as well as an awful trap beats section right before the chorus. The worst part is that the moody piano and violin combo at the beginning makes the track inviting, like a siren or a succubus luring you into your untimely demise. Barring an admittedly decent insert song in episode 5, my only other compliment to the music is that the ED, “Hajime no Uta” by DracoVirgo is actually pretty good. One could call it a generic sort of soothing ending theme meant to give the viewers a breather after whatever whirlwind any given episode puts them through. On the other hand, with vocals and instrumentals this inviting, I don’t care. It invokes something sweet, almost nostalgic at points. That said, one can only be so positive here given that we are talking about one of the worst anime anyone cares about this year. 

Speaking of worst things I’ve seen all year, the visuals in this anime are some of the worst to come out of 2019. The character designs (the better ones, at least) are inoffensive enough but that should not be my highest genuine compliment beyond some of the girls being attractive. Even then, the MC’s design is so ridiculous that it’s almost endearing. Sadly, the insanely bold and bright colors damage even that, especially when you consider that the show has to swap from these characters being barely visible in a cave so dark you can barely see a thing, to bright daylight. The contrast with all this in mind is downright eye-searing, so much so that I often needed to squint to the point of closing my eyes in order for my eyes to stop hurting. When you couple this with how poorly drawn, borderline melted their faces are at times, and how comically the show likes to distort the main character’s face, it all just becomes an aesthetic nightmare. It takes 5 episodes for us to reach a setting where the color palette works to the point where the characters aren’t too dark or bright to look at. Even then it sometimes crosses over into squint territory whenever the lighting remotely increases, and the colors are so much brighter in the side characters that they almost feel too bright in the dark labyrinth. To finally get away from the color and brightness complaints, we have the monster designs. They’re ugly as sin both in 2D and 3D. The 2D animation itself is...there. Don’t expect to see it too much and even then, it feels stilted whenever it is there a lot of the time. There are moments where it’s unbelievable like when Hajime unveils his giant rifle in episode 4 and you can see the wrappings linger and only move once every half second. I am not exaggerating. There are two factors that influence the awkward feel of the 2D animation, and they’re the three most noticeably awful aspects of the production: editing, direction, and CGI.

The CGI is child’s play for any anime fan to pick at. The models and are so bad and jarring that any scene with them automatically looks like shit. Their movements are practically nonexistent as well, just being thrown and dragged around wherever the anime pleases. The worst part is that this Berserk 2016 and Overlord-tier CGI is almost as abundant as the 2D visuals of the show, and if both are done terribly, imagine how horribly they blend together. Actually, by the time we get to the hydra in episode 4, it’s safe to say the CG in this anime is Skelter Heaven tier. The abysmal directing exacerbates the problem, as entire shots and camera movements make absolutely no sense, especially in the OP, which is such a monumental train wreck of horrendous visuals and transitions it’s impossible for me to do it justice. Whenever the show isn’t forcing head-scratchingly bizarre shots, everything is just lifeless. The action has no choreography whatsoever and for some reason, the shots have absolutely no flow to them, especially in the first episode. This is where the editing comes in. Characters are constantly teleporting for no reason and while yes, the MC learns a quick step teleportation power, that’s entirely different from the characters randomly and abruptly being in a completely different location or part of a scene for no particular reason. Characters look one way and other characters, monsters, or objects are moving from somewhere other than where the characters are looking at, causing whiplash as we scramble to piece together what’s going on. Entire scene transitions amount to nothing but a fake-out before the same scene abruptly cuts to flashback or to present day. I don’t even wanna tell you how the show fucks up visual gags with shitty zooms and cheap “animation”. These problems are a constant with the show, and while they do enough damage to the visuals as is, they’re also inherently an issue with presentation. Bad presentation can really damage one’s narrative, as this show proudly demonstrates.

The writing in this so bad on so many levels that we have to tackle it in three different ways. First is how the presentation turns the first episode into an incomprehensible shitshow. Then we have how the presentation turns the entire narrative into a jumbled mess. Lastly, there’s how the writing is generic at best and frankly pathetic at worst. I won’t even come close to hitting everything but there’s more than enough for you to get the gist of these issues several times over. I hope you enjoy my extensive coverage and journey of this hellspawn. 

For starters, the main character just assumes someone sabotaged him because one of the magic laser blasts in a volley of magic collided and ended up hitting him cuz it was misfired, and because we (barely) see a guy smirking for a brief second. First off, how in God’s name did the MC even see the guy while being assaulted by bright lights, one of which basically hit him? He couldn’t. On top of that, since he could have only seen the volleys of light, and the visuals communicate that one of them just ran into another and hit him due to that collision making it go off course, how did he not see it as anything other than an accident? Sure, he was on death’s door before becoming the white-haired, gunslinging edgelord we know now so of course he feels resent for his situation and would like to blame someone, but the anime presents it as if he knows exactly what happened. WE barely know what’s going on, which is a problem in and of itself! This is a common problem throughout the show, even when it temporarily stops being borderline impossible to follow...at least until the penultimate episode tries its valiant hand at in medias res storytelling one last time and making time and events impossible to follow. There’s almost no context or connective tissue between scenes in this first arc, and entire episodes throughout.

My condolences to anyone who thought they could get into the franchise with this anime because context is not a concept this show understands. Sure, it presents a ton of flashbacks that technically explain on some level how the MC got to where he is, but we have no context for why he and those who teleported with him are doing what they’re doing, or how many of them got there. We barely even know jack or shit about the most basic aspects of the world or character relationships because the anime doesn’t bother explaining any of that and we’re just hit with contextless, incohesive montages, and sequences of characters fighting in dungeons. The sheer lack of personality beyond the most basic of caricature characterization only worsens the issue. Even worse is the fact that the flashbacks are erratically placed, sometimes appearing after a scene that necessitated the flashback beforehand makes a transition, sometimes without any transitions to speak of and without the scene prior even requiring the flashback in any capacity. Vital pieces of information are either relegated to throwaway lines or downright nonexistent, so it’s not like rewatching a second time or thinking about it more will suddenly illuminate everything for you. Doing so somehow leads to more questions. That, in turn, forces you to assume things and go out of your way to try to figure out where anything is in relation to its environment, which kills any semblance of joy you could have just laughing at how jumbled everything is. This is the premiere of your anime for God’s sake! If you want to start in medias res, you have to do it in a way where things make enough sense by the end of it that it isn’t a disorienting, incoherent mess. Otherwise, you end up with this glorious train wreck, one I wish lasted longer than a single episode.

Immediately after episode 1, the show just becomes this obnoxious, tiresome mess as it swaps between perspectives no one gives a shit about, not even going far to make the action sequences with our now mental protagonist exciting in the least. Hell, he loses all of the hilariously crazy edge he had to him, just becoming a no-nonsense tsundere character who points out predictable tropes in this cliche fantasy land while purposely going in the opposite direction of where he needs to in order to even begin getting home. He fell to the 65th floor and instead of going back up he goes down 50 floors in a 100-floor labyrinth. Soon after you start to question that, he reaches what seems like the 100th floor in order to fight a boss and free a vampire loli caricature before they head down even more floors to the actual 100th floor. If that doesn’t make any sense, don’t worry, none of this does! Hell, even when they answer why he’s going down with him wanting to get stronger, we have to ask...why is he even bothering when all he has/wants to do is leave and have nothing to do with anything? There are other easy contradictions and logic problems to pick at within this whole excursion, but you get the point. Also, the way they cut between this and the scenes of the other characters coming back is dreadful as there’s no cohesion, and again, they barely expand on the important context we need to understand what is going on and why, just dumping more and more lore on us and presenting more abilities that are sometimes inconsistent cuz we need the MC to do something cool, or otherwise seemingly irrelevant to what he should be learning. 

Speaking of inconsistent, it takes until episode 3 before the show settles on establishing a concrete personality for our MC-kun, or Hajime, if you will. It didn’t even set one up to be broken in the first place because that would require competent writing. We’ll touch back on that real soon. Episode 4 has an insufferable number of death fake-outs which include a contrived scenario where the main character gets blasted nearly to death and only after the monster trying to kill them fires again several seconds later does his partner put up a force field. Said force field is also inconsistent about attacks getting through it and then the rest of the fight sequence is told out of order for no reason. The pair also arbitrarily kiss multiple times because we need nonsensical faux emotional beats, as if there aren’t enough in this episode. I could go on about the asspulls, inconsistencies, and forced drama for the sake of emotional manipulation, but you get the point. 

Pacing is another gigantic issue with this anime. Apart from how badly episode 1 utilizes flashbacks, the show has a dismal time deciding what to show and when. It often skips or montages relevant progression, like Hajime’s journey towards being an “edgelord badass”, or the offscreen training his classmates did after their collective failure in the first episode. We don’t even see how or when Hajime gets everything he needs to complete his character design, as we’re instead forced to assume what happened. The two month time skip in episode 5, the fight the classmates have with the enemies they had trouble with in episode 1, and the aforementioned incoherent ordering of events in the second half of episode 4’s big emotional action sequence serve as further examples of how bad the pacing and storytelling is past the first episode. Nothing feels earned from any emotional standpoint due to both these storytelling reasons and the general lack of decent writing, whether that be the classmates in episode 5 overcoming the CGI monsters that gave everyone hell in episode 1, or any of the big moments in episode 4.

All of this sounds bad enough, but it gets even worse when you understand what this anime is trying to be. It’s a light novel adaptation with intents on providing wish-fulfillment via presenting a dark, brooding, angsty yet (selectively) compassionate main character for angsty teenagers to relate to, all while surrounding him with character archetypes, including tons of waifus. They somehow managed to fuck this up so spectacularly that it actually fails at being just generic and trite and becomes an absolute disaster. I’ve complained about shows that fail to even be generic like The Asterisk War, but that was solely on the writing being so broken that it manages to fuck up the easiest of things and make no-effort plots feel convoluted and nonsensical. Arifureta is so horrendously constructed and presented that it’s actually incomprehensible at times. At best, I can say that this show technically did succeed at creating a bunch of archetypes like the classmates and harem girls our main character, Hajime has to deal with. They still didn’t even succeed at properly establishing, breaking, then revamping our main character. Also, no one is even remotely likable, and their interactions are obnoxious, which seems like a given. The only interesting thing about Hajime and the first girl he gets with is that both of them suffer some kind of abandonment and betrayal issues, but again, both characters are hollow, and nothing is told well so it’s difficult to care. Their lack of chemistry makes the emotional character and relationship moments of episode 4 particularly jarring and laughable. By the time we get the gag of Hajime accidentally clenching Yue's butt in bed, I knew that if they told this story properly, it would still be a disaster. It wouldn’t be as corrosive as it is now, but it would still be a tiresome, badly produced, practically broken mess of a show I’d want nothing to do with. If they stuck to making a hilariously jumbled mess that goes all-in on that “edge factor”, then it would be at least amusing. No one wins when the show fails at going both ways, as if the second arc didn’t make it clear that no one involved is coming out of this ok. 

Once the first arc concludes after 5 episodes, the series doesn't exactly get better. While the remainder of the show isn’t as broken as the first half (including this sixth episode), it basically stops trying to set itself apart in any way, shape, or form from its contemporaries minus the one small plot thread that lingers throughout, that thread being Hajime’s bitterness towards those who betrayed him. From here on out, the main duo shuffles between absolute pieces of shit and begrudgingly compliant assholes that do things because they’re strung along by the slowly emerging pieces of Hajime’s harem. Obviously, asshole characters forced to lay off the edge and do something worthwhile don’t have to be intolerable but given how annoying the rest of the harem is and given how broken the existing caricatures are, the experience becomes significantly more corrosive than ever before. The conflict the second harem member introduces at the start of episode 6 gets resolved, and the rest of the episode is just montages and dicking around before the main characters have to leave. Said second member, Shea, is her own level of destructive at first. She’s not only annoying on her own, but she brings out a new level of dickishness within the main duo that makes their early interactions some of the worst I’ve seen in any harem or anime period. The interactions do get better rather quickly given that the very next episode gives Shea a time to shine, so at least that’s one bit of positivity in the midst of this sea of bile. To quickly leave that reprieve, I’ll mention that backstory is also pointlessly shoehorned in as it has no connection to anything. It might be one of the most insufferable backstories I’ve seen since it only exists to hamfistedly reinforce the idea of “the outcasts coming together and not being so alone in this world” and tell us Shea’s goddamn name. It’s almost as soul-crushing as the episode itself whose only purpose is to introduce a new, big-tittied waifu, and to set up a point which our main characters will have to return to before completing four more labyrinths which the previous episode established. This is our end goal for the show, and where even many fans of the source material feel the show has gone to shit. Need I say more?

Actually, I do, so I’ll just go through the second half of the show in a more rapid-fire fashion. This review is overly long as it is, and that’s without devolving into a ton of nitpicks like how Shea arbitrarily has a change of clothes somehow between two scenes early in episode 7. Said episode is probably the best episode, as we actually get to see Shea beating people six ways to Sunday and prove her worth to the team after all the shit everyone and their mother gives her. It actually reminds me that sometimes these characters have the potential to be compelling, even if the blatant fanservice gags feel shoehorned in at times even considering her appearance and purpose. On top of that, the way they get jettisoned out of the second labyrinth (yes they got there already because pacing is not something this anime cares about) is actually pretty amusing. From then onwards, it’s back to getting the Steph treatment for her, as if using the absolute worst character dynamic from No Game No Life but with a character who is actually obnoxious this time makes it better than when the aforementioned 2014 anime did it. Episode 8 is a tedious reunion episode with some of Hajime's peers, albeit not the ones he has any beef with. Outside of the arbitrary bit of moment a tertiary character has with Shea, the only bit of note is Hajime's equally arbitrary lore dump he gives as a reason to why he won't come back with everyone. He doesn't even care about this, stating to the person offering him a guaranteed way home that he just wants to find some maverick keys so he can leave. It would have been more interesting and in character for him to just say that he wants nothing to do with some of his classmates.

Episode 9 has a moment meant to make Hajime give an angry pep talk to someone about life, which is meant to be an emotionally resonant and inspiring moment, except dismal pacing, a lack of time, and a lack of exploration of this side of Hajime renders this scene moot. Tio Klarus (ok, why do the subs not match the MAL or AL names again?) makes her appearance this episode to round out the “I love Mr. Edgelord Man” party. She’s the masochist of the group, which we learn firsthand in the most embarrassing sequence I have dealt with all year. Apart from all the masochism nonsense, her nice design, and the fact that the anime can’t keep her nail size consistent within the first scene she’s in her human form, she’s boring and obnoxious. I’m done with the episodic play by play. You get the point and I refuse to cover any more of this now that we have all of the relevant characters out now, 2/3 into the anime’s runtime. You can already deduce that there’s nothing left to talk about and that it’s yet more obnoxious LN cliche gauntlets and insufferable character interactions from the diet version of the Konosuba cast and friends. There’s a bad guy and then another evil lord to be stopped, and we’re gonna meet Kaori and her female swordsman friend from early in the series again because they love Hajime as well and we need to fully assemble the harem by the end of the series all while getting sidetracked with more side quests and lolis! This review is long enough as it is, and I’ve wasted enough of both your time and mine! Fuck everything and everyone! Time for final thoughts!

The saddest part isn’t even that this is one of the biggest anime of its season. It’s that this show was delayed by a whopping 15 months. Imagine how much worse it could have been if we got to see it in its original state! The fact that the original author stated ""Every time I was sent scripts and storyboards for the anime over these past few months, I writhed in pain in my room” back in January of 2018 makes that bizarre, alternate reality all the more tantalizing. Perhaps it could have been less incompetent given how there was a different director and team before the shift. Perhaps it could have been even worse given how bland the art style of the original plans looked. Still, it’s hard not to feel bad for everyone involved, fans included. At the same time, it’s hard not to point and laugh at what a dumpster fire this show is before later hating what it became. What it became is a bland, fugly, shitty isekai with nothing to offer but shock value from seeing blood and gore and a crazy turned boring tsun jerkass with a heart of gold. I’d actually recommend watching Re:Zero at that point, disregarding my disdain towards that show. You might even have a better time with Shield Hero, I dunno. Just don’t watch this, not even for the occasional bright spot it may have. Obviously, the manga and LN readers aren’t happy, and people like me who wanted that ironic entertainment are left just as disappointed. Barring those with Digibro’s specific tastes, it pleases no one but the most accepting of anime fans who just wanna see a gunslinging underdog get a harem. The only remaining exceptions are those who are willing to trudge through anything that has the theme of defying a world that hates them, and those who adore the art of baffling, broken direction. If that doesn’t meet the criteria for “so bad it’s horrible”, I don’t know what will. 

I wish this was just a single episode OVA instead so we could have ourselves a modern-day Mars of Destruction. It would probably have even worse reception, but it wouldn’t be this pathetic or worthless, and I wouldn’t feel like a donkey after watching it. Now I’m left angrier at myself for being duped than I am at this piece of shit for promising ironic entertainment in a fantasy subgenre devoid of any kind of entertainment value, and then spitting in my face. I’m angrier about that than I am about the show frequently throwing away or otherwise undercutting the potential it constantly brings up for itself, as unbelievable as the phrase “this show has potential” might seem to many here. The review you’re reading right now is the only reason I finished this humiliating train wreck which has been mildly amusing (dare I say endearing) at best and unbearable at worst. Perhaps this show wanted to make it clear that I’m not allowed to have fun with these types of shows anymore, and that any bright spots like the occasionally decent character moment, are just flukes.

Eh, what can you do? Even Big Order stopped being funny bad at some point.

153288,"Kaiju No. 8 is your brand-new Shounen anime of 2024, and it has delivered quite a huge impression in and of itself. Amidst the abundance of heavy-hitting shounen shows from the last 2 years, from the reach of Demon Slayer to the masses, insane action sequences of Jujutsu Kaisen, and manga fans’s favorites finally getting an adaptation from Chainsaw Man, Undead Unluck, and Hell's Paradise, what does Kaiju No. 8 offer that makes itself stand out amidst the crowded shounen titles?

 simple

Kaiju Battle Sequences
 


If you're a fan of a continuous action series where it never lets you go from the eccentric and insane action sequences, then this show has got you covered, with each episode offering one of the most entertaining and engaging action sequences, including Kaiju Battles that's difficult to look away from. Added with the fantastic animation sequences that's leveling with the heavier-hitting Shounen battles, Production I.G. Animation staff have put a lot of care into minute detail, from the details of Kaiju Monsters to the heavy punches it gives, resulting in an engaging and beautiful action anime that gets action fans hooked.
 
In addition to that, our main character Kafka Hibino (Masaya Fukunishi) brings a full-centric comic relief character and puts him at the center, carrying the series on his shoulders, and he does it well. This results in many comedic moments that can give you a chuckle or two, but also has humanity inside that you can easily root for him. The side characters in this series mainly serve as support for our main character, whether dynamically on screen or motivationally, but they're still fun enough to watch along the ride.


 
On viewing, Kaiju No. 8 has the ingredients to be a perfect action anime, rivaling the heavy hitters of Shounen. However, exploring deeper and giving thought to the plot points of the series exposes different amounts of duct-taped cracks that you just couldn't ignore. For instance, the entire Kaiju mythology has largely been unexplored to the point where you really don't know what these Kaiju want with the world, not to mention that there are human-Kaiju hybrids that were just shown to exist in the world as if it's a normal phenomenon rather than the suspension of mystery within its existence as the series it wants to convey to it. The entire world of the show pretends to be as big as it actually is but never fully commits to the concepts it tries to show the audience.


 
Aside from the amazing action and animation, the first season of Kaiju No. 8 offers nothing more than any other battle shounen. It's not the worst thing in the world, as other anime have one hook of a quirk that unfortunately cannot redeem the other points that drag the show down. But Kaiju No. 8's animation is solely carrying this heavily flawed series inside a half-baked world. You just have to consume what it shows you as a battle action series rather than what it promises to be."
146984,"This Review Contains Spoiler for Attack On Titan The Final Season Part 3 Cour 1

Note: This is the first review I have ever made so there might be some mistakes, and this is mainly more like my opinion than a review

Attack On Titan is back, and safe to say, it is amazing.

After what feels like an eternity of waiting, it's finally here. This is gonna be once again, another controversial adaptation due to the anime getting closer and closer to the final chapters of the manga, which is hated by a portion of the fanbase. Like adding fuel to fire, the decision of spilting part 3 of season 4 into 2 smaller parts pretty much have everyone (including myself) wondering what the studio is even thinking, and tbh I even think that this is just a cheap method of marketing coming from MAPPA. Seriously, ""The Final Season Part 3 Part 2""? That just seems ridiculous.

However, all of that aside, it's obvious that Quality is always what we care about the most, and honestly, I think mappa truly nailed it this time. Why, you may ask? Well..

As someone who has read the last 9 chapters of the manga, there are a surprising amount of anime-original content in this episode, specifically the Rumbling sequence, seeing everyone desperately running for their lives, crying, screaming and getting trampled on are truly terrifying, along with the incredibly eerie music makes this whole sequence send chills down my spine, it really shows how devastating the rumbling is, and how Eren is committing literal genocide. 

The pacing of the episode also feels a lot slower and more drawn out than the manga too due to there being lots of new scenes, which will be beneficial for the plot overall too. The animation also is very consistent and I didn't spot any badly drawn scene, the music that plays during Hange's final fight to buy time for the scouts is pretty emotional. The ODM sequence of Hange killing the colossal titans is probably the smoothest ODM scene that MAPPA has done so far, really gives off WIT's vibes back in season 1 to 3. They beautifully animated her catching on fire and fell down to the ground, sacrificing her life for the Scouts to move on. 

The Paths scene was also great, MAPPA truly took their time to drew even the smallest details like the branches of the Paths trees, making it look a lot like the manga. The whole episode overall is beautifully taken care of in basically every frame, and I truly think people need to chill with the hate towards MAPPA (not talking about them overworking their staffs), sure this whole spilting up the final season is ridiculous and such but if this is the end product, then honestly I don't really mind.

Really hope the staffs working on aot are getting enough rest, because it's surprising how good this episode came out despite their tight as fuck work schedule.

This is undeniably the best season of aot so far."

Zom 100 was one of the most hyped anime for the summer season, created by the minds of Haro Aso and Koutaro Takata. I was really excited about this anime and read the manga. 





So, what is this anime about? Zom 100 is about a guy named Akira Tendo. He gets his dream job at a production company. He develops a crush on a cute girl, and things seem to be going well. It’s not only that he eventually realizes that the company he is working for is exploitative. He works long shifts, barely gets any rest, and his boss is a complete asshole. Akira suffers for three years of his life until one day, he wakes up in a zombie apocalypse. However, instead of being scared for his life, he’s happy because he no longer has to work. He then decides to make a list of 100 things he wants to do before becoming a zombie. 



This anime takes on a more positive POV of people going through a zombie apocalypse, completely different from what’s shown in the first few seconds of the first episode when Akira is watching a zombie movie. It’s a very interesting concept. We get to meet many interesting characters like Kencho, Shizuka, and Beatrix throughout the series. As he continues to gather more of the gang, he goes on a lot of adventures and does fun activities like surf yoga, dining at a sushi restaurant, and taking a nice dip in a hot spring. There’s also character some character development between the group, especially for Shizuka.

The art in this anime is amazing. You can tell right off the bat that Bug Studios put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into animating this. I like how they use black and white when showing feelings of sadness, frustration, and misery. It then switches back to using colors when things start to get exciting. The use of colors, little transitions in between scenes, and special effects were awesome. The animation was very good, and so was the music. It was like watching a movie at the cinema. 




The only thing I dislike about this anime ( and I think many will agree with me on this ) is the delays. This series has gone through multiple delays and an indefinite hiatus due to production issues. It sucks seeing an anime you were so excited for suddenly have delayed episodes and lose its hype. Regardless, we must remember that this is a completely new studio. Unless you want the animators to go through what Akira did, they aren’t robots and deserve breaks. I think it’s also better to prioritize quality over quantity. I’d rather have delayed, high-quality episodes than have a studio produce crappy ones weekly. 


In conclusion, this anime is very enjoyable. A fun horror comedy that will get you on the edge of your seat and, at the same time, laugh your socks off."
113717,"Contains very minor spoilers. Anything relatively major has been tagged appropriately. As always though, this review isn’t suitable for those who want to go into this anime completely blind.

I don’t think I was the only one who’d never even heard the name “Ranking of Kings” until the day this show started. Even as an avid manga reader and someone who likes to keep up with new anime announcements, it just wasn’t something I’d ever even heard of in passing, let alone actually stumbled across.

So why, as we’ve all started to wonder, has this anime suddenly become so huge? How did it manage to cement its place in so many people’s favourites before it’d even finished airing? How did it get me so invested in its characters and world within the first 15 minutes of its pilot’s runtime?

It achieved some insane feats during its run, so I hope you'll join me as I go through them one by one.

In this world, there’s a mysterious organisation that decides the global ranking of each kingdom’s king, and grants he who is ranked #1 one treasure of his choice from the Divine Treasure Vault. To date, every king who has entered has picked the same treasure, and then gone insane.

We witness the story of Bojji, a deaf, mute, and almost completely powerless prince who is the first born son of Bosse, king of the Bosse Kingdom and #7 in the rankings. Bosse is widely acknowledged as the strongest man in the world, and Bojji dreams of becoming like him despite his weakness and disability.

The whole kingdom openly ridicules Bojji for his ambition, but Bojji is always able to put up a smile through this and never fights back. One day, he meets a creature called Kage, the final remnant of the wiped-out shadow clan, and, after a few hiccups, the two become friends. Kage is touched by Bojji’s kindness, its genuineness reaching him because he himself had been exploited and abused for most of his life, and swears to become his loyal companion.

Sounds interesting already, right?

Ranking of Kings presents us with a setting and a premise that I dare say is almost impossible to not get invested in. Even in the first episode we’re given such an in-depth impression of the show’s world and how it’s built, even though we’re hardly given any specifics about its history or wider cast of characters off the bat. It builds this intrigue through its immaculate execution of this factor, and ropes us all in through its storytelling and quirky series composition.

The plot, of course, only becomes more and more interesting as more of its mysteries are unravelled. I’d been following it since its pilot, and week on week it consistently had me at the edge of my seat, always disappointed when episodes ended and excited for what next week would bring. What truly made it so interesting to me personally was its unpredictability, as every single character has a different set of motivations and unseen sides to their personality that contribute to the wider narrative, and it slowly compiles all of these different threads of the story into one big plotline before we reach the series’ climax, which, by the way, has some of the most nut-worthy episode and animation direction I think I have ever seen.

Without saying too much and wandering off into spoiler territory, the narrative of Ranking of Kings is one of my favourites possibly of all time just because of how well it handles its world and characters. I love stories that slowly reveal background information and the reasoning behind a greater conspiracy throughout the plot itself, and this anime did that absolutely perfectly. The way it loops back around to different plotlines right as you think they’ve been forgotten? Immaculate. The way it keeps world aspects such as the rankings relevant without constantly shoving them down our throats? Divine. Even the blatant tone shift we witness in the show’s second cour doesn’t feel unnatural because of the amount of build-up we’d gradually been fed throughout the first.

Ranking of Kings was nothing like how I’d expected it to be after coming out of episode one, but I mean this in the absolute best way possible.

I do have my complaints though, which I unfortunately have to add after watching episode 22. 

!While I don’t dislike how the anime ended, I very much dislike part of the journey it took to complete several of the characters’ arcs at the end of the narrative. If you know me, you’ll know that the one thing I hate more than almost anything else is unfounded ships with no truly romantic buildup, and that is exactly what Daida’s proposal to Miranjo felt like. I don’t want to delve too deep into it because this is supposed to be a general review and not a “the anime’s over so let’s bash the final episodes” free-for-all, but I know for a fact I’m not the only one who reacted exactly as Hilling did when Daida dropped that bomb right after his release from gay baby jail. Poor Despa and Desha as well.I don’t particularly consider this to be the end of the world though, and since it’s only one complaint out of 23 episodes that’s based on a personal pet-peeve, it’s not major enough to truly affect my enjoyment of and overall score I gave to this anime. It’s just something I really, really hope we eventually receive clarity and more development around in a future season, because I honestly do want to learn to love Daida and Miranjo just as I have with every other character Ranking of Kings has flung at me. Perhaps it just won’t happen until a little further down the line.!

I’ve mentioned this a little already, but the characters are something that absolutely shone in Ranking of Kings for me. Its cast is actually bordering ensemble levels in size, but that’s just not something you notice because absolutely none of the relevant characters are lacking in development. All of them have a different character arc and a set of goals that we get to see them try to accomplish throughout the story, and it’s fascinating to watch how some of these motives change through their interactions with each other. It feels like we as an audience truly get to know all of them, all of their struggles and emotions, which is part of why Ranking of Kings is so stand-out compared to your average bog-standard fantasy kingdom anime that revolves around three or four mains with a group of underdeveloped side characters that come and go because of plot or, well, whatever excuse writers want to use for not bothering to at least try to develop their wider cast.

I’m going to avoid individually reviewing any of the characters because really most of the fun comes from discovering them yourself through the show, but you can absolutely take my word that it’ll be very difficult to hate any of them by the time you finish episode 23. Even the most initially evil-seeming characters become understandable by the time you learn of their pasts or watch them walk in their futures ready to atone for their mistakes, and this is what makes them all feel so human despite the fact that a solid chunk of them aren’t even humans at all. They’re perfectly imperfect and their struggles are so relatable sometimes that you just want to reach in and hug them through the screen, and don’t even get me started on the bond we witness form between Bojji and Kage because I am never going to admit that I got emotionally invested in a fucking black blob so hard I was crying by the end of the second episode, nuh-uh.

Ranking of Kings is ultimately a story about empowerment, but through its characters it also gives you this feeling of perpetual forgiveness and the sense that it’s not too late to become and live as a better person even if you can barely forgive yourself sometimes. And this, I think, is what makes it as beautiful as it is.

There’ll be at least a few people reading this who were initially put off Ranking of Kings because of its art style. And I’ll be the first to say it: I don’t blame you.

Ranking of Kings is an example of an anime that really doesn’t look like an anime at all in a traditional sense, and is stylised to look far more simplistic and fairy tale-esque. It looks like it’s jumped right out of a story book you read in second grade, which might be off-putting to some, especially considering some of the substantially less story bookish themes it covers through its story. 

But honestly? It works for the kind of show Ranking of Kings wants to be.

The simplicity of it almost accentuates the horror of some of its gorier scenes and serves to be a surprisingly good contrast to its darker narrative. As much as I adore more realistic and detailed art like Urasawa’s or Miura’s when it comes to series that deal with more serious themes, Ranking of Kings’ simplicity actually serves to contribute to how serious it can get at times, and, despite my initial tentativeness towards its visuals, I never once found myself thinking “this would look so much better if it was drawn in a more typically anime style” while I was watching. Mixing darker themes with what looks like a stereotypically childish art style actually works supremely well here, and it creates a lasting impression as well as a new kind of naive atmosphere around the show, which reflects its tone immaculately. 

The animation is also beautifully fluid, which is something we perhaps need to thank the simplistic style for, and some of the fight scenes the show pushes out are honestly on par with if not better than those you can find in mainstream shonen anime. It’s clear that a lot of care has been taken around composing the art and tonally allowing it to fit into the narrative, which is true in a visual sense as well, because the show has this certain aesthetic to it that holds true for its entire run. Something I adore specifically is the watercolour feel of the backgrounds, since it compliments the cartoonish animation and style and really does make Ranking of Kings feel like the tale of a young prince.

I really can’t fault it, so I just want to say to any people here who are as tentative as I initially was about watching this anime because of its art that it’s worth it and is absolutely something you’ll grow to love.

I don’t have a lot to say here, but then again I never really do because the answer’s always the same: the voice acting is impeccable and I have absolutely no complaints.

I remember going into Ranking of Kings wondering how they were going to go about handing the voice acting performance for a deaf character who can’t really speak—I’ve only seen this done once before and I don’t think I need to tell you what movie it was in—so newcomer Minami Hinata’s ability to encapsulate Bojji’s speech as she does came as a pleasant surprise to me, and once again showcases how much care and thought has been put into this anime from all angles. I have no idea if it’s particularly accurate to real life, but it still felt oxymoronically true to me and is an endearing contribution to Bojji’s overall realism and lovability as a character.

The other character’s voices are equally amazing, emotional in all the right places and all perfectly fitting their respective characters in terms of pitch and tone, and I think it’s wonderful that such a diverse cast came together to bring all of these beloved characters to life and contribute to making them as beloved as they are.

Here’s a confession: music was the sole reason I actually started watching Ranking of Kings. I remember a friend of mine sending me a tweet that listed the first cour’s theme songs and me subsequently going apeshit when I saw that King Gnu was writing the opening. I’ve loved King Gnu even before I witnessed their work on Banana Fish, and naturally they lived up to my expectations.

The first opening, King Gnu’s BOY, fits the initial character of Bojji absolutely perfectly. It’s a banger of a song, and it’s coupled with some beautifully-composed animation that allows us to explore the world through the eyes of Bojji and Kage. It’s a rare case of a song being so carefully constructed around a series without outright being about the series that it just feels genius, and I’m glad the band put so much into making it so for the sake of this anime. And, once again, it fucking slaps.

The second opening, Vaundy’s Hadaka no Yusha (or “Hero Laid Bare” in English) is one that blew me completely away the second I first watched it. I remember saying to that same friend immediately after I’d watched it that it was going to be the best opening released in 2022, and so far I still stand by that. It is absolutely immaculate. The animation is Kaikai Kitan levels of pure, uncontrollable sexiness and at this point I think it’s impossible for me to ever skip it, I just have to watch it the whole way through every time it’s on so I can fawn over how pretty it is. It conveys the series’ tone shift onto its more dark narrative beautifully, and also represents the change in Bojji’s character as he’s wrapped up in all of these conspiracies. The song itself is also just the type you’d want to loop for hours to cry and/or headbang to because it’s Vaundy and Vaundy is incredible.

I have substantially less to say about the ending themes and OST because I’m both a chronic ed skipper and a voice actor hyperfixator, but I really can’t find much flaw with either of them either. The softness of the endings in contrast to the action-packed openings is beautiful and encapsulates the anime’s gentler themes perfectly, and the OST is subtle enough to not intrude upon emotional, voice-heavy scenes while still being strong enough to build tension and poignance where it’s required to.

On the whole? The music is utterly fantastic. All of it is very fitting for the type of series Ranking of Kings is, and the theme songs are some of the best I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing in a while. Full marks.

I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to call Ranking of Kings a masterpiece. Sure, it can’t really compete with all-time classics like Fullmetal Alchemist and Steins;Gate yet, but that doesn’t mean it can’t join the two on the podium of “holy shit, this show absolutely fucks,” and I can say for sure it’s not something any of us will be forgetting in a hurry.

There were a lot of shows that were released last year and very few of them stood out to me like Ranking of Kings did. It’s fresh and new and unafraid to deal with themes every other mediaeval kingdom fantasy anime tend to shy away from, and it’s this aspect of it that immediately makes it stand out in the best way, though of course this would mean nothing without its incredible narrative structure and cast of wonderfully-written characters. Not even a slip-up near the ending could ruin this show for me, and I’m a critic at heart if that puts into perspective how much that means from me.

I would recommend Ranking of Kings to absolutely anyone (as many of my friends know because I have been incapable of shutting up about it to them for the past few months) solely on the basis of the messages it conveys, because I just think many of the themes it explores need to be touched upon more in anime and, honestly, media as a whole.



Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope you were able to get something out of it!"
20770,"Cartoons with strong female characters (and strong as in well-written, not emotionless fighters who do nothing but kill people and look cool) were a rarity back in the old days. But now, more and more of them are popping up, all of them being well received. When I was young and discovering the true nature of anime, I was amazed by anime's boldness in wanting to show things that most American cartoons wouldn't dare touch. Even the kids shows were mature and sophisticated, and that really appealed to me. As I expanded my anime repertoire, I began to learn more and more about Japan's standards on cartoons, and I eventually came to a realization why I love anime so much: the Japanese do so much more with animation rather than just limit it to kids shows or gross-out adult comedies, from horror and love stories to questioning humanity and the progress humanity has made over the years. I even took some classes on Japan and how circumstances such as World War II and the various earthquakes it had influenced many anime we know and love, from the old ones to the contemporary anime of today. However, the growing cynic in me is aware of the anime industry's gravitation toward bad harem moe wish fulfillment anime and catering to otaku rather than telling ambitious, passionate stories full of heart that everyone can love. But not all hope is lost, as there are still quality anime that pop out in modern times. One of those anime is Yona of the Dawn. Seriously, where has this been all my life?! It makes me feel like I'm 12 years old again, discovering the true nature of anime for the very first time, TEN years after the fact!

Yona is a lovely princess who lives a wonderful, pampered life in the Hiryuu Castle, nestled deep in the Empire of Kouka, with her father, King Il, her childhood friend whom she bickers with, Hak, and her cousin, Su-Won, whom she has a crush on. Her life is perfect and she doesn't have a care in the world, and wishes to marry Su-Won, but her father is against it. However, on a dark, stormy night, she is horrified as Su-Won, her beloved cousin, kills her father in cold blood and drives her and Hak out of the castle. With the help of some friends, she and Hak manage to escape death and Yona learns that in order to survive in this world, she have a lot to learn and a lot of growing up to do, and she can't afford to sit around and cry and cling to Hak all the time. A priest and his apprentice tell her and Hak about the Four Dragons who can help her take back her kingdom. With courage in her heart, Yona and friends set off to find the reincarnations of the four dragons with intent to save the Kouka Empire and reclaim her beloved home.

With a premise like this, it's no wonder a lot of people would be intrigued. Princesses have gained a bit of a bad reputation in the Western world, as they're usually portrayed as useless, shallow damsels in distress who love tea parties and dressing up, giggling over nothing, gush over marrying their prince charmings, and pretty much do nothing of importance to anyone or anything. When bad things happen, they're usually shown to just submit to it and wait for someone to rescue them, such examples being Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. But the death of Yona's father isn't the cue for someone to come and save her, even though it does. It's the start of her journey to become strong and more worldly. Simply put, in this story, Yona refuses to be the victim. She strives to become, and eventually does become, a hero. It shows us that the problems with most shows about princesses nowadays aren't princesses themselves, but rather what we, as a society, have done to them and reduced them to. Society sees princesses as damsels in distress who cannot be put on the same level as others. But Akatsuki no Yona takes that notion and smashes it into smithereens, though not without a few jabs at the concept every now and again, especially with how some of the characters treat her, especially Kija and Yun.

Now for the technical stuff: first, the animation. It's bright, colorful, sharp, sleek, and looks quite good. The battle choreography is pretty good for the most part, the movements are reasonably fluid, the colors change depending on the atmosphere, befitting certain moments, and everything looks great. Usually, when the show wants to do comedy, they turn the characters into chibi-fied versions of themselves, probably for purposes of cuteness and hilarity, and it works pretty well here. I've heard some people say that they go a bit too far with this in that they insert these random moments in dead serious scenes as well, but I honestly had no problem with it. I think they're thrown in there so viewers can properly digest the dark and serious moments as well so it makes the scenes come off as less depressing or serious. I mean, obviously we have to show the characters in fun, happy situations before they're thrown into conflict and see what they're really like so we can have the chance to care about their struggles, right?

The music is another thing that really makes the show stand out. Since the show takes a lot of cues from ancient China and Korea, the music has a very distinct Eastern sound to it, from erhu sounds to other Eastern instruments I don't have names for. But every piece of music in the show works: whether it's a fun happy piece during a comedic moment or a roaring, bombastic violin during an epic battle scene, or soft erhus during the sad moments, every piece of music fits their intended scene, and it knows when to be subtle and when to pull out the stops. The music almost sounds a lot like Avatar: The Last Airbender, and they share a lot of commonalities, both in their music, premise, settings, and adventure-esque stories. You can tell the composer for this series is a very ambitious one, intent on bringing the show to life with his music, and if you ask me, he gets an A+. Both the opening and ending themes are very good as well, fitting the show's themes and atmosphere. I hear some say the second opening is a bit too J-poppy for such an Eastern-looking show, but while the music may not fit, the lyrics fit the show as it centers on Yona growing as a person and learning to survive in a harsh world.

The characters are easily what make the show. They may seem like typical reverse harem stereotypes, but in this show, they are actually given depth and turn out to be so much more! But the show really excels in Yona's development. All throughout the show, she evolves from a spoiled, helpless, selfish, shallow princess to a strong, worldly, mature, and more open-minded young woman who is just trying to survive in the world, while still remaining vulnerable. Her friends and the Four Dragons get just as much personality and development within these 25 episodes. Shin-Ah is the silent, quiet type who is troubled by his tragic past, but is kind, sweet, and caring and helps his friends no matter what, and isn't a typical angsty lone wolf who hates everyone. Kija is a pompous rich kid who tries to do what he's been raised to do his whole life but doesn't always succeed, and often tries to push his ideas on others, but its called out, treated as a genuine character flaw, and it never comes off as mean-spirited, and he genuinely does care for his friends despite having lived a sheltered, pampered life. Yun is basically the glue that holds the group together, doing all the cooking, sewing, and anything that doesn't involve fighting, but even he isn't a damsel in distress. Every character, sans one who appears at the end, contributes something to the show and they're all very three-dimensional, showing lots of sides to them that most reverse harems don't even try to do these days. I love them all, even the villain and the skirt-chasing womanizer! Even side characters get some personality and focus!

However, as much as I praise this show and love it and want more people to see it, it does have a very very big flaw. The anime is an adaptation of a long running manga that's still ongoing as we speak, and the show stops as soon as it introduces one character who NEVER APPEARS UNTIL THAT FINAL EPISODE. Basically, the anime really isn't much more than a commercial for the manga. But hot dang, is it a GREAT commercial for a manga! Seriously, if FUNimation ever dubs the rest of it, they should have Toonami air this, as this would probably become really popular here in the US if treated right, as shows like this need to be made!

A wonderful, compelling show with great characters and a riveting story to tell, even in spite of its constraints. I highly recommend it!"
21175,"I like many many many people here grew up with the Dragon Ball Series as one of my first anime experiences. As a child I had nothing but love for it and thought Goku and his pales were the coolest strongest best characters ever. However as I kept aging , seeing other frankly better written anime and having deeper more adult experiences I learned how false this was or at least how false it was for me. The series is terribly written and at this point mostly a cash cow with little to no merit. I'll explain the main reasons why I grew to feel this way here.

You want the biggest reason why as I got older I grew to hate the Dragon Ball franchise? I'll gladly give you it then , it's because they throw characters away. If you aren't a saiyan ect you get thrown away most of the time. Once your importance or more so your "" power level "" reaches it's peak you are thrown off the sidelines with at most the hope of becoming a funny comedic character at worst being written out of the series. 

No one got this treatment worse than Yamcha. Yamcha is probably the genuinely nicest guy out of Son Goku's pales and he was just a nice fun guy who wanted to get married and have a family. He not only got that taken away but he was forced to become a joke character. Never forgot that he defeated the Saibamen in battle but it kamikazee him and they both died. Krillin admitted NONE OF THE OTHERS would have survived that move either. He was NEVER weak ... until the creators and more importantly the fans MADE HIM weak. In the past yeah he was not exactly the strongest of Goku's friends but he was never weak in fact he was one of the strongest fighters on the earth and he showed it a lot. Filler even had him beating the piss out of Recoome ect among many other feats.

It wouldn't last though. Eventually due to immense fan backlash and hate and contempt for the character as well as his waxing role in the series after Vegeta and Bulma get together he was pushed further and further onto the sidelines until they actually made him a weakling who could not beat any even remotely competent fighter. Culminating an the insulting gag Manga "" That time I got reincarnated as Yamcha "" in which a youth gets reincarnated as Yamcha but since he;s not Yamcha he gets to be strong. The joke is he gets reincarnated as the weakest most pathetic most worthless character in the series but manages to become strong. Despite how it seems its not an inspiring or beautiful message it;s just a way to take a steaming dump on a character who lost his limelight and was once considered one of Toriyama's favorite now became a complete 100% gag character. 

This behavior has been the status quo for a long time now for Yamcha. With scenes like him falling during the baseball game in Super mimicking his "" humiliating "" pose when he died against the Saibamen. The fact that he was strong at the time , the fact that all the other heroes would have died from that attack is completely ignored and pushed to the sied simply to mock and humiliate him eve further. To me this is a great representation of the lack of heart and soul in Toriyama's writing as it gets staler and staler. When a character is not popular any more they are tossed aside and literally pushed into the garbage.

Krillin or "" Kuririn "" was lucky. He was Goku's best friend so he would always be important to the plot and he got a very strong wife which would further ensure his status as "" important "" even if he was not the strongest. Yamcha however was the "" loser "" who got dumped for the strong cool Vegeta a hip fan favorite so he had to go ... either that or he had to become the biggest laughing stock in the entire franchise. In a way he was dealt both blows. His importance was reduced to zero and his skills and power was reduced bellow zero. He became a pure and simple joke character with nothing going for him other than his baseball career. They could not even throw him a bone and let him get Krillin's old love interest Maron who was attracted to him in the past 
 I know she's "" filler "" but she could still easily be accepted into further instalments of the anime version ) , they gave him nothing ultimately. That is nothing except the honor of being the butt of just about every joke and insult imagainable. 

Anyway that's enough about how they destroyed a wonderful character .... I want to talk about another issue with the series. The Secondary problem with Dragon ball is the power levels. This actually links back to what I was talking about earlier about how certain characters get thrown away though. It just so happens the less popular characters magically end up being weaker ... at least for the most part anyway. How convenient that for so long everyone who wasn't a saiyan was nearly totally useless. Unlike more well written anime everything in dragon ball comes back to power levels. It doesn't matter how strange or how unique or devastating an ability is as long as the other opponents power level is higher he or she will win every single time no matter what literally period full stop. 

Now if you ask me this will make for some very very boring fights. The fights in Dragon Ball after Frieza had become so stale , so power level based , so typical and so predictable it just started to lose any interest whatsoever. Krillin: "" Did we get him? "" the villain is hidden in a cloud of smoke as the other characters wonder if they killed him before he walks out of the smoke completely unharmed and proceeds to defeat every last one of them. Such became the status quo. When nothing matters except power levels the battles become soulless and mindless instead of intense , beautiful and moving struggles the battles become tedious pathetically written dribble that repeats on a continuous loop. This isn't interesting and it doesn't do anything except turn my stomach in disgust and abject boredom. 


The epitome of this problem is shown in Future Trunks final battle with Zamasu in which his victory is cut short because Zamasu has become vaper. That's right he became vaper! VAPER! So what do they do you might ask .. why bring in a new guy with a higher power level and he cleans things up nicely. The struggle and beauty of Trunk's victory is taken away. He used all the feelings of the earthlings who had suffered for so many years at the hands of the androids and others and used the power of their souls and feelings to win but in the end it meant .... NOTHING! In the end his struggle is NOTHING and he is humiliated and forced to step aside while a new character cleans house with the flick of his wrist. This scene right here was the final nail in the coffin for Dragon Ball for me and it killed nearly any and all love I have towards the franchise. For years I had been growing steadily angrier and angrier at how the series had been going and the direction it was taking but this was the very end for me and I buried it that night and locked it out of my heart. I was done and there was no turning back ... for me Dragon Ball had died that night but it was not so much that it had died but that I had finally completely outgrown any enjoyment of it whatsoever. 

My third and final complaint with Dragon Ball which I will cover a bit more briefly than the above is how death has no weight for these characters. In other anime character deaths are almost always final and can be a heartbreaking tragic yet beautiful send off for characters we've come to truly love as if they were our own friends and family in some cases. In dragon ball however death is as simple as "" oh Piccolo died? Well no problem we can just wish him back! How cool is that? lol. "" Something as final and as irrevocable as death has become the equivalent of dying in a video game. You died? Don't worry you save the game just restart from that point. Character deaths which are the cornerstone of emotions of loss and sorrow in fiction has been reduced to a fun little game or a slight inconvenience at best. 

Let it sink in how truly soulless this is! Death itself has been negated to all but meaningless and is now just a small inconvenience. Meanwhile in billions upon billions of other stories ( as well as our own lives ! ( well written lovable characters and our own loved ones are dying and being lost! They are moving our hearts as well as breaking them and making us look deep within ourselves at what truly makes us tick and what truly makes us human. There is one single thing of importance in this world and that is love and all it's forms and to lose a loved one is the most painful experience imaginable. The sorrow of loss never goes away and that pain remains in the heart as scars of sadness and despair that can both make us stronger and destroy us. To demote that to a mere inconvenience is truly soulless and it is an example of a childish brainless mind that only cares about making money and the status quo of keeping the power level induced fights rolling.  

So in conclusion these are my issues and complaints with a series I loved in my youth but grew to hate with intensity in adulthood. If you enjoy the series then good for you! Don't give me spam or hate or any bullshit or toxicity. Simply express your opinions intelligently and with maturity if you wish to. If you hate the series like I do you have my virtual pat on the back lol. Wishing you happiness and love .... peace out readers!"
100977,"Story Summary
Cells At Work! is an episodic series, with little overarching plot. (Not including multi-part episodes). It follows the two main characters Red Blood Cell AE3803, and White Blood Cell U-1146 along with various side characters such as the T-Cells, Macrophage, and Platelets, showing their involvement in various incidents in the human body, ranging from simple scrapes, to cancer. 
Characters
The main two characters in this show are Red Blood Cell AE3808, and White Blood Cell U-1146, however for the sake of simplicity, I will just be referring to them as Red and White Blood Cell respectively.  Red Blood Cell is played as a clumsy cell who is bad with directions. She regularly needs help from other cells to find where she is going, however despite this fact, she is heavily determined and always delivers her Oxygen. The other main character is White Blood Cell, who is shown to be cold and ruthless at first, but after the first episode or so, starts to warm up to Red Blood Cell, although he still keeps his ruthlessness for dealing with his enemies, the germ cells. Speaking of germ cells, they are usually the villains in each episode, usually having dangerous looking designs, although they are all one-off characters. There are other Red and White Blood Cells that we see, however they never really get fleshed out. There are also different varieties of White Blood Cells that we see throughout the series, such as the Killer, Naive, and Helper T Cells. Their job is to destroy anything that the standard White Blood Cells cannot, and they are characterized quite well, just like the main characters, and along with the Platelets and Macrophages, are some of the few recurring characters.

Animation and Voice Acting
Both animation and voice acting quality are very good with no noticeable drops in quality. Animation is sometimes used for visual gags, but the drop in quality for these gags is done well, and never takes you out of the moment.

Comedy
The comedy is done very well in the series. Along with the before mentioned visual gags, they also use recurring jokes, and while I won’t spoil any jokes, recurring or not here, I will say that they are done in a way that you recognise that it’s a recurring joke, without rolling your eyes due to bad attempts to shove jokes into serious scenes.

TLDR
In Short, Cells At Work is both an educational, and entertaining show, and well deserving of the 8/10 I have given it. [It also has a sequel set for Winter 2021](https://anilist.co/anime/117533/Hataraku-Saibou-BLACK/), as well as an OVA, with both available on AnimeLab, Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, and VRV."

Having grown up in a household filled with family that loved Chinese period dramas, they were virtually inescapable for me. Someone in my family was always watching the hottest new period drama, and eventually, I also began to watch them with my family, and I got hooked on them quickly. At this point, the tropes in those shows were all too familiar to me, so count me surprised when I watched The Apothecary Diaries, and almost immediately thought of what a breath of fresh air this was. It has probably the best female character of 2023, and while it definitely was overshadowed by a certain other heavy hitter, Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, this anime still had enough going for it to merit a lot of discourse in the anime community, and in my opinion stood up to its opponents in both the Fall 2023 and Winter 2024 anime seasons very well.

This series has very riveting mystery elements, while staying light-hearted and comedic at times, and all encapsulated in a fictional inner palace, modelled after a Chinese setting. As I have mentioned earlier, I am no stranger to Chinese period dramas, and I always find it interesting how gender is portrayed in these shows. In the older Chinese dynasties, the [Imperial Chinese harem system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImperialChineseharemsystem) was very prevalent and common, and the inner palace, babymaking and the objectifying of women, with them being handled and passed around as gifts, was what life was dedicated to. For that reason, I find it intriguing that in this portrayal of the inner palace, we see the perspectives of women with agency, solving problems, being involved in the politics of the palace, all in quite a thoughtful way. Also, the existence of a particular character in the show as a test of loyalty to the emperor struck me as a different twist to the whole system, a unique take on this fictional Chinese setting.

The mystery elements were done well, as it was interesting to see how this series introduced a lot of mysteries, but didn’t outright provide the answer, or culprit to the viewer. We get the reasons why people were caught up in issues, or in some cases, how they ended up dying, but the viewer gets left questioning whether or not the intuition of the main character was actually accurate. Things are not answered right away, but eventually, the series calls back to those mysteries that the viewer might have forgotten, and weaves them together for a great pay-off. Some of the episodes, especially in the early parts of the second half, were not as interesting when I first watched it, but knowing how it set up for the pay-off, in hindsight, it did made a lot more sense, and that indeed, every moment, even the duller ones, had some effect on the bigger picture.

The main protagonist, Maomao, makes the entire show for me, and was the main reason I enjoyed this anime as much as I did. She was such an endearing, captivating main character that had a really dynamic personality that could range from her not giving a bother about getting kidnapped at the start of the anime, yet throughout the series, really investing herself in the mysteries of the palace setting, and through her endless thirst for knowledge (and poison), we got to see her go to great lengths to achieve whatever goal she set out to achieve on any given day. Her voice actor, Aoi Yuuki, performed spectacularly to bring out the varied tones to match up with her multi-faceted personality, and she really made Maomao come to life in the best way possible. She reminds me of other protagonists I have seen in Chinese period dramas, but her character writing was more unique compared to any others, and I am glad she had her own ambitions she was able to achieve, rather than just being a tool for the emperor or her superiors. All the other characters also shined in their own ways, and even the ones that only show up briefly, end up being memorable.

The art and animation in this show was not flashy, but still very highly detailed and intricate to really flesh out the setting. The character designs were varied and were unique while staying true to its Chinese identity. The more subtle movements were handled with care, such as the little mannerisms that befit the Chinese setting. The covering of the mouth with their sleeves as they enter a room, and how the characters eat their food are just some examples of that in action. Little details like that really impressed me, as it showed how much care the staff put in to making sure they stayed true to Chinese culture. The music further elevated the material to new heights. Sure, the overall visual quality isn’t at a level of the powerhouse shounen anime, but with the resources the staff had at their disposal, they did a phenomenal job.

Overall, this was a fantastic series, along with one of the best main female characters I have seen in a while. While not every mystery or every episode hit as deeply, whenever they did, it was excellent, riveting, even bone-chilling. If you have any interest in Chinese dramas, or even if you don’t, there will likely be something you will find that intrigues you. With a Season 2 confirmed for next year, I couldn’t be more excited to see more of this wonderful series."

〈 𝗔𝘂𝗿𝗮 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗹𝘆... 〉

Ah, Solo Leveling... how I have yearned for you!

No, scratch that—I have not missed it in the slightest. It has barely been a year since the first season concluded, but it feels like neither I nor anyone else has truly escaped the series' slimy, stinky clutches. The thought that a sequel was more inevitable than death itself loomed over my head like a thundercloud, and, well, here we are. But I will do us all a favour, and skip the monotonous, flowery introductory paragraphs and cut straight to the chase.

I want you to think of this write-up as a companion piece to [my previous review of this oh-so-fantastic anime](https://anilist.co/review/24005). What does that mean? It is simple, really—each and every single criticism I levelled against the first season still neatly applies to this new, shiny sequel. The plot? What plot? The characters? Who? Nothing has changed, not even a little bit. So, in the true spirit of Solo Leveling, I will be as redundant as a broken record and bore you to tears with the same points all over again. Once more, I shall rant like a crayon-eating toddler.



If the first season of Solo Leveling was a limp, soulless, energy-deprived power fantasy masquerading as a meaningful, witty, and action-packed romp, then Season 2 is the same damp, smelly fart—only somehow even more rigid, more lifeless, and totally incapable of producing anything that even remotely resembles entertainment, interest, or—heaven forbid—tension. Whatever cheap illusions and deceptions the first batch of episodes used to feign grandeur and thrills have since been completely eviscerated, leaving behind an absolutely preposterous slop where [Jin-Woo](https://anilist.co/character/129928/JinU-Seong)'s infallible awesomeness is not just the norm—it is a full-blown religion that is revered at every turn. This universe is still his personal playground, where all living creatures exist solely to slobber over him, kneel at his feet, admire his magnificence, and hand him an endless supply of power-ups and ego-stroking moments. Anyone foolish enough to doubt his capabilities or character, be it out of scepticism, stupidity, or just because, is speedily proven wrong, usually via swift execution, brutal humiliation, or, better yet, by becoming yet another one of his silly shadow minions.

One of the best examples of the show's ridiculous mindset, mantras, and messages is the Jeju Island Raid arc—a so-called epic, monumental operation where Korea and Japan join forces in a last-ditch effort to finally reclaim the island from an infestation of ant-like magical beasts. On paper, this whole scenario should be a near-ideal recipe for high stakes, tense alliances, gut-wrenching sacrifice, and international tension. Well, that would be the case in any other series. But this is Solo Leveling, and nuance is about as welcome here as a cockroach in a five-star restaurant. What do we get after several episodes of build-up, countless exposition dumps, and constant callbacks to past failed expeditions? A pitifully pathetic, predictable pseudo-spectacle that, of course, our glorious protagonist conveniently sits out at first because—gasp—[his mother](https://anilist.co/character/209396/KyungHye-Park) has just awakened from her Eternal Slumber. Indeed, it is a touching, deeply personal reason that any person could and would get behind... if only the bastard actually spent time with her during the raid. But no, he simply does not do that. Instead, he just loiters around elsewhere, perching atop skyscrapers and twiddling his thumbs until the plot gets desperate enough to summon him like some genie to swoop in and clean up everyone's mess.

And what a mess it is. The top Korean hunters are a bunch of disposable mannequins who may fare well against the smaller ants, yet the second [the Ant King](https://anilist.co/character/159849/Beru) steps in, they are swatted like flies. The same applies to the supposed crème de la crème of Japan's guilds, as most of them do not last more than a few seconds, their collective screen time being so minuscule you would be forgiven for mistaking them for random extras. Basically, the entire battle is nothing more than a setup to cull seemingly strong characters for the sole purpose of manufacturing a non-existent, fake sense of dread and seriousness, just enough to trick you into thinking the show understands suspense. We are supposed to believe the Temu version of [Hunter x Hunter](https://anilist.co/anime/11061/Hunter-x-Hunter-2011/)'s [Meruem](https://anilist.co/character/23277/Meruem) (minus the depth, complexity, or any semblance of autonomy) is an insurmountable obstacle no one is able to take down. When Jin-Woo finally makes his grand entrance, the fight lasts about as long as a sneeze, as he flattens the insect in record time. Naturally, he is rewarded for this effortless bullying session with yet another overpowered shadow soldier, because Solo Leveling adheres to the revolutionary philosophy of ""not struggling should be rewarded with even more power."" In other words, the arc desperately wants to be like [Togashi](https://anilist.co/staff/96893/Yoshihiro-Togashi)'s Chimera Ant Arc, but lacks the ideological conflict, the character development, and, frankly, the brain cells to pull off even a fraction of its intensity or wit. There is nothing interesting or fun about any of this—just more bodies to stack, more flamboyant but meaningless skirmishes to gawp at, and more proof of how little the show has to offer beyond its shallow power-tripping.




And, of course, this dreadful formula does not only rear its ugly head in the final arc—it is hammered into your skull, episode after episode, until you are ready to claw your own eyes out. In the Red Gate Arc, a group of hunters gets trapped in a dungeon and—to no one's surprise—they are hopelessly outmatched by the monsters inside. The team splits into two groups: one made up of cartoonishly evil jerks who mock Jin-Woo for being an E-rank, and the other composed of our beloved protagonist and his ragtag band of low-ranked nobodies, who get to bask in the glow of his greatness and reap all the benefits of his unlimited power without lifting a finger or having to worry about little things like starvation, freezing to death, or getting torn apart by the ice bears. I think you know all too well how it all plays out—the arrogant hunters pay for their sins with their lives, while the weaker hunters get dragged to safety simply by existing in Jin-Woo's orbit. And, as always, he walks away with more power (i.e. levels and troops) because... well, he just does.

The Hunter's Guild Gate Arc follows the exact same script down to the letter. A guild's second-string team enters a dungeon, gets demolished by a horde of orcs that should not even be there in the first place, and just as all hope seems lost—right when they are about to perish at the hands of these terrifying monstrosities—who else but the ever-flawless Jin-Woo decides it is time to quit standing around like a twat and wipes the floor with these brutes. [The orc shaman](https://anilist.co/character/184957/Tusk), his generals, and his army are slaughtered with laughable ease, and, naturally, they get converted into yet another batch of fresh, mindless pawns for Jesus-kun to boss around. Why would the series refuse to hand its poster child even more might for coasting through life on easy mode, without a sign of opposition in sight? Why should these tremendous battles be any less than one-sided massacres? Why should the System's golden boy ever be forced to struggle, strategise or suffer actual consequences? Why should a power fantasy be anything other than a power inevitability? Why should the story strive to be more than a cretinous checklist of predictable, drab nonsense designed to maximise Jin-Woo's self-aggrandisement?

But by far, the most mind-numbingly hilarious part of the entire show thus far has to be the Return to Demon Castle Arc. Not only is it an absolute slog to sit through—thanks to its headache-inducing, everything-is-on-fire setting—but it is also so laughably empty, flimsy, and toothless it feels like a sick joke. Jin-Woo carves his way through hundreds upon hundreds of demons like a hot knife through butter, never once breaking a sweat, and when he finally reaches and faces off against [Baran](https://anilist.co/character/306643/Baran), the final boss of the entire thing, the show really, really wants you to believe that this fight is different—that this is a genuine challenge. Except... it is not. Solo Leveling tries its darndest to fabricate some sense of resistance, pretending like Baran is a threat that will not go down easily. However, as we all know, the main character of this shitfest has never faced a challenge in his life after the first five episodes of the first season. There is never a moment where he is actually outmatched, never an instance where he is forced to genuinely fight for survival. And just when you think the show could not be any more farcical, [a random demon girl Jin-Woo picked up earlier](https://anilist.co/character/164675/Esil-Radiru) chucks a sword at Baran, and—poof—the fight is suddenly over. This minor inconvenience is what our hero apparently needed to overpower the devil and beat it into a bloody pulp. This is the big, climactic showdown we get to experience at the end of this piss-poor, miserable excuse for a storyline. At this juncture, filing a tax return would be more unpredictable and suspenseful than watching the anime's pathetic attempts at meaningful action scenes. Sure, they look cool, but what is so impressive about flashy animation and pretty colours when there is not an ounce of personality behind them? Why should I care about what is happening on the screen when the outcome is always, always predetermined? Where is the fun I was promised?



None of it should come as a surprise, though, because Solo Leveling has never been about being authentic, impactful, or well-thought-out. Remember Jin-Woo's mother, I mentioned earlier? The woman whose Eternal Slumber was his biggest motivation, the emotional anchor of his journey, and the reason he desired to be stronger? Yeah, that turned out to be a load of sun-scorched crap. In reality, it was nothing more than an afterthought, a checkbox, a convenient plot device trotted out whenever the narrative needed to pretend that he had a more serious objective beyond accumulating absurd amounts of levels, showing off his reality-bending abilities, and toying with cardboard-cutout-like characters. And now that she is no longer in a coma-like state? What is his motivation supposed to be now? More aura farming like a dipshit? More one-shotting pitiful weaklings left, right, and centre? More self-congratulatory scenes to fuel his already sky-high ego? His entire worthless existence boils down to being the strongest guy in the room—hah—the whole wide world, and that is an undeniable fact. There is no tension, no personal stakes, no growth, no introspection, no dilemmas, and no hardship—just a never-ending montage of him mowing down everything in his path, and an ever-growing pile of defeated losers who never stood a chance, to begin with.

What about the rest of the cast? They surely must have gotten better over time, right? Can we call them ""characters"" now without insulting the very concept of storytelling? Bzzt, wrong. They are still a massive collection of glorified toys for Jin-Woo to play with; human-shaped obstacles for him to trample over; exposition-spouting dispensers; bootlickers designed to sing his praises; and whatever else the sick and twisted series can come up with. The ""strong"" hunters exist solely to be one-upped by yours truly—every single S-rank in existence, without exception. The baddies/monsters are moustache-twirling caricatures who are introduced exclusively to be humiliated and destroyed in the most banal manner possible. The female characters are dense love interests with about as much depth as a paddle—case in point, [Cha Hae-in](https://anilist.co/character/138789/HaeIn-Cha) falls in love with him because, unlike everyone else, he does not smell like shit. The allies are a cluster of personality-deprived yes-men who live to admire him. The countless clueless background-filling nobodies question him just long enough to be crushed under the weight of his overwhelming epicness—looking at you, [that one cocky cretin from the Retesting Rank Arc](https://anilist.co/character/184535/MinSung-Lee) who thought he was important before getting reality checked. When all is said and done, these props do not matter because nothing in Solo Leveling is allowed to matter besides Jin-Woo. Therein lies the problem—he is the story. If you cannot stomach his actions or character, you might as well call it a day, since there is nothing else here. Everyone and everything merely facilitates his ever-expanding empire of shadow minions. The world does not change, react or resist. Stakes are non-existent. Character arcs are dead. Conflict is ridiculous. The script is still doing the tutorial. This is not a narrative that will stick with you for longer than a week. It is not just terrible—it is repetitive, thoughtless garbage that does not even have the decency to make you feel something.



You know what? This time, I am skipping the bit about pitchforks or torches—or any goofy spiel about how this review is not some grand ploy to stop you from watching the show. At this point, you are either fully on board with Jin-Woo's antics or, like me, just really into wasting your time. Either way, you already know exactly how much this series is worth.

As for me, it is that masochistic mindset that keeps dragging me back to Solo Leveling every time it crawls out of the woodwork. It is neither well-written nor particularly enjoyable, yet somehow, I am unable to escape its stupidly intoxicating presence. I hate everything it stands for, everything it is trying to peddle—and yet, I feel nothing but apathy for the product itself. And so, I will keep consuming this brainless, tasteless mush for as long as it continues to be churned out at such a breakneck pace.

20792,"If I'm being honest, even as VN reader I enjoyed myself very much with this adaptation, and if you scroll down you'll see I rated it 8.5/10, which is a very good score. However, as an adaptation it's quite a mixed bag and there are multiple problems (and strengths) of this adaptation I want to properly address. 

As always, this review contains spoilers. I expect you to have watched the anime. Now, grab some popcorn while reading because this review will be long.




1.	Shirou Emiya – A character study
2.	Where Ufo’s UBW failed
3.	Nothing beats a smiling Saber
4.	What the anime has the VN doesn’t
5.	Conclusion



Img() 

Fate/stay night is and always will be a character-driven story. Each route explores the psyche of our main character Shirou Emiya, and each route offers a different answer and solution to the problem our protagonist struggles with. Given that they’re 1000 different watch orders for no reason, I won’t elaborate more on other routes, but it’s important to understand that Fate/stay night is one story as a whole with Shirou as its centre. Especially UBW as second route explores his psyche a lot and sets necessary stakes for the final route, Heaven’s Feel.




Shirou suffers under severe survivor guilt and has little to no self-worth. Instead of valuing himself, he places importance on saving others, becoming a superhero who can save everyone. He’s aware he’s no superhero, and he’s also aware that he’s powerless, but all he cares about is the path he took and the goal at the end. His survivor guilt is that severe, that he can only accept the fire as outcome if he thrives to be a hero of justice. For him, it’s logical and obviously the “right thing”. 

img() 

Even if this type of mindset is highly self-destructive when he doesn't care about himself. Archer explains it with money: You can help someone by giving them money, and you may feel good about it. But if you don't use money for yourself and keep giving it to others, you will have nothing left. It doesn’t matter what type of person you are, but you will eventually run out of money and that’s where you’ll collapse. 

Img() 

UBW focuses heavily on the self-destructive aspect, not only by having several characters pointing out Shirou's flawed mindset but also providing a mirror with Archer, who is the future version of himself in an alternate timeline. In that timeline, Emiya made a contract with the world, Araya, and became a counter guardian. By that, however, he basically made himself a slave, by having to counter threats to mankind over and over like a machine. This cycle of killing he was forced to go through eventually led to desperation, because he never was able to fulfil his ideals. Instead of saving everyone he had to choose lives over others, even if it destroyed him inside little by little. As a result, Archer cannot stand Shirou, who will go down the same path as him and his main goal becomes to kill the Shirou who will become Archer.

Img() 

It’s important though that Archer still wants to save people. He lost his faith in his ideals, but that doesn’t necessarily mean this ideal itself is false. Ever since Kiritsugu saved Shirou in the fire, the idea of saving people became beautiful to him. The beauty of his ideal is the conclusion Shirou arrives at, which becomes the fundamental reason why he simply can’t give up on them. Difference between the two is therefore a matter of faith; Whether you still can believe in your ideals of not. And the solution UBW offers is that, in fact, you can still believe. But in order to do so, you need great perseverance and belief, a struggle Shirou sees himself conflicted with when quite literally his own self tells him to give his ideals up. In the fight in the Einzbern castle Shirou even experienced memories from Archer, picturing clearly before his eyes what path he may end up on.

Img() 

The thing is, Shirou only has his ideals. Saber once asked him the reason why he wants to be a superhero, and Shirou struggled with an answer, because saving others is something natural for him, it defines him. It's like having to answer why sugar tastes good. People meme about the ""even if you're correct, you're wrong"" line, but given the context, it makes a lot of sense. If Shirou would give up on his ideals, he would end up like Archer: Disillusioned, desperate and bitter. The struggle in UBW lies between facing an apparent inevitable truth and staying true to oneself. The final clash between Archer and Shirou in the Einzbern castle will always be one of my favourite fights in all of Fate/stay night simply because it drives Shirou’s perseverance and determination to the utmost limit.

The VN showed this by having Shirou fight in a very self-destructive way, where he would simply collapse once he stops to fight. At the brink of death, he still couldn’t bring himself to admitting Archer is right, even under massive headache and a body which screams at him with incredible pain, he still kept his belief that he can’t be wrong for pursuing his ideals. And even if Archer was able to finish him off (which he initially intended) Shirou's determination lasting throughout the whole fight frightened him, and he couldn't fathom that Shirou would be able to keep fighting in such a state. But, contrary to his expectations, Shirou kept fighting like a dead corpse, ultimately leading to Archer not being able to stop the final attack of Shirou and getting stabbed. 

Img() 

UBW openly shows Shirou's flaws, and it also shows that his ideal in itself is not bad. As long as he can keep believing in it, he can either die satisfied by having tried to live up to his ideals the outmost, or arrive at a different answer previously given. And as long as he doesn't let himself get destroyed by his own ideals, they can be a very beautiful and admirable thing in themselves. You can say that UBW as a whole is one big challenge for Shirou to prove, that he can do just that. 

Img() 




As beautiful as it is with how deeply layered the VN explores Shirou’s character, it also exposes the issues I have with this adaptation. The fundamental issue lies with leaving out a lot of monologue which never should’ve been removed. Leaving out monologues may work in a plot-driven story, but in a character-driven story like Fate/stay night it removes one of the core aspects of why this is such an incredible story. I will not say that they didn't try: We see the fire and the tragedy of the previous grail war multiple times, and the anime takes its time to show that Shirou is clearly not normal. But it's simply not enough. An extreme example would be the date in episode 12 of season 1, which actually receives a rather dark tone in the VN due to Shirou blaming himself for having fun and actually enjoying himself. 

Img()

Leaving out this piece of monologue completely transformed the meaning and tone of the scene, making it simply a nice cutesy scene. That’s not necessarily bad, of course, but given that the VN uses every opportunity possible to break down Shirou as a character the end result is much more impactful than the anime, which reduces his characterization to the necessary minimum. Instead of having insight into Shirou’s mind, we only see people bashing him and pointing out his flaws, which doesn’t help with relating to his struggle and leads to not being very impactful. It even feels jarring at times, because it seems like the anime just keeps repeating the obvious.

I think it’s also no secret that people dislike Shirou as a character, because he is “stupid” and “dense”. And while this sometimes is not an issue of UBW itself, but fans for example having different expectations after watching Fate/Zero (which is a whole other topic in itself), I think it’s also a fault of the adaptation. We know Shirou has survivor guilt, we know that he has no self-worth. But because it’s not that apparent on many occasions, his behaviour seems stupid and illogical from an outside perspective. His mindset and worldview are so warped, that it’s important to gain as much insight into his way of thinking as possible, in order to be able to relate to him properly. 

It’s not only core aspects like his survivor guilt, however: Removing monologue removes some nuances to his personality as well, a good example would be when Tohsaka wants to talk to him in episode 8. In the anime it looks like he is pretty slow for not picking up immediately, that she wants to talk to him. VN readers know however, that he indeed realized she was waiting for him, but was unsure how to handle the situation. There were multiple approaches to handle it (you can make choices in the VN to alter the story) and the anime went with the choice where he decides to play dumb on purpose.

It just saddens me that people don’t know that Shirou can be pretty snarky as well, but unlike Archer he still cares about being polite and leaves certain thoughts to himself. And this is not to blame on the viewer, but on weird adaptation choices. 

The climax of the route, Archer vs Shirou, also felt a bit hollow in the anime because of the missing characterization and build-up. I also dislike, how there is a clear cut between talking and fighting, which takes away a lot of the intensity in this battle. It’s not visible enough that Archer clearly intended the kill at the start, but his confidence wavered as the fight progressed. Changing the scenery to UBW also felt a bit overblown, with Archer and Shirou going back-and-forth instead of one continuous clash which stakes are on whoever will surrender first. I will admit however, that the climax is satisfying, and [LiSA’s](https://anilist.co/staff/105561/LiSA) song “Last Stardust” is great.

With all my criticism I nonetheless still immensely enjoyed the UBW anime. Usually it’s the other way around when critiquing something, but now that we looked at its main flaw first, let’s have a look at stuff I actually really liked.




I think it’s no secret that UBW has high production values. Of course, what first comes to mind are the jaw-dropping fights, which’ storyboards visibly had a lot of freedom to work with to create well-choreographed and intense action scenes. You can argue that this is natural by having a more talented director and storyboarder like [Miura](https://anilist.co/staff/107167/Miura-Takahiro) than for example what Demon Slayer got with [Sotozaki](https://anilist.co/staff/99006/Sotozaki-Haruo), but I feel the fewer limitations from the VN source material are also a big factor.

Key Animation: [Akihiko Uda](https://anilist.co/staff/146682/Uda-Akihiko)

And maybe that’s just my own bias speaking, but I feel like Yuichi Terao (head of digital department in Ufotable) really shines more in an urban setting like Fate/stay night and Kara no Kyoukai. Fuyuki at night looks wonderful, and structured high-rise buildings transition so well into 3D.

The Noble Phantasms of the servants also give him plenty of opportunity to be as flashy as possible, assisted by incredible key animation from Ufotable’s strongest animators. Abe, Kunihiro, Obunai… UBW received the full package and it shows.

Technically freelancer but let’s call him half-employed at this point

The beauty of the visuals extends to simple character movements too. It was a joy to see all these characters animated, and they did a great job capturing Fuji-ness quirkiness, Rin’s charm and Shinji simply being Shinji. The modernized character designs of course are a matter of taste, but I enjoy them for what they are and they accentuate the traits of each character fairly well.

And of course, we can’t forget Saber, the epitome of holiness itself, a goddess I will never stop simping in my lifetime. Seeing how all the little moments of her are brought to life simply left me in awe.

Soundtracks and sound design are also great, can’t comment much on that however because I know shit about music. I thoroughly enjoyed the OST though, especially [Fukasawa’s]( https://anilist.co/staff/103288/Fukasawa-Hideyuki) take on EMIYA. 

youtube(https://youtu.be/VTA2nSOBDis)

In total it’s hard to deny that the presentation of Ufo’s UBW is nothing but stunning, and that’s why I love it nonetheless even while knowing the VN, which, in my opinion, is still the superior version. Maybe it’s exactly because I know the VN that I’m able to fill gaps an anime-only is not able to? I don’t know. I want to address as last topic though that there is actually stuff in this adaption the VN doesn’t contain. I spoke in great length about how they butchered Shirou’s characterization, but that’s not by any means the only change/addition in this anime. And some of these are actually (at least for me) pretty welcomed. 




You either have an adaption which leaves stuff out, an adaption which changes content slightly or an adaption which is extremely faithful and adds anime-original content on top. Ufo’s UBW somehow managed to tick all the boxes. 

The anime-original content is most likely to be credited to Nasu Kinoko himself, the writer of the VN. He was fairly involved into the production process in writing scenarios for the anime and attending meetings, and some of the changes are probably also to be credited to him. That man somehow seems to dislike everything he wrote in the past, to the point that Miura (and also Sudo later on for the Heaven’s Feel movies) had to restrict him in his desire to rewrite everything. I just hope once Fate Remake happens Nasu can show some love to his original work lol

As a VN reader, I did like the anime original content though. Examples would be Illya vs Rin in their first encounter, Rin investigating the gas incidents or the extended backstory for Illya in episode 3 of the second season. It’s not anything major, but it serves well as both filler but also interesting content and in my opinion, it also shows that there was a lot passion to be found in the anime as adaptation. The very last episode is also completely anime-original, not only providing great fan-service with Rin’s and Shirou’s life after the grail war but also giving pointers to connections to other franchises of the nasuverse. You can argue that this episode should’ve been an OVA and we should’ve gotten the normal epilogue in full length instead but it is what it is and I don’t think this is necessarily a dramatic change. For the very last scene I do prefer the script version (not VN, but the scenario written by Nasu) more than what actually ended up being the final product though. 

Img()

To the other things I mentioned above, I think I don’t have to explain why there is cut content. This is bound to happen in a VN to anime adaption, but it can happen in a small scale that it doesn’t really matter that much. I think that’s the case of UBW, because while there is cut content they still included everything needed and there aren’t many question marks except when it comes to more detailed stuff in lore or systems. And even that is not that huge of an issue, because worldbuilding is mostly done in Fate (with Heaven’s Feel digging deeper into the lore).

Img() 

When it comes to changes, they are there in numerous occasions and sometimes it’s pretty much a whatever, sometimes it’s a bit questionable. We all know that Ufotable likes to make fights flashy, so I don’t think anyone raised an eyebrow (I hope) when Shirou literally jumped 10 meters in his fight against Gilgamesh or was suddenly able to move in inhuman speed. Other examples would be in episode 2, where they changed the boundary field around the Emiya residence into a mechanical warning system (and 10 episodes later Rin praises their boundary field, very consistent writing) or in the first encounter of between Assassin and Saber. In the VN his sword was actually bent, which is the only reason she survived his sword technique. Since it’s pretty much a technique being able to warp space and time, her luck wouldn’t have saved her opposed to Gae Bolg.

Especially among VN readers, you either love or hate it. It’s undeniable that the UBW anime did create misconceptions about Fate/stay night: For example, that it is a sequel to Fate/Zero or that Shirou is just a generic shounen protagonist. Does that mean it’s a bad adaptation? I don’t think so! I still enjoyed it for what it was, and I would prefer such an adaption, which sometimes was more experimental, any time over a bland boring adaptation, which may be more faithful but feels empty as an overall product. However, I think not every change made in this adaption was good, and I hope whoever is in charge in the Fate Remake (it’s not confirmed, I know, just let me have some hope) will revise some adaption choices, especially when it comes to monologue. As it stands now, Type-Moon X Ufotable is still a very exciting collaboration and I look eagerly forward to the Mahoyo movie in 2023. 

Thank you for reading through this long review, and I hope I also gave some information you didn’t know before (for example if you’re an anime-only). Now that we’re at the end, enjoy this wonderful cut from the one and only [Nozomu Abe]( https://anilist.co/staff/116271/Abe-Nozomu).

[Demon Slayer](https://anilist.co/anime/166240) continues to be the most entertaining anime of all time.



New season, same Demon Slayer. Although this season lacks the action of previous seasons, it manages to highlight the many other aspects of Demon Slayer that we all have grown to enjoy and love. Once again Demon Slayer has redefined peak fiction.


The plot of the Hashira Training Arc follows up right after the events of the [Swordsmith Village Arc](https://anilist.co/anime/145139/). After the climactic battle of the Swordsmith Village Arc, [Tanjirou](https://anilist.co/character/126071) and the rest of the Demon Slayer Corps are called back to headquarters. The demons have halted their attacks and are instead searching for [Nezuko](https://anilist.co/character/127518). This gives our beloved Demon Slayers the chance to train in preparation for the decisive battle ahead. Although it is a training arc, the Hashira Training Arc manages to be even more captivating than any of the previous installments into the Demon Slayer anime. 

We get to explore all of the current Hashira and even get to visit some of the old. [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43) also did a wonderful job of adding anime exclusive content that made the world of Demon Slayer feel much more alive. For example, we get much more insight into [Tengen](https://anilist.co/character/136071)’s training. It is always fun to spend more time with characters from past arcs. We also got a anime exclusive sparring match between [Sanemi](https://anilist.co/character/137774), [Obanai](https://anilist.co/character/137777), and [Muichirou](https://anilist.co/character/136069). This short, yet spectacular, sparring match was more than enough to fill in the absence of major action in this arc. In place of the action we have grown accustomed to was wholesome and comedic interactions amongst our Demon Slayer Corps members. We even got an anime exclusive paper airplane contest between Tanjirou and Muichirou, which was incredibly wholesome and funny after their long and harsh training session.


Aside from anime exclusive content, we also had the flawless manga content to go alongside it. We get a peek into the relationship and inner turmoil of the brothers, Sanemi and [Genya](https://anilist.co/character/137776). We also get to see more of the hilarious dynamic between Tanjirou and [Giyuu](https://anilist.co/character/130050). Although they may have their funny moments together, in this arc we get to learn about Giyuu’s backstory and how he has become the way he is. Speaking of backstories, we also were graced with [Gyoumei](https://anilist.co/character/137778)’s backstory, which was incredibly heartbreaking. To top things off, we got to see [Muzan](https://anilist.co/character/129132)’s entrance at [Ubuyashiki](https://anilist.co/character/137808)’s mansion and the execution of Ubuyahsiki’s master plan. The cliffhanger of the entire Demon Slayer Corps getting transported into the infinity castle was one of, if not the best cliffhangers in all of fiction. This cliffhanger really showed how Muzan wanted all the smoke because he transported everyone rather than transporting them one by one. I do not know how they managed to do it, but this season of Demon Slayer once again redefined peak plot.




The more characters, the better. The Hashira Training Arc gave almost every character their own time to shine in just one arc. We finally got to spend more time with all of the Hashira and it did not disappoint. The most interesting Hashira of the season had to be Sanemi, Obanai, Gyoumei, and Giyuu. 

The poor relationship Sanemi has with his brother, Genya, is very intriguing and builds off the glimpse of Genya’s backstory we got in the Swordsmith Village Arc. Although Sanemi’s backstory is similar to many others, the way his backstory affected his relationship with his brother is a welcome touch. I look forward to seeing more of his relationship with Genya in the [Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/178788) movies.

It was nice to see Obanai get some more love in the anime. The first episode gave us a great anime exclusive fight and really showcased the art of serpent breathing. The moments between Mitsuri and Obanai sprinkled throughout the season were great. I cannot wait for these moments to be expanded upon in the future.

The reveal of Gyoumei’s backstory really showcased what a powerhouse he is while also being heartbreaking at the same time. Gyoumei’s backstory was much more than just a Demon killing those he considered family. Him being blamed for killing the children he considered family, led to his relationship being established with Ubuyashiki. This bond foreshadowed the big reveal that Gyoumei knew Ubuyashiki was going to use himself as bait for Muzan all along. An excellent use of a backstory to connect characters and foreshadow events.

Other than the Hashira, Tanjirou and [Zenitsu](https://anilist.co/character/129131)’s displays of growth were some of the biggest moments of the season. Tanjirou remembering [Rengoku](https://anilist.co/character/129133)’s words to help him push the boulder was a truly heartwarming moment. Tanjirou has really come a long way since slicing that boulder in half in season 1. After receiving a letter, Zenitsu stopped acting like a cry baby and finally got serious. It is sad to see our comedic cry baby go away, but it is about time he woke up. Zenitsu’s character development in this arc was some of, if not the best character development in all of fiction.




It is crazy how accustomed we have gotten to ufotable’s amazing work. We must still praise how ufotable has once again surpassed themselves and provided us with the most fluid and beautiful animation to ever grace a screen. The use of CGI alongside 2D animation has always been superb, not to mention the amazing choreography of the small amount of fights we got. The 5 minutes of slow motion walking by Muzan may have been the best animated sequence in all of Demon Slayer. It is amazing how ufotable goes all out for scenes that are not just fights. Only a story as good as Demon Slayer’s could garner this level of animation quality.




The OST for the Hashira Training Arc was more of the same, but that is not a bad thing. Demon Slayer has always had a phenomenal OST and it is always welcome to return in any Demon Slayer media.




The opening, [MUGEN (夢幻)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2otdcgLtoowuQzlU0Cx827?si=23bebddaed244d87), by [MY FIRST STORY](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6cutt8thPFUICMfxaYerWd?si=91e7f2832680465e) and [HYDE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0ZXSQd2JNOfwJcLNbX0jpN?si=7502235a831043aa) was a blessing to the ears and also featured some of the best animated sequences alongside it. Even with such a great opening, they managed to also nail the ending too. [Tokoshie (永久 -トコシエ-)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4sWlVvuOg0lzDkC56lWrbg?si=7d74e725f2cd421e) also by MY FIRST STORY and HYDE was a delight that just left you craving more Demon Slayer at the end of each and every episode.




With the Hashira Training Arc in the books, I can confidently say that Demon Slayer has once again redefined peak fiction. Though it may have been redefined, I do not expect this standard of peak fiction to remain stagnant because I am certain the adaptation of Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle will once again redefine peak fiction.



To all the Peak Slayer enjoyers, I love you :)

Paper Airplanes > Training!"
21421,"For a show all about pain, feelings and empathy, Kiznaiver carries surprisingly little emotional baggage. And for a show that entirely rests on creating a relatable, engaging and multifaceted cast, it does a questionable job of that too. But perhaps the most concerning of Kiznaiver’s foibles is that, in exploring a relatively simple set of themes that have been explored countless times before, [Studio Trigger](http://anilist.co/studio/803/Trigger) fails to innovate, fails to execute and fails to handle its story with any sense of tact. 

In fact, as far as substance is concerned, Kiznaiver is almost tacky. This is a massive shame. Going into it, I had high hopes for this anime. And as a long-time fan of Trigger’s works it honestly troubles me to say that I’m:



In an effort to create world peace, a deadpan, kawaii as fuck, blunette high schooler has come up with the bright idea of ‘bonding’ seven classmates such that their physical and eventually emotional sensations are shared equally among them; to make them ‘Kiznaivers’. As ethically questionable and as logically dubious this experiment may be, it makes for a unique and alluring premise. 

Unfortunately, the end result is not nearly as appealing. 

The root of the problem lies with the cast. Practically every character is introduced as an archetype. The most obvious example is with our seven guinea pigs. To list them off, we’ve got: the blank and apathetic MC, the tsundere childhood friend, the macho broman, the lofty loner, the patronising coolfag, the moe crazy chick and a sadomasochist. 



This really isn’t an issue. The point of the experiment is to bond seven totally different characters that otherwise wouldn’t normally associate with one another and build some form of empathetic connection between them.

The initial direction that the show appeared to be heading towards was that, in spending time together and interacting with one another, each of the cast would open up and transcend their stereotypes, ultimately coming to a better understanding of both themselves and each other. At least, that’s what I was hoping for.

And this happens, to an extent. To a very negligible extent. Okay, not really.   

What does occur is that a single, private foil to each of the characters’ outward personas is revealed, and that’s it. After these revelations, barring some really minor attitude shifts, they simply continue behaving, speaking and thinking as they did before. And that’s the thing; the characters never really go anywhere. They don’t exactly develop, nor do we as an audience come to a more holistic understanding of who they are as people. Sure, they aren’t utterly one-dimensional. They’re two-dimensional, which is only marginally better and quite frankly, unsatisfying. 



To say, “oh, the popular fuckboy has body image issues and the reason he acts the way he does is because he’s insecure” doesn’t make for a complex or nuanced character. Why has he never been able to overcome his insecurities? How will the other Kiznaivers teach him to overcome his insecurities? What can he teach the other Kiznaivers from his experiences? How will the experiment change him, for better or for worse? These are questions that should have been, but never were, properly addressed. Sure, he has a more sympathetic side, but is that really good enough? To make matters worse, this ‘characterisation’ is typically presented in a very mundane fashion. This lack of depth applies to majority of the cast, irrespective of their centrality in the story. As such, they never truly succeed in transcending their status as archetypes. To pigeonhole a character with a couple of over-exaggerated, uninspired traits and with only a hazy backstory as explanation makes him/her just that.

It’s incredibly difficult to empathise with characters that are so bland and poorly-fleshed out. We just never receive sufficient reasoning as to why we should care about any of them. This is obviously a huge problem for a show that is essentially a character study. Doubly so for when the central theme is empathising with one another. Consequently, character interactions feel shallow and meaningless whilst the feels fest the series clearly aimed to be was never fully actualised.


There is one exception. A particular character receives a couple of episodes dedicated specifically to her development and it pays dividends. Her backstory is fleshed out in detail, and consequently we are able to fully grasp her motivations, feelings and behaviour. What was even more rewarding was seeing the rest of the Kiznaivers banding together and facilitating her growth and lasting change. These episodes were undoubtedly the best the series had to offer.



This is perplexing. Trigger obviously knows how to make their characters compelling, so why stop there? Even the primary two are sorely underdeveloped, which led to major complications as far as plot went. 

Given that character motivations were vague at best, what was occurring onscreen oftentimes felt confusing, rushed and inconsequential.

Much of the confusion stemmed from how convoluted the Kizna project was. Barring how ridiculous, albeit intriguing, the whole idea is to begin with, many of the systems intricacies are never really explained. Similarly, the dialogue can get excessively heavy-handed. This is particularly the case when characters attempt to express their emotions, where the word choice and sentence construction can become frustratingly circular and awkward. I guess the argument could be made that this reflects the difficulty of expressing human emotion, but it was honestly distracting. 



The pacing was very rushed towards the show’s conclusion. As in, things are abruptly dialled to 100. This, coupled with the cast’s general blandness, led to a real sense of disconnect and thus a lack of gravity or feeling of importance. To exacerbate matters, thematic resonance was also lacking. Not only because the messages regarding empathy, compromise and friendship were predictable and unsophisticated, but because they had been tackled far more succinctly, cleanly and effectively in the past. 

An example of when Kiznaiver loses its grip is when a love pentagon (that’s right, 5 points to Gryffindor motherfucker) is introduced to stimulate conflict. Not only is this an excessive, cheap and incredibly contrived tactic, it’s so out of place. Why some characters that had barely interacted with each other were suddenly lusting after one another was beyond me, let alone why we should care. The melodrama was straight from a daytime TV soap opera, and even then I’m not sure things get this ridiculous.

And that's the problem. On top of the hyperbolic characterisation, the drama always felt so forced. In the end, it's ineffective and only further distances the audience. Subtlety is not one of Kiznaiver's strengths. 


If there’s one saving grace, it’s Kiznaiver’s aesthetic design. Once again, Trigger manages to capture just the right amount of the surreal and the absurd in their artistic choices. Colours schemes are vibrant and psychedelic, whilst the direction leads to some wonderfully staged scenes. 

youtube(9m-RhWDMUwM)

Character designs are on fucking point. Combined with stunning wardrobe choices, this was a definite highlight.



The voice actors did a great job too, especially given how dodgy the script could get. They alone could often portray more emotion then what was conveyed through the story. Soundtrack was pretty unmemorable, barring some pretty neat stylistic choices with SFX. The OP and ED were outstanding, and worth watching/listening to even if the show itself necessarily isn’t. 

Another thing Kiznaiver gets right is comedy, both visual and verbal. This has always been one of Trigger’s strong suits, and they don’t let up here.  The gomorins are outrageous and there are plenty of silly one-liners to chuckle at.
webm(http://i.imgur.com/xG21Kks.mp4)


Kiznaiver was a disappointment. It did everything right to attract my attention, only for things to spiral further and further out of control. Maybe the show would have benefitted from a longer runtime. 



Strong, engaging characters are an integral part of any good story, and Kiznaiver stands as a testament to this. To make things worse, the drama was weak not only because the characters were caricatures, but because it was one too. I guess this is what happens when the Trigger formula fails, or at least when it is applied to a more grounded setting."

There's not much a point to summarizing FLCL--pronounced, ""Fooly Cooly"". Either you have seen it, are going to see it, or have decided it's not of interest to you. Besides that, what literally happens in FLCL is only half the story; and the series is famously obtuse. FLCL has been, since its release, read as everything from a parody of Ganaix' own Neon Genesis Evangelion to a critique of Japan's low age of consent (yes really, look it up). FLCL is probably best understood as an anime that looks how puberty feels, and indeed on the longtail, the show hasn't persisted in cultural memory entire episodes or chunks at a time the way many more narratively straightforward anime have. What burns into the brain about FLCL is fragmented images--a yellow vespa, ""Lunchtime!"", ""never knows best"" scribbled in pencil on a cigarette, a Rickenbacker bass, the giant iron resting on the hillside, Naota's horn protrusions, eyebrows, just to name a few examples--plus knotty fan theories, and the soundtrack--courtesy of Japanese pop punk group The Pillows, and one of the best of its kind.

That second point is especially funny, given that the character of Kamon seems like something of a jab at the very sort of person who'd dream up complex ""explanations"" for FLCL, and to tell the truth the idea of trying to solve the show does seem a bit like a lost cause, not because FLCL is devoid of meaning but for the exact opposite reason. In a way, it's a Rorschach Blot, FLCL has so much meaning--symbolism, allusion, and so on--that it's possible to read it in just about any way you want. Far from detracting from the series' quality, this is arguably what's let FLCL have such persistence. Turn it one way; it's the story that happens on the other side of a space opera, the natives of a planet being disrupted by the presence of Haruko, that hypothetical series' hero, bringing her fantastical weirdness to Earth. Turn it another; it's a psychosexual examination of Naota's coming of age, all the colorful gonzo nonsense merely being the medium through which that confusion is conveyed. Turn it a third; it's a surprisingly tragic story about a young boy who's manipulated into doing a pink-haired femme fatale's bidding in her quest to capture Atomsk for her own nefarious purposes. FLCL is all of these things simultaneously. Fiction is interpretive in general, but FLCL opens itself so willingly to so many possible interpretations, it has ended up meaning a lot to many people. Even in the official realm, the manga adaptation takes one tack (stripping away much of the comedy, and altering some key events, leaving a much bleaker story) and the novel another.

Even if you strip all that away, though, you're left with a truly bizarre action-comedy romp that really has no peers. To say that the animation in FLCL is excellent is underselling it. FLCL's visual style draws from a plethora of influences both Japanese and western (check the Looney Tunes-esque slapstick, and the South Park homage in the penultimate episode) and plays with them for all they're worth. The soundtrack too, as mentioned, is just great stuff. Single-artist soundtracks are hard to pull off at the best of times, but The Pillows' straight-ahead rock n' roll works well with the series' more experimental visuals. The voice acting--both the original and the English dub--are great, and the latter in particular is often held up as one of the best of its kind. Reworking gags that relied on obscure Japanese pop cultural knowledge and replacing them with American ones (a reference to Cherio Pop becoming a gag about Crystal Pepsi is probably the most well-known of these) and choosing pitch-perfect VAs, with Kari Wahlgren as Haruko in particular being outstanding, though in a rarity for dubs there really aren't any weak links at all.

Like a lot of people, I was fairly young when I first saw FLCL and it's tempting to--by turns--either try to strip all of its possible meanings away and present it as ""purely"" an aesthetic work of art, or to force it into a single interpretation, a single box. Again, to risk repeating the obvious, this is a show that has meant a lot to a lot of people. But even more than its sheer fun (and make no mistake, it is a real treat to watch even now), it is FLCL's openness to interpretation that's let it have such a legacy. For a show that never hit the same level of popularity as that other strange Gainax show people like to argue about, FLCL's fingerprints are all over modern anime. Detectable on everything from Gainax' own later Diebuster, Gurren Lagann, and Panty & Stocking. To Studio TRIGGER's grand debut Kill la Kill, to PUNCHLINE!'s whacked-out conspiracy rambling to Flip Flappers more polished (but no less weird) serial dimension-jumping take on the world story genre. And of course, because history repeats, we come to the thing I've been tiptoeing around this entire review.

At the time of this writing we are just months away from FLCL Alternative and FLCL Progressive. Two sequel series-of-sorts that sees Haruko--but no other characters--return, and to judge by the trailers and by the episode of Progressive aired early as an April Fools' prank, these series lean again heavily on the same trick the manga pulled. Less definitive continuation, more alternate interpretation (and I have a feeling that this is why the initial branding of FLCL2 and FLCL3 has been downplayed since the subtitles have been adopted), an effort to recontextualize FLCL, to turn it inside-out, or to bring it into the present day. There is a frustrating, and, yet, entirely understandable, fog of anxiety cast over these continuations of the franchise name. FLCL is a lot like Haruko herself, it will enter your life for a brief time, fuck everything up, and then leave, leaving you to wonder just what happened and what to make of it. People, from the standard anime fan on up, have been sifting through FLCL's rubble for years. That sifting has led to plenty of great art in its own right, and it's for that reason that speaking solely for myself, I look forward to Alternative and Progressive. But, one thing's for sure, no matter how they turn out, the series' renaissance ensures a single very simple thing: the future is fooly cooly."
108928,"When the 3rd season of Nanatsu no Taizai aired, I was shocked to find out about the drop in quality. Originally, I decided to skip out on this season, as the change of studio after season 2 apparently ruined the anime. Now with the wake of the 4th and presumably last season I decided to give it a try finally and hype myself up for the finale. Turn out I got a lot to talk about.

So, let’s start with the animation & visuals part of the review as it is the main problem.

And at first glance it didn’t appear as bad as everyone was making it out to be. One thing was immediately obvious though, the “censoring” of blood. It’s drawn white, which honestly doesn’t fool anyone and does makes it worse in certain scenes where the white color could be interpreted as a different bodily fluid. Thankfully as the episodes progress, the color of blood gradually shifts back to red in more and more scenes. Once you get over the first couple episodes this problem does solve itself and even makes for some funnily ambiguous scenes.
Visually this season doesn’t look much different than prior ones. Even the art style apparently didn’t change noticeably despite change of studio, which is a nice surprise. The characters still look like they always did, with the same visual quirks that give Nanatsu its playful art style. The backgrounds are stunning, and the characters are drawn well enough to make them look good.

Now the real problem and the ultimate downfall of this season is the poor animation quality. As I said, initially it wasn’t that noticeable which made me wonder if the heavy critique was an overreaction but approaching the middle of the season it became apparent. When the plot became more and more action-driven, the animation fell flat on its face. The fights where animated so poorly, that it became hard to follow the action. It became glaringly obvious in the Escanor vs. Meliodas fight, where I’ve seen fan-made animations that did a better job. Without checking back on the manga, it’s probably a bad case of panel-to-panel animation, as there are bits missing that progress the fight and the individual frames lack any kind of animation. And this poor quality sadly is to stay for the rest of the season, you’ll notice more and more glaringly obvious cases of still frames with minimal animation or repetitive frames and overuse of backgrounds or scenes to fill a timeframe. You’ll get a bit of a break when in the last third or so when the story becomes more dialogue driven. The final against Estarossa is animated decently again, just to end the season on a high note.

So unfortunately, the animation is mostly as bad as the rumors make it to be, making it hard to follow the story during combat scenes. These glaring issues are distracting enough to break the emersion.

This season profits from the plot it adapts from the manga. It features a lot of reveals and some of my favorite plotlines, which more than make up for the poor animation. I was surprised how far the story progressed; I remember the reveals around Merlin to be in the final strokes of the manga. Maybe this indicates some pacing issues.

Season 2 left Nanatsu in an awkward spot that season 3 struggled to pick up again. Meliodas has just reawakened and the 10 commandments have now taken Camelot. We’re introduced again to the main squad with what appears to be a filler episode featuring some mindless clashes between the sins and some fodder demons. Thankfully, we quickly move on to King and Diane who are confronted by the commandments Dolor and Gloxinia. They get sent on a trial, inhabiting the bodies of the former King of Giants and King of Fairies 3000 years ago during the holy war. While this setup is a bit wanky, it’s really not different from the manga. The payoff is excellent though: We get a drawn-out flashback arc into the happenings of the holy war and are treated with some of the best reveals of the series.

When the sins reunite towards the middle of the season, the writing does suffer as it gets a bit hard to follow the exact course action. Still, the adaptation does its job as it helps to clear out a few ambiguities the manga left, getting a better sense of where and when the story progresses. 

We get some taste of poorer writing when Dolor & Gloxinia help the sins by fighting against a new threat, the demon Chandler who is sent to retrieve Meliodas for the demon king. Their fight lacks any choreography and makes their efforts look very pointless, resulting in their death without putting up much of a fight.

The final plot threat revolves around the retrieval of the commandments and Estarossa’s journey into madness and the end of Derieri and Monspeet, who probably got the most development of any commandment up until this point. Estarossa wants to outcompete his brothers and absorb the commandments himself to become the demon king, so he confronts the renegade demons. While the impact of this storyline was still there, it felt just a bit cheap compared to the manga. When Estarossa absorbs some of the commandments he starts to go insane, resulting in a clash with the revived archangels. This fight is probably the best animated one of the season, but still barely passes my standards for a good fight.

We are left off with Estarossa abducting Elizabeth and Ban entering purgatory to retrieve Meliodas’ emotions. I’m a bit dissatisfied with Estarossa’s plot line being split between the seasons, as the biggest plot twist regarding him is yet to come, especially with all the built up we received in the last couple episodes. There’s a lot of plot to tackle still and I’m curious how it’ll work out in the last season, but at the very least this one managed to get me hyped about Nanatsu again. In that regard, even with some poor writing and lacking execution this season does work as a sequel for the anime adaptation.

I have to address some issues in voice casting. Its not entirely the fault of the 3rd season though.

Zeldris’ voice actor was casted in the previous season, so I can’t blame it on the new studio. They chose Yuuki Kaji, who already voices his brother Meliodas. It wasn’t a problem prior, as the cheerful Meliodas has a completely different tone as the more sinister sounding Zeldris. We are left in an awkward situation when Meliodas reawakens as a member of the commandments though. He assumes the same sinister tone as Zeldris, so the conversation between the two was just confusing to listen to.

Another weird choice was having Diane and King retain their voices in the bodies of Dolor and Gloxinia. This results in Aoi Yuki voicing a decidedly masculine looking primordial giant… which is just absurd. It does make for some funny scenes, but for the most part it sounds distracting.

Funnily though, when the same happens later with Ludociel inhabiting Margaret’s body, Ludociel primarily speak in a female voice instead of his original male one. Maybe they realized their mistake by then, and this case works so much better.

Spoilers end

Overall, it’s hard to excuse some of the glaring issues of this season so I do understand the bad reputation it gathered. As a fan of the Nanatsu no Taizai series though, I think this season works quite well as a sequel. The story had me invested in the characters well enough to make my way though the whole 24 episodes of mediocre animation quality. Some of the quirks like white blood and a squeaking giant even made for some surprisingly funny moments. Even looking past that, I had a genuinely good time watching it. It was a treat seeing the story from the manga unfold to paint the finale of this fantasy epic. I’d say if you’re just looking for some action driven anime spectacle, skip out on this one. But if you’re a fan of Nanatsu and its fantasy adventure, give it a try."
20910,"""Shimoneta: a boring world where the concept of dirty jokes do not exist"": as a fan of this anime I have a lot of things to say about this amazing show. (DISCLAIMER: This sires  involves sexual topics so if you are below the age of 18 you can not watch this program)

Story: The plot of Shimoneta is about Japan in the future where public morality laws have gone to a point where you can get arrested for being a Naughty boy. our two main characters are Tanukichi Okuma and to Ayame Kajou or in her more known name Blue snow those two are the members of SOX (Sx happens most Often on X-mas) an organization of terrorists that want to make dirty jokes talking legal again.

Characters: In Shimoneta there is a large amount of interesting characters including: 
Ayame Kajou- Blue snow, Ayame's character is a very wired one because we usually do not get the pervy type of character in the female version. Even so her character is lacking some personality she is a very good one especially if you from the those who like the pervy ones (me).
Tanukichi Okuma- Blue snow assistant, Okuma's character is unusual his father was a terrorist when the law were just announced but he was arrested for his ""crimes"". After that Okuma had a harsh life no one wanted to be with the child of a criminal until he met anna, anna chaned his life not just because she cared about him, but because she was the only one who wanted to be with him. At the end of the day Okuma is a great character and a great human being.
Anna Nishikinomiya, Anna is the childhood friend of Okuma and the daughter of the only one Sophia Nishikinomiya the one who created the the laws against naughty talk. As you progress through the show you will encounter a change in Anna's personality. Anna is purest child on earth so she is the best character in the whole group.
Otome Saotome- member of SOX, Saotome is an artistic girl who draw prn for SOX and a stocker of Anna she is an interesting part of the sires because she is not a main character but she plays a big roll in the progress SOX making.
Kosuri Onigashira- member of SOX, with a hair style that look like a winner and being a fangirl of SOX here you have your.... boring and annoying character that makes more mess then a cming boy.
Those are just the few characters but there is a lot more of theme."
20457,"Every now and then, you come across something so average that it's almost impressive. ""Wow,"" you tell yourself. ""How did this manage to be so okay at everything without managing to cross into good?"" Black Bullet is one of these rare gems of mediocrity: the foundation is solid and everything built upon it holds up, but it's not quite well-crafted enough to truly be considered stable.

Black Bullet is the story of Rentaro Satomi, a young man working for the Japanese government as a ""promotor"" to fight against monsters created by the Gastrea Virus. Aiding him is the ten-year-old ""initiator"" Enju Aihara. Initiators are known as the ""cursed children"" due to their superhuman abilities. Also, they're all underage girls. Don't ask why they have to be underage girls. They just do. Shut up and let them do their blatant pandering to lolicons. Rentaro and Enju begin by combating Gastrea, but later a masked man called Kagetane Hiruko and an impending collapse of a monolith defending Tokyo both threaten to destroy the city.

If you think this sounds like an interesting concept, you'd probably be right. Conceptually, this is a very strong series. The animal-themed initiators make for an interesting magic system and the plot is solid enough. However, the show overall feels a bit lackluster, probably due to the low amount of character development. There are plenty of scenes that should be tear-jerking or emotionally powerful. The cursed children in particular get a raw deal and if the series had managed to follow through on what it was trying to do, it would have been filled with heartbreaking moments showcasing just how thoroughly these young girls' lives had been destroyed just because they were different. Unfortunately, when terrible things happened they usually happened to characters with little to no character development or plot importance, and it's hard to take the whole cursed children tragedy seriously when they're used more for cutesy fanservicey scenes than for a serious, mature story. Yes, there were plenty of times times that I said ""that sure is terrible,"" but I said it when I should have been moved to tears.

Ultimately, Black Bullet just doesn't do enough. It's like someone drank a can of Darker than Blackweiser and said ""you know, this is really good but it's a little too strong for me"" and then went on to make Black Bullight and while it does still kind of taste like Blackweiser it's watered down and has this sort of skunky loli taste to it but it's still enough to get you buzzed and once you've had a few you don't really notice the loli taste that much anyway. And frankly, if I wanted to see that, I'd just rewatch Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor  oh snaaaap but no seriously that's basically what Black Bullet is.

If you're really into action anime, particularly ones with sci-fi or urban fantasy elements, you'll probably like Black Bullet. But it falls short of better shows in its genre and it doesn't bring much to the table. It's definitely not a bad show. It has solid writing, a great magic system, a few interesting characters among the sea of uninteresting ones, and a bit of humor along the way. It's just brought down by a few unfortunate pitfalls and an overall unwillingness to capitalize upon its full potential. If you like this type of show, go ahead and watch it. But if it's not your usual thing, give it a pass. It's not that it's a waste of your time. It's that there are shows your time is better spent on. Three stars."
849,"When analysing art, perhaps the most interesting aspect of it to me is in its ability to communicate and inspire people on a very raw, personal level. Art is certainly a very powerful thing and I’m sure everybody at some point in their lives has been touched by a piece of art before. Perhaps it was a movie that inspired you to peruse filmmaking, as the original King Kong did for me. Perhaps a novel that enchanted you to pick up a pen and ensue writing your own stories. Or maybe it was a song that gave you the motivation to finally pick up an instrument and learn to play. The pieces of art that mean to the most to us play an important role in shaping who we are as individuals, as well as our sensibilities, especially if that piece communicated with you at an early enough age. I myself have many pieces of art that have been able to profoundly connect with me before, as I’ve already talked about in previous reviews, but perhaps the most prolific, or, to use a more accurate term, important pieces in defining who I am now as a person, was a series from 2006 produced by one of the most infamous anime studios, KyotoAni, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was the first anime I ever watched way back in late 2012, knowing full well that what I was watching was indeed anime, and it affected me at the time in ways I can’t even properly articulate. For 13-year-old LIQ, it opened up a brand-new world; a world in which I could freely explore and learn about; a world full of inspiration and creativity; a world that I could escape into from my perceived concurrent boring, everyday life. While I would still consider myself quite an aimless guy, even nearing 20 years of age, my early exposure to anime opened up my imagination as I was exposed to media that I never thought could ever be created, and anime became deeply entrenched in who I was growing into adolescence, and profoundly changed my sensibilities and taste in what I wanted to peruse in terms of narrative and aesthetic when it comes to my passion for filmmaking. For as much as I make fun of anime for all its troupes and clichés, it’s ultimately a medium I care very deeply for, as it is so intrinsically linked to my coming-of-age and Haruhi was the series that started it all, so much so that whenever I think back to it, or re-watch the show, I’m transported back to that time in my life.

While I don’t mean to delve too much into my personal life in my reviews, nor do I usually preface them with this much background information, I believe it is important when discussing Haruhi, as to me it’s an important series in defining who I am today. However, trying my best to squeeze out the immense bias I feel for this show, allow me to elaborate on why Haruhi, disregarding my personal history with it, is still a show worth your time!

Before diving into the various elements that make up the narrative, it’s worth pointing out that there exists two different ways in which you could possibly consume this series: the chronological order (which I will be referring to for the sake of this review) and the broadcast order. Perhaps only unique to Haruhi, during its original broadcasting over in Japan, the episodes were all aired in a non-linear fashion, intermixing the six-episode Melancholy Arc with the other stand-alone episodes, while the chronological order places the aforementioned Melancholy Arc in succession at the beginning of the series, with the standalones at the end. During my annual re-watches of Haruhi I’ve experimented with both modes of watching the series, both of which have their own pros and cons. If you are planning on seeing this show for the first time, then I’d strongly recommend checking out the chronological order first, as it won’t leave you in confusion, and as the Melancholy Arc is presented in succession, it will be easier to follow the events of said arc. However, you may feel that the show suddenly loses its narrative grip half way through the series and just devolves into a series of “filler” episodes (although I’d argue these still hold up on their own which I’ll get into a little later) and indeed the chronological order ends on the weakest episode in which Kyon gets a heater (I’ll be getting to that blasted episode a little later too!) Watching the broadcast order is certainly a unique ride, as the show seemingly seems to jump from random episode back to the more narrative driven Melancholy Arc, and intermixing both during its duration does help in creating better flow, but the first episode would definitely be a confusing one to start off with, if you were to have no context of the show at all. The reason for that is because the very first episode of the broadcast order is of a terrible short film Haruhi makes in episode eleven of the chronological order, and watching this film, with no framework for what is happening or who these people are will certainly be a strange experience indeed. However one may argue that this is indeed a good episode to begin with, as it conveys Haruhi’s meta humour rather well, and as this episode is followed by the first episode of the chronological order by introducing Haruhi’s character as she was absent in the previous one, could be a fine way to start. Additionally, beginning the series in such a way firsthand with no context is an experience I will never have as I watched the series in the chronological order to begin with, so perhaps for those who viewed the show in the manner opposite to mine will be able to properly articulate why the non-linear mode of consuming the show is the one in which people should try.


Ultimately, having two different ways in which one could experience the show just adds onto its overall charm, as well as its potential rewatchability (considering you didn’t dislike it by the time you watched one way of consuming the show) and, if anything, the eccentric nature of Haruhi’s narrative structure falls in line with the eccentricities of Haruhi (and by large the show itself). Regardless of which structure you chose, both are definitely ones that will (hopefully) engage with you.

Before diving into the show, first we must establish a basic plot overview: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya revolves around, well, Haruhi Suzumiya, who is known throughout her High School as being a little less than ordinary to say the least. Having spent her previous school years in search of the supernatural or of aliens through means of moving every chair in the classroom into the hallway, or painting large symbols on the ground, or some other variant thereof, Haruhi is helplessly bored of everyday life. That is, until Kyon, our sarcastic protagonist for this tale, begins conversing with her, providing Haruhi with the idea to start the SOS brigade! A brigade that is devoted for locating and finding the supernatural or mysterious and for making life more interesting!

Haruhi’s narrative is largely dependent on meta humour, poking fun at the abundance of anime and manga that feature characters with supernatural abilities while being that kind of show in of itself, with later additions to the cast who just so happen to harbour these characteristics. While I wouldn’t go as far as to say that Haruhi is a deconstruction of these types of shows or anything, it does play around with its meta elements in rather interesting and fun ways, even extending so much as to parody other genres of anime, such as the space opera in episode thirteen, or the detective genre in episodes nine and ten, all the while being able to carry the weight of these episodes just as a result of how strong the character interactions are and how much energy the show seems to permeate from itself. There’s a nice sense of variety to the episodes thanks to the unique powers each character retains to put interesting spins on otherwise mundane activities. Take episode seven, for example, “The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya” in which the SOS brigade plays baseball against an actual team of college students, whereupon Nagato uses her alien technology to manipulate data, in other words, to control the bat and the trajectory of the ball in her team’s favour. And, again, likewise in episode thirteen, to deactivate the computer club’s cheating system when the brigade challenges them to a video game. The sci-fi elements not only extend to making otherwise dull high school activities interesting, but in creating new scenarios entirely, from the characters travelling between different fabrics of reality, or having them encounter strange entities, keeping the show consistently engaging. There also seems to be a level of self-irony and awareness too, as our narrator, Kyon, constantly pokes fun at how ridiculous the show can get sometimes, and often breaks the fourth wall, bringing attention to the fact that we are indeed watching an anime, which to me always came off as wonderfully charming and tongue in cheek, but most importantly, rather humorous.

As I already alluded to, the series can be fundamentally split into two halves: the Melancholy Arc and the stand-alone episodes that follow straight afterwards. The former has a greater focus on more of an overarching narrative, mainly centred around resolving the melancholy Haruhi is faced with, while the second sees her trying to curb her boredom by entering her brigade in various competitions, such as baseball as I already discussed, or going on retreats. While it would seem that the latter half would be weaker than the former as it follows less of an overarching narrative, I’d argue that it still holds up, not only for the energy and character interactions that I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but because the latter half still develops Haruhis and Kyon’s relationship while subtly providing introspection into the other characters, all the while building upon established characterisation. One such example of this would be in the thirteenth episode, in which, Nagato, a character who had been thought of as having no interest in anything aside from books, has fun playing a video game, and by the end of the episode actually admits that she would want to go back next door to play from time to time, adding a new layer onto her character, and making her feel more human (well, as human as possible considering that she is essentially an incredibly sophisticated stream of information, or, in other words an alien!)

While I feel that the latter episodes have enough vigour in them to remain enjoyable, I couldn’t make the argument that they’re all as strong as each other, as is the case of the final episode in the series, in that it is an entire episode of Kyon travelling to a shop to obtain a heater. That’s it! Aside from being incredibly dull anyway, the episode is padded with about three whole minutes of just Nagato sitting on a chair and reading, while the sound of a nearby club, assumingly the drama club, rehearse their play. Occasionally, she turns a page. Sometimes she doesn’t. Riveting! For the final episode of the series, it doesn’t particularly leave a good final impression and is the reason many advocate for people to watch the show in the broadcast order, to avoid leaving the show on such a low note. Funnily enough, it seems KyoAni were even aware of this themselves, and of the reaction this episode must have igarnered from the Japanese fans at the time, as, a year later in their next series, Lucky Star, the protagonist, Konata, upon watching said episode, remarks that, “they really cut corners on this one. Nagato just sat there the entire time!”, before turning to her computer screen and baring witness to the flame war initiated as a result of that enthralling episode.

However, even this weaker episode was still able to contain a wonderful final moment between Kyon and Haruhi, cementing their relationship and bond, and this relationship is the crux of both Haruhi’s development and the entire narrative weight of the show. Haruhi’s internal conflicts and her need for escaping monotony is the cornerstone of her character, and while the other members of the brigade exist solely for her desires (Nagato as the accessory, Koizumi as the man who doesn’t refuse any of her requests and agrees with her on everything and Mikiru as her plaything) it’s ultimately Kyon, the human of the group, who she reflects her personal hang-ups onto, and who has the greatest influence on her actions, making her realise that indeed she is truly human. Haruhi’s desire for an interesting world filled with interesting things is completely viable, as is evident in her short monologue to Kyon in which she talks about the time in which the cold truth was finally thrust upon her. As a child, she came to the realisation that ultimately she is not all that special and is just one person in a sea of millions of people in all of Japan, which not only justifies why she acts the way she does, but it also aids in crafting a more emotionally dense character, and is a definitive point in their relationship as this was the first time she had probably ever revealed such personal information to anybody in her life.

Moreover. in the latter half of the series, Haruhi changes in subtle yet meaningful ways in her relationship with Kyon. Such an example is when she gets irritated when Kyon and Mikiru get along with each other indicating personal feelings for him, or when Kyon’s words have influence over her actions and she thinks twice, as is the case when she offered Nagato or Mikiru as a prize to the Computer club if they won the aforementioned video game challenge.

Perhaps the most interesting moment in the series in which Haruhi’s character grows is in episode twelve, in which Haruhi steps in to cover for a band whose lead guitarist and singer had accidentally sprained her ankle. After doing so, she is thanked for her efforts, in which Haruhi, instead of acting arrogant or boastful at her achievement like one would expect from her character up until that point, doesn’t know quite how to respond and ends up being bashful as a result. Haruhi is not used to people appreciating her, but what’s most significant about this is how she drags Kyon along with her when the girls from the band come to thank her in person. Haruhi needs Kyon for emotional support, going to show just how strong Haruhi truly depends on Kyon even though she would never admit it herself. As much as Kyon would hate to admit it himself too, Haruhi truly does add colour to his life, quite literally in fact, as in the opening sequence for the first episode in which Kyon narrates about his boring everyday life free from espers, ghosts or time-travellers, everything the cinematography is of a washed out dull grey. However, when he meets Haruhi colour returns back into his life. It’s an interesting and creative way to show the affect that Haruhi has had on Kyon’s life, and is one that certainly cements their strong bond.

While Haruhi is indeed a strong female protagonist, and her eccentric, loud and egotistical personality, contrasted with that of Kyon’s sarcastic and cynical comments, is enough to hold the show together, there are some elements of her character that come across as trite. Most notoriously are the scenes in which she forcibly changes Mikiru into different outfits, be it either a maid or into a bunny girl, just to work in some forced fanservice and to market figures and other lewd merchandise that you would expect from a scantily clad anime chick. These scenes are easily the weakest of the entire show, and it’s a similar problem I had with a later KyoAni show, K-on, in which the teacher of that respective series would dress the girls up in innumerable outfits. Mikiru as a character anyway serves very little purpose in the narrative, other than to just drop a hint to Kyon which comes in handy when he finds himself in a helpless situation with Haruhi in episode six, and is more so of the mascot character, as quoted by Haruhi herself.

Nagato, aside from being my first anime crush (I have a serious thing for smart girls with glasses and short hair) commands a lot more presence in the narrative than that of Mikiru, and even has a pretty entertaining fight sequence in the forth episode. Nagato’s deadpan, serious face and mannerisms always put a smile on my face, and she even has a few moments at trying to replicate comedy, such as when she refuses to open the door for Haruhi in episode ten due to her following Haruhi’s orders to an absolute. Much of Nagato’s character gets developed in the move tie-in, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya in 2010, which was actually my favourite movie of all time back when I had watched it those many years ago and comes highly recommended too.

One piece of criticism I’ve seen regarding Nagato, and the show at large, is how she is essentially a dispenser for exposition, such as in the case of the beginning of the third episode, but I believe this can be generally excused if we take into account Nagato’s character, and how it makes sense for her within the context of the narrative to talk on in long unbroken takes about complicated and intricate systems due to her essentially being a stream of conscious information. Besides that, the few exposition scenes in the series were fine for me, either because they were pretty short to begin with so they didn’t feel overwhelming or they were intermixed with Kyon’s sarcastic comments making them enjoyable to watch, so I’d argue that to make the case of exposition being a problem in the show would be a pedantic one to make. The final character worth mentioning is Koizumi, the somewhat pretentious Esper who, as noticed by Kyon, seems to be putting up an artificial personality of who he truly is in front of Haruhi in order to keep her mental state stable. Kyon and Koizumi’s interactions throughout the series are perhaps some of the most entertaining to watch for me, as the long drawn out pretentiousness of Koizumi creates an interesting contrast with that of Kyon, but there’s also an air of playfulness about Koizumi as well which permeates itself many a time in the various activities the SOS brigade finds themselves in too; he is a character whom we can never really truly figure out and understand, and much about him is wrapped in mystery, much like the origins of the organisation he works for, playing in the meta elements once more of the secret black organisation or any variant of that kind of cliché.

The animation as a whole is pretty consistent and strong, and it really does shine in a couple of areas, such as in the aforesaid fight Nagato is involved with for all the crazy backgrounds and effects, but also during the performance of the show’s most infamous track, ""God Knows!"" The scene is pretty well damn animated, and the close-up shots and attention to detail in Haruhi’s face as the sweat pours down her face while she sings to the heavens are some great pieces of animation. However, there also a few moments of poor animation too, such as in the case of the already mentioned final episode, in which Nagato just sits there and occasionally moves a page, and in the case where everyone excluding Harhui face off against a giant CGI cricket. While this CGI doesn’t look too bad for mid-2000s standards (and could be argued that, as this is the only moment of CGI integration, it makes the monster seem all the more alien as it doesn’t resemble anything from the established world), there’s a shot in which the backs of the characters move up and down awkwardly like cardboard cut-outs to simulate movement and talking; it looks rather silly.

The music is also of a pretty great standard, and the track, God Knows, is a song that I have listened to so often that I don’t think I could ever forget it; it’s just so damn great! And that greatness also extends to the voice actors too, all of which do an amazing job, featuring two of my favourite voice actors for Kyon and Haruhi: Sugita Tomokazu and Hirano Aya respectively. Speaking of voice actors, Haruhi has probably my favourite English dub ever! Each member of the cast does a wonderful job at portraying their characters, with Freeman, Crispin's role as Kyon I believe outshining that of the original dub!

Additionally, every piece of music the show has to offer is so intrinsically ingrained in my mind, that every time I hear it, I am transported back to the time in which I first watched the show those many years ago, which also means I remember the embarrassing video I made of me dancing to the ending track of Hare Hare Yukai. Every time I revisit that old video, and I remember how much of a weeb I was back then in my outwards love for the medium, I want to dig a dark hole and stay there forever…

To conclude, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is still one of the most popular anime ever made, and its legacy is still being felt today, with frequent references and call-backs in even recent seasonal shows! Haruhi was a real game changer, and the fanbase exploded when it first came out in 2006, and even though I was six years late to the party, it still had a profound affect on me. Haruhi is a series that I can’t talk about without incorporating my personal history with this community and fanbase, but, even trying to push that aside, Haruhi still has a lot to offer, through its charm, characters and meta elements, even if those meta elements could, frankly, be developed somewhat more and not just used mainly for irony. Haruhi is, at the end of the day, a series I wholeheartedly care for. Perhaps I have been biased. Perhaps I have overpraised the series and looked over its problems too much. But, I believe the relationship between the viewer and how a work connects with them is important, and hopefully I have been effective in communicating that today. With that all said and done, thanks for taking the time to read the stuff that I write, and I’ll leave you with my favourite quote from the show:

The action scenes made me in love with studio bones..from Supernatural fighting to gunfights...it doesnt slacks off...the visuals were also given perfectly...

Character :
 I loved the cast...too much badass characters to sleep on...i mean just look at Dazai...who doesnt love him... Chuuya, Rampo,Odasaku are also next to him....During all the seasons we can see their character development at a good pace. But I found a little problem there...its that there are so many characters in this series and so many side characters dont get screentime...And also they get overshadowed thnx to Atsusi & Akutagawa..

Story :

Season 1: The 1st season fully focused on character introductions...so its a soft start...The armed detective agency & The port mafia clashed a bit ..and Our MC Atsusi got most of the screen time...

Season 2 :This is the real shit...as u can see i rated it almost 10...this season was a blast...at first 4 ep Showed Dazai's past...and those 4 eps were so dark and damn good..then we go to present day and A foreign Guild trys to get Yokohama city so Detective agency & port mafia fight together...the last battle of Atsusi & Akutagawa vs Guild leader is considered the best fight of the whole series...

Season 3 : The first 3 ep showed Chuuyas past and his partnership with Dazai...then a former villain comes up with some deadly virus...and this ssn was darker than the other 2...action is good as always..

Movie: this movie takes place after season 2...the best part of the movie was Chuuyas awsome fight vs a dragon or smthng...that fight made my day...but the movie felt a bit rushed and the side characters didnt get screentime at all...i wished it was made season not movie.

Problems/Flaws : 
There weren't actually any major problem I had with this show. But also there was some minor flaws that I just cant neglect. The first would be less screentime of the side characters. And it would have been nice if they showed more insights of their past/characteristics. And my second problem would be the MC himself. Well there are far better characters than him in the show. And it's just my thought that he is not that well written as a protagonist even though he gets most of the screentime. 

Despite all that this show is 10/10 worth watching and the enjoyment is overwhelming. Highly recommend.

10408,"I will start by saying that this is a work by Yuki Midorikawa, and its story happens in the same universe as Natsume Yuujinchou so is very similar in many aspects but the story itself  is (as far as i know) unrelated in any significant way.

This is a very short movie, but even then it manages to keep a calm, soothing pace and an ever-present bittersweetness that will be very familiar  and appreciated by fans of Natsume Yuujinchou. This anime focuses on its 2 main characters,  Takegawa Hotaru and Gin, and the relation that develops between them over the spawn of a decade.

img220() img220() 
 
Their friendship begins when Hotaru, as a child, walks into the forest near her grandfather's house, gets lost and start crying in despair; Gin, despite being a Youkai is unable to ignore her tears and guides her safely out of the forest. From then on, Hotaru would visit the forest every summer and spend her vacations exploring and playing with her friend Gin. There is a catch though, if Gin is ever touched by a human being, he will disappear.

The whole movie is bathed in summer ambiance and colors. The sound Cicadas, a soft breeze caressing the leaves on the treetops and softly making a wind chime sing. The sound of water slowly flowing down a stream accompanied by the sing of birds and other creatures of the forest. The bright sunbeams that manage to filter through the foliage casting small spotlights within the shadow of the countless trees. The forest, painted in green and brown, the sky in blue and occasional white, and the sunsets bathing it all in tunes of red, orange and violet.

img220() img220() 

The background art is very detailed and atmospheric, often concentrating on very ancient looking edifications and statues of religious nature (Shinto most likely) but also taking special attention to nature like a thick forest area, grass leaves, lily pads or a flowerbed. The animation itself, however, sometimes has a hard time keeping up with a regular TV series (yes, referencing Natsume Yuujinchou again since it's easy to compare the two). You would expect higher quality animation for a movie but that is not the case here, corners were cut in some places and that is fine and all, but its sometimes unfortunately obvious where.


  
The music is mostly composed of piano arrangements accompanied by violin and an instrument i can't really identify, but that is also very present in the music of Natsume Yuujinchou and helps set in the soothing atmosphere. The music itself is so very well mixed in with the visuals and in such good synchrony with the tune of the scenes that despite being a fundamental part of the feelings conveyed in the scenes themselves you barely notice it's there, unless you are purposely paying attention for it.

The character design is undoubtedly the work of Midorikawa, there is no particularly extraordinary people, even the protagonists aren't particularly beautiful, they just look normal and could be even be called realistic just for that but there are plenty of very interesting and different looking youkai, many have androphomorphical shapes with animal features mostly wearing yukatas or kimonos and masks with interesting motives on them, others are animals and others have abstract shapes.

""Can i eat her?"" 

It's quite impressive how much impact the story of this anime manages in such a short time, its not really how hard it hits you but how deep and for how long, it makes you feel involved with the characters to the point you wish and hope they could find a way to solve their problems but you know (and you know that they know) that such thing is not possible. And in comes the bittersweetness Midorikawa is so famous for, but this time delving into romance and drama resulting in what is, in my opinion, one of the best (short) works in the genre that will take you 46 minutes to watch and days to digest and think about."
101004,"(Disclaimer: I guess my favorite character is technically a spoiler so beware)
Demon Lord had no right to be so enjoyable. Every sign pointed to it being absolutely awful in every way. It was the perfect storm of awfulness that has plagued seasonal anime for the last five or so years since Sword Art Online popularized the isekai genre, but here we are, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord being actually pretty fun. Not great or even pretty good, but a lot of fun. Fun isn't something we think about much when we're scoring shows and putting them on our ""completed"" lists, but for some reason, Demon Lord makes me remember how fun watching anime can and should be. A lot of you may be thinking that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but I can't find any other way to describe Demon Lord's charm.

Aesthetically, Demon Lord doesn't do much to stand out from its fellow isekai shows, using the same bright color scheme to emphasize how it takes place in a game world, uses fairly generic fantasy creatures, etc. There's really not much to be blown away by visually in Demon Lord, which I can't imagine being a big draw for most people anyway. I mean, it's yet another isekai power-fantasy, how unique can it be visually? Something impressive is how Demon Lord somehow manages to make impressively skimpy female outfits following it up with an even skimpier outfit the next episode like they're having a competition with themselves. Not a complaint, just an observation from an interested viewer.
Sound design is a little more impressive. There were moments that I was simply pulled into because of how solid the soundtrack was. The theme song that they use to introduce the paladin character, Saddler, was especially epic in my opinion. However, I wasn't really impressed with either the opening or the ending, though they were both fairly mediocre. The magic sound design was also pretty good, but I don't know if I can really call anything too bad after watching Fate/Apocrypha.

Favorite Character: Krebskulm

What can I say? The loli demon lord that loves cookies charmed me and my cold, dead heart. How could aybody hate such an adorable face?

That's kind of a good segway into talking about the characters, which play a huge role in making Demon Lord so enjoyable. Individually, they really aren't very unique, but together they have such good chemistry that you have to smile every time they interact, especially the main trio. In fact, Diablo, the main character, is the reason to give Demon Lord a shot. He starts as just another shut-in (where have I  seen this story before?) before getting transported into the game that he is an apparent master of. Seeing how socially inept he is on the inside, only able to pull off an arrogant and cocky attitude is a lot of fun. It blows up in his face a lot, putting him in awkward situations, primarily with women, creatures with which he is very uncomfortable. 

Demon Lord is just a blast. Obviously, if you want to watch a serious story unfold, Demon Lord probably isn't for you, despite the story being pretty good actually. There's really not a lot more to touch on, obviously it's kind of risque, which doesn't bother me at all, but some are really turned off by ecchi, which I understand. If you're someone in the latter group, you're definitely not going to like Demon Lord, since some scenes can be borderline hentai, so there's that. However, if you just want to watch a fun show, not a lot of depth or complexities, then Demon Lord may just be perfect for such an occasion."
129201,"Summertime Rendering is essentially one of the most underwatched and underappreciated show this past season. It's been awhile since we get to experience a good time conceptual anime paired with a horror and supernatural element. I havent really enjoyed a mystery thriller show this much in such a very long time and for me, this will prolly be one of the best if not the best mystery anime to have come out this year.

Its a type of show that when you put on the next episode, a unexpected and/or a mindblowing plot-twist happens then opens up another set of intriguing mystery to be explore by the next episode and each sequence adds a very well-put element and essential informations that makes the entire premise better and much more interesting as it progresses.

The story structure follows a very compelling and mixed up scenarios as revealed progressively and yet a very well-paced plot executions. Generally speaking, it is divided into 2 parts (comprehensive mystery part) which delivers and elevates well with how it manipulates you into creating theories and prediction that radically engross you to be more invested to the show, And (stimulating action part) which may or may not be a hella at its best and breathtaking like any other action shows but it still keeps you at the edge of your seat.

The efficiency of thrill and emotions that this show has managed to bring out of me in a various ways is an indicative of a really good and incredible story telling. It executes great on its premise, everything is just lined up and make sense, I got clear answers for the entirety of what is happening and a very satisfying conclusion thats unexpectedly made me speechless!

Lastly, Let's talk about Characters. One of the best element of the show narratively, is the great characterizations. Basically all of them are great but I'm just gonna mention the main thing for the MC and Antagonist since this show is too reticent about each characters and also to avoid spoilers,
- We have Shinpei a smart MC that literally knows what he is doing, tho he may have folded and fumbled in some circumstance but thats the thing, you need your main character to have flaws and difficulties in order to experience being beaten up, it is intended for him to do some stupid move and dull moments to have an equal tension and unravel things he needs to improve.

- The Antagonist who are also very smart into playing its cards right that each actions and decisions made make sense. It may not have the best reasons to what they were intended to do but it doesn't necessarily have to be that impressive to understand how genuine of a character it is. It is pretty straightforward but it goes along very well with the story and dynamic conflict.

It is literally the game of chest for these rivalry where the difficulty level is raised after each and every loop. Perfectly balance atmosphere.

Overall : 
Summertime rendering has its own league, an Anime worth one for the history books!
It's a show that I will definitely comeback to or rewatch and that I care about deeply, a show thats surely fun to talk about or discuss with someone. It's been a very exciting, horrifying, and emotional ride along with countless episode rewatch just to build up theories and solve mysteries, its been really really fun and i'm glad to have genuinely experienced it.

P.S. : OPs and EDs are a banger! esp OP 1 <3"
21711,"This story is very unique and rather amazing. The plot was very well developed leaving you sitting wanting more and more. Both main ad side character development was absolutely astounding. Giving us the very mysterious Angelo Lagusa, Also know as, ""Avilio Bruno"" who witnessed something very traumatic at a young age and became obsessed with getting revenge for what happened. His best friend, Corteo who is happy to see his friend after such a long time and will do anything for the well being of Angelo and is always there to help his best friend reach his goal even though he may not agree with everything he is doing. Also you get, Nero Vanetti who is one of the people Angelo has sworn to get revenge on but because of Nero trusting Angelo they slowly form a bond of mutual trust and they accomplish many things and overcome many obstacles together meanwhile Angelo plotting his revenge for the perfect time and Nero being completely oblivious putting all of his trust in Angelo, who is his right hand man. This forms some complications with Angelo's plan and he has to make many sacrifices in order to obtain the true goal. But at the end it may not be worth all the loss he has experienced and the revenge he has wanted since 7 years ago may not be as rewarding as he had hoped due to everything he has had to do to be able to finally achieve his goal, all the blood that had to be shed, all the betrayal, and the loss of friends. One of my favorite anime by far for many, many reasons. I hope to see more like this in the future."
98291,"As someone who plays the love confession and any doki-doki parts of shoujo anime on repeat, Tsurezure Children was like a dream come true. Watching the first episode was like getting a highlight reel of all the best moments in shoujo anime (without most of the typical shoujo tropes), and the rest of the anime did not disappoint.

Tsurezure Children is a 12-episode short that features an ensemble cast and follows the relationships of ten different couples from the same high school, some of which get together, some of which don’t, and some of which end on a high note that had me crying about a season two. While the anime is based on a 4-koma manga, it is not necessary to have read it before watching. 

img()

Though the idea of keeping up with ten couples may seem daunting, each of the characters in the anime have very different personalities and distinct character designs, so it’s extremely easy to remember them, their relationships, and pick up each of their storylines no matter how many scenes (or episodes) may have been in between. The combinations of interesting personalities and characters in the relationships make the show engaging no matter what couple is on screen. And though I had my favorites, I was never tempted to tune out or even skip the scenes with couples I was less invested in. 

Each of the relationships have their own distinct dynamic, and I think the anime did a great job of balancing out humorous scenes with actually very sweet and heartwarming ones. The development of these couple is also surprisingly realistic and not only did it give me many, many, many scenes to squeal over and play on repeat, the anime also managed to capture the awkwardness of being a high school couple, the nerves of confessing, and the build-up of a first kiss in a very real but entertaining way. 

!One of my favorite relationships was between a shy girl, Kamine, and an oblivious but sincere guy, Gouda. They start dating early on, and their relationship is one that felt the most real and also deserved, because instead of everything being super perfect and working out for them, we see the two of them put in work and slowly open up to each other while dating.!

img()

My only gripe with the anime is that it focuses more heavily on four couples out of the possible ten, especially towards the second half of the season. These few couples get more scenes and also appear more frequently throughout the anime. This leads to some great relationship development and wrap ups for these couples in particular, which I loved, but it left some other couples in the dust.

Some of the couples established early on in the series are just dropped and don’t get any kind of resolution. And I’m not talking about couples that never get together, as that was actually a part of the anime that I liked: it wasn’t a given that all couples would be endgame. However, there are couples that just completely disappear from the anime, with no sort of resolution at all. 

While I understand that this had to be done to try to balance out multiple relationships on top of being a short, I wish the studio either would have been less ambitious with the number of couples they tried to show (as I know they already omitted quite a few couples from the manga, so why not a few more) or at least allowed for a quick one to two minute scene that at least gave us some sort of wrap up.

img()

The couples that it spends more time on are some of my favorites though, and I think it’s definitely worth it to watch the anime even just for those couples. Overall, I would recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of romance, but does not want to sit through 10+ episodes of misunderstandings, miscommunications, and general avoidance before having the series end when the main couple finally get together. As Tsurezure Children is a short, it’s a fairly quick watch, so if you have a couple free hours, I definitely recommend checking this out."
20993,"Do you ever have that one anime where you feel many things were going on but still feel like there was no impact? Anime that are of the action genre often come into this dilemma. Ones with an overarching story that tries to make it grand and epic, only to squander it by not giving much to go on. It doesn’t help with a short 12-13 episode season. Considering that Owari no Seraph had a 2nd season in the same year to facilitate its story longer and still come off short is rubbing salt in the wound.

To go back on the first season for a bit, since I never reviewed it, my initial impression of the story was incredibly underwhelming. I thought the way it told a revenge plot involving a boy who wants to kill vampires who killed all of his friends was too simple and drab for me to take seriously. There are ways in which this could work, but with Owari no Seraph’s case, it comes across as predictable and hamfisted with the melodrama. Not only is the story itself nothing special, but the way it is presented is all over the place. Most notably, the pacing is what drags it down so low. There are places where the plot rushes to get to the next battle scene without any exposition to tell the audience what exactly is going on. This is very apparent in the last episode of this season, where the last ten minutes felt like there should’ve been two more episodes to fill in to make it feel more like a seamless transition from scene to scene.



Writing is the key point to any story, and Owari no Seraph has probably the most boring dialogue of any shounen anime this year. It’s like the running joke in America where we think of Hollywood as just reusing cliched catchphrases we see in countless action blockbusters by putting their hand in a jar and picking whatever line is on a piece of paper. It feels like some of the lines lean on the “edgy” or “melodramatic” nature of Owari no Seraph. Even if you’re watching with the worst fansubs or know a little Japanese as I do, many of the lines reek of stale dialogue writing that even a high school student with a novice level of writing composition could do better. They can range from predictable to groan-inducing on many occasions.

Unfortunately, most of the characters here are of the same level as the story in terms of quality. They all fall under the category of forgettable and flat, except for one character, the one ray of sunshine of this entire anime. The character I am referring to is the lovely sarcastic lady,  Shinoa Hiiragi. However, her character development is on par with the rest of the bland cast, her snarky demeanor and voiced wonderfully by Saori Hayami, who does her lines a cut above the rest. Without her, I don’t think I would’ve sat through all 24 episodes of seasons 1 and 2; in fact, I would say the only reason I bothered to continue this was to see more of Shinoa. Her presence in season 2 is just as good, albeit a little more serious than in the previous one, which disappointed me, but I’ll take whatever Shinoa I can get at this point.



Yuu proves himself to be the stereotypical edgy protagonist who shouts most of his lines, blurts out predictable vengeful lines, and promises to stick with his friends' lines. Admittedly, I think Mika, Yuu’s other friend who gets turned towards the vampire side, was probably the least bad out of the suck bunch in the cast. Only because he at least had a role that was kind of captivating to see where he has to battle out his friend’s other friends to reunite with him. All three of these characters are the only ones I even remember. As much as I rag on Yuu’s character, at least I can remember his name and the dumb lines he spouts out. You could quiz me on the rest of the characters, and I will guarantee that I would not make more than a 20% grade percentage. This is the problem of how so little development any of them have despite being in the same armed forces as Yuu and Shinoa or the vampire clan they are fighting against. The only thing we have to go on is that they are fighting an enemy that threatens their way of life; that’s about it. Whoopee.

It is weird to analyze the technical prowess of Owari no Seraph because I do love the artwork of the characters, and even some of the backgrounds look nice to look at. However, the animation is very hit or miss. Nowhere is this more evident than in the fighting scenes where there are some episodes where the animation takes a nosedive. The animators were cutting corners, possibly due to budgeting issues or whatnot. It is serviceable to the eyes and compliments the artwork when it isn't of such low quality. Besides the animation is a mixed bag, I genuinely love how colorful the characters look. If the characters didn’t have very distinct features to their hair or skin, I think my opinion of them being forgettable would be even lower than it is.



Vampires and humans battling each other can be fun on paper but rarely has there been any that succeed in reality. Had the writers taken their time to develop the characters and story slowly for me to get a sense of the world, I think this could’ve been pretty good. What I got out of Owari no Seraph after finishing its 2nd season was just the biggest meh that has ever meh this year of 2015. All I got out of it was more Shinoa fanart to gaze upon with my own eyes. At least great things can come from average places.

Intro

Is Mamoru Hosoda the heir to Miyazaki's throne when it comes to animated films? He very well just might be. In 2013, Miyazaki released his last film, The Wind Rises. I was extremely sad to see him go because I fell in love with his work as a young child. Enter Hosoda, who also did Summer Wars and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Wolf Children is the story of mother named Hana, and her tale of raising her half human and half wolf children. The beautiful story and animation will leave you in tears and with a smile.

Story




Hana, a young student, attends a college and meets a man who shows up to class but doesn't sign the roll. She chases after him and gets to know him. Soon their relationship blossoms and the man decides to reveal his true self as a wolfman. He is the only descendant of a human and wolf remaining and Hana seems to be okay with it. As their relationship they soon have two kids: Yuki (an outgoing girl) and Ame (a very quiet boy). Circumstances lead her to raise these two kids on her own later in the film.

The story, in my opinion, is one of the strongest parts of this film. It explores the  bridge between human and wolf. The thing about Ame and Yuki is that they can ""shapeshift"" into wolves as they are both human and wolf. This leaves Hana to make certain decisions such as whether to take her sick child to the vet or the pediatrician. She also avoids allowing her children to make contact with other children for fear that they may expose themselves. Eventually, these two wolf children will need to make the choice of whether they wish to remain wolf or human. These elements make the film very interesting and enjoyable to watch.

Animation and Sound



No doubt about it, this film is absolutely stunning in the visual department. Studio Chizu and Madhouse bring a variety of color and gorgeous backgrounds, such as the bustling city to the quiet countryside. I felt that the most memorable scene was the part where Ame and Yuki run through the snow.

Takagi Masakatsu delivers a very impressive soundtrack as well. The OST ranges from the extravagant theme of Ame and Yuki playing in the snow to the calm and serene strings during Hana's time with the Wolfman. Overall a very memorable OST.

Characters



While the film primarily focuses on Hana, Ame, and Yuki, there are still a good number of side characters throughout the film. The Wolfman is kind and loving. All the villagers of the countryside welcome Hana warmly and help her settle into her new life. The people of the city are wondering if she has a dog and why her children are always crying at night. The bonds between Hana's family and the villagers are so strong despite them not knowing each other all that well beforehand.

Hana is my favorite character and usually I don't pick the main character as my favorite. She was able to raise her children and persevere through all of the challenges thrown her way. She is very admirable and the kind of loving mother these children needed.


Enjoyment

img520()


The first time I saw this film, I absolutely loved it. But even now, I find it so hard to rewatch. It feels like the film gets sadder every time I do. That's what makes it such a good film. I haven't seen a movie in while that could do the same thing to me. The journey that Hana makes with her family is incredible and the film highlights the good times and their bad. It's such a powerful film and it seems to me that each of Hosoda's films get better. Wolf Children has quickly become one of my all time favorite anime films.

Overall Thoughts and Conclusion



I saw an advertisement for this movie in a magazine and it looked great. I knew I had to watch it. The character design and the long string of awards told me it would be good. I am always planning on rewatching it. This film taught me that life can still be beautiful, even when things aren't at their best. I've been able to relate to this and honestly, it can change your life if you are able to change your outlook on the situation at hand. It's all up to you in the end. Hana definitely deserves a ""Mom of the Year"" Award.  I don't know what to say. I was very excited to see this movie and I was definitely expecting a lot from it and guess what: I got a lot out of it. Watch this! You will not be disappointed."
131646,"Not spoiler free but it won't spoil you either.

Vanitas no Karte or simply ‘The case study of Vanitas’ is about a self-proclaimed doctor, Vanitas, out to cure the vampire race of the curse that plagues them (which is the anime’s base concept) along with a naive young vampire Noé who tags alongside him. Set in 19th century France, Vanitas no karte is one of the best anime airing in the season of summer 2021. It’s a show centred around vampires but it’s done incredibly well, honestly compared to the other vampire shows I’ve watched, Vanitas no Karte comes out splendidly. I don’t say that as a personal opinion, even objectively not only is the concept intriguing but even the characters catch your attention. It is not set in the typical manner where there is the only disparity between humans and vampires with divided factions either against vampires, with them or vice versa. Funnily, we are shown the disparity between them in a manner that isn’t repetitive and has some involvement with a 3rd party (You’ll find out in the anime, I don’t want to spoil). 

Later on, when Noé and Vanitas collide with the church, we see some innovative devices used to combat Vampire’s and proper logic behind them, it isn’t your typical clique where the antagonist just happen to have a strong constitution to combat vampires or just happens to have a one in a million item to attempt to win against them. No, in Vanitas no Karte they have clever items to help them. For example, when a Church paladin, Roland also a side character, collided with Noé, he used a special light to disrupt the power the eyes of a vampire hold and a chemical he injected into himself to gain a boost in strength. Might I add, he very cleverly put Noé (and Vanitas) into a vulnerable position. It was mildly predictable but great nonetheless. For your information, there aren’t any dense explanations, so don’t worry about that. 

Coming back to my previous points, the characters are intriguing. I especially like Vanitas, he seems like a very dominant man yet a very submissive one. From time to time, it becomes impossible to understand him but again, his actions become very clearly after some background information. Honestly, the anime has not covered his backstory entirely which makes his characters seem flimsy and too stubborn but keep an open mind, the second cour of Vanitas no Karte will answer the question of why the kin of the blue moon is a human. The other main character is Noé, who I personally dislike to some degree, he is the perfect partner for Vanitas, not fixated on views, persistent and for sure can keep up with Vanitas’s antics however his naivety annoys me. Noé is more child-like than you would want him to be despite being unbiased and expressive of his views. The mature world created by Jun Mochizuki, creator of Vanitas no Karte, makes Noé similar to an out-cast. Objectively speaking, this may have been done for character growth and to provide another perspective on the whole vampire and human situation. Other characters like Jeanne, Dominique, Dante, etc have various varying personalities and situations (that I don’t want to spoil) which add to the characterisation, even the names are intriguing! Honestly, watch the anime to get a better handle on them.

Left to right - Noé, Dominique, Jeanne, Lucius and Vanitas


This is a very small peek into the range of characters but I assure you, all of them are diverse, to some extent mysterious as well as complex and none of them is unimportant or presents just for gag reasons. The designs of the characters are great as well, Due to it being set in the 19th century, the atmosphere around them feels antique as well as unique. Again, Vanitas stands out the most and his design is amazing. I’ll add here that his reluctance to do some things or his impulsiveness does get annoying but it’s not enough to push you away.

Vanitas, the Kin of the blue moon


Let’s now expand a little bit on the genres of Vanitas no Karte and subsequently any themes. It certainly is a mystery, even I desperately want to find out why cursed vampires exist, what their collective goal is. It’s very gripping, honestly, I can’t type a word of it without spoiling the anime. Comedy is fine, nothing amazing, the sudden change in art style doesn’t make it comedic neither does the change in tone. Yes, you may laugh from time to time but it also feels a bit misplaced and jarring. Romance is similar to comedy in that aspect, it certainly shifts the tone quite a bit but it's not bad when it comes to it. Nothing else can be said about supernatural, fantasy and drama genres, they are self-explanatory. This isn't Boy's love either, some misconception of the show has been spreading as per my information, just wanted to clear that up as well.

Animation is great, I never once saw an issue with it. Quality, as well as strict adherence to the manga, is followed thanks to Studio bones. The background is well detailed, so are the characters. Overall, I am impressed, I love seeing good animation along with a great plot, it’s a very enjoyable experience. Similarly, important scenes are highlighted well and are made animated to make them stand out. The anime opening is animated impressively too, along with the song, they make for a wonderful opening and I haven’t skipped it even once. Of course, an opening is always subjective but animation quality cannot be denied.  At first, I decided the ending is 'meh' but after listening to it several times, my opinion had changed. I love it, it did take me some getting used to but I like it as it is without the visuals.

Finally, the voice acting. Did I mention I love Natsuki Hanae? Yeah, he’s amazing. One of my favourite voice actors of all time and worth listening to, surprisingly he just happens to voice Vanitas, a brilliant choice, you might know him from his other roles as Tanjirou Kamado and Ken Kaneki. Ai Kayano voices Dominique de Sade who may sound familiar if you have seen Konosuba, Yes, she voices Darkness. Other actors include Inori Minase for Jeanne, Kaito Ishikawa for Noé, etc. All of them just have so much emotion when the situation calls for it and are a treat to listen to. They create such a beautiful atmosphere that you’d want to hear their voice on repeat, not to mention, the OST just makes things better, it may even give you chills.

To conclude, watch Vanitas no Karte when you want a change of pace and a vampire centred story that isn’t repetitive. Animation along with the Voice acting make for a brilliant combination and will certainly keep you watching. I fail to understand why the average rating on this show is below 80% but I’m sure the second cour will be higher. One criticism I will add is that the world-building is missing from a cultural perspective, if Jun Mochizuki added more of French culture, it would elevate the anime’s world-building aspect, though the lack of it doesn’t take away from the anime. I hope you liked my review, I certainly enjoyed typing it out. I appreciate all feedback, which you can just drop in my profile as a private message or otherwise (do tell me which review you are giving feedback on). Enjoy watching Vanitas no Karte!

One final blow to convince you to watch Vanitas no Karte!"
15451,"Coming off of the success of the previous season would be a very difficult task to accomplish. After all, it’s in the second season where most harem anime go to die hard without any vengeance, eventually fading into obscurity, so managing to actually deliver a second season of this show that was just as good would be a great sign, and probably enough for many people. Though, High School DxD did not deliver the same enjoyment and quality the first season brought. “Why is that?,” you might ask, and it’s simple, really. High School DxD New went above and beyond any of my expectations and turned into something truly great. This review is going to serve as my reasoning for why I would say High School DxD New is amazing. 

The art and style of the show remains mostly the same as the last season. It’s very reminiscent of any shonen battle show or mecha show of the era, and that’s not necessarily bad. The fights are well animated, the characters have interesting designs, and the ecchi is done very well, which is probably the main draw for a lot of people. The amount of ecchi and fanservice for this season is turned up to the highest it’s ever been, both in terms of quality and quantity. There are more bath scenes, suggestive actions and humor, panty shots, scenes of visible nudity, and general lewd happenings typical of the High School DxD series so far. Again, I can at least appreciate how the series is true to itself and how it decides to go about things. There’s no point in just acknowledging the meta, so why not just go completely over-the-top with it and break the ecchi meta as a whole, right?

The original voice cast from season one reprise their roles for this season, thankfully. Yuki Kaji as Issei, Youko Hikasa as Rias, Shizuka Itou as Akeno, Ayana Taketatsu as Koneko, Azumi Asakura as Asia, and Kenji Nojima as Yuuto return, but we’re also introduced to a few more characters for the season. The new cast come in with Risa Taneda as Xenovia, Maaya Uchida as Irina, and Ayane Sakura as Gasper. There are actually two opening songs and two ending songs this time around, with each song pair being used for the first and second six episodes respectively. Both opening songs are great to listen to. The first one is “Sympathy”, and it’s done by the same group that did the amazing opening song that was “Trip -innocent of D”. The next opening song is my favorite of the two, and it’s “Gekijouron” by a different group called ZAQ. To me, the two ending songs, “Houteishiki wa Kotaenai” and “Lovely ♥ Devil”, aren’t very noteworthy in terms of music, but they’re very well animated and sung by the female cast of the show. That’s to be expected for a High School DxD ending song, especially after “STUDY x STUDY” from the last season.

This is where the real enjoyment of the season comes in. After the events of the previous season, we’re reintroduced to our main cast, and that begins our new story arc, “Excalibur of the Moonlit Schoolyard”. This section of the story is pure hype, especially if you’re a fan of Yuuto. If not, you probably will be one after this arc, since it all centers around his backstory and his growth. This arc introduces us to Xenovia and Irina, as well as the concept of Holy Swords. We get more insight into Yuuto’s story and his path of revenge against Valper Galilei. Genshirou Saji, Sona’s pawn from the student council, becomes a protagonist for the arc, helping Issei and the gang on their mission to destroy the Holy Swords. The overall quality of this arc is above anything the previous season had—both the “Diabolos of the Old School Building” arc and “The Phoenix of the School Battle” arc. This arc is also home to some frightening revelations, especially to the characters of Asia and Xenovia, as well as an interesting plot twist towards the end of the final fight. This arc is full of tense moments, ecchi moments, exciting battles, character development, and a good resolution.

The second arc of the season, “Vampire of the Suspended Classroom”, is just as much good. First of all, Xenovia becomes more relevant to the story, which means more opportunities for some fun harem shenanigans. While season one may have been a harem by definition, I feel that this season is really where that aspect comes into fruition. We also get introduced to Gasper, Vali, Serafall, and Zeoticus, as well as get more scenes with Azazel and Sirzechs. Gasper is the titular Vampire of the Suspended Classroom, and he’s Rias’ other bishop who has the uncontrollable power to stop time. Oh, he’s also a femboy, which is very epic. The first portion of the arc is dedicated to getting to know more about Gasper and Issei training him, allowing for some bonding time between Issei and another club member that isn’t overtly lecherous, albeit with lecherous intent. Akeno also has a really good scenes in this arc, which turned her from a good character due to my onee-san bias, into a genuinely good character. The big battle with the magicians was cool to see, but the best fight was definitely Vali and Issei. That fight was wacky and fun, Issei bringing most of the best moments. 

The characters of High School DxD remain interesting as usual. Issei, our protagonist, is expounded on further. We’re shown more of his pervy exploits, as well as his genuinely good moments. His camaraderie with Yuuto, his resolve for Gasper, his acceptance of Akeno, and so on and so forth. Time and time again, Issei is put to the test with problems that affect more than just himself. Time and time again, Issei has the strength to keep on trying until he finds a way to win. After all, he can’t back down until he achieves his dream of becoming the Harem King. He’s a degenerate, but a good-hearted one at that. We’ve already gotten glimpses into the real characters of Rias and Asia in the last season, so this one decides to go deeper into some other ones. Yuuto gets his own story arc, Gasper is introduced and developed, and Akeno has her own important moment. Some characters like Xenovia are interesting in their own right, as their backstories can be viewed as a parallel to already existing ones. Not to mention her fun scenes with Issei; those were pretty good. 

Though, not every character is that great. Irina, for example, is a character I would have enjoyed seeing more of. She isn’t involved for the majority of it due to story reasons, but I would want to see her and Issei get involved in some funny harem scenarios, especially since she has pre-established history with him. Koneko, too, is a bit of a let-down. She remains basically the same as the previous season—a loli kuudere cat girl who’s really strong, calls Issei a pervert, and gets her clothes destroyed a lot. I would have liked to learn more about her, since Issei himself wondered if she had a backstory like him and Asia. Though, this may just be foreshadowing something for a future season. 

High School DxD New is leagues above the original season in terms of quality, while still retaining all the charm it had. It’s fun, emotional, humorous, and just a good time. I loved to see more development for the already established cast, as well as the antics of the newly introduced ones. The plot progression is well done and easy to follow, making it easy to consume each twenty-six or so minute episode in either a single binge-watch or a spaced out schedule. This show isn’t peak harem anime, but it’s definitely close, in my opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed this season, and am very interested to see where the show will go from here."
158927,"Hot take: This show became uhhh pretty mid and boring, not gonna lie. Why? Well, let me present you with a hypothetical.

You get offered cake, alright? And at first you accept it, and it's good, and then you get offered more cake, and it's fine, then you get offered more, and at that point, you get sick of it, but that's what you only get offered.

Spy x Family Season 2 is basically that. An overabundance of one thing and not really much else. 
Granted, for what it does, it does really well. I think the slice of life moments are well executed, displaying the characters in entertaining moments, and it really helps you show that Family feel of the show. And the sound, visual, and animation department is top notch as always, and it's never going to be an object of criticism for me because from the start it's proven to be really great

But...that's basically the only thing that's in abundance. While most people deem it fine with the show just being a montage of the Forger family engaging in shenanigans, or the other side characters going about the stuff, to me personally it feels like the story has taken a back seat for the sake of filler or episodic structures where it's just characters placed in different situations without so much as a process of development or changes in the current situation in the plot.

Yes, I know Yor's arc on the boat was technically Yor getting development, but to me it feels lacking because for one, it still suffers from the issues I mentioned, feeling like filler, not adding anything to the story, and the development itself feels lacking, like there's no inherent change beyond just motivational changes. Yes, it is well animated action, but the action itself doesn't feel emotionally engaging, because the show has shown time and time again, either for the sake of a gag or just a display of coolness, how strong Yor is. While she did struggle, I never thought for a second she would lose because I knew for one reason or another that she would win, how else would the status quo of the Forger family be maintained after all, if by the end of the fight, Yor doesn't return to her family with them being none the wiser to her job?

And that realization I feel displays the writing limitations of the show. The Forger family has to keep their double lives a secret, so no matter what situation befalls on them, they'll go back to being this happy family that doesn't seem suspicious of  their own lives, otherwise, there'll be a change in the dynamic, and they'll not be able to do this happy, slice of life fluff the show is known for. But having an overabundance of said SOL fluff leads to stagnancy, an element that's already shown given the lack of progression to Operation Strix, Loid's reason for starting a family in the first place. You can have the fluff, that's not my issue, but you need to have some progression, otherwise you'll tire out people from the lack of progress.

Perhaps it'll change with the upcoming movie, but as the second season stands in a vacuum, the show fails to pick up where the first season left off properly, opting to just settle with letting the characters just go through the motions of a narrative without much change in the status quo. 

It's been often said, but mostly ignored, that the mangaka/writer of the show doesn't really enjoy or like Spy x Family. That he deemed it as rehab work, or a side project that he would not commit much work into. And I gotta say, with how the second season went about, it shows. Which makes this all the more depressing when his rehab work basically became his most famous IP thus far, as opposed to his previous works.

After all, if you're probably not having any fun with your work, it's gonna show, and others probably won't have any fun going through it.

Also Yor is overrated. That's it."
11843,"This is a slice of life comedy anime about a bunch of high school students doing dumb, random and questionable things. I am not skilled enough to write a review without spoilers, but i will try to minimise it. Well, even if i spoiled anything it probably wouldn't make sense

The plot is very simple and easily comprehensible, there is no plot. Its just the daily lives of high school boys and sometimes girls. If the viewer reading this is a male in high school they'd probably feel nostalgic when watching this anime. And after a good episode of laughter or sometimes tears, the good old nostalgic ending song plays and a bucket load of nostalgia just flows in, there is no song that can be sang so badly but sound so good, none other than the ending song of this anime

Your friends going to the park to see if someone really sent you a love letter, destroying your friend's expensive figure because you bought him the same one for his birthday, going to school on a holiday because the teacher told you the wrong date, looking under a girl's skirt to experience whats it like seeing a girl's panties and wearing your little sister's underwear to feel what it feels like, memories, sometimes questionable, but undoubtedly precious and unique. This anime is the manifestation of such memories. Getting pissed at your friend for the smallest things, acting as the bad guys to help your friend from being embarrassed, making a girl feel bad because she made your friends feel bad, getting revenge on a girl because she messed with a guy, friendship. Many deprecate themselves by saying they have no such relationship with anyone, maybe some are telling the truth but it is as clear as the blue sky that humans by nature would want someone at least to have a conversation with, because humans are sociable, online or physical we seek some form of socialisation. This anime can feel up that gap too, although it may be fake, we'd at least enjoy it

Overall, yes the animation isn't something out of studio WIT. Yes the soundtrack isn't top 10 and yes the voice actors aren't as good as kazuma having a conversation with aqua but this anime feels... familiar... comfortable because this is not the daily lives of immortal highschool boys, not the daily lives of highschool boys in another world nor the daily lives of highschool boys dxd. Its just the daily lives of highschool boys. Its the sense of equality or relatability with a show that makes a viewer relax and laugh to their heart's content, and theres no doubt this show can do that. If you're not a guy you'd probably won't relate as well to the reasoning behind the male character's actions, choices of vocabulary or reasoning of emotions, but i'd say give it a try. Plus theres a small segment at each episode on high school girls"
21403,"So this isn't exactly an airing show, but it DID release in this past winter season and I DID pay a whopping $15 to go see it, so I figured I'd share my thoughts on it. I was and always will be someone who will at least partially defend the Aincrad arc of the original SAO; it wasn't anything great from a narrative standpoint and had one hell of an ass-pull to cap it off, but it was executed very well and was a very aesthetically pleasing experience. Hell, SAO is what got me back into watching anime in college, and even if it is an over-hyped, well-polished turd (especially Fairy Dance and season two), I can at the very least respect its popularity. As someone who went in to Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale with this very prototypical anime-snob opinion of SAO at the ready, I have to say that I was honestly surprised. 

Now don't get it twisted here, Ordinal Scale is very firmly still SAO. The overall plot is forgettable, and simply a vehicle to get us into fights and show Kirito and Asuna in romance sequences. You still have your array of stupid and useless characters like Lizbeth and Silica. The plot is still incredibly forced and laden with ass-pulls and plot conveniences. Yui ""Deus-Ex Machina Incarnate"" still fucking exists to call Kirito ""papa"". This is all that stupid shit that makes SAO..., well, SAO, and without it I don't think that the series would be as monolithically popular is it is. If you stripped ALL that crap out, you'd have one of the most drop-dead gorgeous, technically impressive, and great sounding anime action movies that I have ever fucking seen in my LIFE, but all that ""SAO bullshit"" just drags you out of the experience and straight into the gutter. The ending fight in particular, where it's essentially just pure fanservice and bad-assery highlighting every character in the cast, was the most hype I have ever felt about SAO and likely ever will be. That is, unless they somehow kill off every male character, bring Yuuki back to life, and make a slice-of-life about her and Asuna living together.

And it's worth noting here that I'm not even ragging on the Kirito/Asuna romance, which seems to ALWAYS be a point of criticism when discussing this series. Their relationship was always more well thought out and respectable than any offering from SAO's contemporaries, which has always been due in part to the fact that Asuna is far and away the best character. I can say without shame that their romance sections of this movie were definitely the plot highlights for me, giving Kirito a chance to act like an actual fucking human instead of a faceless edgedark husk of a killing machine. Their relationship is a far cry from something like Toradora's Taiga and Ryuji, but Asuna and Kirito are believable and charming enough in a world where everyone still plays video games despite almost being brutally murdered inside one. 

If you're an SAO mega-fan and think that I'm an asshole for even attempting to criticize it, get the fuck out of your house and see this movie right now, preferably in the nicest theater you can. It'll be everything that you ever wanted, and it's a true sequel to the Aincrad arc for the series. Those who are more on my side of things should still go see it, as I'd say it's a technical marvel for a mainstream anime movie that didn't come flowing out of Miyazaki's skull. This is the best thing to come out of the SAO franchise since its initial adaptation, and although that might not be much more than ""meh"", at least it keeps bringing along something that's nice to look at and listen to. One day, it would be nice to see this series shake off the bullshit and grow into its aesthetic.

...but SAO will always still be SAO, and that's the fucking problem."
2251,"I originally wrote a much longer review for Baccano! back in 2019 on MAL, but here's an edited and far more organised review, because I’m forever eager to talk about my favourite anime to anyone who’ll listen. Also, this is my first review posted to Anilist, so I’m very excited to share my thoughts with everyone.

This review is spoiler free!

I'm going to break everything down into sections to keep my thoughts organised.

img400(v)

Story/Characters
Baccano! has a non-linear approach to story-telling, the narrative primarily, but not exclusively, takes place in the years 1930, 1931 and 1932 (with episode 7, which takes place in 1711, being the most notable exception to this) and it follows a plethora of characters whose stories are all connected in one way or another. The world of Baccano! is gory, action-packed, charismatic, heartfelt and hilarious. It’s a world that lives and breathes for the characters that occupy it (but more on them in a moment). 

Baccano!’s story is one that rewards keen-eyed and patient viewers, the more you pick up on whilst watching this series, the more everything fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, and watching it all unfold is one of the most satisfying and unique experiences I’ve ever had whilst watching any anime. This is a show that holds its cards incredibly close to its chest, and one of the reasons I’m so captivated by it is the sheer amount of rewatch value this short, thirteen-episode anime has— no matter how many times I go back to this show, it never loses its charm, and it always has something new to offer that I hadn’t picked up on during my last watch.

But what’s Baccano! actually about? A train heist, the mafia, knife-fights, robbers, bootleggers, immortals and hitmen, but above all else: Baccano! is about how people affect one another. It’s about how everyone is the protagonist of their own story, and how events can alter depending on the perspective you’re viewing them from. To quote the show itself:

>“Cast aside the illusion that there is a beginning and an end to the story. The story has no beginning. and it has no end. All there is, is a performance of people connecting, living, influencing each other, and departing.”

I’ve placed both character and story in the same category because it’s impossible to talk about one without the other, Baccano! is less a “story” and more a sequence of scenes and unfolding mysteries loosely connected by the interactions that the show’s large cast have with one another. Baccano! has a lot of characters, however, it never once makes it a challenge to remember them all, due in part to the opening listing each one at the beginning of every episode, but also due to the fact that they’re all so memorable and vibrant. From the impulsive, charismatic Firo Prochainezo, to the violent, stand-offish Ladd Russo, to the timid yet brave Jacuzzi Splot, each and every character in Baccano! has a well-defined personality, and a clear part to play in the large, expansive story. 

Regardless of what kind of character you gravitate towards, I guarantee that there’s at least one member of the Baccano! cast you’ll come away liking. I could write a novel on the characters of this show, but I’m already over 500 words in, so let’s move on to the shorter sections of this review.

img400(v)

Art/Animation
Despite the fact that Baccano! came out thirteen years ago, the art and animation both hold up incredibly well. Of course, it would be immensely unfair to compare an anime released over a decade ago by the standards of animation set today, however, the animation does a very good job of bringing Enami Katsumi’s fantastic character designs to life, and equally does well in bringing to life the time period in which Baccano! is set. There is some really good-looking background art in Baccano!, along with some inventive shots, and the fight scenes are well-choreographed, fast-paced and all have a very energetic feel to them that makes them very lively and fun to watch. However, the main cause of the upbeat, downright infectious energy that Baccano!'s overrun with, is the show’s fantastic soundtrack— so let's move on to that...

img400(v)

Music/Voice Acting
The Baccano! OST is one of my favourite soundtracks ever, and it’s only through extreme will power that I’m approaching this section of my review without outright gushing over the music in this show. Nothing sets the tone in Baccano! better than its OST, each and every piece of music radiates so much style and they all come together to become a fantastic mood-setter. Everything (music-wise) from the animated jazz tunes that play during scenes with the mafia, to the piano-heavy tracks that aid in building tension during the murder mystery aboard the train, is expertly composed and incredibly fitting.

Now's as good a time as any to bring up Baccano!'s opening song ""Gun’s & Roses""— the visuals in Baccano!’s opening are great in and of themselves, but it's the fantastic piece of music to which these visuals are set that truly, in my opinion, encompass everything this anime is about. To call Gun’s & Roses ""energetic"" is to state that the sky is blue; it's incredibly hard to not feel hyped up when this song is playing and it’s the perfect introduction to the crazy ride Baccano! takes you on each and every single episode. 

So, I don’t have a good segue to take us to my final topic, but I’d like to round off this review by discussing the voice acting in Baccano! Disclaimer: I primarily watch anime subtitled, Baccano! is one of the only exceptions to this rule. I've seen both the sub and dub of Baccano! multiple times, and I return to the dub more often than I do the sub, as I consider the Baccano! dub to be one of the absolute best. The English voice cast, for the most part, bring their A game, with my personal favourite performance coming from Bryan Massey as Ladd Russo. I would really advise giving the Baccano! dub a shot, even if you see yourself as more of a subtitle person.

>“What we report is neither unaffected information nor perceived information. It’s the precursor to a conclusion.”

Final Thoughts
Hopefully this wasn’t too long winded and boring to read through. I still feel as though I've failed to convey even a fraction of why I call this my favourite anime of all time, and perhaps I'll never be able to fully express my love for it in words, however, if this review convinces even one person to give this show a try then I'm glad of it. Baccano! isn’t a show for everyone; if you’re looking for an easy watch (something to stick on in the background and switch your brain off to) then you may still find something in Baccano! to enjoy. However, Baccano! is first and foremost a show that's best viewed with an open-mind and close-attention, as, like I stated at the beginning of this review, the results of watching this show with a keen-eye are incredibly rewarding.

TLDR; Baccano!'s a show with insane levels of charm, it’s incredibly fun to watch, it’s got a tightly-written plot, fantastic voice-cast, stellar OST, a cast of very entertaining characters and a large amount of genuine heart and care behind it. I can’t recommend this truly unique little gem of a show enough.

Thank you for sticking with me for this long, and, if you do decide to watch Baccano!, then I hope you find as much enjoyment in it as I did (and still do!)"
20631,"I focus my reviews around three main aspects: art, characters, and plot. In question form: ""Is this visually pleasing?"", ""Do the characters invoke an emotion in me (e.g. like, hate, adore)"" and ""If someone asked, would I say the story holds its own?""

I'll do my best to put all major spoilers in tags, but be wary that minor/general spoilers may be present. 

All sections have a tl;dr at the bottom.



Art 
- 6/10 (animation)
- 7.5/10 (characters)
- 7/10 (effects)

If you like fan service, you'll love this anime. It has an excessive amount of raw nudity and all the usual fan service bits. I'm not a huge fan so I found it a tiny bit annoying, but Arata's reactions to each bit was great so I actually found the fan service to be a positive aspect here.

The animation (not the art) was pretty shoddy, I won't lie. However, I do have a weak side for aesthetically pleasing characters. Lilith, Yui and the Sherlock twins were stellar. The rest weren't bad (other than Akio, which I didn't feel particularly strong about).

!Arata and Hijiri's demon lord forms were also amazing!

Since this is a magic anime, the effects are also quite an important part of the show. They weren't outstanding, but it certainly wasn't anywhere near as bad as the animation may lead it to seem they may be.

tl;dr - ""Is this visually pleasing?"" - Yeah, if you like excessive fanservice (with a MC that doesn't have cliche reactions), good character visuals, and magic.



Characters - 8/10

Definitely the strong point in this show by far. 

Arata - Pretty standard harem MC, honestly. The one thing that sells him for me is his reactions to the various fan service bits, which are far from the stereotypical MC reactions. Plus, he's OP, so that's fun.

Now, since this is a harem anime, I'll go in order of my favorite to least favorite

Yui - Both of her forms top the looks chart for the characters. Aggressive in love, but caring towards her friends. Probably plays a killer Yuumi too.

Lilith - I mostly love this character for a combination of her looks and the gap between her and rest of the casts' reactions to being fan-service'd (most of the cast doesn't seem to care, or invites it), but Lilith reacts pretty much as you expect her to.

Sherlock Twins - A classic example of abusing gap moe, but there's a reason why it's such a well known thing. It works.

!Liese goes from that ""evil slutty mage"" to someone that grows on you solely because of Selina, they also have a pretty good sister dynamic!

Nothing big to comment on the rest of the cast, overall good characters and each have their own quirk they bring to the table, hoping to appeal to as many viewers as possible.

tl;dr ""Do the characters invoke an emotion in me?"" - Yeah, but not by their own individuality, most of the emotions invoked as a result of pair dynamic and gaps between one another. If you isolated each of the characters, only Arata and Yui may be worth their salt. Which is fine, but it keeps me from any higher than an 8.



Plot - 5/10

The weakest link. I'd imagine anyone who completed the anime can agree this is the case, at least for the anime adaption. Things felt really rushed, as there really were no good conclusion points except for where ended up, especially if they didn't know if they had the budget for a season 2. 

Plus, not even the story took itself seriously, but that's an intended result by virtue of the type of story it tells. I don't think the author wanted the plot to be taken seriously, or else we wouldn't have the absurd fan-service, randomly OP MC, people kind of leisurely chatting within a couple feet of each other in a life-or-death battle, etc etc.

So, I don't take away much from my rating because of the plot, just because the plot was built this way (or so it seemed from what we've seen adapted)

tl;dr ""If someone asked, would I say the story holds its own?"" - no, it's a mess of cliche or over-the-top bits that were feel intended to make the plot less important, which is fine, just don't go in expecting a Kimi no Na wa story to unfold.



Overall - 7/10

If you like the magic genre, you'll like it. If you like harem animes, you'll like it. If you enjoy fan service, you'll love it (joking, sort of).

If you like none of those, I don't recommend it. The characters are great, but they're not worth the downsides if you aren't into at least one of the three bits above.

But if you are in one of those three, it's a pretty enjoyable watch. You can't take it seriously, but as long as you know that you can expect something worth watching."
112124,"All in all, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Season 3 was honestly the best season to date, jumping back from a pretty null season 2. I was always intrigued by the concept of Danmachi. On paper, it seemed like the ultimate anime, with a strong not-an-idiot protagonist, reliable supporting characters, no over-the-top antagonist, and a very very interesting story. This season did not disappoint.  Introducing additional characters, Oomori Fujino did not fail on the character development, as it was on point leading up to the spectacular climax at the end. J.C. Staff isn't exactly one of the well-received studios, as many of their works just seem dull and super disappointing, but for some reason, the animation, directing, effects, and even the OSTs fit so well to this anime it made the ending even more wonderful. I've got to say, after watching over 200 animes, this was the first for me to shed a tear to. Even I didn't cry to those sad animes like Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Enough of my blabbering now, let's get into the review.

  
Story
  
With the new season, the story takes an unexpected turn off the track, I was skeptical at first because seemed more like a side story than an actual story for the plot, but all in all the story intrigued me the most out of the majority of animes I've watched over the past few years, and boy, what an ending to the story this season. 24/25
  
Characters
  
With a new story, there are many new characters introduced, all to play a big role. I was honestly surprised how many characters were introduced and even more surprised that all of them had a big role to play through this season's story. The concept was honestly pretty wack but in the end, I guess it all worked out. 24/25
  
Animation and Effects
  
I'm going to be honest, J.C. Staff's animation is pretty crap in other animes. To me, they just seem to be a pump and dump type studio, lousy work while pumping out as many low-quality animes they could possibly can in a single season.  But in Danmachi, it suddenly becomes on point, the animation, directing, music, everything. If only they could continue this momentum into other animes. The OSTs give such a good feel throughout the anime, especially towards the end of the anime.  25/25
  
Art
  
Usually, I  never take points off an anime's art unless the art is significantly different from a traditional anime's art style, and Danmachi follows the traditional art style of anime, clean, sleek, and cute. Nothing disappointing here. 25/25
  
Thanks for reading my review (if anyone even does lol) ! This is my first review and I hope to do more in the future. Follow me for future reviews and ill follow back :p"
127911,"What's up with their eyes?

No, but seriously, this is one of the weirdest eye designs I have ever seen in anime. It actually looks good from some angles, but most of the time it's rather creepy. The blonde girl literally has dead fish eyes. And it looks horrible.

Oh, and, since I see people that seem to be saying that the ratings of this show are low from a lot of watchers  because ""the expectations were too high"", "" everyone thought this will be Dress-Up Darling 2"", and ""yall just watch mainstream media & shounen"": sorry to break it to you, but that isn't the case! (at least when it  comes to me). I went into this with no expectations, and Dress-Up Darling wasn't the best show in existence anyway; yet, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie was just not that good. Just like Tonikaku Kawaii. And my most watched/read genre is romance, so this low rating is not because I get bored without an interesting plot, cool fights, a lot of action, or anything that is usually not associated with romantic comedies. Basically, you don't need to find excuses as to why not everyone enjoys it.

Also, if you're one of the fans that claim that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ""isn't just a romcom""... hun, ""romcom"" literally means ""lighthearted romantic comedy that relies heavily on the romantic relationships of the characters & is frequently a slice-of-life"". Now, can you tell me how in the world isn't this show a romcom? Especially since there is basically no plot/story. I'm waiting for your answers, 'kay?


CHARACTERS


Contrary to whom most seem to consider to be the worst character in the series (Izumi), I'd say that it's actually Shikimori herself. She is obsessive, very jealous, and possessive. She doesn't have any hobbies and sticks to Izumi like glue, and doesn't seem very pleased with the fact that he has friends. Even worse than that, her whole identity is basically just trying to be seen as a cute girl while also ""protecting"" Izumi. That's all she cares about, aside from winning in every game/competition. Well, honestly, it's not like Izumi is much better. I get it, he's unlucky, but for being a main character, he sure doesn't have a lot of focus put on him. Rather, it's like he is there just for Shikimori (and 2 other girls haha, didn't know this was a harem) to have someone to be cute & a mommy for. He doesn't have any presence, like, at all; I almost forgot he was the other main character while writing this. He just exists to be the kind, cute prince that captures the hearts of lonely girls just by being kind to them. But, I mean, he's trying to overcome his unluckiness and do sweet things for his girlfriend and friends. At least he's trying. And his culinary dishes are said to be delicious.

(On a side note, Izumi's unluckiness is not even that bad. His worst unlucky moments were jumping in the bushes to avoid being run over by a bicycle and drowning, though the last one is pretty bad. The rest were just random, almost harmless inconveniences, with him losing his wallet or tripping; so, no, he didn't deal with it well or anything, since there wasn't really much to deal with in the first place. The only thing I remember was him trying to be prepared for anything that could go wrong on a date, which I mean was cute, but not that smart? Since he knows he often loses his stuff no matter what he does, why doesn't he let someone else keep them when he's going out? Like, giving his wallet to Shikimori would have resolved the problem. As for tripping… taking a few gymnastics classes or just doing some exercises to improve his balance would probably help, but it doesn't seem like he has thought that far; he just lets his ""unluckiness"" get the best of him.)

As for the side characters, they surprisingly have more character development than the leads (who have, like, almost 0 growth). Two of them, to be more specific; they have a whole episode dedicated to each of them, and it was quite nice to see. Though, the extra characters that were used in one of the episodes were just pure mockery. But all in all, the side characters are better than the main ones, that's how bad this show is.


STORY


Just in case you were wondering… I haven't mentioned anything about the story because there is literally no story. It is a slice of life romcom with school setting; and instead of going for a boring, generic plot, the mangaka (since I suppose the ""story"" is the same in the manga) chose to not have one at all. Which is not a problem at all, don't get me wrong; however, it means that in order to make the anime/manga enjoyable, it is a must for the characters to have amazing chemistry (among other things). And sadly, this is not the case at all. The main focus of the show, Shikimori and Izumi's romantic relationship, is very awkward and unrealistic. They are supposed to have been together for one year already, yet act like they have only known each other for 4 months at best. It's like they don't even really know each other's personalities that well. It's just... very weird, you know. They don't seem to be comfortable with each other at all, and it bothers me. It feels like they are both looking at an idolized version of their partner, only seeing what's at the surface: a soft unlucky guy that needs to be protected and a cool, beautiful, perfect girlfriend. Well, the point is that their chemistry it's rather weak, and nowhere near good enough to make me want to watch more of it. Though, a 12-14 years old person may find it cute and enjoyable, I guess, its demographic is shoujo after all.

The friendship of the rest of the characters feels off sometimes as well, but overall it's passable. The trio of girls (Shikimori, Nekozaki and the other one) seem rather awkward with each other for being friends for more than a year. Again, it's like they have only known each other for like 4 months.


ART STYLE/ANIMATION


When it comes to art style and animation, well... The animation is as good as it can get, and the style itself is pretty nice, though generic. Very charming color palette, well suited for the genre, atmosphere, and demographic. But like I said, weird eyes. Oh, and while I did say the animation was good, it had some slip ups here and there.



CONCLUSION/ENJOYMENT 


Well, having said all that, here's the catch: it's not a horrible anime. As far as entertainment goes, it is actually passable. In short, I didn't hate watching Shikimori trying to look cute for a date, Izumi having to spend his time at a school event in the library, Nekozaki laughing  or smiling most of the time, and  Inu's laid back attitude. I mean, if I did, I wouldn't have completed the anime. What I'm getting at is that it is not that bad of a show either. At least when it comes to the enjoyment.

The best thing about it, though? Its OP! Hands down one of the best this year. The ED was pretty enjoyable as well."
143270,"When Lycoris Recoil begins, Takina wants nothing more than to get back to the DA and return to the position that she once had there. Her disobedience in the field has led to her expulsion, and she is unceremoniously dumped into a new setting with a partner, all of which she never asked for. As far as Takina is concerned, everything that happens over the next several weeks is meant to serve the purpose of getting her back to the DA, and she makes that stance rather clear. So, imagine her surprise to see that supposedly one of the best Lycoris that the DA ever produced is the happy-go-lucky Chisato, who acts without a care in the world and seems to spend more of her time having fun than taking her role as a Lycoris more seriously.

As time moves forward with Chisato and Takina spending more time together, we learn some rather fascinating things about Chisato – she’s not only extremely good at what she does (dodging bullets as though they were barely moving at all), but she also doesn’t adopt the traditional Lycoris method of killing her targets. She subdues them, defeating them non-fatally regardless of the wrongs that they committed. She gives triage to one lackey, asking if he has any plans for later that evening. Takina is indignant at this merciful approach, especially given that the lackey didn’t care whether she or Chisato lived or died. As far as Chisato is concerned, the lackey lost and his job is done. She doesn’t say it aloud or in this exact way, but it’s time for him to move on with his life.

The idea of “moving on,” of continuing to march forward anyway regardless of what life has in store for you, is central to what makes Lycoris Recoil work as a narrative. Nearly every character in the show is, in some way, shape, or form, dealing with a past or a past event that has colored them personality-wise, professionally, or perhaps at an even-more-fundamental level. It doesn’t matter whether the root of the cause was through disobeying orders, clinging to a fleeting reputation, or a relationship that, for one reason or another, simply did not work out for the best. Lycoris Recoil takes the numerous frameworks of past-as-influence and demonstrates how they impact a character or larger social structure’s thinking, and how one’s ability to go with the flow or obstinacy impacts their ability to navigate the present.

Depending on who is it, the evidence of this is rather apparent. The notion that a life for Takina exists outside the DA, or that she might never return to the DA building proper (despite still technically working for them as a Lycoris) and has to adapt to this new life against her will, is a gnawing thought. Chisato’s very existence and manner-of-being seems antithetical to the Lycoris calling or lifestyle, and the idea that Takina has to work with her naturally creates a source of tension between the two. 

Takina was already rather brusque and blunt beforehand, but her circumstances have, interestingly enough, caused her to act even more brusque, which puts her chances at getting back to the DA even further away. It was that very attitude and manner of thinking that caused her to be kicked out, so indulging that attitude and manner under the assumption that it will get her what she wants, rather ironically, doesn’t do her any favors of getting what she wants. Moving on for Takina is not something that she wants to do, but rather is something that she has to do, because the door back to the DA is seemingly closed forever.

Chisato clashing with Takina does not merely manifest in terms of everything Takina wants to be, but also in how readily she accepted her life’s position. The DA makes it clear that Chisato is special, if not occasionally aggravating in more ways than one. But she doesn’t pay that thought any mind; if anything, it’s just something she lives with by shrugging her shoulders and readily wanting to scarf down some sweets. Chisato evidently learned a long time ago that you don’t always have control over the things in your life, and that as a result, some things are just not worth stressing about or worrying about. The bleakness that being a Lycoris entails, the demands of the job’s less-glamorous aspects, makes her cheery personality absolutely magnetic. If Takina’s experience getting kicked out of the DA is any indication, Chisato long-since knew that it was not a place for her. 

Why go back to the DA building when she’s enjoying herself and her work, having fun and playing video games, fraternizing with patrons, and the like? Why go back to an organization that gives carte blanche to kill their targets when Chisato lives her life to the fullest every day? Lycoris Recoil uses its two main characters to reflect two possible outcomes of being thrown into a similar situation. Both are out of the DA’s picture for the most part and had to move on, yet each approaches the matter by entirely-differently means. The juxtaposition between Chisato and Takina’s attitudes is what ultimately keeps the show’s focus tethered; at times, they butt heads. At other times, they act like old friends or sisters. Through its two main characters as the main vehicle, the show’s tone allows many of its moments to work in either the dramatic or comedic sense, if not both at the same time. They learn to move on with their lives together. And as they grow together as individuals and as a pair, each of them possesses qualities that makes either doing their jobs easier or running Café LycoReco more reliable and stable. 

For the DA, the idea of “moving on” is essentially their motto – keep life moving on ordinarily, and don’t let the public know of anything unpleasant going on behind the scenes. As is often the case with science-fiction (action-oriented or otherwise), the future does not promise that there will be no more crime or no more problems. Various agendas, groups, and people will still crop up to cause trouble, either at seemingly-random moments or through calculated planning and execution. The Lycoris as the secret police of their world themselves have an ordinary appearance, dressed like schoolgirls to casually hide in plain sight, making them effective assassins / escorts. After all, who would suspect a cute girl to have a gun in her pocket, keeping the city safe as life moves on? The city itself also embodies this overarching ideology – the ruined tower stands as the final monument to a terrible event from the past, standing out like an eyesore against the far-more clean, pristine cityscape foreground that surrounds it. Its existence acts as a symbol that the supposed tragedies of the past will not be repeated because they, as a city and as a citizenry, have moved on.

But for every character or every system in place that tries to just move on, there is someone or something operating in the background that cannot do so, or at least not in the same way as others. The indignation at seeing the world around them, or being stuck in a place or memory that consumes their very thoughts seemingly day-in and day-out, fuels their desires to seize the present for their own purposes. Lycoris Recoil uses the collisions between the society and characters that have moved on versus those that have not to set up its overarching mystery. The result is a roster of characters that is equally as colorful as they are varied in motivation and appearance. While the series flirts rather dangerously with oversaturation, it never crosses the boundary since everyone’s personality and actions command attention, even if the “why” doesn’t unveil itself until later in the run.

It’s because we understand why these characters are doing what they do, or are intrigued by the mystery that gradually unearths itself, that make many of the action sequences themselves so compelling to see. Director and series composer [Adachi Shingo’s](https://anilist.co/staff/110189/Shingo-Adachi) previous efforts as chief animation director for numerous Sword Art Online installments reveals that he has a keen eye for an action scene’s sense of motion and fluidity. This is not a series that oozes sakuga, but the motions metaphorically feel slick—even in its gunshots—because the characters at the center of the conflict are all distinct. While they could have easily gotten by solely on personality alone, each sequence heightens the tension, progresses the plot, and most of all, keeps the theme I’ve been hinting at in focus.

But action scenes are enhanced ever-further by strong characters, which is where Lycoris Recoil shines. In that sense, perhaps Adachi himself has moved on from the older stories that defined his previous work. It’s worth remarking that this is Adachi’s first time serving as both a director and series composer, responsible for most of the show’s inner substance. I cannot say this with certainty, but I imagine that he paid close attention to the idea that detractors of Sword Art Online complained about the lack of interesting characters, or at least that there wasn’t enough adequate emphasis placed on character to make the good action scenes even better. With him now in command of his own team and Asauro’s story and characters, designating jobs and tasks to those who are able to handle the things that he cannot, he has likewise moved on to something newer and, frankly, grander. The fact that production on the series was finished before its first episode aired is a testament to all involved that they wanted to make the best product possible. 

Lycoris Recoil has the notion of “moving on” throughout its entire run and even into its very lifeblood creatively, fueling many of the drives behind its background plot manipulations, character dynamics and interactions, and is woven into the foundation of the world it created. Bolstered by two strong characters who initially contrast like cats and dogs, it manages to honor its theme both in terms of its comedic and dramatic payoffs, occasionally at the same time and always without sacrificing the overarching mystery. Watching this series was a pure delight, and I will well-and-truly miss it.

As an aside, I want that Takina parfait!"
11597,"“The first requirement of being a hero isn’t being right. It’s being strong. That’s why the hero always wins.” -Araragi Koyomi

Within moments of starting this sequel in the Monogatari series, I realized that I was in for something entirely unexpected. Both the storytelling and character development throughout this entry was clearly defined with the goal of building up the characters of Araragi’s sisters. Even still, none of the previous characters in the past were neglected at all. Rather, they too received some kind of development during the storyline that was entertaining to say the least. One of the key elements that had set this installment apart from the rest was its use of indirect comedy. If nothing crazy was happening at the moment, you could count on some hilarious moments that would soon make the situation look crazy enough. Just the pure energy of this sequel was far different than before, but in the best way possible. While still staying true to its supernatural oddities that we all first fell in love with, Nisemonogatari manages to create an even more unique experience that sets itself apart from the rest of the series. You’re sure to enjoy every moment you spend with the Araragi Fire Sisters!

Art and Animation: 9.3/10
- While still keeping the same art style, this entry takes it one step further and adds more color to the world than ever before! The camera shots are far less aggressive as well, which makes for a more enjoyable viewing experience for those with sensitive eyes. This installment definitely felt like an upgraded version of the signature art style we all came to love. The color palette was a lot more diverse, and it gave scenes more impact or energy when it was needed. When it came down to animation, there was never a major flaw to be seen. Fluid movements and solid character designs were all present, which all paid off when the time came for these aspects to be put to full use.

Storyline and Character Progression: 8.9/10
- Not the deepest or darkest of storylines, but entertaining till the end. Both the pace and execution of the overall premise was almost perfect, with nothing ever feeling too rushed or left with unanswered gaps. The incorporation of comedy was almost too good to even put into words. In parts where comedy didn’t seem like it would fit the situation, Nisemonogatari proved that comedy was JUST the thing to make the moment more memorable. As a result, there was never a dull moment where you felt the story drag on without any real progress. When it came to the ecchi in this season, it had a more “teasing” feel to it. Both the ecchi and comedy were used in just the right amount, especially when they were used in unison. Character progression was more focused this time around to just a select few, these mainly being the Araragi sisters. The development that they had received turned them from occasional side characters to full blown supporting roles whose existence couldn’t be ignored anymore. Even Kiss-shot had received some much needed development that reaffirmed her as one of the main roles with an interesting and complicated attachment to Araragi. When it came to the rest of the cast, none had received any groundbreaking development as much as Senjougahara. We were able to get a little more insight into her dark and sufferable past as new information came to light. So while the storyline itself had a solid foundation that never provided a dull moment, the character progression wasn’t as deep or to the same degree as its previous entry.

Soundtrack and Audio: 8.3/10
- The soundtrack of this season wasn’t its strong suit, but it was by no means anything bad. While it did have a soundtrack that was very memorable in itself (especially that second OP), the message and storytelling behind each song wasn’t as strong. The soundtrack throughout the storyline was definitely used at the right moments, never ruining the mood or taking away from an important moment. In regards to audio, the same high quality performance was still in effect this time around even with the introduction of new faces.

In conclusion, when it came down to pure entertainment and enjoyment, I really did enjoy all this season had to offer. Whenever the storyline was progressing, comedy was able to be implemented without hindering it. The character development was both informative and entertaining, with a little more backstory being added to some characters you may be more interested in. And the best part? No one felt neglected, with everyone being given a chance to contribute to the hilarious mood of Nisemonogatari. Both the pacing and overall feel of everything was very comfortable, making for one definitely enjoyable binge session if you’re up for it. This season definitely deserves its overall score of 8.8/10. With even more characters being added to bring depth to the storyline, this series is far from being over. Until the next one, see y’all later!"
11887,"Kokoro Connect is the probably the most underrated anime of 2012. Though its low rating is mostly because of the huge amount of hype surrounding it, and as with most things, hype ends up with expectations nothing can ever meet. Still, now that the both the hype and hate are dead, it is realized that Kokoro Connect isn't really all that bad. In fact, its pretty damn good. The genres are wrongly tagged, It isn't about comedy (though it is funny at times) and it isn't about the supernatural. While, yes, the supernatural is used a lot, it really just serves as a plot device. Kokoro Connect is really more close to Angst, Love Polygon and Slice of Life, if you can't handle even one of what I listed above, walk away now. That said, let's get to the heart of it (not gonna include Micchi random here, it gets its own separate review).


 Artwork (9/10)
The artwork in Kokoro Connect is reminiscent of moe culture, and it really is quite good. Now, I have never been a fan of moe, but it works very well for the series.
 img()

As you can see, the character faces are quite cute (like, K-On! cute), and the character models are great too. Its not outstanding, but its something you can't really complain about. Some people might think that moe and angst don't go together, but Kokoro connect makes it work. No, wait, it doesn't  make it work, it actually works pretty damn well. The expressions go hand in hand with the great voice acting and the animation is just icing on the cake. Almost flawless. 
Tears, joy, surprise, no matter what emotion needs to be shown, its portrayed in that sweet spot.

The environment, is also just lush, detailed and colorful. What else can a guy ask for?

Silverlink really pulled all stops on this one.

 Sound and music (9/10)

Perfection, perfection. The voice acting is downright brilliant in terms of portraying emotions. Even though I don't really understand Japanese, the voice acting just somehow bridged that barrier and reached out, it almost breathed life into the characters single-handedly. The voices actually get hoarse after shouting a bit, and the sobbing is as real as anything I have ever seen. It is further complemented by great background music which is soft when it needs be and intense when required. 

Then of course, we have the music. Kokoro Connect has a overwhelming 3 OPs and 4 EDs for its 13 episodes. While none of them are bad, my favorites are ED01 and ED02. The first OP is also very good, but it needs a bit of getting used to. All the OPs share the same music video while the EDs have different ones. This is probably one of the extremely rare cases where an ED is better than an OP.

 Story (27/30) 
Firstly, the genres. As I already mentioned, KC is closer to angst than comedy, so someone coming for the comedy will be repulsed by KC, which is bad considering that Kokoro Connect is the probably the best in the Angst genre. Yes, wrong categorization sucks.

 Premise - The premise of Kokoro Connect relies on five members of the cultural research club who are great friends, but one day they realize that their personalities have started exchanging, which means A is now in B's body and B is now in A's body. This happens at random intervals and stays on for random intervals of time. Yes, its problematic, and now everyone will have to bare their true self to each other whether they like it or not, as their friendship is put to the ultimate test.
A unique and very promising premise indeed. See, that is why I mentioned at the start that it is not supernatural. Even though the the personality change in itself is paranormal, it is just a plot device whose only purpose is to act as the catalyst to the reaction which will destroy friendships. Just like a catalyst, it lowers the amount of drama needed to snap the bonds, which is a good thing. It spares the viewer from needless melodrama and still delivers the slice of life type friction we all know and love. In fact, the supernatural is not explained at all, it is just a plot device, leave it at that. 

  As a minor footnote -Some people think ""plot device"" is a bad thing. Which it really isn't. Yeah, sure bad plot devices are awful, but clever ones like the one is Kokoko Connect only serve to further the series's greatness. 

 img()

  Execution - Execution is where most plotlines falter and break, but KC manages to uphold itself with an engaging story and its great character development (I'll ramble about character development in the next section). The strength of Kokoro Connect relies on a surprising plot. It isn't something you can just see coming, in fact there are absolutely no warning signals before Kokoro Connect changes its course. Most people are shocked by the sheer darkness of the plot, but then KC suddenly turns bright before taking another nosedive into darkness. While the brightness is a logical conclusion, you will almost never be able to see it coming, and it will be too late once it happens. In retrospect, such extreme changes can also be seen as bad for those that love angst, but for me, I was just relieved - nay, happy, things didn't go any further south. 
One thing that is really wanted in KC is continuation between arcs. It mentions a time frame has passed since the last phenomenon, but it never really looks that way, and the sudden change from one arc to another can be very annoying. 

Still, for the first time since Clannad after story, I cried (ep05) thanks to Kokoro Connect. Which is quite a feat in itself.

 img()
 Characters (25/30) 
Most characters are alive and meaningful, with great back-stories, with ulterior motives and childhood trauma. Despite that, I couldn't help but think that something is missing, and then it hit me. The characters development squad's  only focus are the females (Inaba, Inori and Yui), while the development is good, it isn't across the board but very specific. Taichi and Aoki get almost no development or history at all (although, this is remedied in Micchi Random), and the support crew is left hanging too. For some reason though, this never once hit me while I watched the series itself, it was more of an afterthought, so I guess you will be fine unless someone tells this to you (Sorry?)

 Enjoyment (16/30)
While KC was definitely enjoyable, it wasn't something that is for everyone. You need to have a very specific taste to enjoy KC in all its glory. Its romance is very good, so it will definitely appeal to those that like romance/tragedy. But at the same time, KC's romance can get nerve-wrackingly boring at times. Even so, KC still shines out as one of the best series I watched.

Final Verdict - 87/100.

4654,"img()

I'll destroy that illusion of yours. It's a catchphrase belonging to a certain spiky-haired boy who resides in a world conceived by the light novel writer, Kazuma Kamachi. Index is that world, and if you want to know more about it, then I say get ready because we're in for a ride through the depths of hell and heaven. With a lot of punching too, bear in mind. This is the anime adaptation after all.

Think about the two great systems that are ingrained deeply within our connection to the universe. Religion and science. The duality, the coexistence, and the friction. It's definitely a story idea of many potentials and this show has utilized it with supernaturalism in mind. We have Touma, a high schooler who possesses a mysterious right hand that can neutralize every supernatural powers. Being a misfortunate guy, he's taken in on a journey split between the magic and the science side. But here's where the main issue arises. The solitary nature of each arc means that there is no core holding everything together. It creates this weary repetition and detaches any sought-out continuation into a bigger story. Exposition is also quite problematic, mostly to do with tediousness, as explanations of religious and scientific concepts can get long-winded. Thankfully, the characters manage to retain interest with the conflicts and entertainments they give to us. Relying on the calm before the storm formula, the slice-of-life scenes have a lot of great humor in the form of witty dialogues, except for maybe the biting gags and some fan services that are sprinkled throughout. During the more serious moments, the magicians and espers complement well in each respective arc and have integrated themselves into some good discussions of ideals, morals, and history. Sure, a lot of them do feel bland with only a couple getting focused developments, but their dichotomies have at least applied to the two great systems of mankind.

And if not for the audiovisual, this world where religion and science coexist as supernatural powers wouldn't have come to life. Academy City is the place where most of the story resides in. As it's a fairly architectural and diverse city, the characters are taken to a lot of different settings that are meticulously designed. Like a metallic tint, the washes of blue, red, and purple fit both the magical aspect of religion and the near-futurism of science. The animation is quite solid on an overall basis although there at times where some minor details are lost. With Touma being a guy that could only rely on his right hand, his way of brute fighting stands out among all the supernatural powers that glow and shimmer with devastating effects. Seeing the punches knock down his opponent can be a satisfying thing in itself. Anyway, something the visual has done to mitigate the boredom caused by numerous expositions is to preoccupy the characters with other actions, usually comical in nature, so they're not like dead presenters. The mix of fast-paced electronic beats and lighthearted soundtracks also help to bring even more enjoyment to this show. While the serious tracks shake things up as conflicts escalate, the cheerier ones supplement the slices-of-life pretty nicely, especially when comedic sound effects are played. Both the opening songs sung by Mami Kawada are really cool to listen to as well.

You know, despite the issues that came with it, the first season treats its adaptation of the Index light novels quite competently. Weariness from how the story is structured and the bland surface of the characters does clash against enjoyment, but overall, the world of religion and science provides a good starting point for more expansion."
21595,"It's no secret that everyone, even those who think they're perfect, has at least one flaw, but to every rule (although it's not really a rule), there's always an exception. Who is that exception? Could it be a certain high school boy with glasses and a mole under his left eye? I've known of the manga that contains such a person for a while now, and when an anime adaptation was announced, I decided to check it out. All I've got to say is, ""It was fun while it lasted.""

Haven't you heard, ladies and gentlemen, of Sakamoto? Good, because I'm reviewing ""Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto"", known in Japanese as ""Sakamoto desu ga?""

Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto centers around Swagamoto - er, I mean, Sakamoto - a high school student who is basically the ""perfect human"". There's nothing he can't do, and he's got good looks, too. Needless to say, he instantly wins the hearts of girls and the jealousy of boys. Even in a tight situation, he emerges from said situation with elegance, grace, and, dare I say it, swag. Basically, this anime follows the (mis)adventures of Swagamoto - dang it, WHY CAN'T I SAY SAKAMOTO PROPERLY - and his classmates throughout his first year of high school.

The first thing about this anime I'd like to take note of is its animation. I've seen a decent amount of anime from Studio Deen, but this has to be some of the best animation I've seen from them, with some decent character designs to go with it. The voice acting is pretty solid, too, especially Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto; his voice adds to Sakamoto's coolness. The ending theme, ""Nakushita Hibi no Sayonara"" by Suneohair, is a pretty beautiful song, but I personally loved the opening theme, ""COOLEST"" by Customi Z, even more. Pardon the incoming pun, but it's a really COOL song! ....Moving on.

The story of this anime is pretty episodic, and they always seem to end with Sakamoto staying on top of things. It can get a bit repetitive at times, but luckily, this anime does shake things up a bit and keep it fresh. There are more funny and amusing moments than there are not, and I would either find myself grinning or laughing at times. As for the characters, some are likable, while some are characters I didn't care much for. If there was a character I had to pick as my favorite, it's Acchan; the fact that he's voiced by one of my favorite seiyuus aside, he was given a good amount of development.

To tell you the truth, though, a major deciding factor of whether or not you can enjoy this anime is the likability of the main character, Sakamoto. The main point of this anime is that he has no flaws; a character with no flaws is considered a ""Gary-Stu"". If you can overlook that, Sakamoto actually turns out to be a very interesting character. He always kept others' best interests in mind, and he turned some cliches on their head; those two factors kept me interested in his character. Sakamoto is also quite an enigma; I couldn't help but ask questions about who he actually is, especially toward the end.

Haven't you heard? ""Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto"" is an enjoyable anime that I would recommend to anyone in the mood for a ""cool"" comedy. Anyone who watches this will know of the antics of Swagamoto!"
114308,"Introduction:Hello. My name is Neill or ""MiNi."" This will be my in depth review of the anime adaptation of Reki Kawahara's Light Novel Series: Sword Art Online. This review will solely be about the final part of the Alicization War of Underworld Part 2. With all my reviews I will score the anime discussed based upon 5 categories that include: Story, Characters, Art, Music, and Personal Enjoyment. Each category will be given a score between 0 and 10. The ending score will be what I determine the show deserves overall. Keep in mind I will be talking about spoilers that occurred during the anime along with possible spoilers of the manga. Now, without further ado, let's get into this.

 STORY (3/10):



Alicization was a much needed breath for the Sword Art Online series. During the first two seasons there was a reoccurring pattern of world building, new characters, solving conflict, destroying said world, and repeating it all over again. For 2 seasons this is all the characters did for each arc. It was getting extremely repetitive and quite boring in fact. Sword Art Online lost its charm, that is acquired when it first premiered and needed something new.

That is exactly what Alicization did. Alicization took Kirito, the only character really worth anything, and put him in a completely new isolated environment. There weren't 10+ girls drooling over him, there was no serial stalker trying to kill him, it was just him on his own. And it worked perfectly. We see Kirito start from square one learning alongside Eugeo trying to become better swordsmen. He wasn't a god right at the beginning he had to train and work for everything. War of Underwold took a step back from Kirito and focused more on Alice and the battles with the Imperial Knights which I was actually fine with and thought the story was flowing together nicely. There were end goals in place there were characters I cared about, there was a singular world we were sticking to with a easy to follow story. This was the best SAO we had ever seen and I was so excited for the conclusion to this arc.

This season threw that all away. I was so extremely disappointed by how Part 2 of War of Underworld was handled. Calling this hodgepodge of a plot a story is an insult to the word. There is no clear direction anywhere throughout this season. What was once a straight line of development became a irate circular mess. I have no idea how it derailed into this wreck.

At least with War of Underworld Part 1 we had some sort of end goal to look forward to. Gabriel Miller wanted to basically eat the souls of different people in the Underworld cause they tasted good. It wasn't a very unique or exciting villain, but I thought his design looked cool at least. 

What we were left with in War of Underworld Part 2 were unnecessary scenes of sexual assault, painfully cringy dialogue, and insertions of needless characters just for nostalgia sake. It would have been so much cooler to have Kirito save Underworld on his own than bringing back every single character with a minor appearance since episode 1. I mean seriously they even shove in Yuuki during one episode to try and help Asuna, but in all reality in was in very poor taste. They even go as far as literally humanizing the grunt red knights that have been slaughtering the people of Underworld. They have like 3 people take their helmets off and try to shove them down our throats to make them seem live they've changed to being the ""good guys"".

The ""power of friendship"" also makes its way into the show a lot too. Whether it's to literally recharge machine energy or to have someone get back up from fighting after they've been knocked down 100 times, the plot armor is extremely sturdy in this season. There's just too many coincidences for anything to seem even somewhat believable. This is suppose to be portrayed in a near future type of setting, but with all the technology they have it seems as though they're hundreds of year ahead of us. Even in the simulated world of Alicization if you die in there, you die in real life. Were we not moving past that after season one? It was never brought back up after the Aincrad arc, why suddenly is it back here now? It also shows that literal dead people can talk to you inside a simulation and fight with you. Thew amount of udder bullshit in this show is laughable. 

Having all these characters come back and fight in Underworld wouldn't have been such a bad idea if they could have actually done something. Seriously, the same formula is repeated for each introduction. Character comes back, wipes out some enemies, someone cries, they get hit and are out for the rest of the battle, repeat. Sword Art Online has some sort of Stockholm Syndrome with these overused and mundane patterns, it's like it can never come up with a real idea. Regardless, literally with every human that owns a computer on earth coming to help Underworld they can't do anything and Kirito has to save the day. But before that he has to contemplate suicide for losing his friends in a dungeon 4 YEARS AGO. Somehow he finds the courage through Eugeo's ghost and overpowers the villain and wins.

The story of the season was awful; rarely was I contempt with the the pacing, structure, plot, or really anything going on. Extremely disappointed and upset that this show that was seeing a revival in quality seemingly drop to rock bottom.

 Characters (4/10):



Kazuto Kirigaya Kirito is really the only interesting chracter throughout all of SAO. Eugeo was pretty cool during Alicization but that's about the only exception. He doesn't make his appearance until midway through the season. I'll say once he does appear the show's quality increases minutely just because we're finally done with the uninteresting battles and everyone getting beat around. Kirito is the only character that can actually accomplish anything.

Asuna Yuuki If there were a definition for a female simp, it'd be Asuna. She snuck in to a secret military base just to see her bf, and when that wasn't enough she went inside a virtual reality just so she could make out with him. I wish I had a girlfriend as dedicated as Asuna. Granted just about every girl in this show would do the exact same thing for Kirito, but Asuna did it first so I guess she's the best? I don't know. All she really does in this season is cry to be honest. Yeah she swings her sword a little, but she just cries every time she sees someone she knows. It gets kind of annoying. She does decide to save Alice instead of herself which is kind of cool, but other than that, not much of a personality seen. 

Alice Zuberg Alice basically just a blonde Asuna clone that cries just a little bit less and doesn't get wrecked in one move. She also may or may not have done some questionable things in bed with Kirito while he was in his vegetable state, but we'll look past that. Besides Kirito she's the only one to get things done in the show, granted the're not huge accomplishments, but at least she goes to try and fight Gabriel Miller which is more than most of the other characters can say. 

Vassago Casals Why is this guy still in the show. More importantly why is he even in Underworld. Literally no one cares about him to be a main antagonist for this season, he shouldn't even be that powerful. We learn that he hates Kirito cause he's Japanese. His whole motivation for his evilness is cause he's racist... great. Legitimately an awful villain. Complete waste of time. 

Gabriel Miller His villain idea is kinda cool. A lot more compelling than Vassago that's for sure. He just wants to like eat and taste human souls which is a little creepy but none the less somewhat original. His transformation during episode 8 was also pretty cool, I thought that was a cool design. He's the ""real"" antagonist throughout the Alicization arc, I don't think they implemented him in that well however. 


ART (9/10)



Sword Art Online continues to be a the pinnacle of Art and Animation in the anime industry. Each year they continue to impress with how crisp and clean everything looks. Everything is so fluid and natural it looks amazing. I was extremely impressed with how well the fight between Kirito and Gabriel Miller looked. There was so much going on but A-1 Pictures delivered on not only that, but the rest of the season as well. Everything from the explosions to the powerful spells and moves everyone did looked incredible. I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy the animation as much as I did going into this. If you want to watch SAO solely for the visuals, you won't be disappointed.


MUSIC (8/10)



The music and Sound design again is another area where War of Underworld Part 2 impressed me more than I was expecting. The opening theme ANIMA by ReoNa is the best theme SAO has ever seen. I know the show has an iconic first season opening, but this beats it by a landslide. ReoNa has such a unique and angelic voice that moves with authority and comfort it's incredible how talented she is. The ending I will... by Eir Aoi is great as well. It's about as cliche as you can get with a typical ending theme, but it still sounds amazing. No complaints in the the music department from me.

The sound design within the show was exceptional. The clanging of sounds will never get old. It just sounds and feels so satisfying. I was always looking forwards to hearing the different sounds within the show. The explosions were also a highlight. Something about theme had this futuristic type of feel that blared right into your ear drums. There really isn't too much else to say other than it's great. Sound effects and music all around get my seal of approval.

PERSONAL ENJOYMENT (5/10)



If you've read this far you can definitely tell I was disgruntled with how this arc ended. It fell flat on just about everything. I really though we were entering into a Sword Art Online renaissance but it was a dream short lived. The visual and audio elements exceeded expectations, but when those are the only highlights of a season, it doesn't sit well once the ride is over. I explained in detail only some of my grievances with the show, because trust me, I have more but I can spare it for this review. I never expect the characters in Sword Art Online to be ground breaking, but I would have liked to see something more than the surface level we were treated to in the first few seasons. Overall, this season was a bust through and through. I'm hoping they can learn from their mistakes for the next arc, wherever it takes Kirito and Co. I believe SAO has the potential of being great, it has shown us, but it hasn't been able to keep its consistency.

@MiNiSoTaN

Did you really read the review, or are you just looking at the score?"
18507,"I recall seeing a promo for Free two years ago before I started to actually watch it. The promo hooked me with the HD quality of the water and how well-drawn the characters were. Muscles, abs and how the water looked so damn refreshing! I completed Free and my expectations of this anime from seeing that promo were definitely met. 

After seeing this anime, I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen it, to please watch it. This is a great casual anime to binge when you have the time and if you ever need a bit of inspiration/motivation. Free is a sports anime, but it's also a slice of life because it really emphasizes and focuses on friendships and following your dreams. Of course, the competitiveness is there and will have you rooting for your favorite character(s) to touch that wall and win! Honestly, this anime is great for girls with the close-ups on the bodies, but guys, don't let that stop you from watching this.  

You'll definitely relate to the characters no matter how old you are. If you finished high school already, it can create some nostalgia on memories of what you did with your friends in high school. And it will have you thinking and reflecting back on what you aspired to be when you were younger.  I felt Free is one of those anime that can get you to feel inspired and get yourself motivated to fulfill what your younger self would have wanted or dream of doing. The friendship and how well-connected the characters are with each other is a must see. The bonds are beautifully developed and there are so many hilarious moments. 

Aside from friendships, this anime shows you real-life situations that anyone can relate. This anime will have characters that are naturally born with talent and characters who have to work hard to achieve their dreams You'll witness dedication, determination and confidence from the characters. Of course, you'll witness the struggles, jealousy, and hard-work that some of the characters had to endure to get to where they are.

Watching Free, you'll definitely want to swim or learn how to swim if you don't know how already. It's such a refreshing and relaxing anime if you ever need a break from the shounen anime.Of course, I can't deny how incredible the characters look when they are swimming, so ladies or men you are definitely in for a treat on that part. Lastly, the animation as I mentioned in the beginning of this review, is spectacular."

Hello and welcome to my review of the greatest thing mankind has accomplished - Eromanga Sensei. In this review I will tell you everything you need to know about this masterpiece and why it's such a piece of art that deserves wide recognition everywhere around the world.



Story 10/10
First is the story. What can be said about the story except that it's masterfully written. I have never seen or read anything with this level of detail and writing before ever in my life. The story has it all - sadness, jealousy, heartbreak but also happiness, excitement, fun and more. It truly has everything. 

In short the story is about a brother who writes light novels and his little sister who is a shut in NEET. What the brother doesn't know is that his little sister is actually his illustrator. The story begins with the brother finding out who her little sister really is and after that the story really picks up. 

Characters 10/10
The characters are nothing short of wonderful. All of them have their own distinct personalities and they all feel very much like normal people. 
Take for example the male MC - Masamune Izumi. He likes to write Light Novels, make food for his little sister and loves to wash her underwear. 
As you can see from that one example, the characters here are all very realistic and relatable. I mean what older brother wouldn't want to wash his little sisters panties. This is why I believe this anime has the most relatable characters ever. 

Art 9/10
The animations and the art are all very well done. Except for one thing, all the lewd parts are censored. If they weren't censored then I would have no problems giving this 10/10.

Sound 10/10
The voice actors are all really good. You could definitely tell a lot of effort was put into every line. Especially when Megumi says she loves dicks. Absolutely the best work of voice acting I have ever seen.
The OP/ED both sound amazing with quality visuals and great singing. 
The soundtrack for this anime really fits in with all the great moments.

Enjoyment 10000/10

This anime is so good that I have watched it a 100 times. Yes, a 100 times. And even after watching it a 100 times, I still like it just as much as I did during the first time I watched it. With every rewatch I find more small details and all of it really makes me appreciate just how much effort was put into every scene. 

Final Score ∞/10

This anime is the greatest thing that humanity has made. We have truly peaked as a species. When aliens visit us, all we need to do is show them Eromanga Sensei and they will know that we have far surpassed them in every way possible. Eromanga Sensei is the crowning achievement that humanity will be known for. It's the anime that every person or being in the universe has to watch because nothing will ever surpass it and nothing will ever dethrone it. For Eromanga Sensei is greater than the universe itself. It is the god of everything. Nothing before it truly existed because it was Eromanga Sensei that brought the universe into existence.  

Thanks to everyone who read it this far, I hope you now know the wonder that is Eromanga Sensei. For those who skipped all the text, please watch the anime. Watching it will truly be a unique experience that you will never forget. So make sure to watch it and then come back and read this review."
21196,"Some things are so campy they’re good. Or rather, entertaining. 

It is this doctrine that has driven the success of dozens of B movies. You know it’s crappy, over the top and an all-round mess. But it’s for these very reasons that the likes of Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! or Day of the Dead are so much goddamn fun. 

And yet, B movies have a bad reputation (and the name) for good reason too. Regardless of how zany and self-gratifying they may be, they all too commonly suffer from flaws in direction, story and character development. Not to mention the shitty budgets. 



Ogon' po gotovnosti!

The key to overcoming these faults is consistent self-awareness. A good B movie never tries to take itself too seriously. Of course, this does not mean they must be devoid of meaningful thematic exploration or social commentary; just look at the works of Carpenter or Romero. But the moment when a piece that had previously thrived on its campiness attempts to reassert itself as a poignant, deep or otherwise serious literary work, and at the cost of its corny charm, is the moment when a B movie falls flat.

Koutetsujou no Kabaneri proves that anime is no exception. 



[Continuing with my trend of uncomprehensive and depreciative single-sentence premise rehashings](), Kabaneri is about a group of zombie apocalypse survivors in steampunk feudal Japan. Oh, and they’re on a big ass train. If that doesn’t exude copious quantities of awesome, I don’t know what does. It’s such a ridiculous and outlandish concept that, ironically, I’m surprised no one had thought of it sooner. 

img480()

Thankfully, Kabaneri experienced no evident budget shortages. [Studio Wit]( http://anilist.co/studio/858/WitStudio) – who are in familiar territory – have given the show a unique but no less gorgeous visual aesthetic. [Haruhiko Mikimoto](http://anilist.co/staff/1968/HaruhikoMikimoto) has gone back to his roots to produce some spectacular character designs reminiscent of the classic 80s OVAs. 



In fact, the aesthetic in general, from the art to the soundtrack and from the fluid animation to the ridiculous setting, is really nice. All these elements work in tandem to establish an absurd but incredibly fun atmosphere, whilst the quality remains consistent. In this way, right from the very first episode, we know what to expect. It may not be the most astutely crafted of shows, but it sure as hell looks and feels dope.  



Indeed, Kabaneri starts off flying. We are instantly rewarded with gory, stylised action sequences, mounting catastrophes, cliché tragic backstories and beautifully over-the-top voice acting (damn these guys love yelling) complete with inspiring monologues that practically scream of badassery. It’s stupid and self-indulgent, but that’s why the show is initially so appealing. 



The plot during these early stages is virtually non-existent and mostly centres on the themes of overcoming fear and paranoia and maintaining one’s humanity. The usual zombie subject matter. Although Kabaneri doesn’t really bring anything new to the table in this regard, its exploration of these themes never becomes boring and is handled tactfully enough such that they don’t become overbearing and detract from the show’s zaniness. 

This is largely thanks to the show’s characters. Admittedly, none of them are particularly complex or original. The side cast are especially dull and only fulfil individual archetypes. That said, they are diverse and likable enough such that they never become too much of a hindrance, even if we never really end up caring about any of them. Also, Max Powers is friggen’ hilarious. 



Even the primary duo in Ikoma and Mumei are fairly stock standard. Ikoma is loud, proud and obnoxious, spurred on by constant self-flagellation and a misgiving past. Mumei is loli ninja super assassin coming to terms with who she is in a world largely unwilling to accept her, not to mention her own unfortunate backstory. These inner-conflicts and turmoils have been tackled a hundred times before and far more effectively. And yet, it’s nearly impossible not to like them, simply because of how much raw energy and charisma they bring. Sure they’re cliché and pretty shallow, but we still want them to succeed purely because of how badass they are.



In this way, the first few episodes see the plot and the characters, lacking as they might be, work to reinforce the absurdity, stupidity and most importantly, pure entertainment factor of the show. 

Then, an overarching plot was introduced. 



This coincides with the introduction of the main villain. In short, he is poorly-fleshed out, has hazy motivations, confusing goals and a cartoonish depiction. This may not appear to be too much of an issue, granted that most of the cast prior to his entrance were just as, if not more uninspired. I’d argue, however, that none of them are nearly as messy as Mr L’Oréal here.


Because you're worth it

Rather, the problem lies in his purpose. The show takes Biba and uses him as a thematic mouthpiece. These themes of fear, paranoia and weakness and strength in a world dominated by the dead had hitherto taken a backseat to all the action and yelling, but were relevant and handled carefully enough such that they were still somewhat meaningful. Immediately upon Biba’s entrance, the show takes these themes and starts forcibly shoving them in the viewer’s face. In other words, the series dramatically shifts its focus from the fun and the absurd to the serious and pseudo-intellectual. 



This doesn’t work for a few reasons. 

Firstly, it completely juxtaposes the show’s atmosphere and attitude in its first half. The transition is abrupt, jarring and comes with little to no warning. 

Secondly, successful thematic exploration usually relies on successful character and story development. These were not Kabaneri’s strengths, nor do they suddenly reinvent themselves to be. If anything, the plot only goes downhill from here. Biba’s motivations are poorly connected to his actions and goals, or at least, a satisfying explanation is never really provided. 

It also doesn’t help that the show begins taking serious liberties as far as logic and the suspension of disbelief is concerned. Why do the Hunters follow the clearly bat shit crazy Biba? Why can kitchen knives suddenly cut through 50cm thick steel cables? Why does every authority figure have the decision making capability of a retarded three year old? Why are there superzombies that scream with the force of a small nuclear bomb exploding? All of these small yet simple things somehow manage to break immersion, which is an incredibly difficult feat for a show as blatantly insane as this. 



Finally, the show’s themes and messages are simply not as profound as it makes them out to be. They’re mundane and oversaturated, and only serve to distract the show from its actual strengths. 

To the show’s credit, I would argue that the final episode does shine some light on Biba’s character and bestows upon him another layer of complexity and depth. This dude sums it up pretty nicely: 
!img700()!

That said, it is too little too late. This fails to redeem the series for its previous misgivings or conclusively explain all of Biba’s prior actions. 



And yet, despite all of this Kabaneri continues to be kinda fun. Sure it skews its priorities and is horrible at min/maxing, but at least it remembers its roots as an absurd, zany and entertaining gore fest. And sure, unimpressive and predictable thematic exploration may overshadow this fun, but Kurusu never stops Ayame-samaing, Max Powers never stops being hysterical and Ikoma never stops yelling. 


Kabaneri tries to take itself too seriously without the writing to back it up. This is why it falls flat. 

And yet, I’d argue that it doesn’t completely derail (hey, I’ve held off from the train puns ‘till now). Ultimately, even though it loses focus, Kabaneri continues to be dumb fun – my second favourite type of fun. It’s just a shame the ‘dumb’ part got out of hand."
578,"This admittedly is not a review of the film. If you want a solid review, you should look at Grassman's review (the top-voted review of this film on this website). This is instead a defense against one of the main criticisms of the film, the idea that there is a major flaw in the plot due to a decision made by the main character Seita. Honestly, your perception of the film will most likely depend on how you view this one ""flaw"", so I thought it would be useful to write a full article addressing it (along with a few other criticisms).

Obviously, this review contains spoliers.

The biggest criticism that I see regarding this film is the decision by Seita to leave his Aunt's house and live in a cave with his sister. This ultimately results not only in his death but also the death of his 4-year-old sister Setsuko.

DrowZgam3r's review (the second-highest voted review) says it best, 
>If neither of them had a place to go to from the start this story might have been better, but the constant knowledge that this tragedy could have been avoided is what killed this film.

Another reviewer from MAL also writes,
>Thus, Seita is a completely callous, idiotic monster, responsible not only for his own death but the death of his sister as well. That's my first problem with ""Grave of the Fireflies"". That the main character is responsible for the entire tragedy that ensues.

To these criticisms, I will say ""yes, that is the point of the film"". The entire point of the film is that it was an avoidable tragedy. If Seita went back to her Aunt and begged for forgiveness they might have been able to live. Hell, if Seita decided to swallow his pride and not leave his Aunt's house, then they would have lived. But he decided not to, and that is the point of the film.

To answer this question, we need to look over the film's historical context.
December 7, 1941 the Japanese Imperial Navy gained a major victory against the United States, crippling her Pacific Navy, via a surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. And yet by then, the war was already lost. The simple fact of WW2 in the Pacific is that the Empire of Japan had absolutely no chance of victory against the United States. No amount of brilliant strategy or willpower would change this conclusion. The industrial capability of the US was higher than all the major powers combined at the time. As such America was capable and eventually did defeat the Japanese using only half of its strength. By 1942 after the conclusion of the Battle of Midway, it was more than clear that Japan stood no chance. Yet they kept on fighting. Even as all their cities were obliterated by firebombings, they kept on fighting. It took two atomic bombs, an invasion by the Soviet Union, and the intervention of Emperor Showa (Emperor Hirohito) to end the war (and even then the military attempted a coup against their Emperor).

So to those that say that the film is unrealistic due to Seita's decision to leave his Aunt (who treats him unfairly) and pursue his own rugged independence, it is realistic because that is what Japan did during WW2 (and basically the first half of the 20th century). Even as Seita saw the death of her sister in front of his eyes, he never once considered the idea of letting go of his pride and surrendering even though to him it was unfair.

This is my favorite film of all time. I watched this film when I was a kid. Even though I probably watched tons of films when I was a child, Grave of the Fireflies is the only one that I have a fond memory of watching. Of course, back then I didn't have any understanding of the history or the culture of Imperial Japan. Now that I am older and have a far greater understanding of the film's historical context, I have come to appreciate the film much more. This film is not just a typical Anti-War flick. This is a movie that tells a moral that is seldom taught. Sometimes the right move is to give up. Sometimes you have to make peace with an unfair system. Sometimes you have to surrender instead of just saying ""I have to fight harder"".

Another criticism that I hear is regarding Seita's ""laziness"" which is why the Aunt justifies her decision to give better food to her immediate family over Seita and Setsuko (yeah, people seem to forget that the Aunt also treats Setsuko, a 4-year-old, badly by giving her porage while her family eats well). I defiantly understand that Seita is somewhat ""lazy"" in the sense that he doesn't work or volunteer or whatever. I would like to ask though, ""what job should Seita get exactly?"" I'm sure people are experiencing how difficult it is to get employment during this pandemic. Imagine how more difficult it would be if every city in America was flattened to the ground. Add to that the fact that Seita is 14 years old (hasn't finished his education) and lost both of his parents. Even though the Aunt's frustration is understandable, it doesn't excuse her behavior in treating Seita and Setsuko as basically second class people compared to her family. And technically, Seita did contribute to her family by giving her all the food that he buried at the beginning of the movie.

This is a side note that is much more important. This film only tells one side of Japan during the Second World War. It paints a picture of two largely innocent children dying due to American bombs. While this is a story that did happen (the deliberate targeting of Japanese civilians by the US did happen) and it is important to understand this perspective, it is not the entire story of Japan during World War 2. Imperial Japan was an evil regime that committed countless horrendous atrocities against her neighbors in order to pursue her imperial ambitions. Lookup the Nanjing Massacre if you have the stomach for it (not safe for life). It is incredibly important that people get a complete picture of historical events. Many people are ticked off at the movie for propagating this false idea that Japan was an innocent victim of the Second World War. I personally believe that this is not the fault of the film but the fault of those who see the film and assume that there is nothing more to understand or learn about Japan's involvement in WW2. This film is not a piece of propaganda as the experience of Seita and Setsuko certainly did happen and it is a crucial part of WW2. It's just important for people to understand that it is not the entire story.

This ultimately leads to the importance of historical context. Historical context is important when analyzing or understanding any work of art. But for this movie, I think that the historical context is particularly important. The Wikipedia article on Grave of the Fireflies gives an interesting point of trivia:
>After the international release, it has been noted that different audiences have interpreted the film differently due to differences in culture. For instance, when the film was watched by a Japanese audience, Seita's decision to not come back to his aunt was seen as an understandable decision, as they were able to understand how Seita had been raised to value pride in himself and his country. But, American and Australian audiences were more likely to perceive the decision as unwise, due to the cultural differences in order to try to save his sister and himself.

I think that fact alone speaks wonders about how so many people fail to understand the film. In the film's theatrical trailer, it says ""[I] came to deliver something you have forgotten"". That thing that was forgotten (or more accurately, beginning to be forgotten) was the memory of the Second World War. The film was released in 1988 and even then people were afraid of the next generation forgetting. I fear that as this past becomes more and more distant, more and more people would see this ""flaw"" in the story, and more and more this film will be misunderstood.

So in all, this film was an absolute masterpiece of a film (especially since I am Japanese and have family members who experienced the War). I believe that anyone can watch this film and enjoy it (or get something out of it), but to truly understand the movie, I believe you need to understand what life was really like for Setsuko, Seita, and the Japanese people during that time. This film was made for people who still had a memory of this. But for us who never experienced this particular time in history, taking the time to learn Japan's history will make your viewing even more enjoyable."
105156,"It's not every day I find myself so damn enamored and thoroughly absorbed in a comedy anime that hits all my right points for enjoyment value. Cautious Hero is such a fun rollercoaster of a ride from the first episode, and it only gets much more addicting and captivating as the show progresses. In more ways than one, the watcher is in for quite a surprise with this anime, it's more than meets the eye. But first, when it comes to the overall storytelling, it's simple and relatively straightforward. It takes place in the dimension of the goddess, where each of them is tasked to save their own respective worlds from complete evil. Our story is set in an S-class world ruled by the demon king and his goons. We follow our two main leads. 

Firstly, we have Seiya, who is the overly cautious savage dude, and I don't say that lightly either. This man will literally spam ultimate level attack on a slime of all things until he deems it's entirely secure for you go on with your day. And, no, it doesn't stop at one or even five attacks. There is no chill when it comes to Seiya's careful persona, which not only brings tears to people's eyes. Because we, among others, have his roasting session, which utterly destroys you down to your every soul. More or less, he has a rude attitude, and he doesn't care about appearances. If you get in his way, be prepared to be destroyed emotionally. That said, I can't help myself but entirely enjoy his unusual quirk since it's executed brilliantly. At first glance, the standard isekai setting, and overly cautious and overpowered being the core theme seems slightly boring, but far from it. The author of the source Light Tuchihi knows which buttons to press to keep it all from stumbling. Instead just rises the elements higher to offer you more entertainment value. 

Oh, did I forget to mention Kazuma from Konosuba would love this man Seiya to bits? Since he gives little to no shit when it comes to genders, and will treat you like he wants you to, whether you are a male or female. I can't even begin to tell you guys how many times this man has made poor Rista (Ristarte) go through hell because of his strong personality. She is a more or less blonde version of Aqua, that's the easiest way to describe it anyway. But like the blue water goddess, Rista is another appealing and adorable addition to be held. Although she is definitely different as well. How to best put it? Rista is a lovable pervert who is in serious love with our main male Seiya. It goes over-the-top sometimes, and her reaction is crazy, so full of life and emotion. She might need to work on her approach if she wants Seiya to ever return her feelings tho. I can also sadly see not everyone will be able to appreciate Rista for perhaps that reason. 

Still, for me personally, her twisty and turny character adds to the appeal, and I adore her that much more as a result. Seeing Seiya and Rista relationship is one of the biggest reasons I loved Cautious Hero so freaking much. But the side cast is not bad either and adds to the fun. It's so impactful, vibrant, and, as stated previously: full of life. I have to give credits to the voice actors for nailing their role too, but especially Rista. Who is played by Aki Toyosaki, who had way too much fun with her voice. She can make all kinds of bizarre, unique, and down-right hilarious sounds. Not to mention, with that solid and fit art-style Rista's, every facial expression is pure gold. Of course, that goes for Yuuichirou Umehara playing the role of Seiya, I can feel the harmony between those two as they act away with tons of enthusiasm and spirit. In other words, the comedy is just absolutely top-notch, and each episode had my side hurting from laughing too much. It was great. You will see all kinds of visual comedy imagery you might've thought was impossible.

As you already could possibly tell by my positive vibe. Artistically, it was solid and looked simply clean. It has this simple nature to it, but let me tell you that's just merely a facade to fool you. All those expressions and the spot-on execution are not something you can draw out without love and passion for your work. So studio White Fox unquestionably knocked this one out of the park and then some. Yes, the animation is no different, you will see some mesmerizing sakuga, and all action scenes looked dynamic and impactful. I had indeed go back and replay some of those moments. We had a certain risque moment with Rista where her melons where hanging in the air and dangling, and omg, that sakuga had me dying, the fluidity was insane. That's just one segment. There are so many more to properly witness yourself and be astounded or shocked. I didn't really give you a clear image representation, so I doubt this one bit won't fail to cause a massive impact positively or negatively even. If it's too much. Well, you are the judge of that.

 Let me also give a short appreciation to the ending and opening song. First off, we have MYTH & ROID, and you either hate or love their music. I am the latter, thankfully for me. On top, there is that cute and lovely ending song with Rista dancing by Riku Azuna. It's CGI and probably not the best you've seen. But honestly, you will be bopping your head left and right to the catchy tune to care much about such irregularities. Now at the core, Cautious Hero is a straightforward anime but executed its theme with great care. I mean, think about it for a moment, our main is isekai'd, and the world is more or less the same as all those other shows out there which are cut from the same cloth. The story revolves around the theme of a hero who is very overpowered and a world that needs saving to boot. But instead of staying true to the core till the end, Cautious Hero twist and turns to truly leave you shocked. It's hard to not dive into spoilers. However, essentially by the end, you might find yourself overly emotional and crying tears of a waterfall.

That's one of the big reasons why Cautious Hero differentiates from other anime with the same setting and genre. It doesn't play inside of the box, but also outside to make sure every watcher is thoroughly engrossed and captivated. That way, this normally simple idea starts to feel complex and lets you add to the story is unique and exciting ways. Whatever the case may be, Cautious Hero has at least my seal of approval for being an outright stunning comedy. And a great anime all around that is not afraid to subvert viewers' expectations or stomp all over our feelings. You might possibly have a great and emotional time watching this anime. Now I can only cross my fingers in anticipation of a much-deserved sequel. I need one badly. At one point, I have to also pick up the light novel. If you especially love KonoSuba, then I can almost guarantee you will have a blast with Cautious Hero. This is positively one of the best Isekai anime I have personally watched in recent years, and I highly recommend it to everyone."

Spoilers for Akashic Records

Before I start the review proper, or rather, this dissertation about why this show is a generic and irritating fraud that actually manages to squander any potential it had for some lazy comedy and infuriating LN bullshit clichés, I have two things I feel I must notify you of. First, a decent chunk of this review will be spent analyzing the ideas this series had and how with some major and minor tweaks, the series could've been better, at least from a storytelling perspective. Secondly, I'm about to let out something I have to get out of my chest because while this insufferable mentality I’m about to describe isn't truly widespread, I've still seen it a handful of times, and quite frankly, it's sickening.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a title is almost nothing but recycled content from shows prior, then to me at least, it has no excuse and little reason to both exist and be defended as a work of fiction. It seems like creativity isn't as valued as it should be and this has been a problem in every industry at almost every point in history for one reason or another. With the anime in the 80's/90's, it was schlock bloodbath OVAs and nowadays in anime, it's Light Novel School Battle and/or Harem anime. Titles that largely or even entirely fit these descriptions can still break the mold and achieve something greater.

We do not have some ""mythical, absurdly high, nigh-unachievable standard"" that bitter ""anti-elitists"" keep accusing us of having! We just want anime to actually have a sense of life, a sense of passion, and a reason to exist outside of making corporate money from people who have loved tons of shows borderline identical to what they're currently watching and fapping to. Even among school battle (usually harem) anime, there are some that go above and beyond, like the aforementioned Chivalry of a Failed Knight. In fact, even among the standards if these ""copy-paste"" anime, some manage to really sink below to almost creative levels of suck, like The Irregular at Magic High School, as if to prove that there is a standard to hold titles like this by and that even this kind of anime has its own hierarchy like all the rest.

In summation, we do not all have some absurd standard for anime, we just want these kinds of titles to die out (or rather to not be as widespread, which in fairness, is already happening somewhat over the past year as isekai starts to take its place) so that anime that actually have passion and creativity can more easily flourish, and even by the standards of the now incessant LN school battle harem anime, some can go beyond the expectations or fail to even meet such bottom of the barrel standards. If you enjoy these titles, that's fine, just at least have some standards regarding these things since not all of them are of equal quality and the ones with the least amount of effort put into making them worthwhile works of fiction do not deserve to be defended, at least to me. Again, like them if you want, just don't accuse us of bad standards or incorrect views solely for dissenting from your ""it's done before but that's fine because I like it"" viewpoint. No one is saying everything must break the mold and become an extraordinary work of art otherwise it has no right to exist. It's certainly ok to have fun and enjoy a work that sought entertainment value first and foremost, as us supposed ""bitter, contrarian reviewer elitists"" do too. I simply refuse to sit down while shows like this and viewpoints such as the aforementioned run rampant.

With that tirade out of the way, let's start the review proper.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mixing Konosuba humor and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is like mixing a liter of ghost pepper juice and white paint. You know, shit like this is why I invested in a tomato farm. Wait, I'm sorry, was that joke not predictable enough for you? My bad, let me try again: Ahem, “This show is cancer.” Actually, my previous joke was funnier than both this one and every single joke here in this godforsaken show. Let me grab those tomatoes now.

Akashic Records. For some reason, people thought this was actually funny and “totally not exactly like all of the other trash we hate because it has more comedy in its trashiest scenarios than those others shows that do the exact same thing but with a permanently straight face.” This show isn't funny; it's predictable. It has no semblance of tact or actual self-awareness on how awful its writing and gaudy cheese-fest self-justification for subsequent action exposition dumps that last up to a minute are. You people call SAO terrible? At least it has more tact and worthwhile humor than this show ever did, as well as more originality, better music, a much more tolerable color pallet. Even with its bad pacing, at least it never showed off early events that feel like they should be coming in much later than they should, or give flashbacks to equally terrible and popular shows with specific plot points. This show thinks it can get away with being the trashiest LN garbage ever as long as it adds “hurr-de-durr” to everything and adding a funny face just to really make it even more obvious than it is. It thinks it's the Konosuba of school battle harem trash; it's not. It takes itself just as seriously for most part, so that doesn't work. Hell, it's even worse since those shows take horrible scenarios like attempted rape seriously when presenting them. This show doesn't. But enough rambling; what makes Akashic Records so awful to the point where I actually believe that The Asterisk War is a much better show than it? Well, let’s find out, shall we?

Let’s address the elephant in the room before we really rip into the logic of this show: the female school uniforms. You know, I think it should be the woman’s choice as to whether or not she’ll be so scantily clad that not only are her midriffs and things exposed, but that she also has suspenders at the thighs and waist to make sure that two-piece outfit doesn't fall apart, not something that a school, let alone an “esteemed private academy” such as this one, should mandate. This kind of uniform that would make any real school principal revile in horror is, while sexy and appealing, downright disgusting in the fact that a school mandates women wear that as their official uniform. I get that this is a trash anime, but no successful school in their right mind would pull such a stunt without raising absolute hellfire from parents, true gentlemen, feminists, other schools and districts, and SJWs across the nation, especially when this show’s one obviously hot and fanservicey character is more decently clad than the high school students (aka, generic archetype bitches) that are forced to wear this. I mean, the men wear regal and classy suits befitting of gentlemen (even Glenn wears something of decent clothing, and he’s the lazy asshole pervert), so wouldn't it make sense to have the ladies wear something even more regal and classy, like Celica, the obviously hot fanservice character? You wouldn't believe how badly that made me lose hope in any logic found in the story. I mean, I am a teenage, straight male, and I like hot women like the rest of my kind, hell, I can ogle at Celica all day, but this is just ridiculous!Now, to everything else.

To be fair, the series doesn't really have major plot holes, even despite a few minor ones (nor all of which I'll cover), but it does have many leaps in logic for the characters, bad pacing, and it manages to portray certain scenes horrendously. But there are decent moments, like the rare joke that hits, occasional (if not successful due to poor pacing) attempts at emotional scenes, and the scene where Glenn goes Grammar Nazi on students to show just how convoluted magic can really be. I'll start by going rapid fire on a few dumb things from episodes 1 and 2. Still, prepare to be here a while, the story segment takes up a vast majority of the review since there is a lot I need to say here.

Why does Celica threaten Glenn to get him to work at this school despite knowing that he is beyond unqualified and that he hates magic? Is it because she just wants him to get a job and if he a deadbeat regardless of whether or not he is remotely qualified, because if so, that's stupid (since she needs to make sure he is at least remotely qualified for his job). The series checks out one important trite bullshit (aka bad cliché) from the list really early with a scene where the flatter student (Sistine) helped the big-tits student (Rumia), but here, it's portrayed in such a sexual manner to the point where in other series, they are still sexual harassment despite teasing, this is easily a more blatantly disgusting and uncomfortable act of sexual harassment that sent out of its way to be as horrid as possible (partially since it made me hate the Sistine, one of the main characters, by the first episode, the episode where we are supposed to be sold on these characters). 

The entirety of episode 2 felt like it should've been stretched out over multiple episodes given how here is a small time skip in the middle of episode 2 after Glenn reaches the importance of grammar in changing magic, and how much is packed into this episode story-wise. In order of appearance: Glenn starts the episode same as before, he goes so far into dissing magic that Sistine slaps him and leaves in tears, each character has an emotional moment before Glenn realizes how little students truly know about magic besides one particular method for each spell, he schools them, then his students like him, he has then made progress and is now infinitely more passionate about work, we go back and reaffirm that there is a moment in which Rumia was saved by presumably Glenn (we even see the hair color, and in episode 1, she looks familiar to him, but this isn't spaced or enough to feel organic or that it would take a little while for us to really explore this point without coming up with the answer so early into the show), and then terrorists. All of this should've been episodes 3, 4, and even 5. I mean it. We could've just done the same shenanigans and have episode 2 end on the moment where Sistine slaps Glenn and walks off in tears, then episode 3 have an emotional episode that shows us another side of our (at the time) 3 important characters while showing us that terrorists are soon to some before at the end, he busts out some knowledge on the students, then episode 4 not only shows us how much all of this is working out while at the same time showing us that he is actually becoming happier overall while doing this, but then the episode brings us back to that moment where we see him and Rumia interact before we learn that she was saved by someone who looks suspiciously like Glenn, and then it ends on terrorists moving in. Episodes 5 and 6 would be a bunch of terrorists raising hell in the school and then Glenn, and all students and teachers fight back in a mini war arc, by editing the final few minutes of episode 2 where terrorists show up and turning that into episode 5, and editing some of the intrusive comedy of episode 3 and making it episode 6.. There, I just vastly improved the show just by taking episode 2 stretching it out, and adding and editing parts as I went along,like making episode 3 episode 6. If only the writer was this capable.

The moment that made this show awful beyond redemption was the attempted rape scene. Let me set the scene. Terrorists have just captured Rumia who turned out to be a former princess but her family was killed and she escaped (hence why she said she was saved by someone before terrorists would've killed her). Sistine is alone in a room, and a terrorist walks in. He then begins to toy with her, saying that people like her are surprisingly and deliciously fragile while pinning her down and slowly undressing her. Then, Glenn walks in and it turns from trite to actively offensively terrible. In the midst of a scene of attempted rape, Glenn walks in, pays no mind, and lackadaisical comedy ensues for like 40 seconds! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! A character is in the verge of getting rape, and the supposed “hero” who busts in not only doesn't recognize the situation, but acts all lazy! Needless to say, this moment made this show practically impossible to redeem. When SAO can treat this kind of scene with infinitely more tact than this show can, in regards to content and tone, you know we have a problem here! Sure, eventually Glenn saves her, but then we get the rest of the scene. 

Glenn busts out this arcana card which nullifies all magic (especially opponents’ and enemies” magic). This is a very generic magic for an MC to have, and it's giving me Mahouka flashbacks as if the school terrorism thing didn't do that already. Glenn just busts out an arcana card unceremoniously and explains what it does in his usual lackadaisical tone (tired of me using that word yet?). This is the first time we see this kind of magic card in the series, adding to the already surpassingly convoluted magic system of this world, so at least the show could do is unveil it with grandeur. Even Mahouka did that right! Whatever, a badly animated curb stomp commences in which Glenn wins, and episode 2 ends. As you can no doubt tell, the rape attempt scene should've never happened and in my version above, it never would.

Actually, there are a few things in episode 3 I would alter, since it's not a great episode either (I mean, what did you expect from this show). I think the worst thing this episode does is prove that this crock of shit had potential, potential that it, predictably, squandered. I mean, Glenn was a mate killer, so that could've been explored and built up a bit better since before then, the only buildup was him saying magic kills people. In this episode, I would edit out the numerous and always monotonous self-justification for what someone is about to do exposition dumps there always last for around 30 seconds, some of the intrusive comedy of the first 6 minutes, and do one last crucial thing in the last few minutes of the episode. Remember how Professor Huey apparently left (hence why they have a sub) prior to the events of episode 1? Well, here he is again, but has no exposed motivations for being here, and he just stands there, saying that it's a game to see if Glenn can free Rumia from a bunch of magic circles, so, none of that makes any real sense. He needs a reason for doing this, and why he is treating this like a game. Also, at the end, they completely gloss over what Rumia’s true name as princess was Eruminia, and I don't know why. This also confirms that yes, Glenn was the one that unknowingly saved her. It's a shame that one of the most potentially interesting hook questions about the series was dealt with only 3 episodes in out of 12.

I'm not going to go or if my way to really break down the rest of the episodes since that would take fucking forever and I'm already spending a lot of time doing rapid fire on a few problems per episode while fixing the series as a whole. But now, we reach the tournament arc, starting with episode 4, so time for me to keep doing what I've been doing. The queen is still the mother of Rumia but apparently everyone was killed but her. Why did she pronounce her daughter dead after the terrorists came? What actually happened? Did terrorists simply kidnap her from everyone? Has the school heard nothing about the Queen? What about the dad/king? 

The other thing is that we are suddenly introduced to what all of the students can do during the beginning of this tournament arc via a pep talk from Glenn. Want to know how to have made this moment work. Have it so that when the terrorists showed up, they all do what we would hear them being capable of, that what this moment would be actually gratifying since by then we would've known a bit about all the students and then have epic realization that Glenn was exactly right since that what they did in that hypothetical. This has been another round of me improving the series. In fact, the actual tournament section in episode 4 could've been 2, maybe even 3 whole episodes in order to make an interesting tournament arc up until the next episode (specifically, 7-9 on my version), since there are so many games that are glossed over since most students are not important. Hell, even before that, we saw a typical asshole vs underdog rivalry set up with Harley and his class vs Glenn and his, and then it would be gratifying and exciting to see both groups compete and Glenn’s class do well on each of these events. This has been another round of me making a better series out of the pieces this one failed to put together. Also, the asspull of Rumia winning her round because the big buff guy suddenly blacked out for no reason was infuriating, and the fact that it came after a rushed and stupid bit of her teammates telling her to quit since they “care for her” despite her being in no peril and her wanting to do this, is especially galling. When both The Asterisk War and Fairy Tail can make a better tournament arc, then your arc is shit, and by extension, you're shit!

Episodes 5 and 6, barring a few really dumb moments (as per usual), are probably the best in the series, as little as that says about them. The comedy is still pretty miss for me but not only are there a few genuinely sweet moments like Glenn’s conversation with Rumia I episode 5 and her true reunion with her mother at the end of episode 6, but also, the way Glenn defeats the villain of this arc is actually pretty intelligent and entertaining, reminding me of some of the most popular protagonists in anime like Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, and Sora from No Game No Life. Still, time to fix ‘em. I'll give this series a compliment when it deserves one; it's already like...96:0 in problems (and you get a cookie if you get where that reference came from). The way to make it better this time is simple, and it builds from the last fixing I did: actually juggle the rescue attempt and the tournament matches equally and flesh them both out, that way we have all of the emotional payoffs actually pay off (at least if you give each scene enough space), and so that we can actually enjoy the tournament side of the arc, and have that whole thing from episodes 5 and 6 take up 3 more episodes (10-12 in my version) while removing some of the fake out comedy, taking away the explosion speeches about “me saying why I'm doing what I'm doing”, removing the dere moments Sistine has with her teacher (I get that he is 19 but still it's sorta creepy for a student to have a hunted romantic interest in her teacher) and altering the ending where the students spend all his money to him actually treating them with some of his money, that way nothing about any of the arcs each character went through get cheapened upon rewatch and hindsight (namely Glenn’s). Also, have more animation in the arc since this series doesn't really have much actual character animation. 

See? It's simple. If we create a brand new episode 1 from scratch to replace this episode 1 and take all of the ideas I brought up that modify these episodes, we could've had an actually good series on our hands since despite all of the LN trope bullshit, awful comedy moments that ruin certain scenes, and a few other things, all the pieces were there for the first 6 episodes to be a good 1 cour series. The other 6 on the other hand...yeah, I haven't been really living up to my promise of tone, and these episodes are gonna change that; they are that bad...

sigh Episode 7 is where things go back to being abysmal instead of just bad, partially due to almost half of it being a cliché beach episode and the irritating comedy, partially due to the character Re=L (make your Ergo Proxy joke elsewhere). She is such a bad character, and it is the impetus of the arc and why it's horrible. Her heel turn is insanely telegraphed and still incredibly forced, being out of jealously in episode 7 about the fact that the deuteragonist females are quote unquote “stealing Glenn away from her”, and because she is just a double agent who likes her dead brother who she saw again (which means he was revived, which is a major plot point in the arc, revival) in episode 8, while the rest of episode 8 before that is just the introduction of revival, one of the villains of the previous arc showing up and being a crazy bitch, and Re=L moving around and being an insufferable bitch. Fuck this arc in its entirety. Oh, and she nearly kills Glenn because of this and badly injures Rumia. When you consider that up to this point, she had been trying to kill Glenn (or at least she attacks him as greeting and always wants to settle a score with him) and the fact that she genuinely talked of the fact that she had a lot of fun with the people she immediately afterwards hated) and the fact that she had just been a generic deadpan loli character, this sudden turn is infuriatingly stupid and forced. The 9th episode is just as bad honestly, and they rushed the shit out of a villain death and the backstory Re=L has can't redeem her in the slightest. Also, the main blue-haired villain of the arc was wasted in the fact that there is a malicious character named Reiner, but this guy was just some random who wasn't connected with anything and is just a “bad person who does bad things because villain” character. I literally have no way to really remotely fix this arc; it was dead on arrival.

But now, we finally reach the final arc. It is one of the stupidest story arcs I have ever seen in my life, if not the absolute dumbest and most wince-worthy of them all. Here is the main plot of arc 4: Some creepy teacher guy continually confesses to Sistine and after Glenn overheard him dissing her dream, he puts on this front about wanting to marry her for money, and it all becomes a pissing match, except between teachers over a student. Fucking creepy! It's beyond stupid a premise given the age ranges (adult and teenager), and given how this is the impetus on having another evil protagonist bent on using Rumia for some scheme, you'd think this wouldn't exist and that they'd find a less disgusting way for this to happen. The sub plot is about Glenn suddenly realizing that Sistine looks like Sera, a now dead girl he once loved before he left the Imperial Corps, and that now angel dusts addicts (I wish they meant the real life Angel Dust drug) are dying, even a year after that substance was said to have been eradicated. All of these have no right of intertwining with the main (disgusting and wince-worthy) plot of the arc. Also, Re=L is off scot free after the betrayal (did she not ever get arrested for treason for that whole thing in the previous arc?), just to add on to what an irredeemable crock of shit this final arc is! Then, the finale. Oh boy. It's probably the most generic episode in the entire show. Turns of there was another traitor that posed as Leo's after he killed him part-way into episode 11, and the only thing resolved is the immediately inserted grudge match between the two. I don't even have the energy to go into any depth with this one, it's just generic and bleh, as if the show is not even trying to hide it's true colors anymore. Serves it right.

You know, if the narrative wasn't so shit in the way that it was, Glenn might have been an actually good character. Think about it: a cynic gave up his pursuit of being a hero of justice after the lives he took and lost now teaches the very thing he hates against his will while growing attached to his students despite everything. Despite what a radical shift in personality he has from past to present, if the writing did how I laid out above, he could've been a pretty good character, assuming they toned down the perviness completely and just made him cynical and partially lazy instead of basically a cross of Archer from UBW and Kazuma from Konosuba. I also like how he is an LN protagonist who isn't very overpowered, but that's not enough to save him from this awful writing. Celica is a hot and haughty woman who is basically never capable of being there since she’s so overpowered that the narrative wouldn't throw a challenge unless they restrain her or just keep her or entirely beforehand. What I like about her is some of her almost motherly nature towards Glenn, like how she threatens Harvey for dissing him in her presence, even if the whole blackmail job thing was nonsense. Now, for the actual named side-characters with relevance outside of just one arc since I'm not even gonna cover the antagonists (partially since I kinda already did in as much detail as they deserve, barring one who I'll get to), nor will I cover small characters like the queen mother or the annoying parents of Sistine.

Sistine is a nightmare for her archetype. She aggressively checks out all of the boxes of a bad and cliché tsundere and does it in a way that makes her especially obnoxious. The fact that she has this dynamic with a teacher makes me even more grossed out (regardless of both the nonsensical age dynamic and partially because nothing about this is brought up). She's also absurdly useless, to the point that this is a legitimate plot point that carries throughout each arc until she finally does one thing right in the finale. Rumia is basically a typical dere-dere of the group who is basically the MacGuffin for all of the arcs in this show. I've already talked about why Re=L is such a shit character so I'll cover one more: Albert. He’s the stoic badass of the bunch whose hunch is always right, so there’s not much to say on him. Lastly, why don't we talk about Leos? He is such a shitty character. He apparently had been asking Sistine our since they were kids and not only has he not let go of that, he has gone pathetic over it despite coming off as a decent person (typical of this trope), but again, the whole teacher and student bit makes it worse, and the fact that ha managed to spend only a paltry evening to be able to decipher everything about Glenn, Re=L, and Rumia is absurd, though it turns out it was this Justine guy from episode 11 who is just another evil LN bad guy for LN bad guy sake villain, since literally every single antagonist in this show is the exact same. They turned a crap and generic character into something creepier and stupider and then replaced him with the exact same character as every other villain in this retarded ass show; how typical! So yeah, that's everyone relevant. What a shit cast, am I right? As if the wasted potential as generic characters weren't bad enough, they reuse the same bad guy personality and have some truly horrible characters thrown into the mix. Let’s move on before I die of embarrassment.

The audiovisuals aren't much better than the writing, unfortunately. Part of the problem this time isn't that the show is badly animated per se, but that its animation insanely limited. Its own damn OP has about as much animation as a typical episode of this show, and there are plenty of reused clips, like the clip of Albert pulling Re=L’s hair or Sistine blasting Glenn with wind, and the slew of reused clips are reused at an insane rate with no remote variation. Hell, even the fight scenes have little animation, especially the one in episode 2 when Glenn beats up the attempted rapist. I initially couldn't stand the color palette but I got used to it. I already mentioned how awful the uniforms are so no need to repeat that. There is minimal (albeit terribly some CGI though it's blink and you miss it), but did there also have to be minimal animation too? Oh well, at least I like the eyes (they remind me of the trademark Studio White Fox eyes) and some of the admittedly humorous facial expressions. 

The OP, ""Blow out"" by Konomi Suzuki is a pretty generic (if somewhat catchy) OP that feels like it should be part of a generic fantasy adventure anime, not a generic school battle anime with fantasy elements thrown in there. The ED, ""Precious You☆"" by Sistine Fibel (Akane Fujita), Rumia Tingel (Yume Miyamoto), Re=L Rayford (Ari Ozawa) is absurdly MediocRE that I never bothered listening to the entire minute and thirty second ED. The OST is decent in its own right but honestly feels misplaced here in the same vein as the OP in terms of where it feels more suitable, even despite the darker tone the series boasts on about half of the episodes.

The dub is probably one of the worst dubs Funimation has produced in recent memory. Next to none of the voices even remotely fit the characters and sound like they'd fit completely different sounding roles, like Monica Rial as Rumia and Josh Grelle as Glenn, but the absolute worst offender here is Sistine, played by Rachael Messer, whose acting not only sounds miscast, but at times, bad in its own right. The tertiaries and antagonist roles aren't good either, and some of them were doomed to be inferior (like Re=L since it's much harder for a dub to pull off a loli voice), and the only voice I sort of see working is Morgan Garrett as Celica. Then again, dubs have been getting worse in recent years, so I guess this is to be expected.

Needless to say, I hate this show. I hate it so damn much. I only found one joke funny since it was the only one that wasn't predictable as shit, and that was in the very first episode. Any potential the story or characters had ended up being squandered rather quickly, which is frustrating since the first 6 episodes could've actually been pretty good had they removed the bullshit elements and made it a 12 episode series that fleshed these episodes out, though the last 6 are beyond terrible and impossible to redeem. Then again, the show lost any path to actual redemption during the rape attempt scene where they treat it with so little tact that there is comedy in the already drawn out scene. The lack of animation made the fights pretty dull as well, and a lot of the characters, namely Sistine and Re=L were infuriating to no end. There are times when a show offends me with how terrible it is, but when it happens more than once, let alone up to 5 times, that's when we know that the show is dogshit and that I'm in for a terrible experience. 

When I wasn't aggravated to some degree, whether it be mild or insane, I was pretty bored since the action was mediocre and the comedy didn't stick with me at all, and a lot of the awful LN school battle harem tropes are here in full display, sometimes taken to the most disgusting degrees possible to the point where I almost wanted to vomit. Also, the final arc is one of the most wince-worthy pieces of animation I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing as if arc 3 didn't piss me off enough to the point where the show went back from being bad but salvageable to irredeemable and truly abysmal again. Shame really, since the second arc was actually somewhat enjoyable at times and has the most potential to be good. So yeah, I'm basically repeating myself at this point so let’s just move on to the final thoughts.

You know, it's almost cute to know that this show thinks it can get away with being typical trash that gives LNs a bad name just by adding more comedy, disgusting elements, and an occasionally bleak tone and more blood. It pretends to not be exactly like its brethren but does all of the same awful things you'd expect a show like this to do, only with a tinge of extra putridness. When there's a good idea, it's gleefully ruined, and the comedy is more predictable than a generic shounen anime. I've already spoken ad nauseam about basically everything wrong with the show and I'm basically repeating myself, but yeah, suffice it to say, this is one of the worst anime I've seen all year. Hopefully, this is a lesson to all of you that even among shows like this, there are still standards that some of them can meet and surpass their contemporaries, and that we don't just have absurd standards that only value high art. Also, hopefully you realize why this show is such a trap that you shouldn't fall for. This show scores disgustingly low compared to its peers. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu."
457,"When I started watching anime again in 2014 after a long hiatus, I saw fans of a series called Mushishi praising how it was “beautiful” and a “masterpiece.” In these same discussion threads, there were also critics arguing that Mushishi was actually “pretentious” and “boring.” Seeing such strong opposing opinions, I opted to see for myself how good—or bad—Mushishi truly was.

img()

About a quarter way through the first episode, I was already siding with the critics. The central character, Ginko, who appeared to be a kind of paranormal investigator, is seen traveling deep into an unusually vibrant forest. He’s headed to the home of a child living there to investigate a strange ability he’s said to have. When they meet, perplexing conversations ensue, which, at the time, I found difficult to follow, and not particularly interesting.

The second episode frustrated me even more. For most of the first half, I grudgingly stared at these two kids sitting in a dark room discussing something pertaining to eyelids (keeping my own eyelids open was a struggle). Before I could get to the second half, I stopped the episode, and concluded that this series just wasn't for me.

As I befriended more people in the anime community, I noticed that many of those who shared my interests also thought highly of Mushishi. I wondered, “Why do these people with such excellent taste (lol) love such a dull series? Maybe I missed something?” I attempted to give the second episode another try, this time approaching it as I would a meditation (or a tedious assignment). I turned down the lights, cleared my mind, relaxed my face and shoulders, took a deep breath, and gave it my undivided attention.

In such a relaxed state, I usually feel a peaceful indifference. Watching the second episode again, I wasn't as impatient during the first half, but I wasn't quite enjoying it either. However, I was more receptive. I initially took notice of how ubiquitous the environment was. A scene would often open with or cut to an intricately detailed—and admittedly beautiful—slice of nature. It was around this time that it dawned on me that nature itself is a character in this story. There’s Ginko, the various people he meets, and nature. Nature is sometimes the protagonist, other times it’s the antagonist, but it’s not an entity that acts with bias. Nature, and the ""Mushi"", which are a supranormal extension of nature, just are. In this context, everything started to make more sense.

When I finally saw the unexpectedly creepy second half of the second episode, my attention was firmly hooked. As I progressed to the next episodes, another thing that became apparent was how the problems and concerns of the characters mirrored our own, providing openings for us as the audience to relate and emotionally connect. Each story guides us through the mental, physical, or sometimes moral process of trying to solve a particular issue. However, people’s plights aren't sensationalized. Mushishi doesn't seek to make you feel angry or depressed. While there are moments that could make you feel that way, it doesn't indulge in negativity or drama.

I was later impressed by how much ground Mushishi could cover in just 23-minute episodic intervals. The directors, under Hiroshi Nagahama’s supervision, did well in balancing the elements of Yuki Urushibara’s award-winning manga. The studio, Artland, didn't cut corners on the production either. The art and animation quality exceeded that of a typical television series, sometimes reaching the levels you’d expect from a feature film. These visuals were underpinned by a traditional and occasionally haunting soundtrack.

Mushishi is infused with subtle, and easily overlooked, commentary on the ways in which we’re connected with each other and the world around us. Thinking back, it’s amazing the difference eased expectations and a little patience can make. With that said, such an approach can’t guarantee that you’ll be able to like anything. Sometimes you’re just not compatible with something, and that’s perfectly fine, too. In my personal case, I was more compatible with Mushishi than I’d thought as it has since become my favorite anime.

I cannot express the feelings I felt while watching this movie directly, so here I write a letter, in fact a review, to unfurl the mark this movie left on my soul.

Let me tell you, straight off the bat, that Violet Evergarden isn't like one of those movies that boast a crappy, realistic and sad ending. It dared to bring forth the ending we all knew was impossible, but wished for deep within our hearts, and animated it with grand splendour. (Spoilers ahead)


Run Gilbert run! One of the most satisfying moments of anime ever, was Gilbert, standing near the cliff, weeping after reading Violet's letter. His brother, who had treated Violet merely as a weapon, was now here, standing before Gilbert, for the sake of Violet. All the years he had wanted to thank him culminated into this beautiful moment, where he made Gilbert realise where his heart truly belonged, and made him race to the one who yearned most for him.

The way the film started was indeed a very pleasant surprise. Relating it deeply with one of the most emotional and heart-touching episodes of the Violet Evergarden series, it couldn't have been handled in a better way.

Life is fleeting for everyone, none spared. It lies within us how we spend the few precious moments with those we cherish. Violet Evergarden, captured this delicate perspective, and shepherded it to us in various ways.


A boy, who loved and adored his family and one true friend, but had no idea how to convey it, in desparation, lobbed to the telephone and called the Postal Company, despite his weak body, for the sake of thanking everyone who had been there for him. With little money to spare, he was ready to give up all of it, so that they could keep a part of him after he had crossed Death's door.

Gilbert, in the aftermath of the war, realised how many lives he had led to their doom, and eventually got crushed by the overbearing guilt, enduring and suffering it alone in solitude. He blamed himself for Violet losing her arms, and made himself responsible for all the suffering Violet went through. He distanced himself from everyone he cared for, thinking it was for the best. But alas! Destiny did not see it the same way. However far apart fate separated him from those he loved, destiny pulled them together again. Violet and Dietfried, together, showed him that he didn't have to face the burden all alone, that it could be shared, because that was what bonds were truly capable of.

A young lady, feeling a deep resentment because they hadn't visited their grandparent more often, let out her frustration towards her parents, despite knowing that her argument was half-baked. Following the steps of Violet Evergarden, she realised the importance of bonds and what love really signifies. In order to apologise and let them know how she truly felt, she sent them a letter with just a few words, but infinite meaning. Those words were ""I love you.""

Capturing the essence of something so fragile and delicate- the concept of life and death itself, and animating it in such a way that it calls upon the very soul of the viewer, is candidly astonishing. Every scene from the beginning of the movie to the very end possessed great detail and precision. Kyoto animation really outdid themselves, and their passion that went into making the film was very evident. The vibrancy and life of every scene was stunning, beautifully drawn and animated to bring out the best.



A splendid mixture of plot and sentiment, sprinkled with the right amount of comedy, animated down to the finest detail, is what I would summarise the Violet Evergarden movie in a few words. This was not just a film made to simply entertain, it was one which strove to make us realise what was important in life, and cherish moments that might never come by again."
877,"The background of NANA feels like an endless white night. Things seem to be continuously in motion; beginnings and endings wrapped up in an infinite wave of falling snowflakes waiting to melt into each other. The forefront sits in perpetual twilight; characters seem to be eclipsed by their own shadows with barely enough to catch a glimpse of who they are. The entire landscape depicts the frigidity of life rising from frosty gales to a calmer ether, only to revert to stormier lands. Movement here isn’t linear. Nothing is. NANA, as a whole, is pure kinetics; an explosion of emotional energy circling, clashing and always in motion. This is all infused as a careful exploration of fate, transience, and relationships in a modernized setting. NANA as a work fully invokes the power of pathos while taking “drama” to new heights.

Based on the acclaimed manga by Ai Yazawa, Studio Madhouse adapted NANA into a 47-episode series. The story follows the pivotal journeys of two incredibly “different” girls bound by the same name and circumstance. Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu are planets apart yet exist in the same sky, tethered by each other’s gravitational force. Nana Osaki is externally a cool cat, adorned in Vivienne Westwood – the quintessential punk queen with a voracity for musical success. Whereas, Nana Komatsu, who garners the nickname “Hachi”, is a dreamer who sees, breathes, and dreams in pink; her ambitions don’t extend beyond finding her fairytale romance. Both are headed to Tokyo to pursue their various dreams (one to establish the perfect domestic life with her boyfriend, while the other wants to form her band and actualize her musical ambitions). Fate brings these two together as roommates and the narrative unfolds to reveal the tender anatomy of relationships and the power they have to shape people and their respective worlds – for better or for worse.

Then, what makes this work more than a seemingly run-of-the-mill drama about two girls discovering the pains and gains of life? What does it possess that other philosophized-by-life dramas don’t? The answer is simple: understanding. Yazawa writes candidly about people and the world, not as a spectator, but as someone clearly living in it. Nana portrays an acute understanding of how people are and their complexities that are simply written off as natural proclivities. There is reason even if Fate seems to play some indiscernible part. There is meaning even if chaos seems to rule it out. However, what’s impressive is not the mere incorporation of “understanding”, but “HOW” the work manages to create a stylized drama that is as visceral as the cold touch of the wintry night that it starts on.

Even with its luridly icy sensation, NANA is never detached or impersonal. It may be highly temperamental, but it never indulges in its own despair. It’s often cold but driven by the innate warmth of its living, breathing cast, who aren’t just personifications of suffering or “insert-theme.” This is partly what makes it sublime in its approach to drama. The drama isn’t a descriptor or a simple add-on. An event doesn’t happen so it can be “dramatic.” It doesn’t happen only in effect. There is an ebb and flow; a serpentine path painted with emotional uncertainty. The characters drip with it, but the difference is that they own it. There is accountability here. Events happen for the characters as an extension of them. They don't occur only as a platform for causality (which makes all the difference).

Considering how easily emotional appeals can be manipulated to rehash emotional evocations, NANA remains earnest. There is a purpose in isolating feelings; to let the characters lather in them, not just merely show them; to explore them to such a degree that the feeling/the state itself becomes autonomous. Loneliness becomes its own character, as does love, as does happiness. It is as transient as it is eternal. The characters are so refined that it’s hard to separate them from the elements that define them. Drama is all about nurturing these humanistic nuances and intricacies in its own habitat. Yazawa knows this all too well. Instead of showing these conditions as mere outputs of a decision or situation, they exist on an aqueous spectrum blurring the lines used to divide them AS a part of the being that gives them shape and substance. Then, causality only becomes a mean, just like Fate, just like chaos, not the end. Ultimately, that’s what makes NANA idyllic as a drama, and even more so, as a story driven by life.

Holistically, NANA showcases its prowess for drama through natural rawness, unflinching realism, and scope for understanding its subject matter(s) on a cellular level. The picture is impressive, but what makes it a pinnacle of its kind are the details – the pieces of storytelling that it utilizes to convey its narrative.

First, there is perspective. Works revolving around the musings of “life” usually have a philosophy driving their vision of it; Nana has perspectives. What the series employs are contrasting, continual planes that converge with each other to give a wholesome view through Nana and Hachi. Their interconnectedness matters more than their seemingly opposing natures. The perspectives confess, observe, share, and exploit the hearts of the events and the characters. The episodes start with a stream of confessional thoughts spilling onto the screen and morphing into the events that transpired them. Structurally, this does two things: One, it offers balance. Two, it contextualizes. This approach helps establish reliability because there are two narrators. This naturally aids in mitigating the problem of the unreliable narrator. The image becomes complete even if it is in broad, disconnected strokes. This show is unwavering in its personalization, and both perspectives will establish that with an uncanny persuasion.

Additionally, there is the context. The synergy between Nana and Hachi creates its own ecology. This isn’t something that is easily fabricated by romanticizing the power of friendship. It is pure symbiosis, of two lives reflected through a continually cracking mirror. As the story progresses, the bifocal gaze of the two melds into one. Even the apparent contradictions between the two begin becoming whole. At first, Nana and Hachi seem to complement each other but gradually start inverting their traits. The evolution of each character is highly dependent on this progression which is why context is crucial. Hachi and Nana, along with the supplementary cast provide this even when the truth is far from being transparent. Although, getting to the truth feels trivial anyway. What the structural decisions do at their very core is reinforce the means (never the end). The importance of every word, emotion, and event that happens is preserved and with it, parts of the individual and their entire world for that moment in time.

That is what matters. These moments where time comes to a standstill and that instance singularly defines the world. Incepted through bursts of chemical reactions - frozen yet in flames - quietly burning everything around them. A tempest consumed by shadows of the past and uncertainties of the present. Where entropy orchestrates all and everything seems to fall into contradiction; where dreams are simply just dreams; where expectations are merely mesmerizing mirages in the distance; where love isn’t a fairytale; where the importance of understanding each other becomes more important than anything else that could ever exist. All of this is the essence of NANA’s characters. Hachi, Nana, and the rest of the cast are crafters of their own moments. They coat the ashen night-sky with them. Constellations composed of moments; visual strings connected by the last and the next, in a cycle of change. It is through these anecdotal glimpses that these characters take form.

The characters embody this candid usage of memory, singularity, and understanding. There is much emphasis on individual events and actions. These subtleties develop to reveal how the characters are constantly at odds with themselves (even when the tone seems to be lighthearted, and all seems to be well). This is why the symbiosis between Nana and Hachi becomes so vital because their moments are not only reflected in each other but formed by each other. Additionally, it’s their relationship that breaks the feigned insularity of the other characters. That doesn’t mean they don’t have their own identities as does the rest of the cast. Everyone has a dynamism to them: their own palettes, shades, and gradients. Good. Bad. These words have no place here. Bound by insecurities, identity, and passion; constantly seeking themselves in a game of hide-and-seek, these characters are more than just adjectives and a system of traits. The show doesn’t waste time in judging its characters because it has so much to say about them.

Even then, the one that seems to be the most misunderstood and unfairly scrutinized is Hachi. She is by far the most superficially flawed character. That is never shied away from. That makes her easy to hate or dismiss as a standard shoujo lead. Hachi is perplexingly idiotic. She flings herself into the worst situations and finds herself in a never-ending state of ambivalence. Not only that, she creates disharmony between many other characters like Nana and her band members. Unlike, Nana who is easily likable due to her strong candor, intense personality, and devotion to her principals and goals, Hachi is unstable, unreliable, and utterly whimsical.

What really substantiates her as a compelling character is how she is unapologetically grounded in her humanistic tendencies and flaws. This gives her a kind of awareness that the other characters, except for Yasu (Nana’s longtime friend and drummer for her band), just don’t have. Everyone acts like they are in control, regardless of how fragmented their reflection is. Where everyone else is running from the phantoms they fear, Hachi absorbs them. Nana is about as broken as they come but constantly hides her inner turmoil; stubbornly trudging through hardship and heartbreak. Pride means everything to her. Nana survives by hiding her true feelings, while Hachi lives by constantly embracing them. Hachi is fundamentally an honest character. She subconsciously recognizes her lack of control and her predispositions. Though, she often seems to be driven by her pseudo-idealization of romance which often recycles itself in ways worse than the last. She owns up to her wretchedness and attempts to reconcile; to change. Though, this doesn’t make her immune. Her awareness is often drowned out by her naivete resulting in incrementally worse situations (almost to the point of becoming stuck in a self-prophetic rut). Still, amidst it all, she remains transparent. There are no contrivances necessary with her. Transparency can be far more compelling than clarifying opaqueness, for what lies under the milky sheath is never truly clear.

Conclusively, the characters are superb because they are etched with all the shades of humanity. The physical and psychological are all accounted for. Character and emotion; feeling and action; change and stagnation; a sincere lust for meaning and acceptance are all encompassed by these characters. The best part is that there is no room to judge. The hearts of these characters beat in such sync with our own; that the only thing that’s left is empathy and understanding even if it shrouded in frustration.

All this is packaged visually by Madhouse. They did an exceptional job adapting this series. There is a certain grittiness to the visuals and atmosphere that keeps the show from wandering too deep into the typical shoujo aesthetic. The series depends heavily on delivering rawness and realism. Otherwise, there is a nice balance of bubbly, bright scenes (in all their shoujo glory) contrasted with the necessary grunge required to keep the actual spirit of the story intact. The characters' idiosyncrasies are also poignantly preserved. The aesthetical and auditory direction kept the maturity of NANA blossoming throughout the show, despite its shoujo dispositions.

One further thing to note is that the manga is still publishing. The anime ends on a controversial note. For many, it leaves much to be desired. In the context of the story and especially how its told, the ending works. The story moves retrospectively. It doesn't bring the necessary closure needed to substantiate all the complexities it introduces, but it provides enough insight into what's important. It leaves room for more because there is more, but keeps the sanctity of the story still flourishing onwards. Another criticism it has received is its slow pacing. The pacing is slow as this isn’t a show focusing on high-octane plots. It is about people. It seasons itself over time, maturing with its characters, and their lives. It never feels redundant nor inflated. There are silly subplots but they aren’t superfluous; for they always work in tandem with a character. As aforesaid, the show never treats anything as an end. Sometimes things happen with no end and sometimes things spontaneously end. The point is that there is something concrete beneath it which ultimately sheds light on those involved.

That is what drama is.

Time lost in an emotive frenzy. Moments molded from remnants of what passed. Transformed into what is to come. Even in the calm, something moves. The scenery here is indeed a bit too chilly sometimes, laden with the melancholy of yesterday and the loneliness of tomorrow. Even so, the present waits in an ethereal stasis; attempting to understand itself. Remembering, being, and accepting; it’s all here, often presented as unyielding blizzard internalized by those who live it. As the single snowflake finally dissolves upon touch into a pool of white, to become something more than just one, those walking in NANA also find themselves inseparable from those around them. Nothing is perfect here. Nothing needs to be.

For what happens here is relentlessly flawed yet at the same time, essential and real. What happens here is, life."
97994,"It's a slice-of-life but all the jokes are just repeated over and over again. On top of that, the main cast is nothing special and the two protagonists are weird and just the low-light of the cast.
There is romance, but it's mediocre at best and honestly just gross sometimes: Tenchō is supposed to be 26 and he is constantly trying to hit on the 16-year-old Sakuranomiya Maika. Ew.
At least the show is self-aware about it:
img()



The show's premise of a bunch of characters working as actors/servants in a café is pretty good, but the execution is terrible. It gets old really fast, and they do a horrible job at changing things up so that it doesn't become stale. If they hadn't introduced new characters from time to time, I would have dropped it for sure.
A lot of the action is unrealistic to the point of being annoying, and it was hard to make sense of it half the time. For example: !Around once per episode, Tenchō does something of which he thinks it upset Sakuranomiya Maika, but it actually didn't. Then he apologizes, making her feel bad and she apologizes. This just spins in circles a bit until another character breaks them up.! And this sort of thing makes up a majority of the conflict in the show, it's honestly pretty sad how repetitive it is.

I understand that this is supposed to be a slice-of-life anime, where story is not at all the focus, but the way they handled this is just bad in my opinion. Many slice-of-life shows (including some of my favorite shows ever) don't have a story at all, but this anime does it worse.
They tried to make a slice-of-life, but they wanted to jam in a story, and the first best thing that came to mind was apparently a cringy romance story that goes nowhere. That on its own wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the fact that 80% of the shows jokes, actions, and conflicts happen solely because of this ‘romance’ between Tenchō and Sakuranomiya Maika. The show wound be nothing if it weren't for these two characters. !Later on, a little bit of romance develops between Kōyō Akizuki and Hinata Kaho, and I would have loved to see that lead somewhere, but they eventually just killed it off or forgot about it.! I think introducing the characters one by one is a smart decision, but it doesn't help much, especially when they introduce the dog that they then forget about for the next two episodes and that has absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than being a cheap plot-device.
The last episode is above average until they slap the most unsatisfying ending on it that they possibly could have, and – of course – a fanservice-Onsen-scene.

The main cast is diverse and fun, the personalities play nicely with the characters' acts in the café, and their amount is well-chosen.
However, the two protagonists (Sakuranomiya Maika and Tenchō) couldn't be more generic in my opinion. Their introduction is cliché and unrealistic too, and their age-gap of ten years is just too much for me.
Hoshikawa Mafuyu is pretty okay all things considered, maybe a little one-sided, but I think it's fine.
Hinata Kaho is annoying at first but sees some serious development later on in the show, making her a good character overall.
Amano Miu is a one-trick pony but still kind of fun.
Same goes for Akizuki Kōyō: one-trick pony, but kind of fun. He also sees some development later on, which is nice.
Kanzaki Hideri is best girl. Period. But jokes aside, Kanzaki Hideri is unironically not a terrible character and it's a shame that they introduce her so late into the show. !Yes, Kanzaki Hideri is technically a boy, but I didn't want to spoil that, which is why I called them ‘her’.! I feel like if the show revolved around Hinata Kaho and Akizuki Kōyō, it would be a lot more interesting and less repetitive than it turned out to be.

It's small, as usual for a slice-of-life, but the café is nice and everything feels immersive.
The homes of all the characters look convincing and nice.
Overall average, but not terrible at all.

There are some nice effects here and there that really enhance some of the scenes, but it's nothing flashy.
The OP spoils the characters that later get introduced, but the ED doesn't, which is kind of weird.
My main problem with the visuals is simply that Sakuranomiya Maika is supposed to have this terrifying look on her face, when there is literally no sight of that (or I'm just blind). Akizuki Kōyō looks much more frightening and yet that is never mentioned.

The sound design is pretty decent, but both the OP and ED are musical trash, if you ask me.
The OP was meme'd to death, and that is all that it's good for; it's not fun, it's not natural, it feels corporate and half-hearted. Same thing goes for the ED, except that is also boring as all hell. They even messed up the mixing on the ED.

There were some funny moments sprinkled throughout the show, but that gets undermined by the fact that nearly every joke gets repeated at some point, making it frustrating and boring.
I like the awkwardness between some of the characters, except between Tenchō and Sakuranomiya Maika, which was just dry repetition of a kindergarten romance.

Really, it's just not worth watching a second time, unless you like the comedy aspect of it.



Note that I did not grade on sadness (as I usually do), because the show just wasn't ever trying to be sad, and it would have just dragged down the score.



Average of all scores: 4.4/10
Average without rewatchability: 5/10
My score: 4/10
It's a very average show with a premise that could have been cool but wasn't. On top of that, the protagonists are unlikable and the conflicts are stiff and dry in most places.
I was expecting more."
20966,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you had the power to switch bodies with someone else? No? How about the power of charm, telepathy, or seeing the future? Or maybe you've thought about invisibility, dreaming of traumatic events, or even erasing memories? Still not impressed? Well, what if you had to KISS someone in order to use one of those seven powers? Mm-hmm, I think I've caught your attention now.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my review of Yamada and the Seven Witches, also known in Japanese as Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo.

Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches is about Ryuu Yamada, a delinquent in his second year at Suzaku High School. One day, he accidentally falls down a flight of stairs, crashing into the school's top student, Urara Shiraishi, in the process. When Yamada regains consciousness, he discovers that he has switched bodies with Shiraishi. When they switch back, they discover that kissing causes them to switch bodies. It is later discovered that there are seven witches at Suzaku High School, each of them possessing a unique power. Together with the newly-revived Supernatural Studies Club, they set out to discover the identities of these seven witches.

Although I've never read the manga before, I've known about it for quite a while because of its popularity. That's why when the anime was announced, I jumped at the chance to watch it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped I would, but it still turned out to be a great anime in all other aspects.

The story is well put-together, and I liked that it focused on powers other than body swapping. Each of the characters were developed quite well, especially the witches. You cannot forget the main characters, though. Yamada was a fun character from beginning to end, and Shiraishi was quite an interesting one. The other members of the Supernatural Studies Club, Miyamura (the student council vice president), Itou (the supernatural-obsessed girl), and Tsubaki (a transfer student who is introduced later), each have their moments of brilliance or hilariousness.

The voice acting was done very well, and each voice actor fit their character as well as possible. I didn't care for the ending theme, ""Candy Magic"", that much, but I absolutely LOVE the opening, ""Kuchizuke Diamond""! It's very catchy and well-sung; it's easily one of the best opening themes of the season where it aired. The best part of this anime, though, was the animation. It was so vivid and well-done!

Thinking about it, I wonder why I didn't enjoy Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches so much, because what is there not to like about it? I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the manga. Or maybe I should read the manga myself and see if the anime was any different from it? I don't know."

Welcome to the NHK is one of the best anime that I’ve ever watched. This is probably because it was the first anime that got me into watching anime ‘as a hobby’, or because it’s just a very good anime. Welcome to the NHK is an anime that has the themes of hopelessness, loneliness, anxiety, and how it can keep us down. What we see around us can be changed by it, and we can make ourselves think that everyone about us is out to get us and laughing at our very existence, even though it is all just in our head. Welcome to the NHK aired in 2006, but its very story is ever so relevant in the current day.

The protagonist in Welcome to the NHK is Sato Tatsuhiro. Sato is a 22-year-old hikikomori (someone who has withdrawn from all social life). He spends his days in his small apartment, without having a job or going to school, sleeping the day away and living life without a purpose. Sato has been a hikikomori for over three years, after he had a panic attack while walking to school the first summer at university. He blames his being a hikikomori on the NHK (Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (Japan Social Withdrawal Association)), an imaginary organization whose sole purpose is to keep him from escaping from being a hikikomori. He hallucinates often, which fuels his conspiratorial theories and makes him go more insane. At the beginning of the anime, he has no reason for existing, just laying down all day, seemingly waiting to die. The only time he goes outside is at night, to either go to a convenience store or to the park – any other outside activity would probably give him a panic attack.

Sato’s life changes one night when he meets Misaki, a younger girl that says she wants to help him to get out from being a hikikomori. Sato knows almost nothing about Misaki, but Misaki knows all about Sato and his life. Even before meeting him, she already knew his name, birthday, and even the fact that he dropped out of university. Sato hesitates at first to accept her offer, pretending to not be a hikikomori, but eventually accepts her offer.

Sato also interacts with Yamazaki, his next-door neighbor, often. Sato and Yamazaki were friends in high school, making their reunion sweet at first. Both are shocked at the developments in each other’s life’s that happened in-between the four years since Sato graduated high school; Sato becoming a hikikomori, and Yamazaki becoming an otaku. Besides Misaki, Yamazaki is the only (mostly) positive influence on Sato.

The only other reoccurring character in this series is Hitomi, who was Sato’s senior in high school. She recruited him to be in the Literature Club, which they were the only members of. She was the person who introduced Sato to the idea of conspiracy theories and is partially the reason why Sato thinks that the ‘NHK’ is plotting to make him a hikikomori for the rest of his life. When they meet again in the anime, Hitomi seems to have her life together. In reality, she is only able to hold her life together because she’s on many medications.

Sato’s takes quite the journey throughout the anime. At times, he seems to finally be breaking out of his shell and unbecoming a hikikomori, only to be sucked back in by unfortunate outcomes and internal forces. When things are going good, Sato often over-thinks, and thinks that whatever good situation he’s in is just the NHK plotting to make him turn into an even more socially-isolated hikikomori. Although gullible, Sato can be quite smart for someone in his situation – he just is not able mentally to get out of his rut. Misaki and Yamazaki try hard to get him to return to regular life, but Sato often reverses the progress he makes.

Almost everything about Welcome to the NHK backs up its excellent and enthralling story. Its soundtrack excites, depresses, or gives the viewer anxiety. The relationships Sato builds up with others are satisfying to see, even if he is constantly messing them up. The animation isn’t that good, but this isn’t the type of anime where that matters all that much. Overall, Welcome to the NHK is a brilliant anime that showcases the struggles of a man trying to re-enter society."

First impressions, so we got modern Japan meets fantasty world with the help of an magic inter dimensional gate that appears out of nowhere sounds interesting enough.

Story, 4/10

When a magic inter dimensional portel opens up in Japan.

Hordes of Fantasy Warriors and monsters poor out and Attck the people of Japan.
With one man standing in there way.
A Japanese soldier named Itami who manages to lead a counter defense in order to push the intruders back.
Which actually works even though any one with half a brain could have come up with it.

Some time after the attack he is apparently a hero now and promoted in the army.
So after that he is in the first squadron of the Japanese army to explore this new land and etc.

the story of gate pretty much starts out like this epic war between the Japanese army vs the empire which is totally not a cheep ripoff of the Roman Empire.

Which I thought was a pretty interesting idea for a war story. 
Because you got modern combat with guns and tanks vs fantasy combat with magic and swords. Which would make some very interesting battles going down. And while this epic war is going down we will have people from both side trying to stop the war so the two worlds can coexist in peace.

Sounds pretty cool right? Well if you think that what the story like then I am sorry to tell you that gate is otaku pandering and Japanese propaganda to the max.
And I am not jokeing when I say this.
The underline story is basically Japanese propaganda and otaku pandering.

For the otaku pandering part you got a fantasy world filled with most otaku fedish's like lolis,elfs,animal girls and etc.

it also includes a main protagonist as an otaku who is a hero to the people and has been starting collecting girls for his haram. 
There is also A lot of fan service.

For the Japanese propaganda part. 
You got the leaders of America,China,Russia government acting like one dimensional evil villains who want to take over the fantasy world and mine it for natural resources for money or eta.
While the noble Japanese government what to protect the fantasy people from those who would have evil intentions like America,China,Russia.

Another example of this propaganda is how normal Japanese soldiers where actually able to beat highly trained American blacks ops who probably have years of combat experience.

I get it Japan your still salty about World War Two but you have to get over it,
The Japanese army isn't as strong as it used to be and you have to understand that.

But Also I would like to add that any country would probably do the same if a new land popped up and it was full of untapped resources and one county was just like no we call dibs on this.
This is global politics 101.

But apparently you can't have a war drama without all these ""important"" elements like otaku pandering and Japanese propaganda. 
Actually it isn't a war drama is more like a war dud.
Because Who needs Gray morality or deep themes or good characters even.
what the fuck is that? Take the safe rote and hope the plebs will bite and call it a master piece of mature writing which it really isn't.

So gate had the potential to be a good war drama and if it had taken it self seriously it would have Been good. But sadly it decided to Take the Safe route And becomes a soulless otaku pandering wish fill ment bull shit with a war thrown in as flavoring.
And when I think about this could have been a pretty decent harem if it wasn't for the war and the badly explored politics.
Hell it could have been a decent adventure story if you again remove the war and politics.

Actually when I think about.
the war and political elements really do actually drag it down to the mud.
Because this could have been a fun story with harem and ecchi shit happening,
And It would probably be a ten times better show.
And that is saying something.

Characters, 4/10

The main character Itami is the most out of place thing in his setting. 
He is pretty much an otaku with a pretty decent ranking the military. 
And I understand that anyone can have a hobby that's outside their work place.
But I would think if he was a soldier for the army he would be a lot more fit or in fact more highly trained.
I know he not part of the black ops or any highly trained military.
But in all honesty he doesn't even act or feel like a soldier.
Because I have meet people that are or where part of the military in some point in there lives.
And he doesn't have that vide about him.
Even when I include other anime with military people in them.

his presence is probably the most jarring thing in this show.

The side character are very one note and are as bland as toast.
All the characters are spupind,
Even the military leaders Who are In charge.

There not even a single character I care about in this entire show.

There is no character development or fleshing out. 
Even though there could be with the whole war thing.
Because war is very stressful and losing your friends or killing things can do things to people.
Some it doesn't really affect them and others well PTSD is quite the popular way to go about things.
Not one character say especially from the Japanese army 
What is this fighting actually actually doing to us or how do people feel when killing entire army's in mare seconds.

They feel like robots they just point, shot, repeat.

But in the flip side It more reasonable for the people from the fantasy world to act like that.
Because death and fighting are more common for them,
Especially When you make in the midevil fantasy world setting as context for that.




Art, 6/10

The animation is very average as a whole.
It has some very colorful backgrounds.
The art style is very generic.

I like some of the character designs,
Not there not amazing or mind blowing in any way.


Sound, 5/10

The op I don't care about and the ending is probably the worse choice they could of picked for a ending song.
Because it so upbeat even though people are getting killed in mass in the show.
It doesn't fit very well.

The ost was fine for the most part.
It was done by yoshiaki Fujisawa.

Enjoyment, 6/10

So over all despite being quite negative towards this show in general. I did quite find it quite entertaining at times.
Like for example when the empire tried to attack the Japanese base and the empire army got recked almost instantly.
Which I fould funny because the empire army was so cocky and thinking they were going to win and then they get ripped apart by gun fire. 
That was favorite part,
It got even better when they did it a few more times with a bigger army each time.
And still got ripped apart easily.
Those episodes are probably the most fun I ever had in this anime.

And sadly it never go back to the quitly those episodes had 



Overall, 4/10

If you like simple shows with fan service and fantasy elements then gate is an anime you will like. But if your looking for a war drama that takes it's self seriously then you won't find it here along with over things like logic or gray characters.

Also if this was supposed to be some sort of advertisement for the Japanese army then it's a fail.
Even as that."
114232,"HigeHiro is the embodiment of a series with good intent proceeding to then absolutely shit on them while being comically unaware of its failings. It covers a highschool runaway turned prostitute by the name of Sayu, who crashes in at the place of our resident main MC  Yoshida, starting a rather heartwarming story about her increasingly finding family in Yoshida as well as others and becoming more and more self-sufficient on her own. This works for the first stretch of the series, but runs into numerous issues even early on that only become more and more exacerbated. 

Even early into the show, there's a heavy emphasis on Sayu needing to pick up her bag and head back to her family - which considering this is a highschool runaway with clear traces of emotional abuse, is obviously out of the question for any sane person to do, yet Yoshida and the rest of the cast keep insisting on this like it's the only option before even bothering asking Sayu why she ran away in the first place. Sayu is desentized involving sexual activity, and this is unsurprising considering her experiences until meeting Yoshida, yet her flirting with him only increases as the series goes on regardless of what happens - even if Yoshida rejects her advances. This colors their interactions in a rather inappropriate romantic light, with the two often blushing at events like going to the fireworks or stumbling on top of each other in a manner reminiscent of a romantic comedy - which is a problem, because this show's romance is rather poor and it certainly can't be described as comedic, especially the later into the show we get.

This series has precisely zero tact involving the subject matter it is covering. This includes Yoshida's coworkers chastising him for keeping a girl with him and encouraging him to kick her to head home - which is doubly astounding considering that all of these people are adults and as such should be aware that her reasons for running away must have been rather heavy if she had to resort to the measures she had. It doesn't help that neither character is well-developed, with the majority of their characterization surrounding their feelings for Yoshida or position on Sayu staying with him, but never much about them personally - in fact, we don't get to know much about the cast at all minus Sayu and her later friend (and easily best character in the series) Asami. Asami is the closest thing the series has to a well-rounded character, and her characterization involving going against her parent's wishes on what to study as well as friendship with Sayu was fairly well done and marked what I consider to be the strongest point of the series. Unfortunately, the later into the series we go, the more its issues run rampant.

A point of criticism against the series in Japan is that Yoshida's actions are illegal, as keeping a minor against the wishes of their parents with an adult is legally perceived as kidnapping (though isn't considered kidnapping if the parents don't press charges/nobody reports it). While I cannot speak to the validity of the criticism made by locals, it misses another point entirely, being that she had no clear authorities to turn to for her troubles (something unfortunately common among most victims of various shades of abuse and mental trauma worldwide) and had to resort to leaving her family entirely. Various series have explored these points in different ways; Ryukishi's work in the Higurashi and Umineko visual novels, for example, extensively cover how abuse can occur in tight social structures, helped greatly by Ryukishi's own experiences as a social worker and how these experiences can materialize. Monogatari, for all its flaws, extensively covers this subject in several character arcs - shown from both the perspectives of victims as well as perpetrators - and handles it exceptionally well, particularly in Nekomonogatari and Second Season. Chi no Wadachi is a pretty neat psychological horror manga, showing to what extent abuse can scar someone and diving fairly deep into the victim's psyche. And there's countless media in the sphere that has covered this topic with quite a bit of care on some level - the recently finished airing fantastic Fruits Basket reboot being yet another example, the Little Busters visual novel's Haruka route being one as well to cap things off.

Unfortunately, as mentioned before, HigeHiro is not a case where this is handled particularly well. Sayu gets guilt-tripped all series long to essentially fuck off and return to her family, and her backstory showcases her family being sociopathic asshats who didn't care for her trauma at worst, and negligent at best. Her mentioning her background unfortunately does not change the pace at which she is pushed to leaving Yoshida and returning to her family, which is doubly astounding considering that everyone interacting with the situation minus Sayu is an adult, and her family as insanely toxic - her mother, for example, is absolute scum, immediately conservatively enquires on her daughter's chastity and talks about the trouble she caused her. One would expect the narrative to confront the incredibly conservative attitudes being shown here, which played a huge role in Sayu fleeing from her family. Instead, Yoshida bows his head to her and everything is resolved seamlessly, which leads me to another issue involving the series; it has no idea how to deal with antagonists.

The earliest instance of an antagonistic character in the series is some playboy who attempts to rape Sayu, which actually is a pretty accurate portrayal of standard sexual assault; victim already knows the perpetrator, blackmail, sexual harassment and so on. The issue is that once the playboy is chased off, the next time he's in an episode he's suddenly conscious of hiding Sayu from her brother stalking the supermarket they're working and is all of a sudden portrayed in a positive light, with his previous actions forgotten. This...is a recurring problem in the series, with Yuzuha and Sayu's moms similarly being victims of the series' strange willingness to forgive people who probably really shouldn't be forgiven, and sweep their actions under the rug due to its clear conservative tint.

There are, however, unique problems to the anime that do not exist in its light novel or manga counterpart. Volume 3 of the LNs - which gives Yoshida quite a bit of backdrop and characterization - is casually skimmed through, making Yoshida himself come off as rather flat, with very little characterization. In both other versions of the story, he's given some exploration of his past with a previous girlfriend, and his distant approach to personal relationships is emphasized to contrast with Sayu's, who receives similar development in the next volume that the anime adapted more concisely. 5 volumes is quite a bit for a 1 cour anime, and while I do think Project No. 9 had a lot on their plate here - this being a decently budgeted anime right after releasing Tomozaki-kun - this show clearly needed more runtime to expand on its cast of characters, and I say this as someone familiar with the source material and up to date with the manga as of the time of this writing. This could have at least somewhat recontextualized some of the dynamic between Sayu and Yoshida, and I'm not sure why Yoshida's backstory was dropped out of the anime in favor of a fireworks date.

Perhaps no larger offender of HigeHiro's issues exists than its ending, which while acts as a bookends to the beginning of the story, also serves as a clear romantic conclusion considering the romantic and sexual friction between both Sayu and Yoshida - culminating in a rather questionable conversation between the two before his flight home wherein he mentions that he wouldn't mind being romantically engaged with her once she comes of age, but won't wait for her to pursue a different relationship. Judging by the fact he was willing to invite her into his apartment post-timeskip, that leaves very little to the imagination about his relationship status and where their relationship goes from her - while I do think age gap stories can be interesting depending on their execution, there's no mention of the disproportionate power dynamic between the two or the fact Sayu very clearly spent so much time being unhealthily attached to Yoshida, who while her savior also acted as a guardian over the course of the story. 

On a technical level, the series is competent; it's decently directed and nice to look at, the character designs are attractive to look at and the animation remained largely consistent, with clear jumps in quality in better moments in the series. The sound design is worth of praise, with pretty good voiceacting, a neat OST and consistent sound effects - to say nothing of the OP, which is pretty nice, and the ED, which is pretty catchy and highlights what I consider the series' best parts. Some people found the fanservice distasteful and while I can't say it bothers me much, I can see where they're coming from involving how the show covers it.

In conclusion, HigeHiro starts off decently enough, but rapidly disintegrates under the weight of its subject matter and themes, of which the author is clearly unequipped to tackle. I wish 'em the best of luck in future endeavors - the series' better moments are clear indicators of what they're capable of - and that they'd improve from this series' failings. 

Thanks to anyone and everyone for reading this review. Any and all feedback would be appreciated.

20626,"We're all part of Fairy Tail and we're a family!

Listen, when I started watching Fairy Tail when I was very young and a big fan of fantasy and action anime. I also liked the series that were very long and had this ‘family kind of vibe‘ to them. Fairy Tail was exactly that and I did like watching it back then!

However, when I started re-watching the anime I asked myself: why did I like this? I’m not hating on the manga or anime because I still think that the art style of Hiro Mashima (the creator) improved a lot over the years and I still like some of the character designs but all in all the show was meh. It felt like there were a lot of filler episodes and whole arcs I did not really enjoy watching. For example, the whole traveling to an alternate dimension arc? You know, the one that put the spotlight on the flying cats. Didn’t really like that one. To me, Fairy Tail was this happy show with (too) many characters and nice little ideas but it was never really more than a nice adventure. I mean, it doesn’t have to be but I can see why people would drop the series after the first two arcs or even sooner than that. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t drop the anime nor the manga because it feels nostalgic and I still hold it somewhat dear but I couldn’t defend it even if my life depended on it.



I don’t even mind the suddenly overpowered characters like Erza but some inconsistencies were just too apparent throughout the series. Especially, in the anime, the characters look different in the different frames. Lucy’s boobs change size in like every other shot and I believe that at some point (for the last season) they changed studios and the characters looked completely different from before. Natsu Dragneel, one of the main characters and a fire wizard is actually a pretty generic hero with his amazing powers and his good heart. He’s brave and while he often acts a little childish he cares deeply for his friends and guild members. I don’t mind his character all that much because while he may not be that different from most other hero characters I did like the way he acted a bit silly and didn’t just seem like the cool guy of the series. I also love that he has pink hair and was raised by a dragon.

Learning magic from a giant ass dragon? How cool is that?



In my opinion, Natsu’s pretty much the only one with an interesting background story and he was pretty much the only reason I wanted to finish the manga. I also enjoyed Natsu’s relationship with Lucy Heartfilia because it was both cute and funny. Their relationship was another reason for me to give this a chance because I liked how oblivious Natsu was and how much Lucy grew thanks to teaming up with him. Other than that, I felt like the story was being a bit repetitive and while I liked some arcs more than others I did not really feel like I needed to actively watch what was going on. I often used the show as background noise when I was doing something else and didn’t want to watch something I needed to pay much attention to. That in itself says a lot about the show though.



The character Lucy Heartfilia was another big problem for me because at the beginning of the series I did not like her at all. She felt like the kind of character the creator included merely for the purpose of fan service or as the potential love interest for the protagonist. But later on, my opinion of Lucy was heavily changed as we learn more about her history with her father and how lonely she felt as a child. She became more of an actual character who could fight and support her friends without needing to be saved and protected every single time. Sadly, she was still used for so much fan service, like showing her panties or her being completely naked and while I personally didn’t mind it that much it often felt a little too forced. It wasn’t funny nor was it unexpected. The same goes for some of the other female characters that were involved in a lot of fanservice. The characters are drawn very similarly and don’t look that different from each other. I think that Hiro Mashima did a better job of drawing them differently in his art books but I’ll make a separate post about that. All in all, when the characters aren’t colored or don’t have different hairstyles most of them are indistinguishable. My favorite female character was Mirajane because her demon forms looked so cool and she was so sweet but she didn’t play that big of a role. There were too many side characters I didn’t really care about and I wish that some of the designs were more sophisticated.

Everyone loves Happy…



This little blue cat is the main supportive character in the series and while I don’t hate him I never really liked him either. Honestly, he could be so annoying and as I recall it, his actions didn’t really matter all that much. He could fly and liked fish but that’s about it. I know that my opinion about him can be considered controversial because he seems so popular but I still can’t bring myself to love this character. I’ll just say it as it is; I don’t really like Happy all that much. Sorry! Usually, I love cats but the cat characters in Fairy Tail just weren’t for me and in addition, I didn’t like their designs at all. Except for Frosch because that cat was stupidly cute for some reason. Carla (the female white cat) I didn’t like at all and when she suddenly was able to transform into a human I was like really? It felt like Mashima just wanted to draw a neko girl character.

Despite everything, I think that Fairy Tail is a fun series and I still don’t think that it’s a bad manga or show but for a long time I feel like praised it too much simply because I was so much younger and didn’t really pay attention to the details. Actually, I did like some of the reveals we got to experience like Natsu’s past or Lucy’s relationship with her father and mother. I also liked how friendship and familial bonds were present throughout the story and like I said I liked seeing Natsu and Lucy interact. There were also some other characters I liked but the best thing about Fairy Tail was it’s charm. Some of the fight scenes were also pretty cool and I liked how all the characters used different kinds of magic. Lucy’s celestial magic was really cool and I enjoyed the idea a lot.



Anyway, I feel like the ending of the series was written too quickly, and quite frankly, the last fight was disappointing but if you don’t expect too much watching the anime or reading the manga I recommend giving it a chance. Fairy Tail is an enjoyable anime to watch with friends or when you need something light-hearted but I don’t think that it was as great as I used to think it was and it’s no longer amongst my favorites. Hiro Mashima’s art style developed nicely though and I even own two of his art books because I love the way he colors and shades his characters. Fairy Tail is a nice action, adventure, fantasy manga and there’s no harm in giving it a try. I hope that I’ve made it clear that I do not want to bash the series because I used to love it so much and it is quite fun. I still felt like I should reflect on the whole story and concept a bit more and be honest about what I didn’t like that much. Thank you for reading!"
155783,"Preface: This review is split into two main sections. The first part is a general review of the show in its entirety and the second is a review of one specific problematic aspect of it. If you just want a general review, only read the paragraphs in italics.

>Note: Due to the ambiguous nature of Haruki/Kiruko's gender and name, I will be alternating which name I refer to them as. This is because every way to refer to them felt wrong, so I am going with the option that feels the least uncomfortable.



Heavenly Delusion is quite different from most other anime. It isn’t some abstract art piece, but it always never makes the most sense. In the first episode, we are dropped into the middle of two plotlines, or in media res, to sound pretentious. The only tenuous threads of vague world concepts link the two initially, but for the most part, it is like two different anime happening at the same time.

In the post-apocalypse side of the story, not much time is dedicated to actual plot progression. The journey of the two leads consists mostly of a search for their respective destinations without direction as to where they are going. Maru and Haruki each spitball directions they can go towards or find out things that might vaguely be related to their goals. However, they usually end up in a story tangent unrelated to the main plot that typically lasts for an episode or two. For most of the runtime, the story feels like it is an aimless collection of side quests.

However, the fluid nature of Heavenly Delusion’s story structure, although on paper counterintuitive, is its biggest strength. My earlier description of that structure as aimless and directionless should only be taken as complementary despite those words’ typical derogatory undertones. Rather than just being a world that acquiesces to the happenings of the plot and the development of the characters, the world is full of characters experiencing their own stories in the post-apocalypse. The self-contained stories that come into view present entirely new ecosystems existing on their own. The Japan of the 2040s feels like a place that has been lived in, rummaged, and savaged. The journey of Maru and Kiruko feels like a true adventure because of the expansive world they are traveling across.

Ironically, by spending so much time not focusing on the main plot, when they do actually come up, they feel all the more rewarding. These side stories, as well as being good on their own, also make the drip feed of info in the main story feel more meaningful. That with the fantastic world building heavily feeds into making the main mysteries all the more enthralling.

Heavenly Delusion doesn’t hold the viewer’s hand. It expects its audience to be willing enough to be lost in its plot. While it is acceptable to watch it in a brain-off way, letting the events of the story pass you by, the series wants you to watch it like a detective. You, as the audience member, are given an incomplete story the show expects you to put together by yourself. You are the one that has to figure out the connections between the facility of Heaven and the post-apocalyptic hell of modern Japan. The mysteries that the characters want to solve doubles with the mystery you are supposed to solve. This level of maturity that this story treats its audience with is hard to come by in anime.

And all of that mysterious atmosphere and meticulous world-building is bundled together with amazing presentation. Even furthering the vibe of the post-apocalypse is very immersive audiovisuals. It is consistently a feast for the ears and eyes. The most standout aspect of a stellar visual and audio design has to be the backgrounds. The backgrounds are detailed to an eye-opening extent.  Here are some standout backgrounds throughout various points of the show.

These are all gorgeous images that can each speak for the decrepit state of the world. They can paint an emotional picture without any context of the greater show. Nothing immerses like the overgrown vines growing across the wrecked environment of normal society. Nature finding its home in abandoned environments shows how the characters live on the remains of a previous world.

But I actually lied earlier. You see, these backgrounds aren’t from various points in the show, they are all from the first 5 minutes of Episode 1. All of those detailed backgrounds that each paint their own little story within them pass by in just a few minutes. And it isn’t like the quality of backgrounds goes down past the beginning. In a series that can have its ups and downs, the enthralling visuals and backgrounds are consistently amazing. Even during some more boring points of the story, it is still engaging just due to the high visual atmosphere.

Heavenly Delusion is as enthralling, as it is engaging, as it is thick in atmosphere. It is rare to come across something that can so consistently impress with its mysterious story and gorgeous visuals. It is a marvel to behold that everybody should see for themselves.

But that isn’t the end. I wish it was, but it isn’t. Throughout my entire long-winded praise of this show, I left out one very important aspect of Heavenly Delusion. You see, I was initially planning on just leaving the review at that. Then after watching a very certain scene in the penultimate episode, this very aspect became something that can’t really be ignored. That aspect is everything surrounding Haruki’s gender. 

I do commend this show for attempting to portray a transgender character. Of course, it isn’t a completely clean representation of the average trans person, as Kiruko is just trapped in the body of their sister and not born in the body of a girl. But if they aren’t transgender, then they are at the very least transgender-adjacent. When Kiruko first mentions their gender to Maru, they use the line:

>“My body’s a woman’s, but in here, my mind’s a man’s.”

Lines like that draw parallels to common language surrounding gender fluidity. Given the grace as to which the story develops itself in every other aspect, it should be expected that Haruki’s gender is treated with mature understanding. Why should anything else be expected from a series that is so mature in literally every other aspect? But, that isn’t how things turn out. Instead, Heavenly Delusion depicts a truly terrible representation of a transgender character.

I am going to adopt a very different tone of voice when discussing the matter of Kiruko's gender because it exists in an entirely different realm of quality compared to the rest of the show. I emphasized earlier how mature the writing was in having respect for its audience. But in this element of the plot, that respect goes completely out the window. 

I am not just going to talk about THAT SCENE at the end of Episode 12. It is a very controversial part of the story, but this half of the review isn’t only going to be a diatribe of it. It may be somewhat obvious what my thoughts on THAT SCENE are just due to how I am referring to, but we have to work toward that. Because I actually don’t have completely negative thoughts as to how it is handled. Initially, when this component of the story is introduced, it is actually done quite well.

In Episode 3, the first time when the complicated gender identity of Haruki is indulged in-depth, this topic is treated with the expected level of respect. I’d go so far as to say that this episode is one of the best in the entire season. Its exploration of Kiruko’s past feels progressively emotionally visceral as it goes on. Haruki’s hallucination during the body-swapping operation and subsequent panic attack after they find out that they now are trapped in the body of their sister are stand-out moments.

The whole hallucinatory sequence is so beautiful in every way, it is probably my favorite scene of the season.

The pure intensity of it makes it all hard to watch, but in a good way (unlike a certain later scene). Combined with the mysterious atmosphere and detailed visual design that makes the rest of the season fantastic elevates the episode to a fantastic degree. In the first few episodes, the plot surrounding Haruki’s gender is very well written, mostly.

The word ‘mostly’ is there because Kiruko’s gender fluidity is initially imbued with incestuous subtext. The very first indication of Haruki’s fuzzy gender is when they try to kiss themselves in the mirror while they are naked. With the context of the Episode 3 backstory, this scene turns from quirky to weird. Not weird with a positive connotation like the complex mystery is, but it is weird in a deeply off-putting way.  This is further compounded in the third episode when Kiruko is straight-up called a siscon. 

It isn’t like Haruki’s feelings toward their sister being coded with incest really go anywhere. The incestuous subtext stops showing up after these small moments in the first few episodes. They are completely ignorable, as on the whole, this part of the story is still very well written. However, when taken into the larger context of the story, these moments can be seen as a bad omen.

Kiruko’s gender is primarily developed through their relationship with Maru. Maru finding out about Haruki’s gender ambiguity after revealing his general attraction towards Kiruko as a girl should provide for well-thought-out, meaningful drama. The inklings of a mature romantic subplot involve Maru navigating through how much he wants Haruki’s gender to be taken into account when factoring in his feelings for them. This can be seen at the beginning of Episode 5 when he beats up a gang in a depressive state. He uses the line:

>Ever had a girl you like turn out to be a guy? Can you imagine?

This is a good scene to start an interesting inner conflict within one of the main characters. Sadly, this is one of the only scenes where this conflict is taken as a serious plot point. In the subsequent episodes, Maru’s attraction to Kiruko and their gender is treated with the touch of a jackhammer. Rather than being played for drama, it is played for comedy. And not in a well-written type of way, more like in the “why is this happening, get me out of here” type of way. By far the most blatant offender of this is in Episode 6 when Maru sexually assaults Haruki despite their pleas otherwise. 

This isn’t to say that the show’s comedy is bad on the whole. Levity should be expected in any type of dystopia. The small talk between the main duo about the many mundanities of their adventure provides for effective and efficient humor. Little diversions like the back and forth over what to name the car Juichi gave them are funny. In turn, details about the world get built out as well as the chemistry between the two leads. But it is very jarring when that briefly gets thrown out of the window to do the very groan-inducing comedy.

Especially in the middle episodes of the series, there is a misplaced need to place Kiruko in sexual situations that are supposedly comedic or for Maru to feel relentlessly horny about them. This is a more systemic problem with how anime, likely written by male writers, mistreat their female characters by putting them in oddly sexual situations. That whole topic belongs in a wider discussion of how a patriarchal society like Japan treats women, but that topic can lead to such a large rabbit hole that it will take until the heat death of the universe to get to the end of it. 

But while this whole discussion usually dips into misogyny, in this case, it also falls into transphobia. To treat a character struggling with their gender identity as a sex object is a gross degradation. When the plot focuses on Haruki’s gender so much, it can be painful to see it kneecap itself by not treating it with the respect and maturity it deserves.

But still, these problems are still kinda ignorable. Yes, those scenes filled with distasteful sex jokes aren’t great, and those are a few minutes of my life I am never getting back, but they aren’t that important in the wider story. An unintentional positive benefit of an aimless story structure is that when there is a bump in the story that isn’t completely desirable, it can be skipped easily. 

At a certain point though, this can’t be ignored. And that point is THAT SCENE at the end of Episode 12.



It's not very good.

It's bad even.

Like, really, really bad.

Concerns about degrading a dysphoric character into a sex object don’t really go away when there is a RAPE SCENE??? 

Even removing all aspects of Haruki’s muddy gender from the scene, is still terrible from a narrative perspective. Even if you wanted a scene where Robin rapes Haruki (which you don’t, this is just a hypothetical), then it shouldn’t be the second scene they share together after they reunite. Yes, fucked up things do happen in the post-apocalypse, but there is nothing about a post-apocalyptic hellscape that would make somebody suddenly become a predator to the person that they were a mentor for. This behavior was previously foreshadowed in Episode 3, but how it was reintroduced here is far too abrupt. It is good from a narrative perspective to have Kiruko's idealized version of their hero fall apart before their eyes, but it is if we skipped straight from the start to the conclusion of the plot point.

With how it is placed in the story, it just feels shocking for the sake of it. But you can still shock an audience while still justifying the buildup for that shocking moment. The destruction of Heaven that is happening in the facility side of the story is a good example of how to properly shock the audience. Even if it is an accidental collapse of the facility, it still makes sense narrative-wise due to the childrens’ growing curiosity of the outside and the inner turmoil of the adults running it. It is staggering to see two scenes meant to be shocking back-to-back with such a vast gap in quality.

And when you do take the transgender theming of Kiruko into account, this all jumps headfirst into the direction of transphobia. Robin explicitly mentions to Haruki that he is raping Kiruko and that they just have to watch. The story context for the rape is inseparable from Haruki’s genderfluidity. This level of tactlessness in this depiction is an extension of Maru’s sexual assault scene but somehow taken to an even more twisted extent. It is abominable that the only way a character can express their feelings towards Kiruko is through a sexual assault of some kind. Even if it is now an antagonistic force expressing this sentiment, the fact that this can only be expressed through the sexualization of said character is terrible. There is a potential for a nonsexual style of storytelling when it comes to dealing with how trans characters interact with others, but it is squandered so heavily.

I don’t want to think about this anymore, here is another detailed background from the first few minutes of the first episode.

It looks so cool, I like the contrast that the flowers and butterfly provide with an abandoned grassy environment behind it.  

I am purposely distracting myself, so let’s just end this.



Even after ranting at length about the horrid depiction of transgender identity and genderfluidity in the story, I can’t really put down the entire show for it. Even if I revile this one part of it, I still enjoyed my time overall. The mystery is still enthralling, the visuals are still beautiful, and the world-building is still fantastic. But it is also hard to swallow something that puts down an entire marginalized group in this way. Media like this is hard to evaluate just because the problematic aspect of it doesn’t erase what good there is. However, just because of the high quality of everything else doesn't mean that there shouldn't be an important discussion about how to do representation correctly in stories like this. Good representation of minority groups is generally a positive, and there are many anime that do representation well. But it is good to see an example of how to do it poorly, to learn from in future stories that try to go into something like this.

In all, Heavenly Delusion exists in two realms of quality. In one where most of it resides, it is a magnificent spectacle that embodies everything great about anime, and in the other where one story aspect of it resides, it shits itself to the point where it represents the absolute worst of it.

Because this anime exists in a murky quality bubble, I am not giving this just one score. I am giving it two. One for if you take the bungled LGBTQ+ themes into account and the other for if you don’t. I can’t decide which one to go with, so I am declaring this a choose-your-own-adventure with two paths. Choose which score you want to go with because I am indecisive.

The third-to-last paragraph was a better conclusion than this one and the penultimate one where I just explained the scoring system of the review, so just pretend that is the end. Please excise the final two paragraphs of this review from your mind like Kiruko’s brain was excised from their body.

356,"Introduction
Studio DEEN's Fate Stay/Night (2006) is an adaptation of Type-Moon's visual novel by the same name. The visual novel branches into three routes - (Stay/Night, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel). This anime aims to cover the first, making it an excellent place to start if you are new to Fate.

Although the series would rise to acclaim with the help of critically received Ufotable works such as Fate/Zero and Fate Unlimited Blade Works. No other attempt has been made to cover the events of Stay/Night and from the perspective of someone who has read the VN, the adaptation is more than satisfactory. 

img220()

Plot
Every few decades, a holy grail war takes place in the city of Fuyuki. The grail chooses seven magic users (masters) who fight alongside their summoned heroic spirits (servants) until only one pair is left. The last remaining master and their servant can have their wish granted by the holy grail.

The story begins when our protagonist Shirou Emiya unexpectedly finds himself involved in the 5th Holy Grail War after being chosen as one of the seven masters and summoning Saber.

Although, the story is about a Battle Royale between pairs of masters and servants, it doesn't just focus on the fighting aspects and instead chooses to dwell deeply into characters and character relationships. Who each servant or master is, what are their goals, personality, etc. As the main duo overcomes different challenges they learn not just about the opponents the are facing but also each other.

The story in the anime is mostly faithful with the Visual Novel except in a 2-3 episode mini arc starting episode 17 where it takes some liberty to change events as they took place in other routes as a subsequent spoiling them, though I would argue the change gives a more fleshed out ending to the involved characters as a result and the spoilers aren't that major so as to ruin the enjoyment of other routes in any way.

Characters
Strong characterization is one of the main selling points of Visual Novels and the anime does very well at translating that here.The way the Visual Novel is written, it chooses to focus on only a small selection of characters per route, as it's meant to be enjoyed as a whole. However I find that Fate Stay/Night has the best mix of the characters it chooses to develop among all three as is given for it being the first route. 

Stay/Night chooses to focus primarily on the duo of Saber and Shirou. Both are multi faceted and rather unique characters, although you may have to spend a bit of time to get to know the deeper truths. The eventual romance which does develop between the two is done naturally and is one of the high points of the show. 

img220()

Atmosphere
Given that the show is from 2006, the artstyle and animation can feel quite dated especially compared to stuff which is out today. But the dialogue heavy nature of the anime helps alleviate some of that burden. The music is also really nice borrowing some themes from the VN as well as adding new ones. Openings and Endings are quite unforgettable too.

The overall feel of the show is fairly light hearted as the route is less darker than the other ones. This helps with the comedy skits and the various hijinks of supporting characters.

Final Thoughts
Before I watched Fate Stay/Night, people used to tell me of horror stories behind it, how it was some sort of Boogieman of bad Visual Novel adaptations, but after having seen more than a fair share of bad VN adaptations, this doesn't even come anywhere close. In fact it is mostly faithful and translates very well from the source to anime in terms of story, feel and characterization. Only parts I would dock points off are for its average to subpar action scenes. 

The community outlook that FSN route should be skipped is fairly preposterous. The fate route develops and explores crucial elements which are not covered in the other routes and just it's relative low art and animation quality compared to the newer adaptations isn't enough to dismiss all its merit. Therefore, I encourage all fate fans old and new to at least give the Deen Stay/Night a chance. You never know what you are missing."
111762,"I originally was going to set out to write something about how I thought season 1 was an enigma to me. And I think I’ll address why I think so to explain why I think second season has been amazing so far.
To be frank I don’t think extremely highly of season 1. This is not to say I think badly of it, otherwise I wouldn’t have finished the series. I thought it was just…average. I know many people think very highly of first season, as judging from MAL and Anilist, but allow me to explain my thoughts. There were always weird things that irritated me about it. Two things that particularly stand out to me were a very poorly crafted protagonist and how the writing just doesn’t seem to fit the anime at times. 

I originally had a pretty big problem with Torhu Honda and I still do, to a lesser extent. Torhu seems infallible for a majority for season 1. She seemed really out of place in an anime with such deep and cleverly designed characters. I think my problem with her resided in the fact that she seems way too simple at first glance. I couldn’t understand why in an anime, filled with characters with complex motivations and back stories, Torhu’s would be so plain. All of her problems didn’t seem like they were presented in a manner that made the viewer care about them. Like the fact that her mom died; of course, I’m going to feel bad that someone’s mom died. It’s human nature, but I don’t feel bad that Torhu Honda’s mom died, I just feel bad that someone’s mom is dead and the child now doesn’t have a mom. I could never attach such emotions to Torhu because she never seemed to feel grievance over the fact. She was always such an upbeat personality that I could associate the feeling of loss with someone so simple, that didn’t look like she cared enough. 

Secondly, I thought the anime’s writing just didn’t fit with the actual show at times. The most frequent case of this happening is when it felt like it just took itself way too seriously. It unironically felt a lot more dramatic than it needed to be at times. Towards the start of first season, it didn’t do a good job of conveying why this scene should be dramatic. Because the characters didn’t have enough build up or story behind them to warrant it. The writing and animation just felt way too over the top at times for the story that was being told. All of these aspects led me to not think as highly as I have of other anime I have watched. Most of the time these things simply occurred because the audience didn’t really have the insight that the writers had while designing this; it almost feels like they forgot this at times. 

My last gripe with first season was the poor integration of the zodiac into the main story at first. I was thinking, there has to be some cool stuff that the zodiac members have to do with their unique abilities? Turns out I was wrong and all that consisted of was, don’t get hugged by the opposite gender. That’s all! This was a disappointment to me at first because I was thinking, what’s the point of this even being in the story to begin with. They could have easily just excluded the zodiac stuff and it would have all been fine. Keep in mind this is what I thought while watching roughly the first half of the show. 

The best question to ask at this point then would probably be, why did you even watch the show then? And the answer is very straight forward: the characters in this show absolutely phenomenal. I really enjoyed how the second half was almost all backstory and character development for the zodiac members. Every character is mindbogglingly unique and complex. What separates this show from others is that whereas some shows have a few characters, usually the main cast, that have real thought and care put into them. Fruits Basket somehow manages to break the trend of quality over quantity. Every character has a deep meaningful backstory explaining how the “Zodiac Curse” affects them and it is something that really helped me understand why the Zodiac is so crucial to this show. The Zodiac isn’t necessarily important because of the physical alterations its grant its members, but rather because it is the mental chain that ties them down. The chain that forces them to carry a deep burden and sadness around with them. In this regard, Fruits Basket is probably the only anime I have watched that has managed to do this. Even non-zodiac members have a significant portion to play in the story. Overall, I have major respect for Fruits Basket to have pulled this off. It’s amazing that essentially all of first season was build up to the true story displayed in second season. 

Fruits Basket second season managed to fix all those things and add so much more that I could have never expected. It’s almost as if I’m watched the redemption arc of a whole show. This show picked itself off the ground and completely shattered the ceiling in regards to my expectations for it. 
Towards the end of first season I was honestly really happy with how it ended. Ending on a note of redemption and eyes towards the future was a really good look and I was excited to see what direction the show was going to take next. I found it funny when I found myself saying out loud, “LETS GOOOOO” when the first episode of second season started. Deep down, I knew I was really excited to see where this was going to go.

The first important thing that second season fixed is Torhu finally getting properly fleshed out. Torhu in the first season kind of reminded me of all the memes made about Katara in The Last Airbender. She talks on and on about one meaningful topic to the point where it loses all semblance of importance for the character. One thing that I am enjoying about Torhu is that her proper integration into the Soma family. Knowing that she is quickly creating lots of friends and enemies inside the family makes me feel that there is potential for a huge climax, seeing as how much set up is going into Torhu interacting with the Soma’s as a group a lot more. They also give Torhu’s immaturity and over the top character a lot more meaning now. Before it always seemed like comedic relief; on occasion it would act as a way for Yuki and Kyo to get their feelings out. However, this season gives Torhu’s personality a real purpose. Only a person such as her is able to truly liberate the Soma family from the curse. Only a person such as her will be able to connect with all of the family members individually. Finally, they finally gave Torhu meaningful flaws. It seemed really inhuman of her in season one to be able to come out of any situation smiling. It was inhuman that she was just never sad. Now we see that there truly has been something eating at her insides this whole time, and I’m excited to see where this leads. Granted this doesn’t really fix everything, however it does make watching her character a lot more enjoyable.

Seconds season also feels like it really understands what it’s trying to be now. It looks like the directors really learned a lot from first season. Some prominent examples are how they don’t feel the need to break up a serious scene with silly comedic relief that breaks the flow and buildup of the scene. The anime really understands that a much darker and serious tone must be employed at times to get the most out of the scene. The comedic relief is done in a much more natural fashion, as it is with Yuki and Haru. It’s not extremely overly dramatic, like characters are not giving long monologues when they are unnecessary. The anime just feels like it ebbs and flows a lot nicer. 

What would this show be without the Zodiac? Second season makes the purpose of the Zodiac and its members absolutely clear. The Zodiac is more or less, an ingenious story telling device. The Zodiac feels most comparable to aberrations from Monogatari. In both situations, the supernatural is more of a way to explore the characters and why they are the way there are, rather than some evil antagonist. Second season builds upon the dynamics that govern the Zodiac members that were established in season one, with the intended purpose being to clarify a lot of plot points that were either not explored in season one or were not immediately clear in season one. Second season has made the purpose and function of the Zodiac as a plot device clear, and through its execution it’s easy to see that the writers did a wonderful job of integrating the Zodiac into their work. 

Finally, something new that I think second season introduces that really makes the whole anime stand out even more so far, is its depiction of childhood. Second Season makes it painfully obvious, even more than season one, just how much of an impact parents can have on their children. It makes it obvious how even the small things that parents do, can shape a child’s development. Second Season aims to not only entertain, but also educate the audience on children’s mental development. Whether it’s Yuki’s story of neglect and mental abuse or it’s Hiro’s story of acceptance and care, Fruits Basket is a story about how children deserve care and affection so that it doesn’t affect them in a terrible way later on in their lives. 
Fruits Basket has quickly become one of my favorite anime. Although it took a while for me to really get into it, I can confidently say I am very happy I did. Even if I only did mention aspects of Fruits Basket’s story, there are a number of other reasons you should give it watch: the animation is stellar, the soundtrack is rich and extremely well composed, and it is quite funny where it counts. Honestly, in the beginning the reason I wrote this came from my love of the show, but it turned in to something else as I kept writing. It frustrated me how people shy away from this show because its seen as a Shogo, as if the label itself makes it seem inferior. I just want people to watch the show for what it is, and not be turned away from what others see it to be. Thank you for reading!"
21701,"Reasons to watch Kuzu no Honkai? I don't have any. Then why watch it? Simply because, it isn't a cliched romantic comedy, albeit, the romantic premise is quite cliche itself, considering the love triangle but apart from that, everything else the series does, makes it stand out from the heaps of garbage of rotten romantic slice of life animes. There are 6 main characters, though the existence of one of them might be debated to be there for just 'comic suffering' purpose. By the time you are done with the first episode, you might question the sanity of the two protagonists or it might even be possible that you question your own sanity for watching something as absurd as Scum's wish. But that's exactly what this show is about, a scum's desire. Faced with unrequited love, their only way to ease their suffering and filling the void is through replacement. Replacing the person you desire with someone else and soliciting each other for sexual pleasure, that thought itself seem highly unthinkable and preposterous, but when emotions become the center of gravity for a plot, the line between realistic and unrealistic vanishes. 

After finishing the second episode, i was left with nothing but intense disgust and animosity at their incomprehensible mentality, but I think that is what the show was aiming for, even if it wasn't, it was the type of feeling one need to feel, because we are watching the show from their own perspectives. By the sixth episode, I actually became interested in what will the characters do next? There is so much self-realization, so many fresh dialogues, that you can notice the characters develop, trying to break themselves from their shells.

Lerche did an awesome job in the visuals, the sexual scenes came in strong, but it never felt like random fanservice, there is pleasure but at the same time there is a repulsiveness for enjoying such scenes. The voice acting was so stunning, it never felt out of place even for once! The melancholy in the voice of the characters, especially of Hanabi's really felt soothing and was perfect with the ambience. The opening and the ending are quite good and the osts are just there when needed, they really get along well with the mood and the tension between the dialogues. In the end, you can see the characters coming to terms with what they did, the change that was brought in their personalities and the decisions they made.

Overall, I totally enjoyed this repulsive at start, compelling in the middle and totally satisfying near the end unique slice of life. A total refreshment and worth watching."
98034,"Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan (Otherwise known as The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.) is a comedic gem, hidden from the eyes of many comedy anime fans. I'll focus this review on both S1 and S2, but TL;DR: Watch Saiki K.

img220()

Story:

It's difficult to rate the story for Saiki K as, well, it doesn't really have one. The main premise is that Kusuo Saiki is a high school kid with an absurd amount of superpowers who just wants to live normally and peacefully, but has so many annoying friends and family members that prevent him from doing so. The comedy throughout the series is fast paced, and always spot on. There wasn't a single scene which I didn't find funny in the whole two seasons I watched (twice).
If we're trying to rate the story, I'll have to give it an 8/10 because, although it's simple, it's super effective and brilliant.


Characters: 

This is where Saiki K shines. Every character is just a trope, but they're so well done and over the top that they're never boring to watch. You have Saiki - the stupidly overpowered main character, Nendou - the super dumb kid, Kaidou - the chuunibyo, Teruhashi - the ""perfect girl"", Mera - the glutton, Yumehara - the hopeless romantic, and so on.
Not only that, the character progression is also brilliant. The development of Saiki's personality towards his ""friends"" is incredibly interesting. The more of Saiki K you watch, the better it gets.
The characters also result in great humour, whether it be Saiki's trademark bored voice (also seen in Koyomi Araragi from Monogatari and Levi from Attack on Titan) or Teruhashi's attempts to make Saiki notice her. They're just so entertaining. 
My rating for characters is obviously going to be 10/10.


Art and Animation:

Fairly cheap, but bright and fitting. Not really much else to say about that. The anime doesn't really need good animation, but the art is honestly fine for this. Nothing bad enough to ruin the anime, nothing good enough to make it stand out. J.C. Staff did okay with this.
I'll rate this 9/10 because there isn't really much to say.


Music:

Again, nothing about the music stood out. It was always fitting to the mood and sounded good. The opening and ending songs were also always fitting (especially OP and ED 4; they were both amazing).
I'll rate this 9/10 as well because again, there isn't really much to say.

Enjoyment:

The enjoyment I had from watching this was off the charts. So many scenes had me in tears, and every time I watched one episode I didn't want to wait to watch the next. Not many other anime have made me as happy as I did watching Saiki K, and honestly I don't regret watching this one bit.
My enjoyment will of course be 10/10.

Overall:

Saiki K will always be one of my favourite comedy anime. It was just so funny and amazing, and I don't know where I'll see something of that level again. Overall, it's 9.2/10, but the reasons it isn't 10/10 are so small that they don't really affect anything.
And again, watch Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan."
18671,"Season 2 of Chunibyo is great... until the latter half. The show starts off strong. Drama unfolds in the latter half, similar to the first season; however, unlike the first season, season 2 ends on an anti-climatic note, and the drama itself was weak.

At the start, Rikka and Yuuta get put in a new situation. Rikka's sister has to move out, leaving Rikka alone. Thus, Rikka moves into with Yuuta's house, and the couple starts living together, tackling everyday issues like a married couple. They get a chance to cement their feelings, and their friends even get involved to discuss Rikka's and Yuuta's love life. We also get great episodes dedicated to the supporting cast. Kyoto Animation manages to make a quiet activity like napping exciting! Nibutani and Sanae get their relationship explored, and their scenes were one of those most heartfelt and wholesome ones in the show.

During the latter half of the show, a love triangle arises between Yuuta, Rikka and Shichimiya. Shichimiya can't decide whether she has affections for Yuuta or not, and she doesn't function as a effective rival for Rikka. Usually a second love interest adds a sense of urgency to a couple confessing their feelings for each other, but Rikka has already made a ""lover's contract"" with Yuuta, so Shichimiya is doomed from the start. Not only that, instead of enhancing the relationship between Rikka and Yuuta, the enfolding drama detracts from it. We get too many episodes focusing on Shichimiya's feelings, while Rikka gets sidelined. Rikka gets some screen time in the second half, but it doesn't make sense.

The theme of chunibyo powers is not used consistently. In the first season, chunibyo represented an escape from reality, growing up, and accepting loss (in the case of Rikka). In the latest one, chunibyo is inversely tied to love. That makes sense, but it is used inconsistently. We see our two female leads lose their powers at some point in time. However, they regain it so quickly, the impact of their loss is never truly felt by the viewer. Speaking of impact, random deus ex machina events also hurt the show.

Random plot events interrupt heartfelt scenes or potential bonding moments. For example, at one point, Rikka and Yuuta organize some alone time to go on a date, and we were supposed to see their relationship advance -- that gets interrupted. Another time, Shichimiya attempts to confront Yuuta about her feelings -- random plot event happens at that moment. Even the climax of the anime gets interrupted by an unrelated, out-of-the-blue event cutting off all suspense and leaving an anti-climatic feel. Even though the execution was weak, KyoAni still gets props for its catchy songs and great animation.

Kyoto Animation did a stellar job with the animation and OP/ED as usual. Fight scenes look epic, with an abundance of special effects, similar to the first season and other KyoAni works like Maid Dragon Kobayashi. The OP and ED are catchy and memorable. The OP syncs with the music nicely, it's cute how Rikka falls down during the character carousel, and gorgeous animation is everywhere. The ED had bass and musical effects that are pleasant to listen to. During the ED, the cast make these funny, cute chunibyo poses.

Conclusion: Chunibyo 2 starts off strong, and we see a budding relationship develop between Rikka and Yuuta. However, the romance drama that develops in the second half features a weak love interest and doesn't have the same payoff that the first season did.

2966,"“Life is either a great adventure or nothing.” ― Helen Keller.

Having a goal in your life is, perhaps, the only way to keep going; otherwise it might be too difficult for one to continue. But, at the same time, finding your aim in life is also not that easy. Kraft Lawrence, the main protagonist of Spice and Wolf, never gives up: he knows what he does and he is not afraid of any difficulties. He is a 25-year-old travelling merchant, who is trying to gather enough money to stop travelling and to start his own shop. One day, at the town of Pasloe, Kraft finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Horo. She introduces herself as the town’s Goddess of harvest, who has kept the lands of Pasloe blessed with good harvest for many years. However, the Pasloe people have forgotten the caring Goddess and now she wants to return to her homeland. The Goddess persuades the series’ protagonist Lawrence to take her with him and the two start a new journey. What awaits our duo and will they be able to reach the homeland of Horo unharmed? Find out the answer by watching Spice and Wolf now.

Adventure has always been one of the most interesting genres; however, it is also very difficult to make a good one. The main problem here is that it might become boring too fast. Spice and Wolf is truly one of the best series in this genre: you will not be able to predict anything, on the contrary, Spice and Wolf will make you relax and then it will dumbfound you. And you know that feeling is amazing, watching a show, where you do not know what might happen in the next episode is truly pleasant. With that being said, I guarantee you that the story of Spice of Wolf is on the level and you will surely like it, but I would not recommend you to marathon this series, to be honest. I also find it important to mention the fact that the anime is unfinished and to know the ending, you will either have to read the novel, or wait for the anime’s continuation, which has not been announced yet. If it does not scare you, you will not have any problems with the story-line.

The animation captures the medieval setting perfectly. Although the anime was made in 2008, I can say that even for 2016 the animation is still beautiful. Everything: fields, market squares, towns, characters’ outfits, and character designs are very beautiful. And it is because of the fact that this anime pays attention to all colors and this alone makes this series that beautiful. But not only the animation, but also the series’ OST helps you to dive into the atmosphere of Spice and Wolf. 

The music in Spice and Wolf is simply splendid. No words will ever describe how beautiful it is. I have never heard an OST that will be as beautiful as in Spice and Wolf, it is something you should listen to, or perhaps get a copy somewhere. The OST does its job and it helps you to appreciate this anime even more. Moreover, the voice actors that took part in this anime did one hell of a job voicing their respective characters. I would recommend you to watch this anime in Japanese, but if you are a big fan of English voice actors, you are free to watch it in English, it is also good, but not as good as the Japanese version.  

As for the characters, Spice and Wolf has also many things to offer. Yes, I will not try to hide the fact that this series has weak supporting characters. But in this series there are only two characters, Horo and Lawrence, Spice and Wolf is only about two characters and all other characters do not mean anything. They exist only to complement Horo and Lawrence. That said, let us discuss Horo  and Lawrence. Horo is the incarnation of every guy's dream girl: she's strong, confident, and smart, but, at the same time, very charming, weak, and feminine. Her character is unique, because in most anime romances, females either depend on men in everything, or are just too independent. Horo is independent, but she also looks like a weak creature that you want to protect. I find it also important to mention that Horo does not deny that she loves Lawrence. Her main goal is, of course, to return to her homeland, but she is ready to give up on what she needs because of the fact that she likes Lawrence. 

Kraft Lawrence, at first, looks like a merchant that only thinks about profit. But after a little while, the viewer understands that Lawrence is an extremely caring individual, who sometimes sacrifices too much. Horo hates it about him, but she also finds his chivalrous conduct attractive. Although, he relies on Horo in terms of protection and sometimes he cannot express his feelings, later on he shows that he is not only ready to protect what is important for him, but also that he is not afraid of showing his true feelings. Lawrence is not just some emotionally numb idiot: he is both strong and able to express his feelings. All in all, Horo’s and Lawrence’s duo is amazing! It is never annoying, it is never boring, you just want them to stay together forever.  

Anyway, Spice and Wolf is a very enjoyable series. Everything about it is enjoyable and you just want it to never end: from extremely well-written story-line, to very interesting characters. As I have already mentioned it, Spice and Wolf is not just some boring romance, yes, it is there, but this series tells a story of two lonely people and there is also a grain of reality in it: one should fight for what they love and want to achieve. And believe me, in Spice and Wolf, both Horo and Lawrence will have to fight for what is precious for them.

All in all, I would recommend this series to any person that likes anime. I simply cannot imagine even one reason for you to not watch Spice and Wolf. Yes, there is one reason, but even if do not have a desire to read the novel, you can always find spoilers on the internet, which I would not recommend you to do, to be honest, but it is up to you, of course. 

I hope that you will enjoy both seasons of Spice and Wolf, its amazing OST, and perhaps you will also read the novel."
114963,"This review will be spoiler free, most of the events I talk about have already been shown in the trailer in some way.

A Whisker Away is a movie that I have wanted to watch ever since Netflix released the trailer for it a few weeks ago (May 28th). From the trailer, the anime looked like an entertaining rom-com with thought-provoking themes relating to personal and social issues. However, I was also skeptical since the writer of A Whisker Away is also responsible for Anohana, which is a show that I was not a big fan of. After watching this movie, I must sadly say that it is everything I hoped it would not be; disappointing and ruined by a poorly paced storyline. 

Story - 5/10
The story follows the character, Miyo Sasaki (her classmates refer to her as Muge), who obtains the ability to transform into a cat by wearing a special mask. Muge fell in love with a boy in her school, Kento Hinode, who does not reciprocate her feelings. However, Muge uses her powers to transform into a cat, which Hinode named Taro, to get closer to and learn more about him. Due to certain reasons (spoilers), Muge visits a land of cats and meets with many more people like her who can transform into cats. 
The movie tells a compelling story during its first hour, especially as it spends time exploring many different personal and social issues that humans face on a daily basis. Themes such as unrequited love, bullying and friendship are all displayed relatively well through the students around Muge. Other themes such as running away from problems and issues relating to families are also explored through the two main characters, Muge and Hinode. 
Despite the well conveyed themes, the problem with the story (or even the movie as a whole) is that it is confused with what it’s trying to be, which caused the last story arc to feel rushed and completely unnecessary. The final major plotline that happens in the movie is when Muge visits the land of the cats, but the issue is that this happens after over one hour into the movie which is way too late to introduce any new storylines in a film that is only 1 hour and 35 minutes long (not including credits). The land with the cats feels like an idea that the creators originally had, but even though the movie changed into something completely different throughout the development cycle, they still decided to use the concept by rushing something random into the last 30 minutes of the runtime. As a result, the island is painfully underdeveloped and the drastic difference in tone creates too big of a discrepancy between the last half hour and the rest of the movie for them to properly fit together. This problem can only be solved if the island is given more development or if it is removed because unfortunately for the movie, a concept that takes up thirty minutes of screen time is too long to be ignored yet too short to benefit the overarching story.

img()

Art - 9/10
The art is absolutely gorgeous, especially the animation and the environmental designs. The animation is full of life and the exaggerated but not totally over-the-top style makes it distinct and memorable. The environments are very well drawn and even though the island of the cats is problematic for the story, its design is nothing but incredible. The only complaint I have is that the animation quality can be inconsistent in some parts.

Sound - 7.5/10
The sound design is pretty good but nothing special. There are a few times when the music did not fully match the tone of the scenes which took me out of the movie for a moment. However, the soundtrack and the voice acting are all solid overall.

Character - 7/10
The characters are all fairly well written and likable, however some minor characters had unfinished character arcs which made the ending of the movie especially unsatisfying.
The two main characters both had a good amount of development and backstory for them to feel like realistic enough characters. Although they are not especially noteworthy characters, they are relatively good and compliments the story effectively. I found that a big problem a lot of people had with Muge’s character is that she is not very relatable since her actions are too creepy, but from what I can tell, she really doesn’t do anything too different from many other portrayals of fictional characters who spy and get close to their crush/people of the opposite gender while in a different physical form in both Western and Eastern entertainment.
The most disappointing character in the movie is without a doubt the antagonist. Throughout the majority of the runtime, he has always been a devil-like character with an ominous presence every time he appears, however, by the end of the movie, he becomes a goofy villain who can be easily beaten by every random person.

Enjoyment - 6.5/10
The first one hour of the movie is very enjoyable and it is also when the characters get the most development. This part of the movie is intriguing from the very beginning and the realistic themes being portrayed through all of the characters allow the story to be quite entertaining. However, the last 30 minutes of the movie completely changes the tone, abandons a lot of these themes and leaves many story arcs unfinished which pretty much took away most of my reasons for enjoying the anime.

Summary
A Whisker Away is a movie that had me hooked at the start, but left me feeling only disappointment when it ended. It attempted to be a realistic depiction of personal and social issues in human lives as well as a cheesy/generic fantasy anime at the same time, but instead it only ended up being a mess of a movie that failed to make two different ideas compatible with each other. I would still recommend watching this movie if you are browsing Netflix with nothing else to watch since it is overall a pleasant enough experience without having to make a big commitment like you would with a show/series."
13125,"I have had the hardest time coming up with writing down articulate thoughts on the subject of Shinsekai Yori. Intrinsically, it's a difficult show to review in an unbiased manner. Either it blew you away with its world building, intrigue, intensity, and suspense or it bored you to death in the first act and you couldn't get back into it. It's a shame if people actually feel like the latter, because I believe that that setup is so necessary to make acts 2 and 3 hit you so much harder. Obviously, I reside in the camp of the former and I'll tell you why. (WARNING: I tried to avoid spoiling anything in the following paragraphs, but I probably slipped up somewhere, so tread lightly if you're worried about spoilers.)

Shinsekai Yori is one of the best, if not the best show, at tackling foreshadowing. Most of the time, it's done in a way so obvious that it's almost painful. The brilliance of Shinsekai Yori is that it is so obvious. I mean, it tells you basically the entire plot in the first 4-7 episodes, but does it in such a way that you never connect the dots until later. It does this so cleverly, by disguising their foreshadowing as plot exposition, diverting your attention so smartly.

Something else that Shinsekai Yori does masterfully is the time skips that occur throughout the story. There are 3 distinct acts in total, of which the later two are time skips, the first being two years and the second being twelve. The first skip is done more smoothly than the second, but that can be expected, since there's a lot less time to fill in with either exposition or inference. The way that they're handled within the story is so well done that you barely even recognize that there's a sudden gap in time. Usually, that'd be a bad thing, but in such an wordy work, it's somewhat helpful to not be bogged down with irrelevant plot lines, like them going through 3 years of school with amnesia. As an aside, the first ending, Wareta Ringo, is among the best songs I've ever heard. In fact, the entire soundtrack is incredible.

Perhaps the greatest feat of Shinsekai Yori, however, is its skill at showing and rarely telling you forthright. There are many instances of this happening throughout the show, where something happens and sometimes you're never told, you're just supposed to have gathered that it has happened. And like I said with the time skips, usually that would be a negative, but in the case of Shinsekai Yori, it's absolutely perfect for the mood of the show. After all, it's a show about intrigue, growing up, and moral ambiguity. 

Probably the only negative that I've really seen regarding Shinsekai Yori, is how dull it is to get into. And it's a fair argument. If you aren't really interested in the deep world building and complex ideas being presented, it can become hard to maintain the level attention that Shinsekai Yori demands. For me, I was absolutely engrossed in the world from episode one, but I understand that that's not how it works for everyone, in which case, this is not the show for you. You have to be prepared to not see much action, but rather, a lot of puzzle pieces to fit together.

I'm not going to touch on the moral questions that Shinsekai Yori raises, since I'd have to delve deep into spoiler territory to discuss, so let it be said that by the end, you won't know who's side you should be on. One thing I will say, is that Shinsekai Yori does a fantastic job at constantly changing who you perceive as the villain of the story, you'll notice that the people who you thought were evil at first are not really all that different from Saki and her friends, only the methods of their approach differ. Shinsekai Yori weaves a wonderful narrative throughout twenty-five episodes, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Anyone who appreciates philosophical, mysterious, thrilling, and coming of age stories will love Shinsekai Yori and perhaps, even if you don't like any of those things, you can still appreciate the narrative greatness of Shinsekai Yori."

Note: TLDR at the very bottom.

Story - 7.5

The World's Finest Assassin is an Isekai anime and much like other Isekai anime I chew up for one-time enjoyment, I didn’t expect much from it. However, The World's Finest Assassin managed to pleasantly surprise me.

A cold-blooded and emotionless man who happen to be the world best assassin in our real world got betrayed by the very organization he worked for and is disposed of. He was then selected by the goddess to be reincarnated in a fantasy medieval world where he have to kill the Hero before he reach a certain age. He was then born in a noble family of Tuatha Dé house where he is named Lugh Tuatha Dé.



Finally, an Isekai where the protagonist is not a NEET, high schooler or a salaryman but an actual skilled person who got summoned to the fantasy world to solve the problem. A goddess with some commonsense but we did see in the short but entertaining cuts about her summoning different people who fail to complete their mission.

The anime can be roughly divided into three arcs. The first arc showcases Lugh growing up, training and meeting a girl who will become his assistant. The second arc is where Lugh saved a group of girls who are being sexually abused and use them to establish his information network. The final arc is the arc where he saves his lover from danger.

For an anime about the assassination, it might feel like the story is slow and we only got to see a couple of assassination scenes but as someone who appreciates intriguing details in my Isekai anime such as Ascendance Of A Bookworm with its details on making things or Log Horizon going over all the guild politic, I enjoyed all the setting up Lugh did to ensure his future assassination go smoothly and ultimately his assassination of the hero. 



Things such as creating a long-range sniper rifle using magic, finding people who have mana to train them so that they can assist him with his assassination and making the information network through his business are all important assets for Lugh career.

Let address the elephant in the room, is this anime another OP power fantasy? Yes and No. Lugh is powerful but some enemies are way more powerful than him as I see in the final episode. However, as an assassin, you never want to fight an enemy head-on and match them fist for fist. Lugh doesn’t do that too, instead, he comes up with clever schemes to fight his enemy.

The story so far is entertaining even though it might not be overly unique but still above all the mass production tier Isekai stories.

Character - 7

Most of the characters traits and character interactions in The World's Finest Assassin are quite interesting.

Lugh was emotional-less in his previous life and vow to be more emotional and human-like in his new life and we see him become more emotional as the story went along. As an assassin, he is still strict and but at the same time caring for his companions. 

It is also nice to see that Lugh no longer blindly follow the order as in the past and investigate the target before he judges if the target should be finished off or not. Unlike other Isekai protagonists, Lugh is a chad who can handle a woman and won’t go running off. Moreover, he has his romantic target set straight instead of beating around the bushes.

I admire the way how Tuatha Dé family raise their child. For a family of assassins both the father, Cian and mother, Esri are loving parents. I like how Cian is strict when he trains Lugh but also funny and loving other times. He also let Lugh decide things for himself than just blindly follow his order. Esri is mostly there for comedy relief and to fuel your milf fantasy.

Female characters fall in love for no valid reason in other Isekai anime but in this anime, everyone has legit reason since they are saved from death or events that are worse than death.





Tarte, Maha and Dia are the supporting characters of this anime and they are not very developed but what is pretty neat is their backstories, each having their tragic circumstances. Tarte backstory is short but pretty messed up. I especially like Maha back story, it is dark, gritty and extremely mess up.

The character backstories may not be much, but they are like adding a cherry on top for the world-building elements. They help us know how to mess up their world can be.

Art & Animation - 7

The art and animation in general look clean and well-drawn with vibrant colours. It will not blow you away but it is a cut above most Isekai anime that were mass-produced.

Character art looks sharp and neatly drawn. There are some really good shots of the character in the first half of the anime. E.g. when Lugh was hiding behind a tree with half the face in the shadow. 



The characters design are good enough to be able to tell which anime the characters are from. I find Lugh and Dia to be less unique, I have seen similar-looking characters in other Isekai anime. E.g. Rio and Celia from Seirei Gensouki.

A minor touch that I like is in the ending song visual which got minor alterations depending on the content of the episode’s story.



Background arts are solid. Cities look believable with background characters doing their own thing, Indoor scenes are decently detailed and populated with objects and sceneries look pretty. There is a minor decline in visual qualities and details in the second half of the anime (e.g. there are streets that look strangely empty when Lugh go around the city with Dia) but it is still pretty solid. 

The most jarring thing in the art and animation department is the CG, most noticeably the horses, the horse carriage and the soldiers which stick out like a sour thumb from the 2D arts.

As a show about an assassin, a lot of the combats ended in one long ranger sniper shot, using poison or other assassination methods, but in scenes where Lugh do hand to hand combat, the choreography is respectable. e.g. the part where Lugh spar with his dad.

Sound - 7

The opening song is lit, no it's a bomb, wait, scratch that it's a nuke. It is an absolute headbanger and the black and white visual for it fantastic. The ending song is an equally good well-made song with its soothing and relaxing melodies. Both songs are going into my playlist. 

Background music is solid with very medieval-ish sounding music and some music sound straight out of a fantasy RPG game. They sound good, compliment the scenes but they are not memorable. I also don’t notice any sound effects to be missing or out of place either.

Voicing actings are also great in this anime with characters having a voice that is suitable for the character’s personality and design. I like how Lugh sound, very calm and analytical. I am also a fan of Dia’s mellow voice and her singing on episode 10 ending is surprising good.



TLDR:
A refreshing story about a capable assassin who got Isekai-ed to a fantasy world with a mission to assassinate a hero. The story is more like a prologue to what is to come in the future."
21058,"Introduction
I am a newbie anime watcher. I started watching anime in 2017 and I have gotten through less than fifty shows at the time of me writing this review. The first two shows I remember watching were Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (up to Season 1 of Stardust Crusaders) and Ganketsuou, an action heavy show and a heavy drama show based off my favorite piece of literature respectively. Upon completing both, I wanted to watch a lighter show for my third show, a romance or a comedy, that would break up the super heavy drama and action that I was used to at this point. 

I don't know why I was drawn to Akagami no Shirayuki-hime (I'm just gonna call it Akagami from now on), but for some reason it interested me. I asked a buddy of mine if it was good, and he gave me a resounding ""yes"" for an answer, making me want to watch it more. So I did...

Two days later I had completed both seasons. This was the first show that I really binged hard on. The reason why was because it was fantastic. It hit every good feeling I could have from a show, and it helped define what kind of shows I really liked. It was wholesome, it wasn't over-dramatic, it didn't have cliches driving it along. It had a great cast of characters, a great couple-dynamic, and a great plot. It, in other words, became my #1 anime, and it still reigns on my list as my #1. 

This show is fantastic, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stellar romantic anime.

A Wholesome Plot
The plot of Akagami is, and some aspects, similar to that of a Disney movie. It has a smooth development and doesn't let cliche things bog it down for the sake of filler. The characters of the show and their relationship with each other makes the story very enjoyable to watch unfold. The plot though is not really one united “arc” per-say in Season 1 (though this does change in Season 2), its more-so a bunch of different stories combined together to make the plot progress, with the main thing unifying all of them being the relationships between the characters developing over time, especially in regards to the two main leads. The plot isn’t really a major focus of the show however, it’s more there to develop the characters along. Yet, it’s still enjoyable to watch unfold.

A Stellar Female Lead
What is there to say about the red-headed protagonist of this show? 

Shirayuki, the red-haired medieval pharmacist and lead of the show, is a prime example of how to do a strong female lead in a shoujo series. She is a kind soul, intelligent, and gets along well with basically everyone she comes in contact with. Now, in most shows with a character like this, the “cute face that cannot do wrong” character type tends to usually become a rug that everyone walks over with no regard. They are kind characters and are very likable, but they aren’t strong and tend to be pushed aside/around quite easily. Worse, if that character ends up being the female lead of a romance show, they usually always have to get bailed out by the male lead when in trouble. Shirayuki though is in the category of “likeable” characters that don’t take crap from people, and are very independent and strong on their own. She is a “get stuff done” kind of character, with many of the problems she encounters in the plot being tackled by her directly and head-on instead of floundering about waiting for the man to come in and take care of it. In-fact, when Zen actually does have to bail her out, it’s because of the fact she exhausted all options and avenues prior to the fact, and it’s more of a “You need a hand?” then a “Don’t you worry your head, I will take care of it all!” deal.

In short, Shirayuki is a female lead who has both a great personality and a very independent mindset when it comes to problem-solving, much more-so than many other female leads in other romance shows

A Great Cast of Characters
There are a lot of characters in this show, and their relationships and interactions with each other propel the story forward. In-fact, the characters of this show and their relationships is one of its strongest points. I can go into depth about all the characters, but I just want to focus on two.

Let’s start with Zen, the main male in this show. He’s royalty, second-in line to the throne, noble up-bringing, etc. Yet, from his first introduction he’s a bit of a rebel and more lax about his duties. He cares more about meeting the people in his country than the essential task of bureaucracy that comes with his role. He kind of starts off with his relaxed state being taken for a “smug prick” personality. Though, he is quickly exposed as the kind of noble who actually gives two craps about the people on his land, and isn’t just a lax arrogant noble. Shirayuki also positively impacts him by getting him to actual go in and tackle the more boring aspects of his job (seeing how she tackles her job) and actually work to be a respectful person in her eyes. Self-improvement for the sake of another is a very common theme in this show, and one that I will gladly support in this media.

Then we have the bestest medieval ninja boy, Obi. Besides being one of my favorite characters in an entertainment medium (not just in anime), Obi is what I describe as the quintessential “wing-man” character. I won’t go into much detail to avoid spoilers since Obi doesn’t appear right away, but Obi is basically a great supporting character. He is humorous and relaxed 90% of the time, but when push comes to shove, he is there to back up his pals, like any great buddy would. If you want to see how that plays out, all I can say at this point is watch the show

I can go further on with the other characters too. I can talk about Mitsuhide, the closest thing to a father-figure in this show. I can talk about Ryu and the mentor-student relationship he has with Shirayuki despite being a little kid. I can talk about Zen and the relationship he has with his brother and how both are contrasted and compared throughout the show. Yet alas, I have a limited word-count and I would be here for a long-time talking about that.

Conclusion
So yes, this show is a great romantic anime. The plot is nice and enjoyable, the relationships are realistic and grow over time, the characters and their interactions are some of the best I have personally seen, and the female lead is one of the better ones in anime.

I skipped out on talking about the romantic parts of this show to avoid spoilers, but I will say that it is well worth watching the show for, and super adorable.

I give this show a “Highly Recommend” and encourage you all to watch it."
2890,"PO PO PO PONYO!!!

The movie that almost drove me to tears just cause of how freaking beautiful it is. First things first, I LOVE ANIMATION! Its immeasurable potential to pump out amazing shit is unrivaled so far, being Ponyo not only an evidence of that, but a whole encapsulation of what makes the medium so appealing to me. Where to begin? Oh yeah, the beginning. The opening scene for Ponyo is the first thing that strikes you like a bullet and shows all one needs to know about the picture. Insanely varied and detailed living creatures roaming the screen as harmonically as the awe-inspiring Deep Sea Ranch playing, definitely one of Joe's finest pieces. So beautifully colored, so accurately portrayed, so incredibly animated; the attention to detail surpasses anything I've ever seen in animation. How much passion can you pour in one scene? Ponyo seems to be fully committed to come up with a proper answer to that. And that all is just from the get go. There are numerous instances in the movie where one will be left wondering how the fuck is it even possible for the movie to exist. I had never, in my long life of anime viewing, stumbled upon something so into the idea of providing people with THE EXPERIENCE. To feel like a child once more, the bliss of earnest discovery, the pure and unadulterated joy of living and experiencing something truly beautiful: that's Ponyo for ya.

One thing I really appreciate about most of Miyazaki's screenplays is how they effortlessly ride on the simplest of premises. Watching two children befriending instantaneously and naively handling their relationship which often results in break-ups followed by immediate reconciliation, it's all too familiar. How far could that familiarity go? Really fucking far, that's it. The world can go to hell, as long these children can meet again thus reestablishing their bond. It's hard to explain how exactly these types of story work. It's innately understood, reaching that part of our brains which concealed whatever ruled our ways during childhood. To amaze both demographics at once, that is what Ghibli does best.

Miyazaki made me happy and grateful for both being alive and being able to experience his artwork. If someone is able to evoke that out of you, hug them to no end. Thanks Miyazaki and crew, I love you guys. 

PS. PONYO RUNNING ON WAVES, HOLY MOLY, I CAN'T EVEN! GOAT SCENE!"
512,"As a child, I probably watched the English version of this over 100 times. ""Soaring"" and ""I'm Gonna Fly"" are precious songs to me, to the extent I felt I'd tear up if I heard them again, and I did. I remember my mother would constantly quote Osono's lines about the pacifier. As odd as it may be to admit, Kiki is a childhood influence of mine; the first character in an anime I looked up to. She partly helped shape my personality as a child, and is a big reason why I talk the way I do to this day. As this child, I was completely changed by the world of Kiki's Delivery Service, and the purity of it's cast and personalities. Somewhere, my old VHS copy is still there, though I cannot play it anymore. Now, I got the chance to sit down and finally take a look at the original Japanese version of this after all these years. The differences are surprising.

Sitting down and watching this film again after all these years felt like sitting down during a reunion with an old friend. As much as I appreciate it, I was making fun of it also while watching it. I was treating this film more like a friend, as embarrassing as that is. Still, the differences are many, as I could not help but notice, considering that the film had been burned into my memory from all those years of watching it. The original is much more quieter. Maybe the Western attention span is that bad it needs more noise in dubs. The kids mention disco's, drink coffee, and at some point Kiki threatens her broom with death. Most surprising of all, is what the English version does with Jiji.

Because of my bias, I can't give this anything lower than a 10. I was too immersed and connected emotionally with it, and still am, that I can't go any lower. Still, all 10 out of 10's feel biased anyways.

Thinking about it now, Kiki's journey of leaving home at 13 to become a successful and independent witch feels a lot more dangerous. This could easily have turned into a dark story, as the fortune teller witch said: a lot can go wrong. Kiki is essentially throwing herself out into the wild city life as a minor and practically homeless. The city she happens to find appears to never have had a witch. She gets crushed that she doesn't feel she belongs, and the thought of failure and starting over in a new city felt hard for her to accept. It's not for certain, though it's implied by Bertha that witches are unfamiliar and more like legends there. Considering that, it's not surprising how everyone is shocked or scared to see Kiki for the most part. Seen as an anomaly, and asking permission to stay by asking random people for some odd reason, she gets outcasted. It gets even more ridiculous. She almost causes a bloody multi-vehicle car accident, evades arrest on broom, and becomes a fugitive. Sitting alone eating a sandwich she took, with her cat, and little money, the situation felt hopeless. If not for Osono, what could have happened? She's not Yabuki Joe, who could probably adapt to a jungle if he had to, though that unsettling feeling of isolation and hopelessness felt harsh to watch.

Not being used to the city life, Kiki even almost gets run over by a car, as she is not used to looking both ways. All she could do at the moment was window shop and wish about material possessions that seemed impossible for her to acquire, and feel frustrated by the stylish clothes of the street kids because she still had not accepted and embraced her weirdness.  She meets a kid named Tombo that seemed as if he was an obsessed stalker that is into witches, though he actually means well. Kiki gets upset with him seeing as though she is very formal, and he isn't. Not only that, he was showing her off as something cool rather than human. After a few more frustrating interactions, she does decide to go to a party of his, despite that she was mad at him. Was she being nice? She was already talking about boyfriends, and looking out the window bored looking a bit envious of the couples passing by the bakery. Why not give him a chance? Regardless, it's also a good way to make friends since she had barely any at all at the time. Then there is Osono, pulling strings in the background for Tombo.

It's interesting now, considering Ubereats exists, that she takes up a flying delivery service. Hopefully this doesn't inspire someone to try to revive and probably ruin this film by modernizing it. The music is elegant and invokes emotions in me. Maybe the main theme repeats too much in the songs, though I was and still am charmed by it. Listening to the bittersweet end of ""On a Clear Day..."" fills me with elegance and makes my mind dance. To me, that's Kiki's theme song. I close my eyes, as it reminds me of my childhood and takes me into the world of this film with imagination. Then I have to pinch myself and remind myself to stop taking cartoons so seriously.

Eventually, Kiki begins to lose confidence and direction in her life. Despite her and Tombo start to bond, she could not accept his friends because the one rich snobby one was among the group. Not only that, she was going through a depressive state; a sort of writers block, though with flying. All she needed was a reason to get her powers back, and she finds something out of misfortune that aids her in this way.

My only complaint is that there is very little closure in the end, despite there is an epilogue. I was left with a wide gap of emptiness from the lack of it. It doesn't feel like it reaches a meaningful conclusion. Not everything needs an answer, though you would think the climax of the film would lead to something more overtly intimate. Despite it all, this film will always stay with me and in my heart. It's become more than a part of my life, but a part of me."

Horror anime has a tendency of looking like a terrible comedy. The execution manages to be sluggish, lacking any oomph in its performance, including a sense of assurance. This goes to make the frightful moments fly over your head, leaving you either expressionless or bored out of your mind. Maybe you are even insulted or purely annoyed. From what I have seen of horror in anime, it's usually mistaken as delivering a gratuitous amount of gore without any substance or direction. Forgot all about a gradual suspenseful build-up, solid character facial expression to deeply nail the emotions. Even the whole sound aspect is simply thrown out of the window, including voice acting, effects, the soundtrack. These things are important for a solid horror experience. If only all of these parts where handled with more care and attention to detail. Thankfully we are not entirely out of luck. Some effective, compelling, brilliantly executed horror exists, even if they are not that many. They handle those aspects mentioned above with passion and proper care. One of them and the most famous is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni franchise.

It's set in a rural village of Hinamizawa, a town frozen in time. Nothing gets in and out, a relatively short place where everyone knows each other, and it's hard to get lost. It got its own set of hierarchy that's quite ancient and dates back hundreds of years, its own traditions and values. Even the family names can be traced back for centuries. One day a new resident, Keiichi Maebara, moves in, easily eases into the community, and makes a circle of close friends. He ends up doing everything together with them. They become really close friends. Keiichi genuinely feels close at home. All his newfound friends are as competitive, energetic, and odd as him. Usually, their group ethics involves playing some strange games that are meant to embarrass the loser—this a typical day for this quirky bunch. Everything is happy-go-lucky until Keiichi finds out one-day that there are darker and disturbing parts to this lively village. This thread leads him to find a more scary and painful incident that has happened. 

Despite all this being fresh in the minds of the villagers. It's like this tragic incident never even took place. Was it all a dream, a nightmare, or even rumors? What's going on in Hinamizawa? Before Keiichi can process the village's sinister goings, the peaceful town is not so peaceful anymore. What's more, despite our cast being all smiles and happy, something is just not what it seems. Trying to dig into what's hiding in might do more harm than good. Unless you value your life, one better pretends nothing out of the ordinary exists and live your life at peace. Even if those horrors will eventually find a place for you someday. It's still better to not invite evil willingly when you have that option available. Otherwise, you will come to deeply regret your actions. But by that point, it will be far too late to go back to simpler and not so painful times.

You are not wrong to call Higurashi a horror, but first and foremost, it's a mystery that will make you feel very dumb. Give you a headache trying to piece together the puzzle that is way more complex than a spider's web. If you try to untangle it, you will find yourself unable to escape before making sense of all the shit that goes on here. Higurashi is split into two portions, the question and answer. The former purpose is to make you wanna rack your brain until it explodes. Simultaneously, the latter feeds you all the answers is not a very direct but understandable way. If you're bright, you might even figure out the answer with just the first arc, but that's doubtful. It's not as easy as it sounds. One of the joys of watching Higurashi for me was to try to piece things together and crack the code of what's going on inside of Hinamizawa and beyond. Spoiler alert: I was utterly lost in my first watch-through.

Why do I label Higurashi a masterpiece and my favorite horror of all time? Well, because it's, as implied, very diverse, deep, and complex. It starts out simple, but you get more confused and wonder if you even have a brain up there with every passing episode. This is a very intelligent story where you need to have your mind on full-throttle. No, It's not EVA and especially not SEL. Higurashi is sprinkled with short story arcs throughout the season. They might seem hazy and loosely tied at first. But every loose thread gets tied exceptionally well in the sequel, blowing your expectations and mind out of the water. This is one of the many reasons that makes Higurashi an absolutely engaging and addictive ride. The story also carries underlying heart-warming themes of friendship and subtle signs of how chaotic the world would be without trust and friendship. How it shows the results the way it affects society is a scary and realistic cut.

I remember watching the anime for the first time, not understanding a thing, then when I watched the answer arc. I was blown away by how much of the mystery was hidden in plain sight. It's a cakewalk once you know the details. Let's leave it at that. There's foreshadowing sprinkled across, hinting at the bigger picture even if it's not clear at first glance. More than that, Higurashi has such a strong emotional impact on me because it explores very delicate touchy-feely topics shared in the real world. Such as being bullied for having a different opinion or ethics, feelings, or the sad urge to commit suicide. You can even see signs of manipulation and psychical and emotional abuse. It goes through how it feels like being betrayed. It doesn't stop there. It touches on many other very offensive elements through both the surroundings and how it affects the character and their mind. Higurashi got a well-written flawed cast of characters that grow throughout the ride. Each of them got a unique and colorful personality that's more than meets the eye.

When it comes to production, it's made by Studio Deen, a not so highly favored studio nowadays. Still, they had their fair share of solid adaptations in the past. Konosuba swiftly comes to mind. Higurashi is no exception to that rule as it's a solid adaptation of Ryuukishi's brilliant visual novel. The author behind this masterpiece. It uses the same idea of Madoka Magica by hiding behind a cute and moe style. I think this option elevates the experience and emotions more. When you suddenly see someone harmless, change at the drop of a hat, the style harmonizes with the person's mood. It's a very satisfying and exciting spectacle that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Well, it might be hit or miss. The reason for that is the bizarre facial expressions Higurashi throws at us where the voice might not always hit the nail on the coffin. Despite so, it has thrilling and many well-executed moments that send chills down your spine several times over. Not to mention, the voice acting is top-notch.

That goes for the sound effect too. I can still hear that utterly maniacal laughter in my head as I am writing this article. I can even clearly hear the brutal sounds of stabbing, blood spurt, and other grotesque bits that make me shake from the fright at the thought of it. While we are on the topic, Higurashi got two masterpieces of opening, and the ending songs are good too. But no one can deny the two opening songs that accurately capture the mood for their respective arc is the one most worth noting for most people. Both are filled to brim with symbolism, foreshadowing, and the lyrics hold such significant meaning. I still slap them on the highest volume to this day. I don't think I will ever get bored of them. Higurashi got a beautiful and soothing insert song as well, titled ""Dear You."" It never fails to make me emotional, and again it holds meaning to what happens in Higurashi.

Never have I ever been on edge on my seat watching horror in anime. Most time, I have only laughed my heart out and become nauseated by the unnecessary gore. Higurashi is one of the only times I have felt the need to have my guard up, possibly hide behind my hands to not get hit by a terrifying moment that makes my heart jump out of my chest. I have never cringed as much nor been utterly terrified to the point I need a break. Watching Higurashi at nighttime is one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Still, I loved the exhilaration it brought to the table. I am not a horror fanatic, yet Higurashi has shown that to not ultimately be the case. To this day, I still visit Hinamizawa when I feel the need to scare myself back to alive again. It never gets old. Those same moments always make me react with genuine emotions. I should note for Higurashi, when it comes to violent and bloody scenes, it doesn't hold anything back and does not shy away from censors. If you can't handle that, then don't step into this place you are sure to regret. Regardless of the amount of praise I can shower upon Higurashi, it's not without flaws unless you don't consider them that. In my eyes, this is a masterpiece, albeit flawed. For others, this might not even fall in the realm of good anime, which I find terribly disappointing personally. 

Higurashi is relatively slow-paced and feels somewhat episodic at times. Unless you got patience, then it might not be for you. But trust me, at a certain point, when all the groundwork is over and done with, it's an absolute blast from start to finish. I love both seasons, but my favorite has to be Higurashi no Naku Kori ni Kai, otherwise known as the answer arc. If you also prefer your shows to have high production value, you might sadly find yourself disappointed. Then again, top-notch art and animation are not be all and end all if you look at a particular anime in 2020 that felt lifeless even with all that. Higurashi does not look terribly poor. Does who got issues with production need to look at the execution and direction, not the flashiness. One thing that's both Higurashi's strength and weakness is the crazy facial expressions we get bombarded with every now and then. Stunningly utilizing these. Studio Deen has made me both terrified for my life to wake up to one of those faces and got me to drown in laughter by how hideous and funny-looking they are. Despite being an anime from 2006, Higurashi offers a distinct and varied background choice. Many look quite solid. Studio deen excels at creating a somber and ominous tone and harmonizing it with a more cute and wholesome vibe. The shift could be instant, but it flows naturally, really shaking you up when it happens.

There's no denying I am biased when it comes to Higurashi. Before, I really fell in love, however. I had tried getting into the show many times without any luck. At some point, when I was more mature, I finally gave it a proper shot and absolutely fell in love the more I watched. There is a manga adaptation for those who don't wanna watch the anime that you will either love or hate, or if you don't wanna go through the incredibly long visual novel. It's seemingly 50-100 hours long. Not everyone will have time for that. I have yet to sit down and read it myself, but I have planned it for it one of these days. I think Higurashi manga, at least, is stunningly adapted. As you would expect, the anime has cut out scenes or changed around events to flow smoothly while animated or make more sense. Let's say you watched Higurashi, would there be a point in reading it? To that, I say absolutely. Reading it is such a more refined, refreshing, and incredible experience. Not only do you get more meat on the bones where anime skimped on, but it's also easier to digest the content at your own pace. The art-style is solid, and trust me when I say the horror moments made me jump from my seat several times over. I implied it earlier that Higurashi is split into question and answer part on the surface. 

If you look into it further, there are in total of four arcs for each of them. Are you interested in reading the manga? This is the order—Onikakushi-Hen, Watanagashi-Hen, Tatarigoroshi-Hen, Himatsubashi-Hen, Meakashi-Hen, Tsumihoroboshi-Hen, Minagoroshi-Hen, Matsuribayashi-Hen. It might seem much at first, but most are less than 20 chapters long. The lengthiest is 35 chapters if I recall correctly. By chance, you mess up and start the anime from the sequel. The order is Question, Answer, Rei and the latest Gou. You can't go wrong with either the anime, but especially the manga is absolutely top-notch good-shit you don't wanna miss out on. Overall, if you're hungry for some horror and mind-blowing mystery, then give Higurashi a watch. If you can look past the low production value, you're sure to have a wonderful and thrilling time. This a must and should be watched at some point in your life. I want to say that this article is both a review for anime and a soft one for manga. In other words, my rating takes both of the adaptations into account. Let me lastly add that if you enjoyed Re:Zero by chance, you're more than likely gonna have a blast with Higurashi."
20657,"What does it take to create a dating SIM which will cause people to laugh and cry, but also touch their hearts? This was a question our main character asked himself, which sparked the beginning of the roller-coaster of laughs we call Saekano.

I’m sure when we were younger you’ve all had dreams and goals you wanted to achieve when you get older. The anime tells the epic adventure it took our MC, Tomoya Aki, to achieve his goal of creating a game, complete with all the girl problems, and sexual harassments he receives each day from his devious co-workers.

While I was scrolling through the notoriously long new anime section of an unnamed website “how to raise a boring girlfriend” caught my eye, then I thought to myself “better take some notes.” At first glance, Saekano looks like an average rom-com anime, and being your normal rom-com lover I decided to give it a try, and let me tell you I was definitely in for a treat. Saekano is one of those anime’s that you just can't get enough of, not a single episode has left me without tears rolling down my face from laughter.

[Story]
The story kicks off on a sunny spring day in which the wind blows the hat off of a fair maiden, which of course Tomoya was there to pick it up for her, and give it back. That event was what inspired Tomoya to make a dating SIM, he also envisioned that that exact event would serve to be a flawless opening scene with the maiden as the main character. And as far as we know the “perfect girl” doesn’t exist, because Tomoya later finds out that in reality, the maiden wasn't very “fair,” in fact, apart from her beauty, she’s just about the most ordinary girl ever. She was so ordinary that Tomoya didn't realize that she was in his class. The plot is centered on our protagonist Tomoya Aki and his associates, the busty, but intelligent Utaha senpai, the flat but ill-mannered Eriri Spencer, and of course the ordinary girl, Katou Megumi. Saekano takes a slow start, as it takes several episodes for Mr. Aki to convince his unwilling companions to aid him in making his game. But after that, the pacing of the anime is quite steady. Sadly, this anime is limited only to 12 episodes, which for me is a definite con, because there could’ve been so much more character, and plot development.

[Characters]
The characters are definitely where the anime excels the most at. Each of the female protagonists, except for Katou, has an ornate, and well-developed backstory with Tomoya. Throughout the plot, the author slowly elaborates more on the characters as if slowly giving us puzzle pieces to give us a better picture. But due to the anime only having 12 episodes, we never really get to see the full potential character development from all the characters.

[Art]
In my opinion, the A-1 pictures did a great job animating this anime. They used vibrant colors that brought out the carefree, and cheerful tone of the show. The animation style reminds me of Nisekoi another successful harem anime. The character designs to me were great, they followed the generic character designs of many harems, and romance animes. Don’t see many cons of this art style unless you dislike the uniqueness of the art style. One thing that stood out to me was the insanely stubby fingers the characters have sometimes, especially while Utaha is typing.

[Sound]
The show had a solid, and well-built soundtrack, with dramatic sounding dramatic scenes, and cheerful music for happy scenes. Not much I can say but the soundtracks were sufficient for the show. Great choices in the voice actor department, what could go wrong with Ai Kayano, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as 2 of your main characters? The OPs and EDs were lighthearted songs that complemented the show’s tone. They were not especially stunning but not crappy.

[Negatives]
As mentioned before several times, my biggest problem with this anime is that it only has 12 episodes, and because of this, we didn’t get to see the full potential of character development the show could’ve given us. Nor get to see a more complete full picture. But with the anime leaving off like this I’m sure that there would be a second or even a third season.

The second thing I had a problem with while watching the anime was the pacing of the, which I mentioned before was a bit too slow in the beginning. But towards the end of the show, the pacing sped up again.

[Enjoyment/ Overall]
Q-What would you happen if you added together with an eccentric rich girl, a beautiful female writer, a hardcore otaku, his musically blessed cousin, and an ordinary girl?

A-You get Blessing Software, as well as one of the most well-made and hilarious rom-com ever.

131518,"Dr. Stone is back, and it’s more of the “sciencey” goodness we have come to enjoy. After the events of the OVA, Senku and gang are venturing out to sea to the other side of the vast world, to try and understand more of the mysterious green light that petrified all of humanity. If you liked the previous seasons of Dr. Stone, there’s no reason to not like this one, as it’s most of the same shenanigans, but just in a different landscape. It continues to have a solid mixture of comedic elements and action elements, and a good amount of meme material to it as well.

If you’ve watched this far into Dr. Stone, there’s a good chance it’s because you’ve found the world fascinating. The restarting of civilization, through creative, and often times, exaggerated use of science was quite an enjoyable premise. The goal of this cour of the series was to take strides in trying to find out who was behind the mysterious green light, and we do get some answers. While the first half of the cour was a bit slow in its buildup, the pacing quickened in the latter half to reveal some exhilarating things, and it progressed the story in quite a solid way.

One thing I’ve always found a bit underwhelming, however, were the visuals. It’s not bad by any means, but it doesn’t really “pop out of the screen”, or have you left in awe by flashy animation. The real strong points of the art are the reaction faces, which are quite expressive to leave you with a little laugh at times. The music still remains decent, especially the opening and ending.

Another thing that has gotten progressively glossed over as the story progressed is the creating of materials. With an increased pace of the story, the time spent on the creation of materials and devices became less and less, which I found made it a bit too “easy” for Senku and the gang to proceed in their mission. However, I also do understand that the story can’t use the same status quos forever, so its focus must change to better advance the plot, and it’s done that well. It’s sort of an exchange of sorts, we see less time spent on science, and more time spent on strategizing on how to defeat enemies, which isn’t inherently a bad thing, I just wish the creating of materials felt more “earned”, rather than just rushing through their creation.

The big strong point of Dr. Stone to me are the characters, and the cast has been quite solid throughout the series. Senku is the ultimate driving force and mastermind behind the creating and strategizing, and the supporting cast around him all play their roles in driving the plot forward and to keep the fans engaged, rather it’s through comedy or suspense. There are quite a few characters that just haven’t done much though, such as Ruri, Taiju, or Yuzuriha, so to say the entire cast is interesting would not be fully accurate.

The first cour of the third season of Dr. Stone has been a solid one, and one focused on exploring a new landscape, which provides a different type of intrigue than previous seasons, but still nails the fundamentals of what made this show popular in the first place, that being its silliness and the occasional tense moment. While there is some sacrificing of the science aspects, it's a trade off for more progression, so take that as you will. Cour two should bring us nothing but more excitement for what is to come in this new world, or as Senku would say, “This is exhilarating.”

2236,"The following assumes familiarity with the reviewed material. Spoilers below.





The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a film that explores the power of love, its limits, the inevitability of time, the importance of clear communication, and the futility of living in the past.

Girl's premise is interesting though not wholly unique (and indeed, the movie is in fact a sequel to the 1966 novel of the same name). Highschooler Makoto gains time-travel powers (which she later finds out are limited) after a particularly terrible day that caps off with her dying by being hit by a train. Inexplicably, she wakes up earlier that ""same"" morning. From here, she uses these abilities to fix mistakes, spend time with her friends (the brash Chiaki and the studious Kousuke), and generally avoid any serious consequences for her actions. The core of her selfish behavior is her desire to remain friends with Chiaki and Kousuke for, well, forever. Her resistance to change is a recurring point, and near the film's halfway point she begins abusing her time travel powers to avoid answering a confession made to her by Chiaki, who asks her out. Here is where things begin to genuinely unravel.

Eventually, in the film's final third, Chiaki is revealed to also be a time traveler albeit one from a distant future. It's a very odd turn for what is up until that point a fairly standard 'teen romance but with some supernatural element' plot, but it ultimately works in the film's favor. Chiaki manages to bail Makoto out of getting Kousuke (and his girlfriend Kaho) nearly killed by the same train that clobbered her earlier in the film. It's only here, at Girl's end, where she begins to really face any consequences for her actions beyond inconvenience and awkwardness.

Makoto and Chiaki only even begin to resolve the tension in their relationship in the film's closing moments, and by then it is inarguably already far too late, but importantly the film still treats these final scenes as cathartic, and they are. Whether or not Chiaki and Makoto can ever actually see each other again is beside the point, the tension between them is resolved, and that chapter of their lives is closed. It's a fascinating alternative to the usual unambiguously happy ending these kinds of films tend to showcase, because the films point it seems, is that, while we can't change what happened in the past, we can control how we react to it, and can control our future going forward. Love is powerful, but even Makoto and Chiaki can't stop the march of the clock forever. After all, ""time waits for no one"" (delivered in charming Engrish) is one of the film's recurring key phrases. Is it a touch fatalistic? Yes, maybe. But it's also liberating, there's no point in trying to constantly repair past mistakes, because ultimately, we all live in the present. 

If this all sounds rather dry or even preachy, it must be emphasized that Girl backs its themes up with visuals that are rarely short of gorgeous. The backgrounds (cobbled together from a number of real life reference-locations throughout Tokyo) are intricate, incredibly well-drawn, and perhaps due to being drawn from actual sources, feel like real spaces. This, combined with solid performances from secondary characters such as Makoto's younger sister, her aunt (who is heavily implied though never outright stated to be the protagonist of the original 1966 Girl Who Leapt Through Time novel), a teacher with a peculiar fashion sense, an aggravated mother of a small child Makoto runs into multiple times and so on, makes the world of the film feel bigger than just the three characters who sit at the center of its plot.

The audio warrants more than a passing nod too. The soundtrack is fantastic--subdued and lilting until it needs to be dramatic and bombastic--as is the voicework, almost every character mentioned thusfar has a specific, unique, voice that is undeniably their own, even minor background characters, and when soundtrack, acting, and visuals come together you get a scene like the one near the end of the film, where Makoto bawls her eyes out in one of the most beautifully-animated cries this viewer has ever seen, sobbing uncontrollably as heavy, luscious strings swell in the soundtrack. 

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a film that does almost everything right. It has no major flaws and in the decade since its release has leant a touch of influence to everything from YuruYuri season finale episode ""The Akari Who Leapt Through Time"" to the similarly-structured and equally amazing Your Name. Truly, it is impossible to not recommend Girl. From someone who doesn't believe in must-sees, it comes damn close."
17074,"Here we are, my pick for the greatest entry in the Monogatari series. While Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari introduce each of the characters and gives viewers a charmingly bizarre introduction to Koyomi and his group of supernatural friends, Second Season pushes these previously established relationships to their emotional brink, digging into what makes each of the fascinating women in Koyomi’s life tick and analyzing what life would be like without some of them, all the while reiterating the magnitude of their impact on Koyomi’s personality and character growth.

If Bakemonogatari is introducing Koyomi as the troubled young perverted protagonist we come to know and love, Second Season is about forcing him into adulthood. Koyomi’s existence as a half-vampire has given him a confidence he can utilize to erase any potentially problematic stakes when solving the woes of his friends in the past few series, but now the stakes are unavoidable. Major villains make themselves present in Second Season and unexpected allies rise up to assist Koyomi in his battles and endeavors. None of the stories go where you expect them to, and the production values are, like always, incredible.

As far as individual story arcs are concerned, there are certainly those that are stronger than others here, but each arc is precariously placed to tell the overarching story of recurring antagonist Nadeko. Many future storylines are set up within Second Season, and each thread is carefully chosen to build towards the expansive future of the franchise. This series more than any other in my opinion fleshes out the supporting cast of the franchise, showcasing the wild characters who exist alongside our own Koyomi Araragi and demonstrating how they affect him and help him to become the person he ultimately needs to be to save the various girls who seek him out for help. My personal favorite arc in the franchise is the final one in this series, Hitagi End, and it cements both Senjougahara and Kaiki as some of the most well-crafted anime characters I've ever encountered.

Simply put, Second Season is Monogatari at its very best. While Bakemonogatari and a few later entries come close, I still to this day hold Monogatari Second Season as the greatest set of stories the series has to offer.

“Regardless of who I was in the past or what I did, I feel like “me” of the present should take responsibility.”

- Yashiro Isana


K-Project is a unique experience. I accidentally found this anime and didn’t really have much hope for it, considering the ratings and stuff, but I was surprised once I finished it—yes, all seasons and movies. I am talking about the entire franchise in this review. It then became my favorite, and here’s why:

Story (100):
Without spoiling anything, K-Project’s story is a mix of mystery, tragedy, friendship, betrayal, sacrifice, identity, and power struggles. It's set in a world where different kings with different supernatural powers lead their clans, and our protagonist, seemingly an ordinary boy, gets involved in their business due to a murder mystery. That’s how our story begins. It might be slow and even confusing at the start, but the little bits of information it gives you along the way serve as important story devices and foreshadow the dark twists of the show, leading up to some of the best moments along with one of the best endings in the anime medium, in my opinion. The lore of kings is very interesting, and the use of the Sword of Damocles is a clever metaphor tied to the kings' powers and responsibilities, adding more depth to the narrative. There are other interesting references and symbolism in the anime as well.


Art/Visuals (100):
Beautiful. Yes, every frame and every scene is so polished. The colorful and fluid animation complements the premise of the show perfectly. The fight scenes are a treat for the eyes. and it gets better especially in the movie and season 2 they go all out. I’d even say this show has visuals on par with the best of KyotoAni and Ufotable. have a look at some of my favorite shots.





Characters (100):
The characters are the best thing about this show. It has a huge cast of characters, and each one of them has a unique personality, motives, and depth. They are all very relatable in one way or another. They feel human. Their flaws, complex dynamics, conflicts, emotional depth, and development bring the anime to life.


Soundtrack (100):
Again, just like the visuals, it has top-tier soundtracks that are perfect for the premise. A few special tracks played during pivotal moments contribute highly to delivering some of the best moments of the show.


Enjoyment (100):
If you are a fan of the genre and you enjoy deep, intricate storytelling, then you are bound to enjoy K-Project.


Overall (100/100):
K-Project is one of the best anime ever created, in my opinion. It’s one of a kind, and you should check it out at least once."
777,"""We ruin the countries we govern and the people in our care. We slaughter our enemies and sacrifice all our allies. We will keep killing till there is nothing left but to destroy ourselves. It will never be enough."" ― ‎Alucard, a.k.a., Владъ Дрьколъ (Vlad Dracula).

Place: The United Kingdom.
Time: The Present Day.

Alucard is a vampire that works for Hellsing, an organization responsible for hunting down vampires in England. For some reason, England is not a safe place anymore, as well as some other countries. More and more vampire attacks are being reported in England. On top of that, one day, Alucard receives an order to destroy a group of vampires in a church. During his mission, he saves a police officer, Seras Victoria, making her his companion and turns her into a vampire. Now, Seras is a part of the Hellsing organization under the command of Integra Wingates Hellsing and the Hellsing organization is to find the culprit that is responsible for vampire attacks in the whole world. What organization is trying to turn England into dust and will the Hellsing organization be able to stop them? Find out the answer now.

Truth be told, the story line of Hellsing Ultimate does not sound intriguing: watching how the most powerful vampire is killing other vampires and humans for 500 minutes cannot be interesting. However, Hellsing also has its philosophy and I must say that it is simply splendid: it is dark and very dramatic. I also would like to mention the fact that Hellsing Ultimate is not like some battle-shounen with overpowered main protagonists; Hellsing Ultimate is different and you will find out why. All I can say is that Hellsing Ultimate is a story about a man, who challenges the most powerful being in the whole world. Whether you will respect him, or hate him is up to you, but their duel is simply epic. Of course, it is not the only focus of this series: Hellsing Ultimate has many things to offer to you that I will, of course, will not mention in my review, so if you want to see an epic action with a grain of philosophy, I guarantee you that you will like the story of Hellsing Ultimate. 

Hellsign Ultimate mostly takes place in Europe, portraying different castles and famous places of interest. Most of the time, the series will show you old castles and spooky villages, and this series will do it so that you will surely remember it. Hellsing Ultimate is truly dark, gruesome, and cruel. But it is not the only good thing about the animation, Hellsing Ultimate has also quite beautiful characters. 

From the first to the fifth episodes the ending of each episode uses various pieces of instrumental music composed by Hayato Matsuo and performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. Episodes VI and VII feature vocal closing themes by Japanese rock group Suilen, titled ""Magnolia"" and ""Shinto-Shite."" Episode VIII has ""When You Start the War, Fight With Arrows, Spears and Swords!"", which was also in the original series. Finally, episode IX features Japanese singer Maon Kurosaki and her song ""Scars."" The music fits the series and I am sure that you will even find some pieces for your collection. By the way, both English and Japanese versions are good, so you are free to watch it in whatever language you want. 


The best part about Hellsing Ultimate is, of course, its characters. There are many characters and I am sure that you will find someone that will be truly interesting for you. Alucard is the main protagonist of the series. He is the most powerful worker of the Hellsing Organization and its the most powerful weapon.  Alucard is no mere vampire; it has been implied that he is the most powerful vampire, he sometimes acts like a soulless creature that kills humans without a single thought; however, as the story line progresses, you will find out how humane this monster is. Seras Victoria is a human that due to some circumstances becomes a vampire. While she does not show enough development at first, she shines in the later episodes: in Hellsing Ultimate her role is mostly to restrain her master’s, Alucard’s, humanity. Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing is another protagonist of the series and the leader of the Hellsing Organization. She is the only protagonist that will annoy you. Not only the anime shows almost nothing about her past, but also her character is annoying as hell. Finally, Alucard’s enemies and the series’ antagonists: they either consist of people who want to kill Alucard in the name of God, or of people who are jealous of him, and, in my opinion, the series antagonists is the strongest part of Hellsing. 

As for enjoyment, I like this series and I rewatch it from time to time. The story of this series is dark and well-written, the animation, for the year it was made in, is breathtaking, the OST and the voice acting make you enjoy thins anime even more. However, there are also flaws. Alucard’s personality is so strong that it makes other characters shrink. Of course, there is Max Montana and he is, perhaps, the only character that is on the level with Alucard, but, in my opinion, there should have been more strong characters. I would not call it a serious flaw, but the fact that this series has weak supporting characters is the only reason why I cannot call this anime a masterpiece.

All in all, Hellsing Ultimate is the series that has both action and philosophy. So, if you like to analyze characters and if you are a fan of spectacular battles, I am sure that Hellsing Ultimate will not disappoint you. To be honest, I cannot think of even one reason for you to not watch this series. Yes, it is long, but it should not be the reason for you to not watch it: take your time and try to understand this series. Without a doubt, it is not a masterpiece, but, in my opinion, this anime deserves its 9/10.

I hope that you will enjoy Hellsing Ultimate as much as I did."
116674,"The Thousand Year Blood War is a story that I have read before, it’s a story that I have re-read even; that’s why in this analysis I aim to not only comment on elements which make bleach a fantastic story, but also comment on what this adaptation does to enhance it.

In the past few years, a prevailing narrative within the community has been that Tite Kubo is an unskilled writer, and by extension, Bleach is a lackluster story. This was a point I never cared to argue against before, however, revisiting the world of soul reapers and magic swords through this anime has made it clear to me that these preconceptions are unsubstantiated, it just takes a little effort to uncover Kubo’s strengths as a writer.

The poems are the first little thing that the team behind this anime adaptation uses to show that they truly understand Kubo’s style.

If you’re a manga reader you might have noticed that every volume begins with a poem which gives a hint to what you are about to see. Not only do these old poems show up to replace the usual episode previews, the care has been taken to include new poems written by Kubo so that each episode can feature one. These poems betray Kubo’s sensibilities and they are the first step to seeing how the writing in Bleach is more like poetry, full of metaphors and symbolism.

One of the most frequent themes of Bleach is that through conflict people can reach an understanding. This is often exemplified through Ichigo and his fights against Aizen, Byakuya, and Ginjo, to name just a few. It’s no surprise that for the final arc of the story this theme would make a return in its most extreme form yet, through the battle between Kenpachi Zaraki and Yachiru Unohana, this is the battle.

This exchange of sadistic sword swinging and murderous maiming maneuvers is in fact the deepest display of affection that this anime has to offer. This duel plays out with enough passion to make me shudder even now after seeing it happen so many times before. The battle delivers scenes unlike anything I have seen from a shounen anime despite it not looking as flashy as what the competition is offering. In moments like these you learn to appreciate the brilliant direction put on display, the choreography, and the sound design, everything coming together to form one of the most memorable scenes of the genera. 

img()

These two characters who are seemingly polar opposites are in fact so perfect for each other that they cannot help but to destroy themselves, the only scars that hurt are the ones they gave each other. The understanding I mentioned earlier reaches its most heightened state in the brief moments before Unohana’s life is taken. The dreamlike image of two skeletons duking it out in battle evokes the meaning of the fight, two people locked in a deadly trance which strips them to their most base forms, unchained from any limit. It’s only after Zaraki awakens that we break away from this imagery. 

All throughout this encounter Unohana has been stronger, more powerful, more agile, but when the battle reaches its climax, they are finally on a level playing field. Their monologues merge into a dialogue, and they achieve a perfect state where they can communicate almost telepathically, simply by exchanging blows. In the end it’s the strength they both sought that gives them their purest moment of bliss and also takes them away from the only person who could match them.

I used to interpret the passion of this fight as two lovers in a self-destructive dance, now through the anime I can also see a motherly love coming from Unohana, her life culminating in this final trial where she gives all she had to awaken the true Kenpachi.

This is the all-encompassing element of Bleach. Sadness embodied.

Every crucial moment of this story has been enveloped by the cold mantle of rain; I don’t even have to name them because I’m sure some have already sprung to your mind. 

To see everything but the rain is to see only the happy moments of life, but sadly not us nor the characters in Bleach can escape the rain forever. Its uncomfortable, it might challenge us, but enduring the rain is what makes us grow. When Ichigo is thrown out of the soul society his entire sense of self is thrown into confusion, it’s only after he can face his past marred by the rain that he can reclaim the symbolic manifestations of his identity: his zanpakuto and the combat pass left with Ikumi. 

img()


Symbolically, fire can be seen as many different things, destruction, growth, purity, rebirth. I find that all of these meanings are represented perfectly within Yamamoto. He is the fire that defeated Yhwach’s army a thousand years ago, the same fire that nurtured the soul society and its Shinigami, and in the end, the fire that burns out without resistance in the face of an overwhelming force. 

Yamamoto’s demise was tragic, his mental fortitude flickering akin to a candle in the wind. He was far from perfect as someone like Mayuri would point out but he was the beacon which guided the Gotei 13, and now that his fire is gone it’s time for a new leader to rise from the ashes of war. Kyoraku’s promotion to head captain was something cleverly foreshadowed by the opening of this anime, and the direction of the anime works towards showing how intertwined his fate is with his old teacher. 

In many ways his opposite, Kyoraku is forced to mature quickly, and pick up the mantle left by his predecessor, but that’s all I can say for now. The future will definitely test Kyoraku again and I will definitely be there to talk about it.

In many ways I feel like the anime is filled with these small gestures of affection towards the original work. The poems, the battle, the rain, the fire. Every tiny thing converges to create a product which pays respect to the source material while also elevating it with a stellar directorial style and solid animation and music.

I’ve been a fan of bleach for so long that I wasn’t sure if the anime could ever surpass my expectations, but I found that it managed to do much more than that, it has returned to me in equal all of the love which I’ve been pouring into it. I don’t have to live in fear of lost happiness because I know, Bleach has come back.

First half was acceptable but not on par with the other cours, however the second half got things back into gear again when we get a little bit of character development for Erina, and an insight on Saiba Jouichiro's past while he was still attending the academy.

At times the show is a little predictable but the way the cooking is presented is still fun and interesting to see, especially with the current arc of the former Elite Ten members and Souma's team fighting against Central in the final few episodes with a lot at stake. One thing I also noticed is that the show is very slideshowy, in the sense that the camera movements are always lateral or horizontal with the same generic shots and very little movement of the characters which is likely to make up for budgetary restraints.

I feel like especially with a cooking show, good animation is important, so it would've been nicer to have some better shots and more insight into how the dishes were specifically made rather than a quick summary at the end of the dish's production and a few shots in between. The first and second seasons did a better job in this respect, though I believe it just depends overall on how much time they are willing to spend on each match that determines how much detail they put into capturing the cooking process which is something I can understand seeing as Shokugeki no Souma is a seasonal one cour release (with the exception of the first season). On a slightly different note, while I understand Souma is supposed to be and is written as a playful / amicable character, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that his personality got a little on my nerves, and this seems to to be more apparent since the third season started, with the more frequent use of the chibi-like characters when ""funny"" moments are occurring. I've taken it with a grain of salt so this isn't too large of an issue in terms of his character writing, however for some people, his character may trigger them depending on how tolerable they are to such personalities.

In this part of the season, we're also being introduced to a bunch of new characters such as the provisional Elite Ten members and the second and third years that attempted the battle royale to win the selection and obtain a spot in the group that have very little depth to them with no explanation as to how they got their spots, apart from the fact that we understand they are skilled at cooking. I'm not sure if this will be expanded on in the following season but they just seem to come and go as opponents the main cast can fight against for plot convenience.

In any case, this is a relatively decent shounen series that despite it's flaws, I do enjoy, and have enjoyed throughout it's entirety as of yet. It's nothing amazing or fantastical in terms of its production values, plot or characters, but it's something that would be appealing to many people that want to just sit back, relax and watch a fun anime."
20745,"After we got down once again with that Demon x Degeneracy in the previous season, I really did have great expectations for High School DxD. High School DxD New was great, so naturally the third time’s gonna be a charm too, right? Well, not so much. To me, High School DxD is the shining example of how to do an ecchi-harem-battle series. The plot and characters coincide with the lewd elements to form something truly enjoyable. This ecchi-harem show sets itself apart from many others by being genuinely engaging with how it tells its story, but it seems as if this season did away with a lot of its previous formula. In the immortalized words of Justine from Persona 5, I say: “Not terrible, but not impressive.”

Once again, Studio TNK takes responsibility for bringing this season to the animated world, and for the last time at that. If anything, I do once again have to appreciate the designs of the main cast, Akeno and Rias in particular. Here, I’d like to take a moment to appreciate their thiccness in this art style. As usual, the fights and ecchi are the main artistic appeals, and they remain basically the same. The fights work, the boobs bounce, and so on and so forth. I haven’t seen much of what Passione will do with the next season, but I’m interested in how they’ll handle it. Hopefully, the designs will retain their appeal from before.

The voices we know all to well return once more, and some newcomers too. Yuki Kaji, Youko Hikasa, Shizuka Itou, Ayana Taketatsu, Kenji Nojima, Risa Taneda, Maaya Uchida, and Ayane Sakura all form the Occult Research Club for this season. Some new characters enter the fray, meaning new talent to introduce. Minami Takahashi voices Kuroka, Takayuki Kondou voices Loki, Shinpachi Tsuji voices Odin, and lastly, Ai Kakuma voices Rossweisse. While this section isn’t very important to the review, I still think it’s good to acknowledge the people who lent their voices to these characters.

It seems as if Vali has appeared now, and he’s used his Divine Dividing ability on the number of main songs we have this time, turning the four songs from New into a normal two songs for BorN. The first one is “BLESS YoUr NAME” by ChouCho. It’s a fine song with standard High School DxD visuals, but it’s nothing really of note compared to the previous three. The ending song, though, is one that rivals the legendary “STUDY x STUDY”, and it’s “Give Me Secret” by StylipS. It’s no wonder this song is so good; it’s made by the exact same group as the first ever ED. While the visuals aren’t as mesmerizing as the strip show from that one, they’re still some pretty nice looking ecchi scenes. Though the music is the one that really carries it. I guess you can also consider “Oppai Dragon no Uta” to be an ending song, and it’s pretty humorous, I guess. It’s nice to hear a male cast member sing an anime song once in a while.

Now, the plot. Huh. Well, I do have to say the beginning of the show is pretty strong. It serves as a nice introduction for what we’re about to face for the rest of the season. We go experience the underworld, and meet new characters, notably Kuroka, Odin, and Loki. This section of the story answers one of my pleas from the previous season, and it’s the lack of Koneko attention. This arc mainly focuses on Koneko and her growth, but it’s not my favorite part of it—I’ll get to that later. Koneko’s backstory is something I’ve been wanting to know for a while, and it’s good that we get to see her character arc like we did Yuuto in the previous season. It’s here that Koneko really warms up to Issei, and that’s nice because A: it’s very cute, and B: Issei has more opportunities for harem shenanigans. We also get some nice Rias ecchi during the first Kuroka fight, and that’s an example of how High School DxD uses such dumb concepts to make its battles unique. Even if you do expect some kind of bizarrely lewd plan to take action, it’s still entertaining to watch, Issei’s motivation while fighting Kokabiel from the last season being a good example. being a good example of how something like that can work. That said, my favorite part about this section is actually what takes place in episode five. Episode five is all about Akeno, and it expounds more on her story and character. This was really the time Akeno became one of my favorite characters on more than just a superficial level. Not just that, but it also functions as a kind of date episode with her and Issei for a part of it, and that’s always nice to see.

I wish this quality of content would have kept up, and that really could have happened if it weren’t for its breakneck pacing. Yes, while the first arc of the show is one that I was very engaged in, it dips right after that. That arc was an engaging introduction and character piece, but it loses most of its strong points when it comes to the actual plot in the latter half. Things get pretty messy, and there are too many things happening too quickly, meaning not enough things are given the proper care or time to really have a proper or important effect on the audience. The characters remain fine for the most part, but the plot developments are unfortunately not that good. In concept, these could have been genuinely good arcs, but the execution is what kills it, and not in the good way. A plot like fighting against the Fallen Angel that Asia saved could be interesting, but it’s not done well in the final product. Not to mention the fact that this season adapts three novels instead of the usual two per season. Hey, it even does them out of order, starting with volume five, volume seven, volume six, and then going completely anime-original for the last three episodes. The fanservice and other fun moments are really the best parts of this section, and that’s not what I’d like to say when it comes to a series like this that builds itself on all the ecchi shots, fight scenes, and genuine moments that it has to offer instead of just banking on the lewd factor on its own.

On a more positive note, Koneko has moved past just being a character reserved for being the loli cat girl that’s strong and gets her clothes ripped a lot. Her past trauma and fears were good to see, the reason being her coming into her own and accepting herself. This theme of acceptance of yourself and past can also be applied to Yuuto’s growth in the previous season, but more relevantly, to Akeno. This season, Akeno had a great character arc, one that built upon the things we learned beforehand thanks to her scene with Issei at the shrine. This theme is enhanced when she not only comes to terms with herself, but the people involved, such as her father. Rossweisse was a fine little addition to finish off the harem, and while she makes the same joke most of the time, I find myself enjoying it out of pity, I guess. After all, the sentiment of your age equalling the number of years you’ve been alone certainly can be a relatable one for some people… Anywho, Irina is also more present this season, which answers another one of my pleas from the previous season. Of course, Xenovia is still here to bring us some funny little ecchi gags, my favorite one being her, Issei, and Asia in the storage room. Gasper is also pretty cute; he’s good to have on the squad. Most surprisingly, Rias has dipped in quality for me. She was my favorite back in season one because she was the onee-san that had the most moments, but my opinion has changed throughout the course of the series. Funny how I started out liking Rias the most, then Yuuto in season two, and now Akeno. Well, it just kinda seems like Rias lost her edge. She just feels too clingy, and while that’s not a necessarily bad thing for her character, the problem is that it becomes the majority of it. This is exacerbated in the final three anime-original episodes that I feel steer her character in a pretty weird direction.

Of the new villain cast, I did find myself liking Kuroka. She reminds me a lot of another anime character called Black Hanekawa in terms of looks, that is to say she’s very attractive. Though, only on the surface, as her personality and her effect on Koneko especially damning, which makes her a compelling force. On the other hand, Diodora Astaroth is forgettable. Again, an interesting concept; he’s the whole reason why Asia was exiled from the church. It would have been super impactful to find out his true intentions despite Asia not regretting her actions and generally kind demeanor, but it just doesn’t work for some reason. Issei’s Boob Telepathy or whatever didn’t have the same effect that the simultaneous pokes, him getting to suckle if he wins, and going berserk on Vali for halving everything. It was fun to see him use Dress Break again, but not much else. Also, I was disappointed that he used a date with Akeno as a catalyst for her power but never actually went on a date with her after he recovered. This just might be a grievance as an Akeno fan, but hey, it’s my review. Loki is pretty good for the canon section he’s a part of. The big fight against Fenrir was a highlight, Issei’s Juggernaut Drive and Vali’s appearance being pretty cool aspects. I do wish he was given more focus and had more of his motivations shown. He’s dangerous, but not that menacing, really, since he doesn’t seem that much of an actual character and more of an evil roadblock for the cast due to his evil antics that are evil.

High School DxD BorN is a bit of a let down compared to what the series has done before. The series is all about how you can combine a heavy-ecchi harem and battle-shonen and make it a genuinely good show that can be enjoyed unironically as a truly good piece of animation. This is just a mediocre sequel that progressively gets less interesting and is saved only by its comedy, ecchi, and characters. I’ve always longed for an ecchi show that can tell a genuinely good story that can be enjoyed for what it is. High School DxD turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, season two being the reason as to why I consider it one of my favorite shows. Season three, though, dropped the ball hard. Sure, it was fun in some aspects, and sure, it had some genuinely great moments sprinkled in, but it just didn’t feel like itself. It’s not even that egregiously bad, so the latter portion isn’t even something ironically fun. Overall, High School DxD BorN is a disappointment, but still one that can be occasionally good like it was last season and the season before. Here’s me hoping season four will be better. I’m now in your care, Studio Passione."

Whenever people think of anime, there's an ingrained impression even today that it's full of giant robots, ninjas, pirates or other crazy and fantastical elements that are, in an oversimplified manner, ""cartoonish."" Even nowadays, there's a communication barrier between those who got into anime and those who didn't. There are certainly many reasons for it, and I won't patronize anyone by assuming that I understand such reasons, but more often than not, anime has impressed me on just how broad a range it has in its thematic variety. Aside from the most common mainstream anime like ""One Piece"" and ""Naruto"", there have also been poignant anime about the neutrality of nature and its cyclical life and death like ""Mushishi"", anime that portray mental illness in a lighthearted fashion like ""Kuuchuu Buranko"", or even anime about the innocence of crossdressing like ""Hourou Musuko"". Furthermore, each anime I mentioned has a very distinct artstyle of its own, so the reasoning of ""I don't like anime artstyle"" never really convinced me either.

Then there's ""Inuyashiki: Last Hero"", an anime that's the equivalent of Pixar's ""Up"" but far more tragic and socially relevant in its tackling of ageism issues in Japan, an anime about a superhero old man.

Based on the manga ""Inuyashiki"" by Hiroya Oku (creator of the popular sci-fi manga, ""Gantz""), the 11 episode seinen anime (anime targeted at adult males) tells the tale of Inuyashiki Ichiro, an old man dying of stomach cancer. He has lost connection with his family and even the world at large, and he feels left behind without any meaningful purpose in life. That is until an accident caused by extraterrestrials that changed his life (and body) forever, along with another teenage kid named Shishigami Hiro. Their body is replaced with a robotic one, and both of them take a different approach to their newfound life and body; Hiro chooses to kill while Ichiro chooses to save lives.

img(

Beyond its ageism issues on the surface, Inuyashiki is also about the human capacity for both good and evil, and how people can sometimes take for granted the life and the time that they are given. There's a very clear duality to both Ichiro and Hiro with both of their viewpoints on life practically mirroring each other. While Ichiro is forgotten by the world at large, including his own wife and children, Hiro still has friends and a family that cares very much about him, not to mention a female classmate who has a crush on him. While Ichiro remains compassionate towards a society that's cold and indifferent towards the elderly like him, Hiro feels that it's logical for someone to only care about his own loved ones and friends while remaining apathetic towards the lives of others. What's similar between them, however, is that they have both lost touch with society long before they became machines; their attempts to heal and kill people are ways that they could feel alive again in their own nihilistic existence.

I haven't read any other work of Hiroya's except his most famous work, Gantz, but it was easy to tell from both Gantz and Inuyashiki that his works are very critical of the Japanese society, or perhaps even humans as a whole and how we are becoming more cold and indifferent towards one another in the digital age. While Gantz deals with this more explicitly by exposing people's hypocrisy and prejudice, Inuyashiki seems like an antithesis to Gantz, showing the humanity that still exists within what seems to be a cruel and uncaring society on the surface. It's almost as if Hiroya was calling out on misanthropic readers who have misinterpreted his works as advocating violence for violence's sake. In fact, other than a yakuza gang that committed heinous acts of violence and assault, most characters in Inuyashiki aren't portrayed as the kind of inhumane monster that Hiro definitely is. No matter how callous or selfish people act in Inuyashiki, Hiro's senseless violence feels far more sadistic every time.

img(

There's an especially disturbing scene in episode 2 where Hiro gradually kills off members of a family while soaking up their emotions and trauma simply to feel alive again. Unlike most violent scenes in mature anime, this particular one feels harder to watch because it's more focused on the emotional pain of the family members that Hiro feeds off of like some junkie, not to mention how the entire murder is slowly drawn out as Hiro forces the father to talk about his feelings in the moment and how he feels about the death of his wife. Needless to say, Hiro is established as a complete monster from the very start, and yet he too is later shown to have people he cares about and protects, whether it's his mother, his childhood bestfriend, Naoyuki Ando, or the girl who has a crush on him, Shion Watanabe, and her grandmother. There's still love buried somewhere beneath this monster, and it's only after his loss of these few connections to the world that he goes off the deep end and goes on a rampage against the entire humanity.

In contrast, Ichiro uses his newfound powers for the betterment of humanity by going around hospitals healing terminal patients, saving people from burning buildings and helping the homeless. While it's easy to simply classify Hiro as the villain and Ichiro the hero, that's oversimplifying these characters, as they are two people trying to find significance in a life that has become meaningless for them, in a world that they feel they no longer belong to. More than just about something shallow like good and evil, Hiroya's works have often been about the contrasting subjects of nihilism and existentialism (though not necessarily existential nihilism). Even though Ichiro actively helps people, his actions are not necessarily altruistic. Rather, much like Hiro, Ichiro admits that he does what he does to feel human, to confirm to himself that he's not just a machine after the alien reconstruction, but someone who still retains empathy, kindness and that feeling of catharsis from seeing cancer patients become well again and reunite with their family happy and in peace.

img(

Something that caught my attention was Hiro's love of manga and manga characters over people. He shows more interest in fictional characters than real people, something that's been prevalent among Japanese youths who value ""virtual girlfriends"" rather than going out and actually find a real partner, thereby partially contributing to the country's decline in population and birthrate. There's this pervasive feeling of disconnect between people in the anime where Hiro's mother was doxed by some kid on the Internet, or the reporters who preyed on the her after she's exposed as the mother to a serial killer, or the students who glorify Hiro as some kind of idol, discussing among themselves how sexy he is in spite of all the horrific acts he has done. Both the author Hiroya and the anime Inuyashiki tread this fine line between the apathy and compassion of people, with both Hiro and Ichirou embracing this duality of humanity. Inuyashiki doesn't paint humanity as entirely malicious or entirely loving. Instead, it tells us that there's an innate goodness in all of us, that there's potential for people to care about one another even if they sometimes need a little reminder from their elders.

Like many anime worth praising, Inuyashiki's opening and closing theme songs are noteworthy as well for their representation of the show's themes. ""My Hero"" by Man with a Mission is an intense battle cry signaling the two protagonists' fight for their place in life, with lyrics like ""Are you losing your way, or are you lost? Where are you going? Tell me, my hero, where are you going? What do I need to end my war?"" Meanwhile, ""Ai Wo Oshiete Kureta Kimi E"" (""To You, Who Taught Me Love"") by Qaijff is a more somber and tranquil song lamenting the appreciation and love one might have wished to give their loved ones while there was still time, while they were still around, featuring lyrics like ""Is there a special person in your life? They're closer to you than you think, but you probably don't see me."" Both songs convey that burning need for connection people have towards the world and their loved ones, even if they're not always willing to admit.

img(

At its core, Inuyashiki is a moving story full of heart and loneliness. There is rarely an episode that doesn't either disturb you with Hiro's violence or make you cry from seeing the people Ichiro has helped and how grateful they are for a new life, just as Ichiro has been given his. It's one of those rare spiritual journeys in anime that reflect on the more profound questions of life rather than simply entertain the viewers. Inuyashiki touches me deeply with its sincerity towards life, and while it could sometimes be heavy-handed in its preaching, it's nonetheless a unique reflection of our place in the world that I wish to see more of in the evergrowing medium of anime. If it's proven anything, it's that there can indeed be an anime out there for everyone, even the despondent elderly who have been neglected and forgotten."
2025,"The story Darker than Black, delivers well on its own premise. A sense of attachment that gives the already sorrow setting a rugged feel to it. The characters fit nicely in the surroundings, where the four members accent each others characteristics graciously. The world itself gives you the feeling that it's balanced which is in complete contrast with the ""main"" character who does not feel balanced at al. Which in turn keeps you interested in what he is doing, notifying you why you should pay attention to him.

The visuals of the show are good, if not great. I've never felt that something is out of place or does not work in how the world is moving. The differences in characteristics when the characters show their true colours feels genuine and gives them a bit more natural feel. A decent amount of background visuals while something is happening in the focus area also makes the world feel real and accents what is happening in the foreground.

The characters individual stories and quirks makes the show worth the watch. Each character has his/her motives and reasons why they move and act. When a character makes a choice or move, eventually you'll understand why or what it is they did. It feels as though there was put a lot of care into the reasoning of a character. Not just for the ""main' character but also every other character in the world. Except there are a few characters where they felt a bit out of place because of their eccentricities. But that can easily be explained by saying ""I don't know enough about the world to understand any and every character that walks around"".

If you have been able to read the whole review I'll leave you with a gift. There are multiple ways to watch a show, you can enjoy the story, the visuals, the characters. But when you see the whole picture that the author is trying to portray it get's it's own personal meaning. Something only you may be able to understand. Or not.

All in all a good watch. I give this show/anime a 84 out of 100. I would even go so far as to say that I would watch it again if enough time has passed and no other anime can keep my interest."

Initially, when I heard about this anime, I wasn't at all that interested in it. I have heard from others that they were very hyped for this series to air, however, nothing about it intrigued me. In my head, I'm thinking, okay a bear doll and a blue-haired AI is going to change the future. I picked it up, because well you know, people say it was good. :) And boy, did it deliver. You could call it love at first glance. This show is amazing in all aspects and I would definitely recommend it to others.

But first, can we admire the artwork? The art and animations are amazing, as expected of Wit Studios, producers of Attack on Titan, and Vinland Saga to name a few. Sometimes the colors are vibrant and attractive and other times it can be the complete opposite. The art is very stunning and the animations are very fluid and smooth. I was actually surprised when I saw the fighting scenes, because it was unexpected from an anime such as this. The fighting sequences were very well done and entertaining to watch too. 

The songs in this anime are top-tier as well. The singing is very nice and it gives a sense of connection to the show because Vivy is the one who sings these songs herself. The songs are very catchy and easy to listen to. That being said, I've already slammed all these songs into my playlist. 

Since the beginning of the show, Vivy has always questioned what it means to pour your heart into something. She wondered what it meant and how she uses that to improve her singing. Ultimately, she begins to learn what it means. She learned that pouring her heart into something meant ""singing along with her memories"". As Vivy made new memories, her audience began to grow, and she started to be happier. Because to her, the heart for humans is what memories are for AIs, a road map of their journey to where they are now. Vivy's 100-year mission has shaped who she is now. All the people she met along the way have made a huge impact on her, and that is what allowed her to truly understand what it means to pour your heart into something and sing on the main stage once and for all.

I'm probably biased towards this anime because I just really enjoy the idea of time travel with Steins;Gate being my favorite anime after all. But I genuinely enjoyed watching this anime. It was very entertaining and kept me hooked with each episode. It can be sad, it can be funny, it can be action-packed, it has it all. If you have nothing better to do, like me, you should give it a try. You never know, this could be your favorite anime."
21428,"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash) is a fascinating morbid take on the issekai genre. The show strays from issekai, almost as if it is meant to poke fun at standards commonly associated with issekai shows. Grimar starts in the middle of a group of adventurers' journey, after they have already formed and speeds through their formation as a flashback so the viewer can concentrate on the important part of the story: the story itself. This was something I really appreciated, because it's very irritating to sit through the characters in the show learning how their world works and meeting other people in it and other world building. Grimgar's speeding through of this mundane part of issekai was greatly appreciated and this new strategy of characters having a decent amount of knowledge about their world before the story starts can be seen in shows today, most notably The Rising of the Shield Hero, which aspects of this show can clearly be seen in. Instead of delusions of grandeur and insanely overpowered main characters with amazing special abilities able to take on any villan they face, Grimgar has a group of adventurers fighting just to survive daily, initially struggling to kill the even the most basic mob, a goblin. The show deviates from other issekai shows further in this scene, in which the main character realizes that the goblin is also struggling for its life, desperate to survive and his group and the goblin's survival are in immediate conflict. As expected, their journey is not an easy one, morally or physically. As a group, they experience heavy loss and grief.
!This is highlighted when their leader dies and another character, the thief, must take his place to lead his group. The grief the characters experience from this death is also unexpectedly realistic, with characters, especially the new leader, unable to come to terms with the death of their comrade, and the new leader conflicted about how he will be leading the group from now on, as he needs to grow into his new role as the group's leader and get his members to move on from their loss as well, while he is still struggling with it himself.!
The characters are also incredibly real, with each character having their own faults and weaknesses due to their personalities which we get to see because the group members all get their own character development and are properly fleshed out, which is very rare to see in an issekai anime. The characters are all different, and this difference leads to a very unique relationship between the characters, with some having difficulty communicating with certain characters, occasionally leading to discord within the group that the characters struggle to resolve. However, when push comes to shove, the characters show their dependence on one another and camaraderie. Their reactions to one another after events occur in the story is also very realistic, with each character dealing with it in his or her own way. The show is a (possibly satirical) masterpiece, plot-wise and was unlike any other show in its genre when it was released, but shows similar have started to rise and have been met with praise (a pun on my example).
I do not consider myself an artistic person, but the artwork for Grimgar was incredible. As I said, I am not a very artistic person, so I cannot quite describe it or identify why I feel this way, but the artwork for Grimgar is truly unlike anything I've ever seen before in any other show and the scenery simply looks magnificent.
Sadly however, likely due to it being such an unconventional and unfamiliar use of the issekai genre, not many people know about it, and likely as a result, it never got a second season. Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is an incredible show that not many people watched, a shame, because they missed out on something really great.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, I hope you enjoyed it! I really hope you consider watching Grimgar, because it's really just a great show that I can't recommend enough and it's one of my favorite anime because of how it subverts most common issekai tropes and still makes itself into a exemplary anime."
20987,"Umaru-Chan has a nice idea, make an Anime that portrays your local gamer quite well...sadly the Main Character is unbearable.

[PREMISE OF THE SHOW:]()
There is not much to say about Umaru-Chan's story, that's quite understandable for a SOL Anime and this does not mean that the show can be bad. SOL shows rely on their character cast and gimmicks. If the show has a bad cast and doesn't try to stand out then why even bother?

Now back to Umaru-Chan. She is a High School student who shows herself as ""Elegant"" and ""Mature"" and even to a point of being inept at Technology...this is all a charade her true form, and I do mean form, is that a of a annoying Chibi rat with a hamster attire.

The show tries to potray a ""Gamer"" and how they would behave in real life and in their gamer cave. To be honest with you, I believe that this show did a better job showing the true gamer moments. Though the Main Character (Umaru-Chan) is the most annoying creature ever making the show very unreletable and not even slightly enjoyable.




[CHARACTERS:]()
So I already talked about Umaru-Chan. She is a High School student who hides her ""Gamer"" identity, at school she is perfection but at her house she is the opposite with her crying, whining, and sheer mess of a life style. This character is one of the most annoying ones I saw, she shows no remorse to the mental state of the people around her, she wants something so she gets that something with the power of tears. Her portrayal of a ""Gamer"", as I said numerous times, is quite decent (to a degree), her wasting her time away in games and buying a bunch of collectibles is quite true. The part that starts falling apart is when she goes on her fits of crying and rage when she doesn't get her Gamer Fuel (Cola and Crisps). This aspect of the character is really off putting and just makes you look at ther and say ""What a spoiled brat"".

Pretty much everyone else in the show is a decent character though. Each and every one of them have their unique quirks. 
The brother is what you would call ""Normie"", he doesn't know much about Vidya Geamz and doesn't care that much, he also is the one responsible for Umaru-Chan and her luxurious life style.

Sylphynford is quite energetic, she is the rival to Umaru-Chan gamer life. She acts like a nice lady but is quite dumb to say the least. If I'm to be honest with you if she was the Main Character I would probably enjoy the show much more. This is something I can get behind, an Energetic and less annoying version of Umaru.

Nana Ebina, best girl of the show, the main reason I haven't dropped it.
She is quite shy, she also lives in the same apartment block as Umaru. She is the nicest human in the whole show. She tries her best ot make everyone have fun but kinda struggles due to he intense shy behaviour. She doesn't know anything at all the Life of A Gamer but despite that she still manages to be one of the best.

Kirie Motoba, VERY shy. She has a gaze that people would call ""Deadly"". People avoid her but she is quite a nice person.
In the show she swears to protect Umaru-Chan's Chibi transformation. She will go to great lengths to satisfy the needs of the monster lurking in the house that is Umaru-Chan. Quite a decent character if you ask me though her over attached personality kind of makes her not the best.




[ART/ANIMATION:]()
Umaru-Chan has quite the average animation, its the usual smooth and yet sometimes choppy due to budget kind of thing we see from a lot of SOL shows. Though the art style does looks quite neat.
The art style is nice and vibrant which makes us feel more energetic like the gamers we are.




[MUSIC:]()
The OP is....quite catchy actually. It has Umaru's high pitched voice yeah but the beat and lyrics sound actually really good. I've been listening to it a few times.
The ED on the other hand...well it sounds...decent I suppose. Nothing that unique and quite forgetable. Its much slower compared to the OP and has normal vocals from Umaru and the rest of the cast but still, just not as catchy as the fast paced OP.




[OVERALL OPINION:]()
Himouto! Umaru-Chan is a show centered around the Otaku culture and more on the ""Gamer"" aspect. Its portrayal is decent to a degree, at least in my opinion. Her addiction to playing games and collecting items is very true to me. But the part that really throws me off is the incredibly annyoing main. She cries and cries and rages a second can't pass without her crying or raging. If they toned down that aspect then I believe this show would've been a 6.8/10."

[Fantasy as a genre](https://anilist.co/search/anime/Fantasy) has become something of a crutch over the years. What was once a banquet of ingenuity and a feast for the imagination full of wonder, magic, and otherwordly creatures, has now become nothing more than a shadow of its former self. Too many stories barely nibble around the edges of the genre's potential and serve the exact same old, reheated, and lukewarm concepts to the viewers over and over again.

However, it is not all doom and gloom. [Even though the number of bland, monotonous, and cookie-cutter products labelling themselves as fantastical is constantly growing](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Isekai), there is still hope for the genre.

This is precisely where Dungeon Meshi comes into play, as it repeatedly demonstrates how much flavour the fantasy genre has within its insides and how delicious its content can be if you give it enough attention, care and time. Though, on the surface, the show seems like your average, run-of-the-mill, isekai-esque mishmash of ingredients with no interesting tricks or twists up its sleeves, we quickly realise that is not the case here. There is much more to it beneath its unassuming appearance and rough texture.



It is the very foundation of the anime that is its most delectable feature by far. Dungeon Meshi does not shy away from its [Tolkien-inspired roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highfantasy), [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons%26Dragons)-like backdrop, and [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playingvideogame)-esque framework. Instead, it displays them proudly like a chef boasting [a Michelin star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MichelinGuide). However, rather than relying on the worn-out, well-known, and more-than-obvious tropes and concepts to do the trick without doing anything noteworthy, it thinks outside the (lunch)box in a delightfully fresh and spicy manner.

You see, my dear reader, [as far as other stories are concerned](https://anilist.co/search/anime?genres=Dungeon), they very sporadically (or never) explore and examine the ins and outs of the ancient, monster-riddled monuments. Typically, these places are merely used as grounds for scavaging precious loot from bygone civilisations, exterminating mythical monsters, or exploring for the thrill of it—nothing more. Sure, we might get a lick of their backstory, learning how they came to be and what they were in the past, but this is often done in a shallow, sterilised, and undercooked manner that produces more questions than answers. ""Dungeons are just dungeons, as simple as that"" is the conclusion many come to. But is that really all there is to them? Nope, not at all. Even the dullest, dreariest, and dumbest of ruins can be successfully transmuted into magical, fascinating strongholds filled to the brim with intoxicating mysteries, effervescent corridors, and lavish surroundings that will punch you in the gut and leave you hungry for more.

So, how does Dungeon Meshi dish up the secrets of these ancient mazes? That is quite simple, really: by having its protagonists chow down on the fantastical beings and animals they slay along the way! Yes, that is the entire premise of the series. It might sound silly, gimmicky even, but it is surprisingly not just that. We are not merely supplied with 20 or so episodes of non-stop monster munching with nothing of substance sandwiched in between. As unique as it sounds, the premise alone would not make the anime this entertaining, endearing, and enchanting. Thankfully, the mere act of slaying otherworldly organisms and transforming their bodies into gourmet dishes is just the appetiser. There is a whole lot more on the menu.

The real secret sauce is the show's mouth-watering, hunger-producing knack for breathing life into its setting—whenever the characters reach a new layer of the dungeon, they are greeted with a completely unique climate, atmosphere, and vegetation. Early on, they wander through cosy, welcoming and rather unassuming environments that seem harmless at first glance. For instance, one of the initial levels is entirely comprised of trees and nature-inspired enemies. Although it is still part of the titular building and should not be underestimated, the way it looks does not instil a sense of danger within us just yet. In a way, we can tell we are merely stuffing our faces with an easily digestible lunch, waiting for the main course to burst onto the scene and spice things up. Soon, our wishes come to fruition; the further we descend, the harsher, more vicious, and increasingly exciting the wretched monument becomes. One level is dominated by bodies of water full of aquatic enemies that force the protagonists to cook up creative solutions to deal with these obstacles. There is a castle level packed with haunted paintings, treasure monsters, and moving armour, where even a single piece of furniture could be a trap waiting to bite. Then there is a gigantic ghost town oozing with eerieness and uneasiness. There is even a level completely covered in snow and ice, which will surely send a shiver down your spine—both figuratively and literally.

With that said, it is not just the dungeon's multi-layered structure that made me fall head over heels in love with it; many smaller elements add even more flavour to the structure, thus making it feel much more lived-in than it looks. For example, plenty of spots are created to allow adventurers to rest, restock and reorganise their freshly obtained loot. In a place bustling with people of different kinds and backgrounds, it only makes sense that they set up campgrounds to better prepare themselves for the lower levels or trade with others for food, money, or equipment they may be in dire need of. It is an extremely trivial and insignificant detail, yes, but it is tough not to appreciate such cool features. 

Additionally, every nook and cranny of the dungeon is home to inhabitants who are as different as apples and oranges. Monster A lives only on Level X, Monster B is found exclusively on Level Y, and Monster C only roams the depths of Level Z—this simple concept creates a habitat that feels self-sustaining, self-developing and harmoniously cohesive. While a lot of tales toss the fiercest monsters into the lower levels of their respective ancient constructions, they rarely chew on the consequences of these creatures' presence. In Dungeon Meshi, the absence of a smaller fry leads to a shortage of medium-sized monsters, which might force the bigger beasts to stray into other parts of the labyrinth in search of food. I wholeheartedly adore this detail because it subtly and intriguingly mirrors real-life food chains and represents how an organic animal kingdom operates. When a predator notices its usual prey is scarce, it expands its hunting grounds in search of other means of nutrition. It is as logical as it is satisfying, and I am all for it.

All of this makes the ecosystem seem tangible and realistic, without doing anything out of the ordinary. Yes, in a vacuum, these elements might not seem that impressive, but if you take a step back and look at the entire picture, you will swiftly realise that without them, the dungeon—the star of this cooking show-like narrative—would be a rather uninteresting, drab and boring location. But hey, a fantastic foundation like this is only a part of what makes this series as full-bodied as it is.

webm(https://i.imgur.com/c9PfWd7.mp4)

So, what about the plot? What is simmering beneath the wacky premise? Well, like I mentioned earlier, eating monsters and exploring the dungeon are just parts of the storyline. In a way, they are the ingredients of the anime's body that put it on the map and set it apart from the competition. To be honest, the plot starts off rather slowly, like a pot warming up on a low flame. We get to know the characters, understand the situation they are in, learn about their goals, and see how they plan to tackle them. The episodes go by, and they tend to follow the same formula of goofing around, fighting, and cooking with some variations in the actual plot progression.

Nevertheless, this somewhat playful facade quickly melts away, and the show begins serving us genuinely impactful content—both emotionally and conceptually. Suddenly, we are not just watching a fantasy rendition of [MasterChef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterChef), but a thrilling quest to uncover the mysteries surrounding the place, its creators, and what can be done to keep it in check, while trying to save [one of the main characters' companions from the grisly fate they suffered at the hands of a red dragon](https://anilist.co/character/130508/Falin-Thorden). This massive change in tone and vibe may leave some viewers gobsmacked and be incredibly confusing to others, but, all things considered, it is quintessential to keeping the series excitingly fresh and introducing tangible stakes into the story at hand. For all intents and purposes, these moments of heightened seriousness and intensity not only allow the viewers to savour the setting and the various concepts that populate it in a slightly different, richer coating but also add much more gravitas to everything that occurs on the screen. While yes, Dungeon Meshi contains a few pet peeves of mine like healing and resurrection magic, they are not as disruptive and detrimental to the experience as they initially may seem, as there is a lot more nuance to the whole magic system. Healing actually hurts, and being brought back from the dead has its own set of consequences and drawbacks that depend on a plethora of circumstances. Overall, the show triumphantly finds its emotional footing, and it promptly engrosses you in the story it aims to tell—it balances light-hearted charm with darker, more serious moments in a way that is quite sensational and sparkling.

However, I feel like the series' plot would not work as well as it does if the characters did not carry it on their backs the same way skilled chefs are able to bring out the best in their kitchen team. [Laios](https://anilist.co/character/126818/Laios-Thorden), [Marcille](https://anilist.co/character/127292/Marcille-Donato), [Chilchuck](https://anilist.co/character/130509/Chilchuck-Tims) and [Senshi](https://anilist.co/character/127689/Senshi) each bring something unique to the table and are fully-fleshed individuals with their own quirks, easily distinguishable personalities, backstories and motivations. While they may start off as a walking-talking collection of tropes or gimmicky characteristics, as time goes on, Dungeon Meshi makes sure that they all get their moments to shine and develop into authentic and relatable people. Sooner rather than later, the characters stop being just a bunch of loveable meatheads and become flesh and blood. You immediately become attached to them, cheerfully following their antics, appreciating their squeaky-clean chemistry, and feeling like you are a part of this family-like group of flawed people who care greatly about each other. It is that warmth that really pulls you in and does not let go. Much like a hearty campfire and a homey meal that relaxes your body after a challenging trek, these seemingly mundane characters and their everyday adventures are what truly make this feel so cosy, comfy and comforting. They are what makes Delicious in Dungeon really delicious.

Naturally, a great narrative deserves to have only top-shelf production values at its disposal, and Dungeon Meshi's visuals and soundtrack definitely fit those criteria.

When it comes to the various tracks that inhabit the scenes, they fulfil their role rather well. Sure, there might not be any standout songs in my eyes, but none of them are ill-fitting or distracting either. [The opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=602zt9l3Yk) [themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asyT-N1Ip70) are slow, sweet, and deliberate, which perfectly embodies the sense of friendliness, companionship, and love the cast of characters radiates with. On the flip side, the endings are either cheerful and celebratory [(the first half)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jio17jg980) or sombre, melancholic, and oddly nostalgic [(the second half)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uba6oz7AC8), setting the mood just right. Lastly, the various insert songs we hear over the course of the show's run give off a strong fantasy vibe that really nails the tone at every turn. In other words, the soundtrack is sweet, inoffensive, and does its job quite nicely.

On the other hand, the visuals are where all the juices are, and they could not be better. The colour palette is downright gorgeous, with a myriad of vibrant, warm, soft, and almost pastel-like hues that immediately and effortlessly immerse you in the vast, glamorous world of magic, monsters, and meals. The same applies to the art style. Though it may seem quite mismatched or generic at first, it uses its straightforward, fascinating lines and designs to produce some genuinely striking imagery. The background art is gorgeous to look at, and every single centimetre of the dungeon's structure oozes with personality and life. The monsters' designs are compelling and eye-catching, the various locations spread throughout the dungeon are full of this majestic, adventurous atmosphere, and the character designs are instantly recognisable and memorable.

Of course, the animation is what ties all of it together, and it is genuinely competent on all fronts. It is fluid and expressive to such a degree that even the most mundane and action-deprived scenes are somehow a treat to watch. Additionally, the camera work is wonderfully dynamic whenever a situation calls for it, the editing does not allow for even a second of boredom to appear, and the lightning further enhances the ambience of the eerie dungeon. All in all, each component of the visuals comes together to produce some truly amazing, screenshot-worthy shots and scenes and they make the already comforting experience that much more worthwhile and exceptional.



That was a mouthful, but I hope my ramblings at least sparked your interest in the show or allowed you to look at it with a fresh perspective in mind. There is a lot to love and admire about Dungeon Meshi. Certainly, it is not perfect, but the elements that are praiseworthy, amazing and entertaining fire on all burners, and provide us with a hearty helping of whimsical, heartwarming, and nutritious content that will stick with you for years to come. You can feel with every fibre of your being that it is made with love, talent and passion, and not churned out like yet another mass-produced slop that we see every single season.

In a nutshell, Dungeon Meshi is a genuinely sweet and charming surprise I did not expect to love to such a degree. From the phenomenal worldbuilding seen in the dungeon's layout, ecosystem and foodchain to the joyful, wholesome and endearing relationships and interactions between the characters, this series time and time proves that confidence is key, and even the most unassuming of textures can reveal a wonderful, one-of-a-kind flavour when you are willing to dig in. It is an incredibly lovely experience, and you should have a bite as well.

Bon Appetit!

If I had to describe Gamers! in one word, I would say “mess”. Not a mess as in that the anime is bad, but a mess in the way that ties the story together and progresses it. Not a ‘beautiful mess’ per se, but you get my point. If you’ve heard about this anime on Reddit, YouTube, etc. before reading this review, you probably already know that those who’ve watched it frequently call it “Misunderstandings: The Anime”. They aren’t exactly wrong. While romance anime, and anime in general, is known for the ‘misunderstandings’, Gamers! takes it to the far end. While some might find the misunderstandings annoying and get turned off from watching by them, they make the anime interesting. While it can be extreme, the misunderstandings progress the plot and create many humorous situations. Gamers! can be an annoying anime to watch, but the annoyances don’t make it a bad one.
img1000()
Gamers! is only nominally about gaming, while mostly being about relationship trouble and the ‘misunderstandings’ (as to be expected from a rom-com anime). It stars Amano Keita, a ‘loner gamer’ who loves games for their enjoyment value. The other main characters include: Tendou Karen, the standard top-of-the-class blonde girl who is the president of the school’s ‘Game Club’ who tries to get Amano to join; Uehara Tasuku, a ‘reformed gamer’ who still likes to play games but gave up being a ‘nerd’ in order to fit in more; Aguri, who is Tasuku’s girlfriend and doesn’t play games; Hoshinomori Chiaki, who is very like Amano, but has a very different philosophy when it comes to games; and Hoshinomori Konoha, who is Chiaki’s sister and is mostly relevant in the latter half of the anime. Together, these five (Chiaki’s sister is not a part) form the ‘love pentagon’, or rather, make one up inside their head. All of these characters are unique, despite the tropes that they convey. Due to the way the anime tells its story, if you don’t like the characters, you probably should drop the anime.
img1000()
Although they can be very annoying, the misunderstandings are ultimately what make Gamers! interesting. If it was just a standard harem anime where all girls had a crush on Amano, Gamers! would just be cookie-cutter and boring. The added misinterpretations and mix-ups are what make Gamers! its own anime, and are not as bad as some people on Reddit might imply. The confusion that all of the characters have are oddly familiar, and will probably remind of you of whatever misunderstands you had while in high school.
img1000()
Gamers! isn’t anything ground-breaking, but it’s worth a watch. If the misunderstandings are not that annoying to you, then you will hopefully see that it’s what makes the anime good. The only sad part about it is that the Light Novel series that it’s based on has only been officially translated into German, making it near impossible for those who don’t know Japanese to continue with the series after the anime ends."
131942,"I was originally planning on waiting for the end of Stone Ocean to release so I could make a review but now seeing it be split into different segments on the site, I thought now would be a good time to share my thoughts on this cour. I did read the manga prior to the anime so my thoughts may be different than some people but regardless my views are pretty consistent with both. There is a lot I want to cover so I will try to summarize everything to the best of my ability.


Like every part of Jojo, Hirohiko Araki throws us in a quite bizarre direction. This time we are following the daughter of Jotaro Kujo, Jolyne Cujoh, as she gets thrown into prison for being framed for a DUI murder. She then gets sent a broken piece of a stand arrow by her father and then the events of Stone Ocean start to take place. Something that I will mention here is that this story still follows the ""villain of the week"" format that some love and some despise for respectable reasons. Although this way of storytelling doesn't take long to get old, Araki presents plenty of unique encounters in this part to make it refreshing and also engaging. Moving onward, this part has the best hook compared to all the parts that have come prior with that being Jotaro's death. 
When I first read the story and experienced it again in the anime, I was completely astonished to see one of the most beloved characters in the series get killed off at the beginning of the story and right in front of his daughter. That entire scuffle leads right into one of Stone Ocean's main plots which is Jolyne's journey to save her father. Definitely one of the strongest starts to any Jojo part and I think the anime adapted perfectly. Something else I appreciate is that they introduce the main antagonist early on instead of halfway through the story like some of the other parts do. It's a nice change of pace that Araki should've done more often.



Most of the characters and what they showed in the 12 episodes were solid at best. The clear standout of the cast is Jolyne herself showing why she deserves to be the main character which sometimes that line can be blurred in other parts. Jolyne's personality and desire to escape gives a lot of life to this part. The main side characters are Ermes who was the first prisoner Jolyne met and Foo Fighters (F.F.) who is a colony of plankton and basically a Stand (this is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure after all). When I first read the manga, I didn't really enjoy either of these characters but on my watch of the anime they both warmed up to me a little with their unique personalities. Still nothing special for me, however. 
The other important side characters are Emporio who is quick to be allied with Jolyne, Weather Report, an ally of Emporio with a lack of memory, and Anasui who is also an ally of Emporio and will be more present later in the story. To me, the cast of the main characters is good but it still doesn't compare to the groups that were presented in parts 3-5 for me. Enrico Pucci is the main antagonist of the part and he is a priest who is a loyal follower/friend of DIO. Not much to say other than that he has had a very intriguing start to his character so far. One of the few characters in Jojo who has interested me the second they appeared.



The graphical side of Stone Ocean was pretty consistent with some dips here and there. Overall, it is very similar to other parts which is a good thing. In my eyes, David Production seemed to go for an art style that could be placed right between DIU and GW because similarities of each can be seen throughout every scene. If I had to choose, it's definitely closer to part 5. The animation definitely was weird here and there. As I stated already the animation was mostly consistent with other parts but the ugly use of CGI and inconsistent drawing at some parts would make it difficult to make an argument saying that it's an upgrade. Bad moments with CGI are Lang Rangler's movement and the random use of it with Whitesnake during times is a turn-off. I typically don't have an issue with CGI, but if it doesn't fit with the scene and the background then I have a problem with it. Maybe Netflix rushing David Production could be a reason behind this? However, I'm still not disappointed with the quality we were given because I still find it good.



Not much to mention here other than Yugo Kanno absolutely kills it once again. My standout themes so far are Jolyne and Weather Report's themes. I guess I'll mention here that I think the opening is also a bop but not as good as some of the other openings.


-A lot of the stands are good in this part but some of them feel so bland and I can't explain why
-NETFLIX WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
-I appreciate the pacing is still consistent with the other anime parts. Jojo being very fast or going back to Stardust Crusaders pacing would be a crime.
-I HATE NETFLIX
-Perfect voice actor choices for all the characters
-NETFLIX BETTER NOT RUIN PART 7
-Episode 12 had a solid ending and it was good to leave us on that conclusive note rather than a cliffhanger.


For what we were given in this batch of episodes, I would say there is minimal to complain about. We witnessed an intriguing start to a well-developed story so far, met a new cast who is solid and will be even better in the future, and beautiful art and animation here and there. It does suck that this release schedule may be one of the worst in anime history but that doesn't take away the quality we were given at the start of this current bizarre adventure. 

Now if there is one last thing I must say, we are all getting closer to heaven..."

[Season 4](https://anilist.co/review/13414) 

(This is the last part of a series of videos and reviews called The Decline of My Hero Academy. If you only want a review of Heroes Rising, stop at the ""The Decline of My Hero Academy Conclusion"" section.)

Heroes Rising blew my mind because it’s kind of the opposite of the first one. Whereas movie 1 looked horrendous and like they threw most of it together in a month, movie 2 looks…good. Especially compared to the rest of the series. Where movie 1 somehow looked worse than the series, Heroes Rising looks infinitely superior to the series. The entire time I was watching it, the dominant thought I had was “holy fuck why does this look so good?”

Like really:

Story

As far as the story goes, it’s…okay. It’s mostly just the students running errands on this island until the villain attacks, and then the rest of it focuses on…stopping the villain. But there are a couple of moments in the movie that caught me off guard. Like the villain just beating the shit out of Deku and Bakugo. That’s a really good way to establish a villain. Just have him beat the shit out of characters that usually have plot armor. And the blood! YES!

This is especially great considering all the class A students were written out of the moment where the villains take over in the first movie.

Also, Shigaraki kills Nine, the antagonist of this movie. Truth be told, I was hoping they would do it when Nine lost. And…the crazy bastards actually did it. Kind of stunned they didn’t pussy out and have him arrested like the series would usually do.

Bad stuff

Don’t get me wrong though. There are things I don’t like. The villain starts off promising. His power and backstory are somewhat interesting. But when it comes to his ideology, he ultimately just ends up being another “I’m going to make a world for the powerful and strong” type. Disinteresting. Recycled. Boring.

img()

And while the ending is really cool, seeing Bakugo run around with One for All and everything. I really wish they didn’t bother with all the non-canon course correcting at the end. This is a battle shounen movie. Everyone knows that what happens in them never affects the main story. So don’t worry about making sure there aren’t any plot holes for the next season. No one cares!

Conclusion

Overall though, Heroes Rising is (if you choose to look at a movie’s production as an indicator of quality for an upcoming tv series) a glimmer of hope. It at least points to Studio Bones proving they can still put together a solid production if they need to, which is something I just didn’t believe anymore after how disastrous seasons 3 and 4 were visually.


I think I've pretty well established how and why the My Hero Academy anime declines as it goes along. Also I basically already did the conclusion earlier, so I'll use the conclusion to clarify a few things that might get misconstrued:

1: Some of you might be asking, why did you make all these videos and reviews on a series you don't like? Well, that's the thing. My Hero Academy isn't inherently bad. After all, it started off well. But its potential is being wasted by 2 entities, and I think it's very easy to fix (most of) the problems that are plaguing it. You might have noticed after a lot of the issues I brought up, I also gave solutions to them at the end of those sections. That's because I believe My Hero Academy is salvageable, even after 2 full seasons of crap.

I would never throw hundreds of hours of my life away making a review like this about something like Fairy Tail because I don't think it has any real value. All I would say is ""its really bad and don't watch it"". You can't fix something that is broken on paper, that doesn't even have a solid blueprint for a good show. But My Hero Academy isn't like that. It could be good, if its issues were ironed out. And I think that alone is reason enough to make these reviews.

2: It was not my intention to use the Hunter x Hunter, FMA, and Naruto comparisons to do the whole ""lol other show better"" thing. That's dumb, and I think it would be disrespectful to both Kishimoto and Horikoshi.

It was also not my intention when comparing to say the show should always do what Naruto or Hunter x Hunter did. That isn't really fixing My Hero Academy, its changing it into something I like more. And to be honest, I don't really want every new shounen to be like those shows. They should strive to carve out their own identity. But if you're going to utilize the same tropes, I think it's more than fair to illustrate how My Hero Academy doesn't use them as effectively, and why that is.

3: I don't hate Horikoshi and I don't hate My Hero Academy. I liked the potential it had, and am frustrated with Horikoshi for wasting it with lazy writing. He's clearly a very talented illustrator, which is all the more reason to be frustrated with Bones for making his show look like ass. And it's always possible some of the things I attributed to Horikoshi could actually be the result of an editor, or JUMP, or something. You never know. I'm happy for him that his manga is  super successful and I'm sure he's a nice guy. He just happens to have written a popular manga that he's pissing away the potential of.

I'd like to end things on that note, because that's probably the most important thing I want to express here. My criticism of MHA comes from a love of the battle shounen genre. And that love makes it very hard for me to watch Horikoshi continue to spin gold into bronze."
105190,"What's up everybody! Killua Morales is back and as promised, I'm gonna review an anime from the Winter season of this year. There were a lot of anime I wanted to look at, but I've decided to focus on one of my personal favorites, and that's the battle royale anime, Darwin's Game. Let's begin shall we:

Synopsis

17-year old Kaname Sudou is living a normal life until one day, he's invited to play an app game called Darwin's Game. Unbeknownst to him, this app game isn't some normal game you just download and play. The moment you join the game, you're involved in a battle royale where you have to fight to the death against others. Another thing is that after you join, you gain a supernatural ability called a Sigil that varies from player to player. After being trapped in this world of murderers and psychopaths, Kaname becomes determined to fight in this game to not only end it but also to kill the Game Master.

Story & Characters

This may come off as your typical fight to the death anime if you're familiar with series like Fate/Stay Night, The Future Diary and BTOOOM!, and you would be right. This story is very simplistic, but it's an effective simplicity. It's the psychological factor that makes this anime more entertaining than you would expect from the survival game genre. You really pay close attention to the main characters' mental state when fighting and understand each of their motives. As far as the survival game part, you're given basic groundwork for what's occurring in the anime, so you're never confused, and you're never bored because further detail about what occurs is shown through the action scenes.

What makes this anime more interesting and entertaining than normal is the characters. Each character is kinda stereotypical, but there is variety in between them. Unfortunately, that's all you get, variety. After seeing these characters, you don't really get much from them besides the main two.

Kaname Sudou



Kaname is basically if you mixed together the special abilities of Shirou Emiya from Fate/Stay Night with the edgelord personality of Hajime Nagumo from Arifureta. He has very strong values, but he won't hesitate to kick someone's ass if they piss him off. He's no coward, so he's much more likable than Yukiteru Amano from Future Diary, and he's pretty damn smart too, so he's no stereotypical protagonist. He starts off like a bland character, but you start to see how he adapts to what's happening and how he plans things out making him well-developed and a bad ass. Of course, the characters around him are no slouch either especially his main love interest.

Shuka Karino



Shuka is a tamed version of Yuna from Future Diary just give her Rider's chains from Fate/Stay Night. She comes off as a psychopath, but she's not. She's a normal girl that just knows how kill you up close and personal and from far away. After meeting Kaname, she becomes not only very girly to the point that it can be cute but also very protective of him to the point that it can be considered stalker-ish. When she's fighting, she can be merciless and holds nothing back. It's a shame that we don't get much about her backstory because it would have been nice to see why she's so damn merciless, but it's whatever.

Rein Kashiwagi



You can't have a survival anime without an introvert now, can we? Well you get that in the form of this little girl who's also good with a sniper rifle. She's basically the informant that gives out much needed information to others for the right price, so mix together the informant in Izaya Orihara from Durarara!! (minus the manipulation of others) with the sniper skills of Shinon from Sword Art Online, and this is who you get. You would expect something from this character, but she doesn't really have much development since she doesn't get a lot of screen time. You just get what you can out of her that involves her information gathering and marksmanship, and that's it. It's a bit of a let down since she's a very interesting character, and you do see a bit of her backstory, but she remains the same character even after meeting Kaname.

Ryuji Maesaka



This was a character that had a lot of potential. He started off as a character that join the game for money with his brother but became vengeful after a gang killed his brother. It was the perfect opportunity to see him grow while obtaining revenge, but his motives were completely sidelined after meeting Kaname where he becomes your typical right-hand man. I personally wanted to like his character simply because he wields a light-machine gun with a clip you normally see on a Tommy gun, but that's all you get from him which is a huge letdown.

Sui/Sota



A character with split personalities, how can you mess a promising concept like that. Oh I know, by focusing too much on one personality and not seeing the other come out unless a fight is occurring. This was another character I wanted to like. You have sweet and shy Sui who is the biggest pacifist you'll ever see that can control water and her split personality Sota who's as big a psychopath as Shuka and can turn the aforementioned water into ice. When you first meet these two, you would have thought that it was fight scene involving twins, but you're thrown a curve ball when you learn that it was split personalities. It was a well developed start but we never see how it comes to fruition. You just get what you can from their action scenes and afterwards all you see is the timid Sui being scared of violence. It's not a bad thing, but it was another let down due to how much potential the producers missed out on with this character. Speaking of missed opportunities.

Liu Xuelan



This is my favorite character from the manga, and I was looking forward to what they would do with her character. You have the best fighter in the game who becomes captivated by Kaname's fighting prowess to the point that she tried to make him the heir of her clan while bearing his children. That was a story concept I could get behind that's rarely ever seen in an anime (Hell, the only anime I've seen do a concept like that is Kengan Asura, Akame ga Kill!, and Isekai Cheat Magician). You have a strong and independent female character being interested in an equally strong male character to the point that she wants to marry him and start a family. How can you miss an opportunity like that? Oh I know, by bringing it up at one moment, and then completely forget about it along with the female character as well. This was the biggest disappointment I've seen in this anime. How exactly do forget about the top fighter in this survival game and never bring her up again! I hope we get another season because they way she was completely sidelined was a huge kick in the nuts.

All in all, it was a very promising story, but the characters were very much wasted especially the villain who was a complete psychopath just because. Yes his character was entertaining at first, but let's face it, he will never be Vaas Montenegro.

Animation & Sound

The art and animation by studio Nexus whose known works include:

Granbelm



WakabaGirl



and the co-production with Silver Link:

Chivalry of a Failed Knight



was the biggest highlight of the show. You see a lot of detail put into this series especially with the breathtaking backgrounds.



Not now Keanu. Another time, but thank you.

Back to my point, the art style was one of the best parts of the anime with the action scenes being the stand out. You feel the intensity in each action scene. That's how it feels in most of the action scenes, but other times it's just average. The animation during the opening credits was kind of misleading at times with it trying to make the characters look bad ass, but in all honesty, it was 

The character designs however were as bland as a cup of hot tea with no flavor or sweetener. Just one look at each of the characters, and you'll know what their personalities are like making the characters all the more bland than they already were. The only stand out character design was Shuka's design with her red dress, blonde twin tails and chains which fits her character to a tee.

Then there's the sound, which was the best part of the anime. The soundtrack was well made with a combination of techno, orchestra, and electric guitars giving off the intensity of the action scenes and the emotion of the dramatic scenes. The OP theme and ED theme were serviceable. They do their job setting up the tone of the anime, but it's not anything special if you listen them by themselves.

The voice acting is where the sound department really stood out. You could really feel the emotion the voice actors put into their roles from Yusuke Kobayashi (known for voicing Subaru from Re:Zero) voicing the smart and sometimes ruthless Kaname to Reina Ueda (known for voicing Mira from Dimension W) voicing the ruthless and Yuno-inspired Shuka. Each voice actor stood out in their own way (I just wish their characters were more likable). The stand out of the voice actors was Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (whom you all know for voicing Kirito from SAO and Ren from The Rising of the Shield Hero) voicing the Vaas wannabe Wang. It doesn't surprise me that he can voice a psychopath since he's voiced Petelgeuse from Re:Zero. His voicing of Wang is nothing compared to Petelgeuse, but it was a job well done.

In the end, the animation was just above average, and the sound department was a hit out of the park. It was the only thing redeeming the anime.

Final Verdict

What more can be said about this anime. It was a promising concept that had a lot to ride on, but the characters are what brought down the anime. If Nexus took the time to properly develop the characters like the manga, this could've easily been the best anime of the Winter season. As it stands, the only redeeming factor about this anime was the animation & sound, so we can say that this is an anime with style but barely any substance.

With that in mind, I can say that Darwin's Game is...

A One-Time Watch"
100112,"Wise Man's Grandchild follows a normal boy, called shin, getting into an unfortunate accident, causing his death. He reincarnates as a baby in a fantasy world, in which after another terrible incident he is stranded without his parents. He gets picked up by a powerful warrior, and through his teachings Shin learns that he is incredible powers. After he is turned adult (15 years old), the grandparents of Shin decides he is finally fit for the real world. Tiny problem: Shin doesn't really know how the world works, as his grandfather never thought him other then magic. Thus Shin gets into a magic highschool and has to learn about the customs of the world, which he does so easily because the actual focus of the anime is that Shin is fucking OP. He can do everything better then everyone, and even invents new magic. This attracts the attention of other nations, thus Shin gets into a political landscape with many people going after him.

I applaud you if you could read the last paragraph without falling asleep by the second line, you are a stronger man (or lady) then I am. The Wise Man's Grandchild is an isekai, and boy is it an isekai. It is a power fantasy, about a misfit boy with an extremely generic personality but still has unimagineable powers, thus everyone wants to be his friend and his enemies want his powers, but they fail because the misfit boy is so goddamn powerful. The plot synopsis read like the starter kit for every isekai ever. It follows the tropes very closely and it has very little original bones in its body. Especially the attempts at ""self-awareness"" falls so flat it is embarassing. 

But there is something with the Wise Man's Grandchild that makes me enjoy it more then I should. And it isn't just because I am an ""Isekai trash"" that enjoys any isekai regardless of quality. [Isekai Cheat Magician](https://anilist.co/anime/101547/Isekai-Cheat-Magician/) only came 3 months after Wise Man and fucking despised that anime, even though it has the same generic tropes as Wise Man's Grandchild. So what makes Wise Man's Grandchild so enjoyable?

I think a big part of my enjoyment comes from the fact that even though it is a generic isekai, it feels like the author somewhat cared about it. It has all the aspects of a generic isekai, but it feels like its goal wasn't just to make the protagonist a self insert, but also to make the isekai feel like a good time. The constant new introductions of the increasingly ridiculous powers of Shin never stops being funny (both ironically and non), with Shin also learning others his powers to others. There is positive vibe from this anime that keeps me engaged, even if it has some dark scenes. 

Since we are talking about dark scenes, I want to mention that the story is surprisingly engaging. Ofcourse, I could sit here and pick apart any nonsensical or stupid part in the story, but as a whole I think the story has some nice twists and ideas that get expanded on just enough.

Also, and I can't stress this enough, there is actual romance in the anime! Yes, it has tons of cute girls to make it look like a magical harem anime, but these girls aren't there to be the love interest of Shin, they are just their own fun characters. Shin actually falls in love with one love interest, and throughout the series they actually get together and start to develop their relationship. There is barely any chemistry, but it is something!

Despite my praises, I still have some definite problems with this anime that aren't just ""hurr durr generic"". The characters are very hit or miss. The comedy feels like it runs in circles and never really goes beyond giving me a smirk. I like the animation and it has some nice sakuga, but the character design is so weak. Each character looks like the default skin when you make your own character in SAO. My personal biggest problem is with the anime is its ending, which honestly completely ruined my goodwill I had for this anime. Like I wanted to throw my computer in the sink for how many eyerolls I made during the last episode.

The Wise Man's Grandchild is on a technical level a bad anime. It has more flaws then it has postive aspects. The Wiseman's Grand Child is on a personal level an okay enjoyable anime. Maybe it is due to lowered expectations, the positive vibe tricking me into liking it or that the good aspects shined harder due to the negative ones, but I can say for sure that I don't regret watching this show. Even with its godawful ending, the Wise Man's Grandchild is a big ""good enough"" from me."
106479,"“Now to distribute status points? Everything I've got goes into defense!” - Maple

If you couldn’t tell from the title, Bofuri isn’t an anime that you should take seriously and expect anything crazy from. The characters are hilarious, the atmosphere is light and refreshing, and the storyline centers around a beginner gamer that seems to get herself into the craziest of situations: Maple. This anime doesn’t try to be anything absurd or impress you with some intricate plot or characters, but it's just there to have fun, and that's a good thing. Bofuri is one of those anime that you need if you’re looking to just sit back, relax, turn off your brain, and enjoy a good laugh or two. So why don’t you do just that?! Enjoy all the smiling faces in this anime. Enjoy all the crazy and entertaining things going on. Enjoy how overpowered Maple seems to get every episode. Just have fun and enjoy it all! Leave all the technical scoring to me...

Art and Animation: 9.1/10

The quality of animation was a lot better than I was expecting. I admired the character designs when I first saw them, and I was pleased when I saw that the same level of quality was implemented into the anime as well. The beautiful and vibrant colors of New World Online were both beautiful and refreshing. It felt like you were in a VRMMO with all the surrounding diverse environments and creatures. From beautiful sunsets to crystal clear ocean waters, the attention to detail in background shots were pleasing to the eye. I appreciated all of the diverse environments that we were able to enjoy throughout this anime. As for character designs, you had both familiar and new ones all around. New weapons, unique armor, craftable items, all of it was included in an anime about a virtual video game with their designs. The action scenes also had some amazing and over-the-top moments that I truly wasn’t expecting. Fluid movements, beautiful visual effects, and creative dynamics/skills kept this anime interesting the whole way through.

Storyline and Character Progression: 8.5/10

I’d be lying if I told you that this anime had an actual storyline or some type of character progression that didn’t involve leveling or gaining more equipment. While this anime does have in-game events that our gamers participate in, there isn’t really anything beyond that. Bofuri is more of an episodic anime that's meant to be enjoyed one episode at a time. No need to bother with character progression either, since any character progression in this anime has to deal with being a higher level or gaining powerful equipment. There isn’t much to say in this department if I'm being honest. The events that took place in this anime were funny to watch, had a bit of suspense, and looked extremely fun to take part in. The sense of exploration, leveling, and new adventures were all there and made me excited to watch Maples journey as a gamer every episode. I’m sure you’ll either laugh or have your mouth wide open at how many crazy things Maple discovers...

Soundtrack and Audio: 8.8/10

This was also another element that I truly enjoyed in Bofuri. The soundtrack had complimented the anime well in adding to the environment and ambiance to give a true sense of adventure. It was upbeat, refreshing, and the OP represented the anime quite well. When it came to the sound effects used, they were neither generic nor stale. This was most evident during action scenes when explosions were plenty and spells were being cast left and right. Another strong point that Bofuri had was in its astonishing vocal cast. With a lot of talent in this cast, its only natural that we’d get high-quality voice acting to add to the bubbly personalities of our beloved characters. No complaints at all when it came to this department.

As you can tell, Bofuri isn’t meant to be taken seriously at all. It's intended to be laughed at more than anything. From the cute and adorable moments, to the endless and crazy overpowered things Maple seems to get, you’re going to have a lot of enjoyment with this anime. With a grand soundtrack, amazing vocal cast, and animation to add to the immersion, Bofuri is here to help you unwind and just enjoy! So sit back, don’t worry about the big things, and enjoy the absurdly funny and OP adventures of our cute gamer Maple. For the refreshing and great quality animation, fun soundtrack, and hilarious adventures, Bofuri has earned its score of 8.8/10. What are you waiting for? Add this to your plan to watch when you need an anime to make you smile and relax! That's all for now, and as always, I'll see you in the next one <3

249,"Inuyasha proves what a talented mangaka Rumiko Takahashi truly is! Rumiko Takahashi can go from making slackjaw comedy like Ranma 1/2, to making creepy horror such as Mermaid Saga, to jam packed action shounen anime such as Inuyasha. There are elements from Ranma 1/2 in Inuyasha. Many of the characters in Inuyasha parallel characters from Ranma 1/2. There is a half demon girl in Inuyasha that bares a slight resemblance to Lum from Urusei Yatsura. Inuyasha was inspired from one of Rumiko Takahashi's earlier series from the 80's called Fire Tripper. Inuyasha is about a teenage school girl from the present day (at the time 1996) named Kagome Higurashi. Kagome lives with her little brother, mother, pet cat, and grandfather in a house right next to the family shrine. Her grandfather is obsessed with mythology and ancient artifacts. Kagome is well liked by her peers at school, she has three friends, and a guy named Hojo who is secretly in love with her but Kagome is of course oblivious to this. On her 15th birthday Kagome enters the family shrine and the well starts glowing and Kagome is captured by a centipede demon named Mistress Centipede. Kagome is transported 500 years into the past and she sees Inuyasha a half dog demon who is bond to a tree. Kagome is attacked by Mistress Centipede who bites out the sacred jewel from Kagome's body. Inuyasha tells Kagome to free him so that he can kill  Mistress Centipede. Kagome does so by pulling out the sacred arrow that binded Inuyasha to the tree. Once free, Inuyasha easily kills Mistress Centipede but tries to kill Kagome. The elder of the village an old priestess Kaeda magically puts on an enchanted necklace onto Inuyasha which he cannot take off and Kaeda tells Kagome to give the necklace a command and Kagome says ""Sit"" and Inuyasha crashes face first to the ground. Kagome accidentally breaks the sacred jewel into many pieces with a sacred arrow causing her and Inuyasha to go on a quest to find all the pieces. Kagome being a powerful priestess can sense a piece of the scared jewel close by. The main antagonist of the series Naraku is the cause of most of the tragedies and murders in the series. Naraku is different from other half demons because Naraku is the human bandit/murder Onigumo and a legion of demons combined into one body. Naraku gives ""birth"" to many incarnations that follow his orders. One of his incarnations a wind sorceress named Kagura despises him and wishes to be free. Naraku is the reason why Inuyasha was bond to the tree because Naraku caused Inuyasha and Inuyasha's first lover Kikyo to turn against one another in order to capture the sacred jewel. Inuyasha and Kagome on their quest to capture all the pieces of the Sacred Jewel befriend a young monk named Miroku who has a generational curse from Naraku which is the wind tunnel that is a black hole in the palm of his right hand that he uses to cover up with sacred beads and a piece of clothing. To remove the curse Naraku must be killed or the wind tunnel will eventually suck up Miroku just as it did to his father and grandfather. A fox demon child named Shippo who can transform into anyone and anything. Shippo's family was killed by Naraku's minions. A teenage demon slayer named Sango whose father and clan were slain by her possessed little brother Kohaku who under Naraku's control slaughtered them and joined Naraku. Sango's companion a demon cat named Kiara who can transform into a giant flying cat , all travel with Inuyasha and Kagome united in their quest to capture the sacred jewel shards and kill Naraku. Inuyasha's older half-brother Sesshomaru is easily the most complicated character in the series. Sesshomaru was originally one of the villains in Inuyasha. Sesshomaru and Inuyasha each had animosity towards one another. They each both told the other that they will kill the other and would try to fight the other to the death. Sesshomaru resented the fact that both his and Inuyasha's father (The Great Dog Demon) gave Inuyasha the Tessaiga which Sesshomaru believed was the best sword that belonged to his father because Sesshomaru received the Tenseiga which Sesshomaru believed was a useless sword. Sesshomaru goes from despising humans to eventually bonding with one, when he saves a little human girl named Rin who he allows to become one of his traveling companions that he guards and protects. It can be said that Rin was the one that gave Sesshomaru his ""heart"". Inuyasha and Sesshomaru actually don't want the other to die. Towards the end of the series Inuyasha begins to care about Sesshomaru and doesn't want him killed. Sesshomaru, Inuyasha, Kagome, and their traveling companions all unite in their common quest to kill Naraku once and for all! If someone enjoys adventure, action, fantasy, and mythology then they will enjoy Inuyasha."
124194,"Even though we are the ones who completely embody it, human emotion and their inherent nature is a topic that is vague enough to unassuming eyes, that it may be considered impossible to understand. With there being no true concrete answer as to what comprises the deeper parts of our minds, problems with depicting that complex nature in a story will always arise. A lot of stories that strive to be more than what they are expected to try to write its characters in a way for them to feel human. What constitutes as human strays into the vague territory of the subject that it even derives from. This vague territory is the reason why it is extremely daunting to incorporate in a story. To get a true method for portraying human characters is impossible, and to get anywhere close to is a challenge many aren’t willing to take. This is why a great deal of stories primarily feature one dimensional characters that are idealizations of a certain archetype. While this approach to character can work well in certain contexts, for stories that mainly surround characters like it, the story lacks the capability to make the audience feel a far wider range of emotions. When stories actually do try to venture into the aforementioned vague territory, the results can produce some of the best stories ever created. While the true extent of the vague territory is unknown, even an understanding of a small part of it can provide a great deal of emotion and meaning. 

Enter Fruits Basket. 

img()

Contrary to popular opinions that said otherwise, my initial impression of this series was one of dissatisfaction. It seemed to me in the beginning that it was a story that revolved around one dimensional characters that didn’t exactly click with me. However, Fruits Basket was pulling a trick. While some didn’t fall for it at all, I was somebody that fell head first into it. While Fruits Basket was lulling me into the notion that it wasn’t doing anything past the status quo, it was actually doing the contrary. In its entirety, Fruits Basket is an emotional ballad that, out of any piece of media I have consumed, is one of the stories that most successfully ventures the furthest into the vague and muddy territory of human emotion.

As Fruits Basket’s approach to character writing evolves, the method as to how characters are developed gets slowly better and better, until it becomes nearly perfect by the Final Season. The general method of character development with Fruits Basket’s method doesn’t really change throughout the series, but it is so volatile and utilized so well, that it isn’t remotely repetitive in the slightest. This method starts with the initial impression. This initial impression is in a character’s introduction, where you learn about a character’s extremely base character traits. From this initial view into a character’s world, you can initially write them off as one dimensional at the start. The series does a very good job at hammering these traits in. This series very easily creates some of the most detestable images for a character that I have ever seen in a story before. Even if the hammering in seems like it is counterintuitive at first, it serves a deliberate purpose in later developments of the story. After our initial impressions of a character has set in, the show immediately asks a vital question about the character in question that will permeate throughout the rest of the series. Why?

Answering as to why a character would act a certain way isn’t exactly a new question that stories have brought up when developing characters, but what sets Fruits Basket apart is in how meticulously it shows this development. For characters that initially started out with one base character trait, they each eventually flourish into very complex, sympathetic, and human characters. The sympathetic part is the part that is particularly impressive to me. Fruits Basket can somehow turn one of the previously mentioned destable characters into somebody that feels uniquely human in a way that no story has really ever pulled off for me. The empathetic nature of the show naturally allows it to have better character writing across the board, because it lets all of the emotional beats of the show completely hit their targets. While not every character arc in Fruits Basket is consistent in their execution, the few lesser arcs aren’t major enough to outshine some of the best character arcs that the major characters in the story have. It isn’t like the characters that are worse written are abundant either. The character arcs that hit it out of the park take up a very sizable majority in the ensemble cast, so it is very rare to see anything that I could actually call bad. With all of the elements of so many emotional aspects of humanity on display here, Fruits Basket can draw strong emotions that have been built up over the course of a character arc to a powerful emotional climax. These emotional climaxes have the ability to bring out tears in many people. However, this series has rarely been called something anywhere close to cry bait. This is because it fully earns nearly every single emotional moment that it tries to attempt, due to how well the buildup was to that moment over the course of all three seasons. Fruits Basket’s ability to make the viewer tear up is far from high on its priority list. However, it manages to do it anyway, because the audience at this point most likely deeply cares for the characters.

With the series having such a deep understanding of the emotions inside of us, it leverages this understanding to commentate on deeper issues ingrained into our society. As played into the supernatural elements of the Zodiac curse in the beginning, by the second season, they are nearly nonexistent. This change in direction helps the series to put greater focus on the symbolic and allegorical aspects of the implications of the curse on its victims. Even if the first showcase through the Zodiac curse is in a more lighthearted, comical, and supernatural manner, the curse comes to parallel some extremely realistic struggles that can be applied to many real life curses of its kind. With how the Zodiac curse is contextualized throughout the story, it makes every single action of the characters affected by it to feel all the more justified and real. It is yet another manner that Fruits Basket uses its knowledge of human struggle and emotion to create a realistic world of suffering in a way that can hit a real chord.

The OST also contributes equal parts to the more emotional parts of the series. The emotional weight that nearly every song in the OST holds in my heart really shouldn’t be understated. Nearly every song manages to be soaring in a way that compliments every scene, while never being overbearing. I don’t think you could properly describe much of what makes the OST in proper words, and the only real way to actually know how good it is to actually listen to it. 

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWX07Ci3lBU)

My only real problem with this series is in the visual department. While the character design is absolutely fantastic and the shot composition is pretty good, the art style itself can feel off putting to many. Compared to most shows coming out nowadays, it can look a bit dated. On top of that, the series is pretty static and there isn’t exactly much animation that is actually present. This only really nagged at me in the early stages of the first season, and I quickly got used to it.  I can’t try to defend it to say that the questionable style of the series is actually intentional, but the good aspects of the visuals were good enough for me to ignore the lesser elements.

As vague human emotion can get at times, it isn’t something that is completely aimless. It is never going to be fully understandable for as long as humanity exists, but we can still derive meaning from it. Fiction lies in a unique spot where it can more easily draw out these emotions to create experiences like no other. This capability can be utilized to create works of fiction that can be considered life changing. I can confidently say that Fruits Basket is one of these works to me. It is so potent in how it contextualizes its storytelling that it becomes something that truly changed the way I acted. I feel like I will be generally nicer to nearly every person I meet from now on, and I will try to get to know them for who they actually are instead of what I think they are. It is a trait that I felt lacking in before, but now I feel more aware of the world I live in, and I can say a full thank you to Fruits Basket for that. Even for anime and manga I have ranked higher there are very few of them that I can say have changed my life for the better. However, through its emotionally driven story, its lovable characters, show stopping score, and poignant themes, Fruits Basket fully deserves that distinction.

Thank you for reading to the end of the review if you did. If you have any criticisms with how this review was made, you are free to message me to critique what I had to say."
99468,"Teasing Master Takagi-San is my favorite anime, and yes I really do mean that. While it may not be a “top-tier” anime objectively, the series has received a positive reception over the years and has garnered a good amount of fans. It’s a cute, wholesome, hilarious and even nostalgic anime that resembles the feeling of being young, reminiscing the days of middle school, and making fun memories with the people we spend time with. Takagi has all of that, and it does an excellent job at making these moments feel natural and organic. It’s the kind of series that serves as a nice breather to help balance out from the more deep and complex stories out there, but still having moments for the viewer to keep themselves relatively engaged.

With Season 3 currently out, I thought I go back and review the Takagi anime as a whole, highlighting the charm of what this series brings, and how much it has progressed overtime. While I will admit Seasons 2 and 3 are good sequels that improve the qualities of the 1st season, I still find Season 1 to be quite underrated and there are some nice moments here that people tend to overlook. The season may not be perfect, but it manages to keep its overall narrative consistent which later gets improved in future seasons.

Art: The art and the animation is pretty solid. I love the visuals and how the setting is based on the real life Shodoshima, which fun fact, this is where the author of the Takagi manga grew up in! The anime manages to recapture a couple of the island’s locations such as the school, a few neighborhoods, the shrine, the library, the tunnel, and the bookstore to name a few, and when you look at a side by side comparison to its real life counterpart, the shots are pretty similar, almost looking like a faithful recreation. While Takagi isn’t the only series that manages to recapture Japan’s notable locations and landmarks, it still does a good job at making the viewer feel interested in wanting to visit sometimes. 

img220() 

Moving back to the in-universe stuff, I like the character designs and how they actually look like middle schoolers. A lot of series tend to either overage or underage their characters from their respective age group/school year. This is mostly a nitpick on my end when it comes to those series, so it’s not really a huge issue for me unless it becomes taken too far. Aside from that, the anime does a good job portraying the behavior of most middle school children, from their youthful appearance, to their playful, innocent expressions. Nishikata’s reactions are hilarious and his expressions, complimented by his sounds effects, are what makes the comedy land. Takagi’s expressions are great too ranging from adorable cuteness to playful teasing. Those smug faces she makes are pretty hilarious. 

img220() img220() img220()

Overall, the art for Takagi is solid. Its got good looking visuals, and the expressiveness of the characters captures the nostalgic feeling of being in middle school, giving a sense of adorable wholesomeness and hilarious laughs. Shin-Ei did a good job in this aspect, which they later improve in the future seasons.

Story: The story follows two separate plots. One focusing on the two main leads Takagi and Nishikata, and the other revolving around 3 best friends being Yukari, Sanae, and Mina. 

Takagi and Nishikata Story: 
In Season 1, the narrative is relatively straight forward, Takagi teases her classmate Nishikata and Nishikata tries to find ways to tease her back, but often finding himself failing to make a comeback, so he continues until Takagi succumbs to his teasing. Its a simple plot that's easy to follow, but still leaves the viewer engaged as to how Nishikata will try to tease Takagi. Season 1 manages to keep this narrative consistent, and gives a similar vibe to a classic Tom and Jerry episode. Although some people may find the segments repetitive after watching a few episodes, the interactions Takagi and Nishikata have leads into the most important aspect of the series, their relationship.

img220()

Season 1 focuses on establishing their relationship, how they met, and how they grow closer to each other. In a relationship, this is the initial stage. Nishikata sees Takagi as a rival at first, but as time goes on, he notices that he spends a good amount of time with her, and even though he loses most of the time, he is able to learn and slowly grow thanks to her. The interactions the two have feel natural and organic, and I love how the anime paces itself and its dialogue when it comes to fast paced comedy and slow paced intimate moments. 

img220()

This in my opinion, is what highlights the series’s charm, because it emphasizes one of the main love languages, quality time. You get invested in how these 2 characters slowly start to think about each other throughout their daily activities, talking in class, going bicycle riding, playing games, walking together, all of which show the natural progression of how a friendship is formed, and only then do these two eventually start to see that they enjoy each other’s company, and later see each other as something more which is something the later seasons start to focus on. It feels organic, it feels natural, its well paced, it has this nice sense of flow when the episode transitions into their next segment. You start to see the relationship change bit by bit, and while Seasons 2 and 3 show this development more evidently, Season 1 has some nice small moments that often go unnoticed, which makes the finale of this season all the worthwhile, opening the door for what’s about to happen in the next stage of their relationship.

img220() 

B-Trio Story: 
The secondary plot revolves around 3 best friends being Yukari, Mina, and Sanae, who i will refer to as the B-trio. Their segments consist of the usual slice of life parts that serve as a nice comic relief away from the Takagi and Nishikata segments. Now to be fair, if I had to pick one criticism people have with the series, it’s that the B-trio segments don’t often serve too much to the overall story, and often times their segments can be seen as fillers, which could of been used to develop Takagi and Nishikata’s relationship. Personally, I enjoy these segments and I don't mind their presence in the anime because I find them to be solid comic relief characters, and their segments also expands on the SOL middle school life, plus their segments don't go on too for long so its not that big of a deal, at least to me. If you don't like these segments, then its perfectly fine, because I agree that these 3 as standalone characters wouldn't work, hence them being here helps to serve as a breather to give a quick laugh before transitioning back to the main plot. 

img220()

Season 1's overall narrative focuses on the starting stage of establishing the main lead's relationship, and focuses more on the slice of life/comedy aspect with small bits of romantic interest. The romance is definitely on the slow burn side, but it does manage to pace itself in giving subtle hints of development worth investing towards which will then be expanded on in the later seasons.

Characters: Takagi and Nishikata may be your typical middle schoolers, but their dynamic is what makes the series enjoyable to watch. 

Nishikata is a fun character. I love how expressive he is and his reactions always give me a good laugh, even upon rewatch. His development in Season 1 may not be as impactful to some compared to the later seasons, but he does slowly improve himself after some of the losses he takes, and he slowly starts to learn more about Takagi, not only as a rival, but eventually as a friend. 

img220() img220()

Takagi is also a fun character. I enjoy her fun teasing side since her teasing isn’t seen in a mean spirited way, but rather showing her affection towards Nishikata. Granted we don’t know too much about Takagi since we mostly see the story through Nishikata’s perspective, so it leaves both Nishikata and the audience having to use visual cues such as tone and expressions, especially with how each encounter with Nishikata slowly strengthens her feelings for him.

img220() img220()

Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi do an excellent job at making their interactions feel very natural. The dialogue is smooth and well paced, talking at a speed where it’s easy to pick up some of the basic Japanese language. 

The B-trio and various other side characters in the series are also your typical middle schoolers and most don’t serve too much importance to the overall plot, just people Takagi and Nishikata interact with if they aren’t hanging out together.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack for Takagi is interesting as it doesn’t follow the standard 1 opening song, 1 ending song, for a 12 episode series. Instead it does 1 opening, sung by Yuiko Oohara (who also does the songs for Mushoku Tensei), and has multiple ending songs (this season has 7) that change every 1-2 episodes, all sung by Rie Takahashi. The songs are wonderful to listen to, and I recommend looking at the lyrics as it does give more insight on Takagi’s feelings.

Enjoyment: After rewatching Season 1, I found it to be pretty fun to watch, even if Seasons 2 and 3 are a definite improvement. A good amount of the iconic jokes were in this season, and the development was pretty subtle. I still got a good laugh from Nishikata’s reactions and I appreciate his motivation to better himself once he starts learning more about Takagi. I also saw the B-trio plots to be fun as well, even if they didn’t serve too much to the story. Finally, rewatching most of the segments in Season 1 helped to see how much the relationship has changed, as there are parallels that correlate to how Nishikata from Season 3 is a different person there than he was in Season 1. He acts less flustered and is starting to become more aware of his feelings for Takagi. All of those small moments of development he had in Season 1 were foundations as to how his character starts developing in the later seasons.

Conclusion: Takagi-San Season 1 isn’t a perfect season, it’s a simplistic plot with a premise that repeats itself, and development that may not be as noticeable compared to many other series that have an overarching storyline, fleshed out characters, and complex themes. However, not every story needs to have this layer of complexity, and simple stories like Takagi are needed to help give the audience something to relax to, a story that invokes happiness, and a story that’s easy to follow but still make it engaging for the viewer to feel interested. 

In my opinion, Takagi is a simplistic story that works. It gets the job done of the story it’s trying to tell, and the later seasons manage to improve the qualities the first season had, making the series definitely worth the time investing in. If you’re looking for an anime with good romance, or something to relax your brain with, then I definitely recommend this one.

105228,"Dorohedoro is a [twenty three volume long manga](https://anilist.co/manga/31133/Dorohedoro/) by [Q Hayashida](https://anilist.co/staff/98024/Q-Hayashida) that is packed from beginning to end with weirdness, quite often over the top yet imaginative gore, and an ensemble cast of sorcerers with fucked up magic.



 And also a lizard man who murders sorcerers to death with a knife usually after chomping on their head to force them to be seen by the man who lives within his mouth.

Upon seemingly the moment this manga ended after going for eighteen years, it was announced that there would be an anime adaptation by the studio [MAPPA](https://anilist.co/studio/569/MAPPA). Immediately, I was awash with two very different emotions. Unbridled excitement with a deep undercurrent of overwhelming dread. After all, the last time I was probably this excited for an upcoming anime adaptation was [Berserk 2016](https://anilist.co/anime/21560/Berserk/).



And back then before it actually aired, I remember my often repeated mantra being along the lines of “even though it’s CG, it still has the potential of being an at least okay adaptation.”

And of course, because of how absolutely horrible it turned out, that’s how I ended up starting to review anime on this site.

...So it’s super refreshing that I don’t have to write that exact same review again four years later with Dorohedoro.






img440()

That’s the word that would come to my mind when I tried to imagine… a whole bunch of scenes from Dorohedoro being animated. Before the anime was even announced, mind you. I couldn’t imagine it in my head without sanding away the artstyle or the overwhelming darkness of the Hole. Or the absolute lunacy of day to day life in the Sorcerer world.

How would they handle this scene? How would they handle this character?  How would they handle this moment?

img440()

Then the anime aired and I had a hammer repeatedly bashed into my skull until those thoughts ceased. Very quickly indeed, this adaptation proved to have an incredibly firm hold on the admittedly very odd tone of Dorohedoro. Like the general setting of this series is a town comprised of humans who have been victim to sorcerers, having their lives ruined or completely altered as they suddenly find themselves with the head of a lizard, missing a couple of limbs, or worse.

img440()

You would think comedy wouldn’t belong in a series with a setting like that, yet it is. It’s present throughout the entire manga. And I thought it’d be pretty difficult to nail it down in animated form, yet the light hearted and more comical tone of the series is just as present and perfectly handled as the manga.

img440()

...But then every once in a while, we get a nice little dream sequence of say... a blood covered mystery fellow emerging from the jaws of our favorite lizard man.

img440()

In my opinion, the staff that worked on this adaptation were handed what I thought would have been an insurmountable task. Or at the very least, a task that could have been handled wrong in dozens and dozens of different ways. Maybe I'm beating a dead horse here because I've been disappointed so many times, but it's just amazing to me that they actually managed to nail the spirit and the tone of Dorohedoro so perfectly.

img440()




Dorohedoro is probably home to one of my favorite cast of characters ever. Like if you ask me, hey, who's your favorite Dorohedoro character? My gut reaction is probably Shin. The sorcerer donning a heart mask whose magic, get this, doesn't even kill you. It just cuts you into pieces. While keeping you alive.

img440()

So to actually kill people he just hammers them to death.

How about Noi? Shin's partner? Well, she's the healing sorcerer. On the brink of death? She'll just vomit some smoke your way and bam, good as new. So you would think this would cause her to do pretty much nothing but heal the other characters throughout the series but... well...

img440()

...Let's move on. There's En, who is basically the head of the Sorcerer world. And his magic is... mushrooms.

img440()

To be honest, in the manga, I didn't even like En that much. BUT HE LOOKS SO FUCKING COOL IN THE ANIME.

He can turn things and people into mushrooms. And he's essentially the head figure of the Sorcerers. He has his own mansion, he's got a movie about himself he's making, he had a ramen chain until there was a bunch of cases of food poisoning via the mushrooms... I mean he even has his own goddamned song. And it's just him singing about mushrooms.

youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOBoZibhOOM)

As if that wasn't enough, he also even has a pet catlike creature (?) who can bring the dead back to life.

img440()

And I could just keep going. I mean, I'm still on Sorcerers. I haven't even gotten to the lizard. And he's the main character! It'd just be quicker to just jump to characters I don't like so much. That of course being Ebisu and Chota. Chota doesn't have that much time in the anime so he's not that much of a bother here. Although, seeing his smoke animated was cool. I never really liked Ebisu in the manga because for sure to an extent, her character is moreso comedic relief than anything else. Not that you can blame her for it. 

img440()

After having a traumatic experience where a lizard literally chomps your face off, you'd probably never be the same too.

...That being said, her being animated and voiced adds a whole lot to her various shenanigans.

 




img440()

The heart of this series is chaos. Pure, simple, and unadulterated chaos. Yes, there is still a plot to be followed from beginning to end, but I would definitely urge you to not take it too seriously (though I very much enjoyed it myself) and just revel in the chaos.

I mean if you watch this and get to the part where there is a baseball game held in the Hole, you'll get exactly what I'm saying. 

img440()

As one of the members of a team is literally just a gigantic talking cockroach. There's also the Frankenstein'd corpse of Fujita's partner who Caiman (the lizard) murdered in the very first episode.

As can be gathered from what we see of the daily life in the Hole, a lot of Sorcerers are complete assholes and definitely deserve to be knifed to death by a lizard. That being said, it's kinda hard to not feel bad for Fujita. Still in mourning for his dead partner and oh there he is, playing baseball...

 

Though, probably the earliest piece of world building that caused my love of Dorohedoro is because of all of the fucked up magic from the Sorcerers, the Hole has a certain event every year. It's called the Day of the Living Dead.

 

On this special night, corpses just get up and start walking around and brainlessly attacking whoever they see. And one thing this series makes abundantly clear from start to finish is that there are a lot of fucking corpses in the Hole.

img440()

My favorite thing about this is everybody treats it as completely normal. Rather, it's a contest. The plates you retrieve from downed zombies, you can redeem for various prizes. Really, the only ones who find the fact that the living dead are roaming the streets strange is sorcerers.

And they're the chief cause of it!

img440()




Dorohedoro is one of my utmost favorite action manga. Would I consider it my #1? No, but I simultaneously can't really say that the other ones I hold above it have what Dorohedoro has going for it.

img440()

No other series have I seen a character catch a man's brain with a baseball cap after cutting his head open with a spear. Also, there's a lot of lizard chomping people. And that's pretty great.

And for the anime adaptation to capture the spirit of Dorohedoro so wholeheartedly and to include so many scenes from the manga where I would go ""yeah I'd fuckin' love to see this animated"" and then go ""wow, they didn't ruin it!"" is amazing.

img440()

I basically already said this exact line verbatim earlier in the review but I'm not removing it to drive the point home.

It's a 100 out of 100 for me, but I acknowledge it may not be that for other people. I, on the other hand, will desperately be hoping for a second season every day until it's announced."

Before I get into this, keep in mind that this is a review for all of Magi up to this point, not just season 2.

When I was first introduced to Magi, I could only think, ""great, an anime ripoff of Disney's Aladdin."" Like come on. It's in an Arabian desert setting, it has magical blue wish-granting genies, and to top it off, one of the main characters is even named Aladdin. How they didn't run into copyright issues for this I will never know. But the more I watched Magi, the more I saw it grow into its own. I watched it meet, and often exceed, all of my expectations of what constitutes a good piece of entertainment. But looking back, I can't say I can pinpoint any aspect of the show that truly wowed me.

[ STORY - 7.7/10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhVCoTsBaM)
There's no doubt that Magi has a very good storyline. It follows a journey through a surprisingly well fleshed out world filled with both dream-like fantasy and well-defined realism. Through this world, some genuinely interesting ideas about fate, class, and friendship are explored, and it's not afraid to get into the darker side of things. One of its most impressive features is its vast number of kingdoms, each with fully functioning governments and economies that really help showcase all the major themes of the show. But in general, the storyline seems to just wander around its world without any major focus or backbone, and it's often hard to see what it's really trying to accomplish. This also lets it drag at times, like in the middle of season 1 and and the beginning of season 2, where the pacing takes a hit. But overall, Magi tells a very impressive story, especially in the second half of season 2 where all its strengths culminate.

 [ CHARACTERS - 7.5/10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhVCoTsBaM)
Characters are a bit of a mixed bag for the show. On one hand you have characters like Titus, Hakuryuu, Morgiana, and Matal, who all have very engaging arcs and motives over the course of Magi. But on the other, main characters like Aladdin seem to pale in comparison. Aladdin, while fun for a lot of comic relief, doesn't really have much depth to his character at all. Side characters are similarly mixed, with some being really interesting, like Gyokuen, and others being comically bad, like Abhmad. All in all though, there's definitely much more good than bad going on in the character department, with solid characterization and development across a very wide range of characters.

[ ART - 6.4/10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhVCoTsBaM)
As far as the art goes, it's pretty good. Like I said earlier, the world has some interesting settings which look nice and colorful. There's nothing mind-blowing going on here though. The fights generally look pretty average, with some being better and some being worse. It does the job and it's more than good enough.

[ SOUND - 5.3/10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhVCoTsBaM)
The soundtrack also does the trick, but it definitely leans towards a more average quality. It isn't very memorable at all and listening to it alone doesn't do much for me. I'll give it some points for matching the Arabian aesthetic and for combining a lot of different instruments and voices. The voice acting is also sufficient, but nothing really stood out there either. Same for its openings and endings.

[ OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 7.4/10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhVCoTsBaM)
So in the end, did Magi end up being a diamond in the rough? (Heh, see what I did there Aladdin fans?). I'd certainly say so. It really has no bad aspects, and for what little it may lack in art and sound, it more than makes up for with its gripping storyline and broad range of well developed characters. While I can't say that its ideas changed my life or that its moments moved me to tears, I'm confident that it'll satisfy anyone who's looking for some high quality entertainment."

TOKYO, 14,000 KM

--signpost, seen near the end of the series

Let's be clear right from the get-go here. A Place Further Than The Universe is not really about Antarctica per se. It's about Antarctica in the same way that Citizen Kane is about running a newspaper business. Further is more akin to a young adult novel than anything else, an adventure series whose premise straddles a line between the fantastical and the merely unlikely (it is certainly technically possible that a group of highschoolers might someday be sent to Antarctica, but it's not exactly a safe bet, is it?), and indeed the anime's very title is an allusion to the sheer improbability of the task at hand--space seems a more likely destination than the world's final, frozen continent.

What makes this work is the series' buildup, taking protagonist Kimari's desire to tag along with her friend Shirase to Antarctica from in the beginning more of a mere impulse, to a full on quest by the end of the fourth episode (complete with a sunrise and stirring music). The desire to go to Antarctica specifically may not resonate with many, but the desire to go out and see the world, to escape--even temporarily--from one's everyday hometown life, to go, in the show's own words to ""somewhere that isn't here"", is damn near universal. 

Near its halfway point, at the end of the fifth episode, is where it becomes clear that Antarctica in this series is a metaphor for growing up and more specifically, for seizing control of one's life, for shaking up one's routine. On the dawn of Kimari's departure, Megumi, Kimari's longtime childhood friend (and recurring second-stringer throughout the first half of the series), tearfully ""breaks up"" her friendship with Kimari and confesses that she's been spreading rumors and making Kimari's life difficult in a bid to sabotage her trip to frozen frontier. Both characters cry full-on ghibli tears as Megumi comes to the realization that she's been clinging to her friend, and using her as an emotional crutch. The soundtrack swells and Kimari rejects the ""break up"", forgiving her friend even as the both of them step into a world without each other for the first time since they were kids. It's the third episode in a row to deliver a knockout finale and easily places Further in the upper echelon of anime in its season all on its own.

This extended metaphor continues throughout the series, and is evident in just how much of the show's runtime is devoted to the girls overcoming the minutiae and mundanities of making the trip to Antarctica. A trip that does not actually begin in earnest until over halfway through the series. This makes a lot of sense if you think about it, reaching your goals is often a hard and furthermore a tedious process, filled with pitfalls and any number of things great and small that could easily go wrong. Further succeeds by not skipping over this. The series' first third is dedicated to the girls simply securing the money and permission to go on the trip in the first place, and the second revolves around their overcoming obstacles on the actual trip--Hinata losing her passport in Singapore, the girls adjusting to life aboard the ship (and enduring a wicked bout of seasickness), and so on. 

Then there is episode 9. Shirase's character is probably the one whose initial motivation ties into this extended metaphor the least, at first at any rate. For most of the series everyone--including the audience--assumes that the main reason Shirase wants to go to Antarctica is the distant hope of finding her mother, who was part of a civilian expedition not unlike (and sharing many crewmembers with) the one she is on during the series' latter half, went missing during an inland expedition, and is presumed dead. This is mostly true, but there's another angle, Shirase's relationship with Gin Toudou, the expeditionary leader, Shirase's late mother's friend, and someone who has known Shirase herself since she was a child. It's established over the course of the series that the two have a very strained relationship, and during the climax of the 9th episode they talk. Shirase blames Toudou for her mother's apparent death and is evidently somewhat in denial about doing so, but more to the point, and tying back into the Antarctica-as-independence theme, Shirase feels that her life stalled after her mother's death (she later compares it, in episode 12, to a dream she feels like she never woke up from). The rhetoric is familiar; every day was the same. Antarctica, again, serves as a means of escape, an end to the endless everyday--the Slice of Life cycle of consequence-free repetition that many lighthearted anime embrace, but in the real world (and here), is a trap. Shirase pours her heart out, and we are met with the immediate visual metaphor of the expedition ship hitting fast ice,[ and having to ram through it]() (as well as a brief history lesson about Japan's allotted routes to the frozen continent). The episode ends with our girls--all at once--stepping foot onto the Antarctic snow. A place further than the universe, finally within reach.

So with all of this said, how does one assess Further Than The Universe in a broad sense? On the whole, and within the context of its medium? Well, here's the thing. When it premiered, Further got unfairly pegged with the non-description that is the ""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"" pseudo-genre, and while the term isn't entirely inaccurate here (certainly, the cast is all-female, and they are adorable true enough), it's not even close to the full picture. Further is an adventure series, and furthermore (har har) it is one defined in part by a thematic opposition to the slice of life series that make up the majority of what gets called ""CGDCT"". Further is, boiled down to its barest essentials, a story about coming of age, about becoming independent, and about breaking away from the societal cycles it is all too easy to get trapped in. Look, for instance, at how little of the show actually takes place in high school despite its main cast all being teenage girls (and how it's unambiguously portrayed as a place of trauma, and a place to escape, for Shirase and Hinata). The series is not entirely unique in this regard, as this kind of anti-Slice of Life genre dates back at least to Sound of The Sky, if not farther. But the key difference between Further and many of those earlier series is twofold. The first is that Further takes place in a setting much more akin to the real world (the events improbable but far from impossible) as opposed to a dystopia or similarly downbeat setting, and the second is related, that Further finds in that opposition, not something disheartening or depressing, but something inspiring. There is nothing antagonistic about Further's relationship to ""cozy"" slice of life shows, it stands apart from them, and as a result of its ambitions, is something altogether different. 

There is of course more to the show--both in breadth and depth--in the end, it is probably impossible to touch on every single thing that Yoromoi does right. There is so much packed into its thirteen episodes that there is a real temptation to ramble until words lose their meaning about them. It is a story about growing up, independence, friendship, parents. Big ideas, broad things that a lesser anime would sweep aside entirely or carefully pick and choose from. Part of what makes Further so brilliant is how all of this fullness and richness takes not a single thing away from the main arc of the show--Shirase coming to Antarctica, the place where her mother died. An arc that finally reaches a sob-inducing conclusion at the end of the show's penultimate episode, where, in its biggest break from reality (but such a well-earned one), the girls, visiting the camp site where Shirase's mother disappeared near, find two things. One, a frost-encrusted picture of Shirase and her mother. The other, a miraculously still-functioning laptop. Shirase opens the computer, opens her mother's email, and sees messages--over a thousand of them, from Shirase herself to her mother's untouched in years inbox--pouring in. Here, Shirase and the other girls break down crying, and so, it's not unlikely, do you. 

The last episode is probably the one that hews closest to what the term ""slice of life"" usually conjures, but by that point, it's so well-earned, and so deserved, that it's just more emotional payoff. Even in its victory lap the show captures you, over and over. The scene at the end of the twelfth episode is probably what will set off the most waterworks but for me, the title card at the very end of the series is what sent me tearing up, Further absolutely does not ever lapse, even for a second.

It is ultimately that very command of emotion, genuinely masterful in its execution, that makes Further so perfect. Its flaws--extant but minor--are so few and nitpicky as to not even be worth mentioning, when every single note of character and plot development is played this well, they simply don't matter.

If all of us had friends like Shirase's, finding our own personal Antarctica would not be so hard, and it's telling that the series itself seems to wish us that exact thing. After all, at the very end of the last episode, we have this:

The sort of touching farewell that assures you that yes, the people who made this genuinely did pour their whole hearts into it. Somewhat incredibly, Further is director Atsuko Ishizuka's first longform project that is not an adaptation. If this is a work of auteurship, then, we can only hope that the title of the final episode--"" We'll Go On Another Journey Someday""--is something of a promise, of more of this--this whole thing--in anime. It's something well worth hoping for.

Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. There are a number of rather famous characters that fit this description, from Bruce Wayne to Tony Stark. And it was only a matter of time before anime came back with one of its own in Daisuke Kambe, of Fugou Keiji: Balance: UNLIMITED. Adapted by [Studio Cloverworks](https://anilist.co/studio/6222/CloverWorks) from a novel series of the same name, originally written by [Yasutaka Tsutsui](https://anilist.co/staff/97488/Yasutaka-Tsutsui) and directed by [Tomohiko Itou](https://anilist.co/staff/105801/Tomohiko-Itou) of [Silver Spoon](https://anilist.co/anime/16918/Silver-Spoon/) and [ERASED](https://anilist.co/anime/21234/ERASED/) fame, Fugou Keiji is a lot of things. It is both a comedy and a mystery. A tale of murder and revenge, of heroics and villainy, and perhaps most importantly: of family. And while there is no shortage of missteps along the way I can say one thing with certainty: Fugou Keiji is a fun show oozing in style and I cannot wait to talk about it with you. So lets jump right in!

(Disclaimer: This review contains minor spoilers for Fugou Keijil. You can also find individual episode write ups and comment on this review on my [Star Crossed blog](https://starcrossedanime.com/fugou-keiji-anime-review-72-100/).)

Starting off as always, lets talk art and animation. Fugou Keiji’s art is easily one of my favorite aspects about its production. Something about the sharp, angular lines yet still realistic proportions lend it a sense of… style. I can’t quite figure out if its the linework, the slight softness to the angles or the characters eyes. Yet something about these designs really pique my interest. Its similar in a way to [Haikyuu](https://anilist.co/anime/20464/HAIKYU/), though that one is much more brightly colored. Regardless the art and aesthetic of Fugou Keiji is one of the parts I enjoy the most and it lends itself well to the series. When it wants to be comedic, its just low-detail enough to get away with silly expressions. Meanwhile when it needs to be serious it can up the linework/eye detail to draw the viewer in. Add on some special effects and you have Fugou Keiji.

That said, Fugou Keiji is by no means a sakuga-fest. There are good moments no doubt, and they mostly come in the second half as things ramp up. A few fights get special treatment as do some character moments. But its nothing that’s ever particularly impressive. There is no [Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/) episode 19 or or [KyoAni](https://anilist.co/studio/2/Kyoto-Animation) confession scene here. Rather for a large portion of its runtime Fugou Keiji gets by with the bare minimum of animation. Instead relying on the Character Design work of [Keigo Sasaki](https://anilist.co/staff/107638/Keigo-Sasaki) and his team along with the Director of Photography [Toshiyuki Aoshima’s](https://anilist.co/staff/146397/Toshiyuki-Aoshima) work. The best way to put it is that Fugou Keiji has no shortage of good looking stills. The series is well presented and well shot, which we will get into in a moment. But when the r/anime awards come, no one will be thinking of Fugou Keiji for animation.

Next up we come to the Direction, which I believe did most of the heavy lifting carrying Fugou Keiji. Well either that or the characters, but we will get to those. Generally I think Fugou Keiji was shot pretty well. It made good use of its locations and wasn’t afraid to go for some wackier or more “Michael Bay”-esque shots. Some might view that as a negative, but with how little we see it in anime and this basically being a James Bond show, it felt nice. Additionally the Fugou Keiji was rather varied color wise, never afraid to paint the screen in red and oranges, blues and blacks or greens and beige. It changed the color palette of the scene to fit the mood. And while some of those were very “anime” moods that didn’t quite fit at times, I enjoyed it.

There were really only 2 issues I actually had on this front with Fugou Keiji: The lighting and the tonal disparity. For lighting it was very up and down. Some scenes were fantastically lit, playing off the fire or casting shadows well while others were so dark it was almost impossible to see. I understand wanting to set the mood with the darkness, however there comes a point where audience experience takes precedence. As for tone, this goes back to the previously mentioned “wackier” shots. We will get into it more later, but its as if Fugou Keiji couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. A lot of its gags worked because of how the scene was shot and directed. Only for that same style to be brought into more serious scenes or vice versa, negatively impacting the shot.

I can’t say for certain if Fugou Keiji would be better if it had chosen one tone or the other. The comedy is just as much a part of the series as the mystery and neither can really live without the other. In this way it is clear that Fugou Keiji was trying to be something akin to Batman. Where the absurdity of a grown man in a spandex suit dressed as a bat somehow doesn’t take away from the serious drama. Where a man can murder his way through a city dressed as a colorful clown, yet still be one of the most complex and interesting villains in the medium. However unlike Batman, Fugou Keiji doesn’t quite nail this balancing act. It isn’t enough to ruin the show, and most of the time it isn’t a problem at all. But when it does crop up, you definitely notice.

But what about the story that Fugou Keiji’s art and animation tells, how is that? Had you asked me prior to the finale, I would have answered thus: It is a fun James Bond/Batman romp that can’t figure out what it wants to be. Flip flopping between comedy and crime drama, Fugou Keiji is split between two very different shows. One is a riff on the Tony Starks and Bruce Waynes of media, the super heroes who’s only power is “Money”. In Daisuke Kambe, it gives us a character with all the pride and snark and wealth but absolutely none of the sense of moral responsibility and plays the entire thing like the absurd joke it is. Spending billions of yen to bring in boy bands to placate hostage grannies on a train or buying a building just to blow it and the criminals inside up. Its absurd fun.

The other is a James Bond spy drama with twists and turns, murder and betrayal. Fugou Keiji introduces us to a core murder mystery early on and largely plays it straight. We have corrupt cops, internal politics and an ideological conflict between Kato and Daisuke. One seeking justice through the system and moral means, the other only seeking results regardless of the methods. It’s a very competent, if straight forward, setup. The issue though is that these two shows are taking place in the same timeslot with the same characters, but largely feel independent of each other. The comedy gets in the way of the serious drama. Meanwhile the drama waters down the comedy. Early this is fine, comedy is the focus, and only becomes a problem as we dive deeper and deeper into the core conflict. At least that is what I would have said until the finale.

Let me be clear, the finale is by no means perfect. Fugou Keiji is, at the end of the day, a fun mystery romp that doesn’t take itself very seriously. But the finale, without spoiling it, brought these two disparate shows together. It managed to throw in one last twice, give us one last serious character conflict for our leads and resolve both in such a way that I couldn’t help but laugh along with Daisuke. Fugou Keiji’s story isn’t going to wow you by any means. It might take you by surprise in a few places and it will most definitely disappoint you in a few more, though we will talk about that later. What it will do though is deliver on its initial promise: Entertainment. I was never not entertained by Fugou Keiji and its story. And at the end of the day, what’s more important than that?

img()


And now we come to the characters, the core of the show! I’ll just come right out and say that I really enjoyed Fugou Keiji’s characters. Kato and Daisuke bounced off of each other well and though their arcs weren’t perfect, the finale did a lot for them as well. Early on they are portrayed as your usual double act, Kato as the straight man and Daisuke as the funny man. Fugou Keiji has a slight twist on this in that Daisuke is stoic while Kato is the one who overreacts. But Daisuke is also the source of the absurdity 90% of the time. In a way it adds another layer to the dynamic, making it seem even more absurd and comedic when Daisuke takes his own absurdity with complete sincerity. More than once what made the comedy work was Daisuke’s complete and utter non-reaction, and it was great.

As the series progresses, and we start to see the narrative issue mentioned before, the characters shift as well. The comedy is still there but Fugou Keiji starts to show us deeper aspects of who they are. Starts to establish them as actual people rather than comedic stereotypes. We come to see what Daisuke’s home life is like, how pampered and naïve he is when it comes to the real world. Similarly we see Kato’s rigid moral compass and his frugal way of living. The two start to bounce off of and effect each other in meaningful ways, with the comedy just facilitating this exchange. The only real negative I have about the characters is that their arcs seem… underutilized? The next paragraph is going to contain spoilers for their arcs, so please read at your own risk. Otherwise just know that I enjoy them but wish they were more.

!All in all, I quite enjoyed Fugou Keiji’s characters despite the fact that they could’ve been more. It did a great job of easing us into them. Using the early comedy to establish their dynamic and the premise of the show without expecting us to be invested in a serious drama right off the bat. It gave the audience time to get used to and get to know the characters. To come to care for them before the big life-threatening plot. And so when that plot did come around, the audience is already emotionally invested and prepared to care about their actions. The best way to put it I think is that Fugou Keiji slow-rolled us on the feels and it worked out. I will gladly take this over any number of drama shows that expect me to care about my leads dead mother or whatever right out the gate.!

Finally we come to the OST, which I love. Sadly as of writing this, the OST is not officially released. At least not in a way I can get my hands on it. This makes linking to specific songs difficult but I will try my best. The only way I can really describe Fugou Keiji’s OST is fire. My two favorite, and best, examples of this have to be the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4kZOh7yEOQ) and the [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F874mBpLI14), the ED being one of my favorites of the year. Between the lyrics, the beat and the slow almost refined sound of the bass I love it. I can’t quite think of the word to describe it, as it isn’t “Jazz” in the slightest. Yet I get a very similar vibe from Fugou Keiji’s OST as I do Jazz music. This style, this distinct and prominent rhythm, etc. And it goes beyond just the bookend songs.

Granted, most of the time Fugou Keiji’s OST felt rather average. Some strings, a basic orchestra in the back, the kind of mood setting music you would expect. It neither really enhanced or took away from whatever scene it was in. Every now and then though you would get something like this: [Warning, this contains spoilers for episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mtm5lCRmFM&t=26s). You would get some kind of stylish or absurd piece that fit the moment perfectly. It could come in for something silly like this or it could be the perfect song to tie together a dramatic moment. I wish I had an actual OST to link you to, with specific songs to prove my points. I am not nearly musically educated or eloquent enough to make this point. So instead all I can say is this: I have 0 complaints about this OST, and I doubt you will either.

img()


Now you might be wondering, what the hell is this section of the review and why should I read it? This is basically where I am going to talk about what I wish Fugou Keiji had done differently. Why criticize something without at least trying to be constructive about it, right? This has no bearing on the final score and is entirely my lobbing ideas. My hope is that it will give some perspective to you read above, why I liked some things and not others etc. And fair warning, there will be some serious spoilers in here. Don’t read it if you haven’t already watched Fugou Keiji. Now lets roll!

!Now in case you haven’t guessed yet, my biggest issue with Fugou Keiji is the tonal inconsistency of it. For a large portion of it’s runtime, Fugou Keiji can’t decide if it wants to be a parody of Tony Stark/Bruce Wayne or an actual detective/mystery thriller. It sort of makes this transition in episode 4, as it leaves behind a lot of the absurdity, but not completely. And I would have preferred it if it had committed more to that switch. Take the AR setup they use to get Takei to basically confess. Not only does this come out of nowhere, but it completely undermines a possible 3 way conflict between Cho, Takei and Daisuke. We could have had an entire arc of them going against each other before they recognize they are on the same side. Instead Fugou Keiji introduces and resolves it in a single episode.

Beyond that Fugou Keiji didn’t use its premise as strongly as it could’ve. Take for instance HEUSC, Daisuke’s AI helper and companion for the show. We learn early on that it cannot be trusted, that someone else is using it and able to shut Daisuke out. And yet Daisuke and Suzue never stop trusting or using HEUSC. There is no conflict there, no distrust, nothing ever happens with that plot point. Fugou Keiji could have had Daisuke take control of HEUSC back, give us another small arc of him without his money/resources and show how he has learned from Kato in doing things the old fashioned way. It also could have been used to let the villain compete with Daisuke on the whole “Balance Unlimited” side of things to. It just feels like HEUSC is underutilized as a plot element, stuck as nothing more than a fancy tool.

None of this is to say that Fugou Keiji is bad, it certainly isn’t. I was never not entertained while watching it, and at the end of the day, that’s the most important thing in my mind. I was always ready for the next episode, even if I ended the episode thinking it could have been more. And credit where its due, Fugou Keiji managed to pull out a fantastic twist at the end that doubled up on the both the character and narrative arcs of the series. Just because I think Fugou Keiji could have been more and used its premise better doesn’t invalidate the work it did put in and what it did accomplish.!

img()


So all in all, at the end of the day, how was Fugou Keiji: Balance: Unlimited? Well for all of its faults, despite the fact that I think it could have been a 10/10, that doesn’t undo what it did accomplish. I was never not entertained by Fugou Keiji, I was always looking forward to the next episode. And while I might end those episodes thinking they could have been more, at the end of the day, I think its the entertainment that matters. Not every show has to reach for the stars and make some grand philosophical argument. Its nice when it happens, but there is nothing wrong with some popcorn crime drama. And Fugou Keiji delivers on that popcorn crime drama and then some.

There's a few things i need to say before hand. First, i saw this movie in Japan theaters (which at the moment i think is the only place its out) so that means there are obviously no subtitles, the reason I'm here is to study Japanese so i do know some Japanese and i could understand about 85-90% of what was being said + the visuals i think i understood quite well, but I'm sure i missed a few things here and there. I am also a big fan of [Makoto Shinkai](https://anilist.co/staff/96117/Makoto-Shinkai) and the studio he directs so i might be a bit biased. This review will be mostly spoiler free meaning there will be slight spoiler like very general plot points and short characters descriptions but barely more than you get from the trailer if even any more. I think that's all to know before hand now for the review 

To me the enjoyment of the movie was split into 3 parts. The opening (20-30 minutes); early/middle (30-60 minutes); and the later middle/ending. I think the opening was very good and introduced things quite well but things did happen quite quickly compared to most of his previous films. There wasn't a ton of downtime in the begging of the the movie where as in [Weathering with you](https://anilist.co/anime/106286/Weathering-With-You/), for example, its a pretty relaxed movie until about  2/3 into it. This movie starts the action in the first 10-15 minutes and then slows down a bit in the middle. This is neither good or bad necessarily, just depends on what you prefer.  

Story - 8.5/10
The general idea of the story (as you see a bit in the trailer) is there are these doors that burst out with this red cloud looking things and the main characters have to close them. There is of course a bit more to it than that but keeping it spoiler free that's all you need to know. I think this is quite an interesting and unique idea so i don't have any problems with it. I also think there are some very good plot turns that make me prefer the seconds have of the movie more than the first (the first isn't bad by any means, i just felt like things were better in the second half). I also like how they travel to different parts of Japan in the film, i think it is cool to get different visuals, especially with how good the animation is. And as someone who is in Japan and plans to travel its cool to see. 

img350()

Animation/Visuals - 10 
Of course being a Makoto Shinkai film the animation and visuals will be spectacular. And they are. The are just as good or better than the previous films and you can tell they didn't spare any expense and really did the best they could. There wasn't any scenes are parts that i thought looked weird or felt off, everything was very smooth and fluid. During the relaxed parts of the movie where you just see a mundane, everyday objects and scenery, everything still looks amazing, and when the beautiful scenery came into screen, things looks absolutely amazing. The way this studio does color and lighting makes every scene look super good. 

img350(

Music/Sound - 9.5-10
Another obvious one. The music and sound are also always on point on these movies. With [RADWIMPS](https://anilist.co/staff/126955/RADWIMPS) doing the soundtrack again its a sure bet that its going to sound amazing. and sure enough it does. I think that the OST is amazing. The sound they make just fits so well into the world that Makoto Shinkai creates. I think it is just as good as the Your Name and Weathering with you soundtracks.

img300()

Characters - 9
The characters in this movie were very good. I really like the dynamic between the characters. I also think the way that the male lead get turned into a 3 legged chair makes for an interesting change in how the movie plays out. Without saying too much there is also a cat in the movie that plays and interesting role that i quite like. Seeing the characters and their relationships with each other change and grow throughout the movie is very satisfying by the end of it. 

img350()

Final Thoughts
Not sure if this review makes sense, i find it hard to explain whats good and bad about a series without spoiling it but i like to keep it spoiler free. But either way i recommend anyone who likes Your Name, Weathering with you or and other Makoto Shinkai movie to watch. Its hard to say which movie i think is best because they are all so good. i think it just comes down to what plot point you prefer, but i will say with confidence it doesn't fall behind his other films. That's all i have, Thank you for your time."
100183,"So I just finished this show and let me tell you--it was a fun ride. Initially I wrote the show off to be another Sword Art Online piece of cliche garbage, but when I grudgingly watched the first episode I found myself entertained beyond my belief. The show starts off ridiculously and honestly ends ridiculously, but throughout the entirety of it I had fun. So getting that off my chest I'll jump right into it the review.

Story: 85/100
The show didn't try to be too deep, and to be honest it shouldn't be. It's supposed to be fun, and I think that really came across well. Another huge thing in its favor was that one doesn't have to have watched Sword Art Online to watch this show. There are a few mentions of it and some easter eggs here and there, but nothing that would take away from someone who hadn't seen SAO.

Art: 80/100
Not much to say here, but the art was decent enough for the show and the action shots were done well enough that no blaring mistakes were evident. I did notice some CGI in the last few episodes, which was a little irritating, but overall pretty good.

Sound: 90/100
I absolutely loved this show's sound effects and OST. The insert songs were nice and were a nice change of pace, and the ED was absolutely amazing. The OP was a little underwhelming, but not bad, and the normal action scene soundtracks were engaging enough. Not really much to say here, except for crediting Kusunoki Tomori with that amazing ED.

Characters: 80/100
The characters were well done in this show. They didn't try to make any of the characters particularly deep or really have any huge character development, but they were still funny characters. To me, the really only stand out characters were LLENN and Pitou with their small but meaningful character progression, and I thought that that was good enough for the show.

Enjoyment: 95/100
As I mentioned earlier, I had a blast watching this show, and surprisingly with all the other big shows coming out this season, I enjoyed this the most out of all of them. The fights were serious yet really funny, and the cuts back to Karen in the real world were to me the most enjoyable moments in the show. I can't really place my finger on why I enjoyed this show so much, but maybe it was the pink loli killing grown men with a p-90, maybe it was the ridiculousness of Karen's height difference when she was LLENN, or the amazons, or countless other things I made me love every minute of this show.

Overall: 90/100
As I have stated above, this show was really fun to watch for so many reasons, and I think was just what I need to watch at that time--A light hearted show that isn't moe or a typical comedy. I hope that this review encourages all of you guys to watch this show and to not think too hard about it and just enjoy it for what it is: A pink loli slaughtering people in the cruelest ways imaginable."

I Won’t let you die


.

There are a lot of things I want to say about this series, but I’ll try to keep it as concise as possible.  Every part of this show left me speechless.  I couldn't believe I could feel this passionate about a show ever since Made In Abyss, but here we are now.  86 was a show that had a lot to offer, whether it be its in-depth story telling, the significant growth of each and every character through their trials and tribulations, the relationships shared between each of the cast and heck, even the more materialistic stuff such as animations, soundtrack, etc.  Now, I haven’t watched my fair share of mecha, regardless of which I can confidently say that this is a competitor for being considered one of the best in the genre.  This show genuinely gave me the feeling that everyone working on it had nothing but love and passion for this series, and that’s what made this a masterpiece in my eyes.  Eighty Six has achieved heights most adaptations could only ever dream of achieving and set the bar for future light novel adaptations. 

Taking inspiration from World War II Germany, 86 is a show that gives you an insight into a future where war dominates the world.  A world where death on the battlefield is most significant.  A world where racism & segregation is the norm, a tragic tale of being forced onto the battlefield even before getting a proper grasp on life.  This show leaves you thinking a lot about such events that occur throughout, and for me personally, it has left a very lasting impression that won't falter for a very long time to come.  

.

Don’t leave me

.
The very first thing I’m gonna get into is the animations in 86.  As expected from A-1 Pictures, they did not miss in the slightest with the animations, especially in episode 11 (which I will go more into later).  As for the CGI, while I was initially concerned about the use of CGI for the legion troops before I started watching the show, this easily turned out to be some of the best CGI i’ve ever seen, with amazing attention to details and fluid movement, which makes it almost impossible for me to imagine 86 without the CGI legions, which would feel worse.  That is something that I would usually never say about CGI.  Besides that, the show had really beautiful sceneries and many wallpaper worthy shots throughout the show.

.
I won’t forget..
.

The second season of 86 (or part 2 at this point I don't know anymore) gave more significance to Shin and his gang in contrast to season 1, which gave almost equal significance to both Lena and the spearhead squadron.  While I was initially slightly disappointed to see the lack of Lena, that disappointment soon faded to nothing as the plot began picking up its pace and I got heavily invested in the spearhead squadrons life beyond the republic.  

Though with that being said, the true star of the show was Shin.

Throughout the show, we get to see Shin grow substantially as an individual, to find the meaning of life beyond killing his brother and to go from an emotionless battle machine to becoming someone that does not have to be dependent on his brother in order to keep moving forward in life, coming to appreciate several other things which he otherwise would not have before.  Now we know that even though he wouldn't stop being as reckless as he is, he would atleast stop putting himself into suicidal situations, and the person mainly responsible for bringing such a change in him is none other than our queen Lena

When we talk about character development, we most certainly cannot forget about Lena.  We get to observe in both seasons just how much Lena has grown.  From learning how simply compassion is not enough to bring a change and realizing her own limitations in the process, refusing to let the fact that she is a minority amongst the alba stop her.  Over the course of the two seasons she has time and time again proven to us how she went from a person who we could respect to a person we could truly respect AND look up to.    

.

I won’t forget...

I feel like I need to dedicate one section to just episode 11, simply because of the piece of art it was.  Going into a 3 month hiatus was considered to be critical damage to 86 as a show, but with its return 3 months later, it transcended all expectations and silenced all critics.  The beginning parts of the episode gave us an insight into Shins mentality, using several unorthodox means particularly such as the aspect ratio (black bars) and more throughout the episode.  Now, I won't be going too deep into every bit of information from the episode as that would take too long, but the episode was filled to the brim with symbolism, and i'm sure even now I still haven't found most of the things that Ishii tried to convey with this episode regardless of the countless amounts of times I rewatched this episode.  As someone who's read the light novel, I can confidently say that the anime and especially this episode were way better than the light novel version of events.  Though the LN is amazing, the anime took things one step further.

Another thing worth mentioning was the soundtrack used in one particular scene.  The usage of the OST ""Voices Of The Chord"" was simply perfect for the moment and genuinely left me with tears in my eyes when the scene happened.  That scene had so much impact mainly because you could tell something changed within Shin once he found out Lena was still alive and when she told him he should still be proud of himself for fighting and surviving till the end.
.

I won’t forget...

.

Since we are on the topic of soundtracks, I might as well give credits to the man behind the musical masterpiece himself, Hiroyuki Sawano.  Those who keep up with the anime industry on a regular basis surely have heard of this name.  That is because he has made the soundtrack for many popular shows such as Attack on Titan which were incredible good, and yet again he delivered in full force with his soundtrack for 86.  His soundtrack added so much impact in several moments, particularly one I mentioned above and elevated my enjoyment even further, not to mention even composing the two EDs in season 1 which too were amazing.  Along with that, I should give credit to Kohta Yamamoto who's also composed for popular shows such as AOT and who composed around half of the soundtracks for 86 alongside Sawano.  Both of them did an incredible job.  Some of my favorite 86 tracks by them are ""Voices Of The Chord"", ""The Answer"", ""8SIX"" and ""Region"".

.

I won’t forget....

.


In conclusion, no matter which direction you look at this show from, whether it be its story, animations or soundtrack, this show is the true definition of a masterpiece, easily the best light novel adaptation I have ever seen and a show I can confidently call the undisputed goat of 2021.  

I am really grateful to the original author Asato sensei, the director Ishii Toshimasa and everyone else that was involved in creating this masterpiece, and I look forward to seeing more from them in the near future.  Since the anime had a perfect conclusion, I wouldn't complain a lot if we never get a sequel but even so I really hope that one day we can see another masterpiece of a season, and I will be eagerly waiting for that day no matter how long it takes, be it 2 years or even 4.

21093,"Monster girls, monster girls everywhere. Imagine if they could be a part of a harem series with one lucky guy forced to take care of them by law. What's that? The word harem immediately makes you instantly gag just from trying to enunciate that term? I don't blame you. Great harem shows have been a dime a dozen, besides those that were and are already in continuation. When new ones crop up, they do not add anything new or exciting, just more and more formulaic as time goes on. So what is to be done to amend this curse? Put in cute and sexy monster girls in it, of course!

It is possible to add a new element to an anime from a specific genre and succeed in giving a modern edge to the anime. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a prime example of something like this succeeding at a level that I did not think would be possible. If Monster Musume, hypothetically speaking, did not have monster girls as the harem and it was just ordinary girls, I don't think it would've had as much of an impact. Unlike human girls, monster girls have abilities from their bodies and state of mind that can create all kinds of unique jokes and sexy situations that you wouldn't find in a typical harem show. This uniqueness is where Monster Musume has more going for it in its humor and story. New scenarios involving monstrous entities with tentacles, wings, and other strange things add something interesting that we aren't used to.



There is not much to say about the story other than that it involves a slightly exciting world of monsters being integrated into the human world. The only issue with it is that it does not explain it very intuitively to the point where I just nodded off halfway through. But from the way the show portrays itself as a silly harem/ecchi anime, it knows how ridiculous it is and runs with it. Even the title itself is translated as ""Daily Life with a Monster Girl."" This is what most ecchi/harem anime should strive for when developing a story of this nature.

I will briefly go through one by one of each character since this is, after all, a character-driven anime based on how good the girls and male protagonists are. There are a lot, so bear with me for a moment. Miia-chan, the lamia snake-like monster, is the best one out of the rest. Thanks to the sweet voice of Sora Amamiya, her caring and cute personality is infectious. Not to mention her ""darling"" catchphrase is one that I can't preface about how heart-inducing it is. Papi, the bird-like harpy monster, is the bootylicious loli of the group who has some pretty hilarious moments due to her childlike curiosity. Cerea, the centaur monster, is probably my least favorite, but she is still quite enjoyable with her humorous attempts at being noble and knightly to her master.



Suu, the humanoid-like water goo-ish monster, has a peculiar essence about her from how she interacts with the characters. Because she can't speak well to people at first, we see her grow up with everyone and start learning how to become an adult later in the show. Her morphing technique and almost drowning the protagonist with her own body are amusing. Meroune, the mermaid monster, does get a bad rep as being the worst girl, but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I've always enjoyed seeing her wanting to get married to the protagonist and her attempts at seducing quite alluring in more cases than one. Finally, Rachnera, the giant spider monster, is easily the 2nd best out of the bunch. This is primarily because of her entertaining sadism towards the characters, making her unique among the harem. One scene involving a dullahan and her is especially noteworthy, which I won't spoil for those who are not aware.

Our protagonist, Kimihito Kurusu, is surprisingly one of the show's highlights. His reckless and commanding attitude is a breath of fresh air compared to other harem protagonists who do not have the same level of bravery as females. His actions that involve helping the girls from being downtrodden in human society, particularly one scene involving him punching monster bigots so hard that they fly through the door, make him quite likable in this regard. He does have his dumb moments here and there, but in context to the situation, they fit well in a comedy scenario where he does not have much control over a bunch of monster girls that are entirely different from human girls. He is not an overly perverted protagonist who we would all root for, like Tomoki from Heaven's Lost Property or Youto in Hentai Ouji. Still, he manages to have a subtle sexual interest at the right time.



My only big issue with the cast is that we do not get to explore the supporting cast as much as we'd like. Sure, Sumisu has great moments involving the supervision of Kimihito's care for the girls, but I do not get the same feeling with the other characters. The MON (Monster of a Neuro) squad, in particular, has this problem. There might be one episode where Kimihito goes on a date with all of them, but other than that, it was hard for me actually to give them any thought compared to the main girls. They will explore them more in the 2nd season, and I hope that that is the case. One exception to the supporting cast is Lala, the dullahan monster, who has one of the most memorable moments involving her head and an independent body in the entire show. Again, no spoilers, but it's worth seeing Monster Musume for that alone.

From a technical standpoint, Monster Musume's art assets are pretty good from how shiny and colorful the character designs are. I also enjoy the funny character face reactions whenever something lewd, scary, or surprising happens every time they occur. The backgrounds, however, are not something to write at home about. It is quite plain and average to see on-screen most of the time. There is the issue of the OP/ED music. The OP is okay; I liked the chorus of the girls chanting ""Monster! Monster!"" at the beginning, but the rest just felt underwhelming.  Same with the ED, although I tend to question how it fits with the show's tone at all. I know it features the monster squad, which are the active characters of the anime, but it felt like an ED to an action anime overall, not a comedy/ecchi one.



I had read the Monster Musume manga a little before getting into this, so I expected much of what I got. And what I got was enough for me to say it was an entertaining harem that reminds me how harem shows can be incredibly enjoyable. You need to add a different spin to the genre, and Monster Musume proves that you can do that successfully. Is it a game-changing spin that will change it? Not at all. There's so much added to the genre, but so little for it to be anything but enjoyable escapism.

Grade: A-"
7791,"So I watched K-On originally with little to no expectations, i basically knew nothing aside from the fact that it was supposedly good. Here I am today though on my 5th rewatch in like 5 months, my favourite anime by a landslide really. One reason for this is just how easy the show is to watch, most of it is just the main 5/Sawako fucking around with any drama rarely entering the story, which means it never really gets tiresome. There's more to it though, few things can make me as emotional as some of the later episodes of S2. The series does a really good job of showing the friendship and bonds between the main 5 girls growing over the series, how they change each other and grow closer. Because of that, despite the series seemingly episodic nature when you compare early season 1 to late season 2 you can tell the differences just from the subtleties in the character's interactions with one another, how they all grow closer to and more comfortable around Yui especially over the course of season 1 with episode 12 being the culmination of that. It's one of my favourite episodes because of it, despite how simple it is the re-enactment of the episode 1 scene resonates really hard with me because the idea of Yui finding a place with her friends who truly care for her even after only joining after feeling obligated to do something is incredibly real feeling. Ritsu's ""We all love you, Yui"" feels an especially sincere line. But yeah, despite how much I love season 1 season 2 is an improvement in basically every regard, from direction to humour, with the Azusa/Ui/Jun episodes being the only ones I don't consider excellent in some right. The frequent showings of the turtle/the presence of Ton-chan being a representation of the show's message to take life slowly and enjoy it are wonderful. A big fan of how the series has it's characters realise things like this, with episode 4 of Season 1 (reinforced by episode 9) showing that Mio is the first one to truly understand how valuable their time together as friends is. Episode 20 is probably my favourite episode, even above 24, because it feels like a non-stop celebration of everything the series has been til now. I get emotional from the second the Sawako scene happens, and U and I is likely my favourite Hokago Tea Time song not just because it sounds awesome but due to the context in which it's played on both occasions; someone as airheaded as Yui trying to get across her sincere appreciation through song is incredibly touching, and when it's played in 20 it feels like a thank you from Yui to everyone who has supported her up until now. Then of course the scene after the concert is perfection from beginning to end, makes me cry every time I watch it. It's so beautifully done, the slow realisation that their time together after school is slowly coming to an end hits the audience exactly as it does the characters.
In conclusion, this is the first time I've ever really tried to write anything so it's probably a mess but I fucking love K-On, it's the best."
98444,"that's my first review in english, so... sorry for the mistakes



- Yuru Camp

img220()

the meaning of a relaxing watch, you may think that this could a slow paced anime, but not, it's just perfect, and COMFY, the character, the story, the OST's, the animation, everything, so COMFY, you cannot watch this without a smile on your face (like Nadeshiko), it's just everything so happy, and COMFY.

The story is basically 5 school friend that likes to camp (saitou too), and that's it haha, but fits you in phenomenally, it's just too smooth and soft and relaxing and COMFY.



- The characters

img220()

1. Shimarin (gonna call rin like that hihi): the pro camping girl, who likes to camp alone and have just one friend (saitou) until the show begins, her personality it's like that ""sasuke"" character, doesnt show many emotions, but it's a really nice person and has a little development during the anime.

2. Nadeshiko: the most pure and happy girl in the history of animes, you cannot see her and not smile, she transpires good emotions, so truthful, and it's her who ""changes"" Shimarin, makes her like camp with other people, and it's her too who gather the group to become friends so all could camp together. She also it's like that shounen protagonist (in the good way), happy and eats a lot.

3. Ohgaki: The founder of the outdoor activities club with Aoi, Ohgaki is the ""clown"" of the group, who jokes the most, making a contrast with the appearance, being that type of character who uses glasses.

4. Aoi: The founder of the outdoor activities club with Ohgaki, Aoi is my favorite character, she has some kind of Shimarin and Nadeshiko personalities, being the most ""adult"" of the group, who seems to be more responsable, and yeah, she is really the mix of those two haha

5. Saitou: i think she is the girl who less appears, but she is cool too, because she is a combo character, comes with the ""Chikuwa"", a Chiwawa.



- The OST and the animation

img220()

THE OPENING, so energic and beautiful, the rythim is exactly like ""ABC"" from the jackson 5 haha, fits perfectly with this anime.

THE ENDING, so calm and beautiful, brings the sensation of a real camping, fits perfectly with this anime.

THE OST's, so camping, like the ost's from One Piece it's so pirates, this is so camping.

The animation itself is nothing too special, but for a anime from that gender, it's very good, soft and all. The scenes of Nadeshiko and Aoi smiling is simply perfect, warms your heart.



- Conclusion

img220()

i really loved this anime, i've only not favorited because the story it's nothing special, like Sora Yori, but if the season 2 and the movie be on the same level from the first season, i'm gonna change my mind. I realized that that was the most COMFY anime i've ever saw when i noticed that i was smiling while watching hahaha specially when Nadeshiko and Aoi appears. 

if you are in doubt of this worth or not worth to watch, i'm just gonna say that you should not expect something masterpiece, but if you want to relax and watch with a hot chocolate and a blanket, this is the perfect anime for it"

The fire may have slowly died down in Nisekoi: but the lingering warmth and erratic flickering of the flames are enough to awaken my comedic spirits. Observing the characters in this season is laugh-inducing. On the other hand, the lack of a story could define it as a time-waster.

Continuing from its prequel, the charming cast is back with their romantic stresses close by. This time, rather than having an underlying plot with the pendant and the promised girl that we've gotten from before, it shifted more towards everyday activities. Episodic and digestible, everything is given off with a comedic spray full of love issues. In short, comedy has become a dominant replacement. Misunderstandings, inconveniences, and exaggerations are scattered throughout. Repetitions are present and some of the jokes are too forced to get any laughs out of me but overall, it has a great chemistry with various personalities reacting in entertaining manners. All that said, a few episodes are actually dedicated to short story lines that feature the main characters' history, giving each some spotlight. Other than unlocking more aspects with their characterization, from childhood memories to family ties, it also shows how they handled romance at their own pace. New characters are introduced to highlight them as well although the lack of screen time means that any chances of investment are erased with the exception of Kosaki's sister, Haru Onodera. Witnessing her contradictions and ever-growing awareness towards Raku is a really fun high point for this season.

Coating the surface of their everyday lives, the art remains as dazzling as ever. Playing around with lighting and mixing in geometric backgrounds creates a highly-spirited ambience. It's sparkly and glimmers about with rainbow colors. With the above average animation exaggerating many visual gags, entertainment is there to tickle you at every corner. The presence of Shaft's distinct style, including prolonged close-up shots, achieves personal connections with the characters. Feeling their cuteness and embarrassments, their emotions are expressed as an appealing factor for your best girl of choice. Moe and chibi comedy captivates me while the jolly kind of soundtracks playing in the background click with the fun vibes. They are gentle on every scene. If the characters' attractive appearances aren't enough for you, the voice acting serves as a delightful personality enhancer. They bring out a matching quality to let their persona shine through. From Chitoge's more-dere-less-tsun attitude and Kosaki's adorable endearment to Marika's clingy obsession or even Seishirou's tomboy coolness, despite the differences, they all have a similar feminine quality that is alluring and entertaining to listen to. Haru's voice seems like she is about to lose her voice though but nevertheless, it is definitely cute.

Nisekoi: manages to operate with its still strong hilarities although the faded plot progression signifies a lower glamor compared to before. It's a season of laughter with small hints for the promised girl. And if you don't mind that, it's a nice bundle of fun to enjoy in your free time."
154965,"Loving Yamada at LV999! is a show that can best be described by the word bland.
img1220()
It follows a college girl by the name of Akane, freshly dumped and in search of a way to make her ex feel jealous. This plot of hers fails spectacularly, but coincidentally she meets a pro gamer that just so happens to be attending the same gaming convention by the name of Yamada. She ends up telling him her woes and somehow by getting drunk, she ends up in his bed. However, he never intended to do anything with her. He's just a good guy who's decided to take care of a stranger in need. That's pretty much the summary of the first episode - a solid opening, full of potential. Unfortunately, the character's emotions are never fully explored and we get stuck with a bland story. For a show that's supposed to be a romantic comedy, it doesn't have many funny moments. In fact, it doesn't even have many romantic moments. So... what is it? Well, I'd describe it as a slice of life in which Akane decides to pursue a guy who showed her kindness and her path to getting the courage to come to terms with her insecurities and confess.... wait actually no, that's not what happened here.

Now I'll be entering SPOILER territory because It would be difficult to explain what's wrong with this show otherwise.
 
Instead of Akane confessing her feelings to him, he confesses first while she's drunk. Okay, so maybe the point was Yamada getting past his complete awkwardness and developing feelings for a woman for the first time in his life? The way I'm describing this sounds cute and very mature actually. Two people get past their insecurities and break into the unknown so that they could be together. But it just feels... weak. The show is paced very poorly and many of its episodes are wasted on characters that make no difference in the end and are not interesting in the slightest (looking at you Runa and Kamota). It would be interesting if that time was spent more on Yamada's relationship with the classmate that also likes him, but she was introduced very late, and because of that Yamada's rejection failed to trigger any emotional response from me. In fact, nothing triggered any emotional response from me here.
img1220()
They didn't bond by doing much together, the game they were supposed to play together... well, they never actually play it together. It's mostly just Akane playing it with the rest of their little game guild. And their relationship develops mostly by Akane bothering Yamada every now and then and Yamada taking care of her when she's in a bit. The last episode flops so badly, there's no kiss, there's no romantic tension, there's no charming funny moments. They get together just ... like that. And that might in fact be pretty realistic, but it doesn't make for a entertaining watch.
This is a show with bland characters, and a very unimaginative basic story with no real heart put into it. At the end of the day, it is pretty harmless and inoffensive, its biggest fault being that it's simply boring. I'm unwilling to give it a lower score just because if you watch many episodes in a vacuum, they're not bad. But how it's all connected didn't reveal what the point of me watching this show was. I didn't have fun, I haven't felt emotion, and I didn't laugh. I just... consumed a very average show with little meaning.

THE OPENING, so energic and beautiful, the rythim is exactly like ""ABC"" from the jackson 5 haha, fits perfectly with this anime.

THE ENDING, so calm and beautiful, brings the sensation of a real camping, fits perfectly with this anime.

THE OST's, so camping, like the ost's from One Piece it's so pirates, this is so camping.

The animation itself is nothing too special, but for a anime from that gender, it's very good, soft and all. The scenes of Nadeshiko and Aoi smiling is simply perfect, warms your heart.



- Conclusion

img220()

i really loved this anime, i've only not favorited because the story it's nothing special, like Sora Yori, but if the season 2 and the movie be on the same level from the first season, i'm gonna change my mind. I realized that that was the most COMFY anime i've ever saw when i noticed that i was smiling while watching hahaha specially when Nadeshiko and Aoi appears. 

if you are in doubt of this worth or not worth to watch, i'm just gonna say that you should not expect something masterpiece, but if you want to relax and watch with a hot chocolate and a blanket, this is the perfect anime for it"

The fire may have slowly died down in Nisekoi: but the lingering warmth and erratic flickering of the flames are enough to awaken my comedic spirits. Observing the characters in this season is laugh-inducing. On the other hand, the lack of a story could define it as a time-waster.

Continuing from its prequel, the charming cast is back with their romantic stresses close by. This time, rather than having an underlying plot with the pendant and the promised girl that we've gotten from before, it shifted more towards everyday activities. Episodic and digestible, everything is given off with a comedic spray full of love issues. In short, comedy has become a dominant replacement. Misunderstandings, inconveniences, and exaggerations are scattered throughout. Repetitions are present and some of the jokes are too forced to get any laughs out of me but overall, it has a great chemistry with various personalities reacting in entertaining manners. All that said, a few episodes are actually dedicated to short story lines that feature the main characters' history, giving each some spotlight. Other than unlocking more aspects with their characterization, from childhood memories to family ties, it also shows how they handled romance at their own pace. New characters are introduced to highlight them as well although the lack of screen time means that any chances of investment are erased with the exception of Kosaki's sister, Haru Onodera. Witnessing her contradictions and ever-growing awareness towards Raku is a really fun high point for this season.

Coating the surface of their everyday lives, the art remains as dazzling as ever. Playing around with lighting and mixing in geometric backgrounds creates a highly-spirited ambience. It's sparkly and glimmers about with rainbow colors. With the above average animation exaggerating many visual gags, entertainment is there to tickle you at every corner. The presence of Shaft's distinct style, including prolonged close-up shots, achieves personal connections with the characters. Feeling their cuteness and embarrassments, their emotions are expressed as an appealing factor for your best girl of choice. Moe and chibi comedy captivates me while the jolly kind of soundtracks playing in the background click with the fun vibes. They are gentle on every scene. If the characters' attractive appearances aren't enough for you, the voice acting serves as a delightful personality enhancer. They bring out a matching quality to let their persona shine through. From Chitoge's more-dere-less-tsun attitude and Kosaki's adorable endearment to Marika's clingy obsession or even Seishirou's tomboy coolness, despite the differences, they all have a similar feminine quality that is alluring and entertaining to listen to. Haru's voice seems like she is about to lose her voice though but nevertheless, it is definitely cute.

Nisekoi: manages to operate with its still strong hilarities although the faded plot progression signifies a lower glamor compared to before. It's a season of laughter with small hints for the promised girl. And if you don't mind that, it's a nice bundle of fun to enjoy in your free time."
154965,"Loving Yamada at LV999! is a show that can best be described by the word bland.
img1220()
It follows a college girl by the name of Akane, freshly dumped and in search of a way to make her ex feel jealous. This plot of hers fails spectacularly, but coincidentally she meets a pro gamer that just so happens to be attending the same gaming convention by the name of Yamada. She ends up telling him her woes and somehow by getting drunk, she ends up in his bed. However, he never intended to do anything with her. He's just a good guy who's decided to take care of a stranger in need. That's pretty much the summary of the first episode - a solid opening, full of potential. Unfortunately, the character's emotions are never fully explored and we get stuck with a bland story. For a show that's supposed to be a romantic comedy, it doesn't have many funny moments. In fact, it doesn't even have many romantic moments. So... what is it? Well, I'd describe it as a slice of life in which Akane decides to pursue a guy who showed her kindness and her path to getting the courage to come to terms with her insecurities and confess.... wait actually no, that's not what happened here.

Now I'll be entering SPOILER territory because It would be difficult to explain what's wrong with this show otherwise.
 
Instead of Akane confessing her feelings to him, he confesses first while she's drunk. Okay, so maybe the point was Yamada getting past his complete awkwardness and developing feelings for a woman for the first time in his life? The way I'm describing this sounds cute and very mature actually. Two people get past their insecurities and break into the unknown so that they could be together. But it just feels... weak. The show is paced very poorly and many of its episodes are wasted on characters that make no difference in the end and are not interesting in the slightest (looking at you Runa and Kamota). It would be interesting if that time was spent more on Yamada's relationship with the classmate that also likes him, but she was introduced very late, and because of that Yamada's rejection failed to trigger any emotional response from me. In fact, nothing triggered any emotional response from me here.
img1220()
They didn't bond by doing much together, the game they were supposed to play together... well, they never actually play it together. It's mostly just Akane playing it with the rest of their little game guild. And their relationship develops mostly by Akane bothering Yamada every now and then and Yamada taking care of her when she's in a bit. The last episode flops so badly, there's no kiss, there's no romantic tension, there's no charming funny moments. They get together just ... like that. And that might in fact be pretty realistic, but it doesn't make for a entertaining watch.
This is a show with bland characters, and a very unimaginative basic story with no real heart put into it. At the end of the day, it is pretty harmless and inoffensive, its biggest fault being that it's simply boring. I'm unwilling to give it a lower score just because if you watch many episodes in a vacuum, they're not bad. But how it's all connected didn't reveal what the point of me watching this show was. I didn't have fun, I haven't felt emotion, and I didn't laugh. I just... consumed a very average show with little meaning.

21858,"This is a Spoiler Free review

At first glance, Little Witch Academia appears to be yet another series cashing in on the hype that surrounded (and continues to surround) the Harry Potter franchise. A series about a magic school for young witches, full of adventure, mystery, and friendship, all wrapped in a classic coming of age story against a villain who plans to use the ultimate form of magic to change the world? This is nothing new.



And, to be fair, there is very little on the surface that LWA does to separate itself from this notion. Continuing the Harry Potter comparison, like Harry, Akko is someone completely new to the world of magic, and her two best friends are either smart or mischievous. Her rival is someone from a powerful magic family, who are all blond, and along the way, she's assisted by a professor who is strangely interested in getting her to be her best self. The basic elements are all there.

What makes LWA so special, though, is that it has one of the strongest casts I have ever seen.

Almost every single character in this show feels like a breath of fresh air. Each one of them may appear to fit into a trope, but that's quickly dissuaded by just how fully realized each of these characters actually turns out to be. As long as your hair isn't lavendar, you're probably an extremely strong character with clear motivations and deep development. The one that really steals the show, though, is our lead, Akko.



I could talk for hours about how great of a character Akko is, but I'll hold off on that for a moment to address the other parts of the show.

The animation is stellar, as always from Studio TRIGGER. Yoh Yoshinari's character design prowess is on full display here, with each character having a memorable and unique yet simple and elegant appearance. The soundtrack is passable, with great Openings and Endings and some strong motif tracks. There's some amazing moments, and there's a twist towards the end of the series that made me fall in love with the lead all over again.

Where LWA is weakest, surprisingly, is in the things that made Harry Potter so strong to begin with.

LWA's world is kind of boring. While Luna Nova is cool, everything else is super underdeveloped; which wouldn't have been a problem if the series didn't spend so much time outside of the school. The series also has a very weird format: The first half is entirely episodic, with a very, very loose overarching plot, whereas the second has a clear overarching story. This change is signified by LWA's weakest character, Croix. I don't want to get too much into Croix, since I'm avoiding spoilers, but just be prepared for a very strange turn halfway through the series.

To put it simply, this series isn't revolutionary and it only really has one ""Wow"" moment that happens towards the end of the series. I genuinely think that if you think you'll like LWA, you'll probably like it, and if you don't think you will, then there's nothing here for you. It's a very straightforward show, which I actually think is a good thing with how many anime are trying to subversive or ""the new big thing"" these days. Little Witch is content being what it is, which is something greatly missing from a LOT of other contemporary anime.



Okay, now that that's out of the way, we can move on to Akko.

Akko is one of the most unique characters I have ever seen. Just, straight up. A lot of anime, even good ones, don't have main characters half as strong as Akko.

Think about this for a moment: most main characters will have a mixed bag of strengths and flaws. When somebody sits down to design a character like Akko, you might try making a list of sorts, to see what these traits are. A character who makes up for their clumsiness and incompetence with their compassion and determination is a very classic, and very functional, template many, many main characters fall into. But these are all just surface-level observations.

At this level, Akko is almost entirely flaws. She's clumsy, she's stubborn, she's a little stupid, she's arrogant, rude, selfish, lazy, doesn't know when to take things seriously, can't read a room, is constantly butting into other people's problems, and is overall just a terrible person.



So why... why do I love her so much? 

Well, because I'm Akko. These are things I'm constantly feeling about myself, and if I'm being honest, it makes me hate myself a little bit. I can't help but think about every single mistake I've made in the last 10 years, every terrible thing I've said, every selfish action I've made, every person I've let down. And while I'm sad and sulking, Akko is happy and hopeful. I constantly feel useless, and like Akko, I jump at the first chance to help somebody just so that I can feel useful. Akko represents what I could be, despite my shortcomings. Every time I think about Akko, I find another reason to love her, and that helps me find another reason to love myself.

Akko, despite all her flaws, is doing everything she can to be a good person, to be useful. She wants to inspire people, to bring fun to their lives, and she, against all odds, succeeds in a lot of ways by the end of the series! She has legitimately made the lives of all she's come across better, and that's something I want to do as well.

Akko is legitimately my favorite fictional character of all time, so despite all of LWA's flaws, like Akko, I still love it."
107717,"My main opinion of the first season of Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid was that it was good, and possibly great even, but it didn’t show true mastery over what it did. I still stand by that opinion firmly. It has all of the elements of a great slice of life all the way through, but I felt that a lot of what it did was done better at least somewhere else. That is not to mention that all ecchi parts were a bit of a mixed bag. Still, though it was good fun that was especially aided by the Kyoto Animation’s golden touch. However, the wait for the sequel turned from more of a sense of hype to one of general emotion. Even though the tragic events of the arson attack on KyoAni’s Studio 1 building happened over two years ago at this point, it still somewhat feels like a surreal event. It sticks to my mind to this day due to how even in the current year, and probably will when it fades from the general consciousness of most of the anime community. Even though Dragon Maid wasn’t my favorite KyoAni property, it now meant something truly larger. A lot of the wait became more of a wait of an old friend finally coming home. Something familiar to all of us on our television or computer screens that once brought us joy was finally coming back. Even if Dragon Maid S was just okay or even sub-par, we would all probably still forgive it just on the fact that it just represented KyoAni’s return to TV. It didn’t have to be in the upper echelons of their catalog for it to mean something. However, even although it would’ve been well-received either way, the team at Kyoto Animation managed to pull off something truly beautiful. You know when I said that Dragon Maid didn’t have proper mastery of everything it tried to do? Well, this second season was about to flip my narrative of the show completely on its head.

From the get-go, Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid’s two main characters, Kobayashi and Tohru are like a match made in heaven. Even with the introductions of their personalities in the first episode, the two of them make for an incredible comedic duo. They foil each other in a remarkable sense. The idea of “opposites attracting” comes into full swing here. Seeing an eccentric mythical being head over heels for an ordinary office worker is just plain fun a lot of the time. The two’s chemistry with each other allows the show to be more reliably funny, as a lot of the comedy is centered around the characters rather than the situations. Since the bulk of the series follows these two, it allows nearly every segment primarily featuring the two of them to flourish. While this combination of personalities leads to incredible comedic potential, it also leads to incredible dramatic potential. Even if it isn’t at the forefront of the series a lot of the time, it is as integral to what makes Dragon Maid work as its comedy. While the obvious differences between Kobayashi and Tohru are in their personalities, the direction that their character arcs go in is completely different. Kobayashi lived a mundane life, but the introduction of Tohru brought excitement and wonder to her lifestyle. On the contrary, Tohru lived a chaotic life, but the introduction of Kobayashi in her life brought new peace and tranquility. While the directions that these two characters go in are completely different, they each end in the same place. In many ways, they complete each other. Like yin and yang, Kobayashi and Tohru are the two halves that make the whole of Dragon Maid.

This is the main formula that makes Dragon Maid work, and the first and most of the second season have more or less the same approach to frame this relationship in the story. In the first season, the dramatic elements are nearly all used for heartwarming moments at the end of a segment. This is a common hallmark of slice of life series of this nature since their premises are so down to earth that heartwarming moments are one of the only ways to squeeze dramatic value out of the series. Most of the second season has the same approach, and it still works very well here. There is a common theme around slice of life shows of this nature. Since the characters grow on the audience throughout the series, the second season is usually better than the first just on the fact that the viewer is usually far more attached to the characters and is way more invested in their antics. This applies to the second season as well, but Dragon Maid S takes it an extra step. There are many segments where the comedy takes a backseat, and character development is the primary focus. In a comedy/slice of life series like this one, the changes to the writing don’t feel jarring due to the serious segments just building off of what the comedic parts built up in the background. To even further compliment these moments, there are also moments of very interesting philosophy explored through these moments. Part of the reason why Dragon Maid S works so much better than its predecessors is owed to the presence of moments that lack comedy.

While the main duo was always what made Dragon Maid as special as it was, things start to get a bit more mixed when transitioning over to the side characters. Kanna is probably the character that gets the most screen time besides Kobayashi and Tohru. While not as deep as the two of them, Kanna’s ventures to figure out the human world around her are very entertaining. She exemplifies childhood wonder in a way that is very hard to replicate. The new side character, Illulu, is probably my favorite side character in this show. Her arc near the beginning of the series perfectly fits in with the general themes that the relationship of Kobayashi and Tohru set up. For the few episodes where she is the focus, she manages to be a perfect counterpart for both Kobayashi and Tohru. Illulu’s place in the story is completely natural in the grander arcs of Kobayashi and Tohru. This is the same with Elma, being instrumental to the growth of Tohru while just being an entertaining goofball in her own right. I don’t particularly find myself that attached to Fafnir and Takiya, even though I do still enjoy them when they are on screen. However, the two side characters that are the biggest stains on this otherwise beautiful picture are Saikawa, Lucoa, and Shouta. Saikawa is a singular joke on a broken record. She marvels at how Kanna is cute with the same face all the time, and it got completely old after the second time. The subplot with Lucoa and Shouta… is problematic. I don’t really want to mull on it since it makes me uncomfortable to think about, but the people who know what it is about these two know what I am talking about. This is the first season of Dragon Maid’s largest problem, and Season 2 more so leaves the bad side characters in the background rather than fixing anything about them. This was probably my biggest disappointment with Season 2, since leaving it in the background doesn’t exactly solve anything. Still, though the bulk of the side characters are entertaining but not as good as characters as Kobayashi or Tohru.

In terms of my biggest surprise, this series actually has some of the best action scenes all year. Kyoto Animation was never a shounen studio. They specialize in slice of life, and they are pretty good at bringing them to life. The first season did have action scenes, but they weren’t prominent enough to be memorable. With the action scenes in the second season on the other hand, what the fuck. To be honest, I am not exactly the biggest fan of battle shounen, take one look at my anime list to figure that out, but the action scenes and their animation of Dragon Maid blow my mind. Unlike with story or characters, I really can’t put into words why the animation of the second season is good, but I don’t really think it takes any analysis to see why it hits it out of the park. Kyoto Animation is just flexing their muscles at a time when they would be forgiven for not doing so. However, Dragon Maid’s action scenes go even further than just good animation. Since most of the series focuses on slice of life shenanigans, the few action scenes that are there are placed very purposefully. They either progress character development or the story when there are no better methods to do so. With the moments of action so sparse, it makes it far more rewarding when one comes up compared to a battle shounen with fights nearly every episode. If you told me a few months ago that Dragon Maid S would be the best action series of 2021, I wouldn’t believe you, but now I think it blows everything else out of the water.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Out of any anime studio that exists, Kyoto Animation has a stranglehold on most of our hearts like no other. Dragon Maid S is a perfect encapsulation of why they are so special. It is a fun slice of life series with sprinkles of action with a lot of deep philosophy under the hood. It is as fun as it is deep. For a return of a studio after such tragic events unfolded, their return didn’t need to be a kick in the door like this. It didn’t have to have amazing animation. It didn’t have to break new ground. It didn’t even really have to be good just because we would be thankful that KyoAni is back. However, Dragon Maid S manages to rank as one of the studio’s best in circumstances that truly boggle the mind. Because of the effort put in by the ones behind the scenes, Dragon Maid S managed to be one of the bright spots of this year for me. And to be frank, I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Most anime, in some form or another, is a form of advertisement. That does not necessarily mean that it’s meant to draw attention to an adapted source manga or light novel, though. Anime as advertisement could also be for the studio that made it, as certain studios have established clout or reputation, and thus naturally have more attention drawn to their works. Other times, an anime could act as an attractor for a new enterprise altogether, serving to drum up enthusiasm and hook in a new audience to the emerging property.

takt op.Destiny was a Fall 2021 anime that served to draw attention to the takt op franchise. As a new collaboration between studios MAPPA and Madhouse, a show like this has a two-fold mission that it must complete – succeed as a standalone piece of media, while also being good enough to make people think to themselves that the mobile game it’s helping to market is also worth their time and energy. Making an anime is already hard enough especially in the current anime industry climate, and these extra expectations upon the show don’t exactly make its job any easier. 

In an apocalyptic future, monsters known as D2s violently attack any location that plays music, as music is the only thing that can hurt or kill them. To battle the D2s and attempt to bring peace and music back to humanity, various individuals called Conductors are imbued with the power to command Musicarts, superpowered beings that use music as a combative force. The Conductor Takt Asahina and his Musicart Destiny start a journey with their mutual friend Anna to the New York Symphonica, hoping to learn the truth behind the D2 appearances, all while trying to stop them and allow music to be played freely once again. Along the way, they will meet other Conductors and Musicarts, battle D2s, and struggle.

The series starts off well by integrating its exposition with actual events. Takt is well-oriented as being the odd duck out in this post-music world, being so drawn to the piano that he plays it, despite knowing the danger it would entail. Destiny’s laconic personality clashing with Takt and Anna’s impatience at Takt and Destiny paints a good foundational tableau, establishing the chief dynamic among the three. With an action sequence to show the power of the D2s and Musicart concept, takt op.Destiny manages to convey most of its information effectively. The intriguing premise behind Musicarts and the D2s, and the comedic moments with Takt, Destiny, and Anna, gives the first episode a strong first impression as they travel on their merry way.

But the potential fun of a road comedy action series gets derailed quickly once more time is spent with the main trio beyond the first episode. Takt’s personality is so disenfranchised and aloof that unless someone is having a discussion related to music, moments just seem to mostly bounce off of him. He’s cold, and while that might make sense in a post-apocalyptic landscape, it makes getting endeared to him far more difficult. Because she is neither a Conductor nor a Musicart, Anna serves as little more than the means to get the group to the Symphonica by driving them, or is trying to make contributions to the relationship between Takt and Destiny.

As far as Destiny is concerned, it is revealed very early in the show that she used to be a human named Cosette, that she was Anna’s younger sister, and that she also likes music. Her relationship to Takt is, at best, incredibly vague and at worst is stunningly underdeveloped. The idea that they are bound together by their Conductor-Musicart connection reads more as a flimsy attempt to give Cosette characterization without actually going through the effort of doing so. Any character development that Destiny would undergo, or that Takt and Destiny would undergo together down the line, becomes too rickety and forced because not enough time is taken to make Cosette a more rounded character beyond being adorable. Whether it be through Anna attempting to make Takt and Destiny get along, or Destiny realizing something about Takt, herself, or the world around her, it reads as clumsy.

And the bit of development that we see from Destiny isn’t that engaging, either. Since she functions as a robotic or emotionally blank character, she falls into a lot of the common trappings associated with such an archetype. Calling something a “creature” instead of a “cat,” or a “tool” instead of a “hammer,” Destiny’s bed of knowledge seems almost completely centered around fighting D2s and food. The latter of which is mostly used for comedic purposes, even if it’s supposed to refuel her to continue fighting. Aside from a character obsessed with food not being inherently funny, Destiny’s actual switch from emotionally blank to a more-complex emotional palette doesn’t have a solidified point of orientation. The result is that the shift is abrupt and crammed.

Also crammed is the idea of how music factors into this story. takt op.Destiny offers a lot of proselytizing about how great music is, but largely without probing it further. Music is, supposedly, more-engrained in the show’s DNA both in regards to the plot and the characters, but is kept bizarrely at a distance throughout most of the run. This even impacts moments where music is meant to take centerstage. There’s a sequence where Takt is playing jazz piano and Destiny talks about what Takt’s music does to her, but so little of the music actually plays that it never got the opportunity to enter myself as a viewer. Destiny’s discussion happens in a setting completely divorced from Takt’s playing. This sequence, and others like it, insinuate that music’s contribution to the story is limited to being a plot device or gimmick, rather than an actual force that moves things forward. This also factors into the series soundtrack – despite all the famous classical pieces, we so rarely hear good quality recordings or re-orchestrations of the works, which takes away from the sense of raw power that they allegedly have.

That’s not to say that the show doesn’t try to incorporate music, because it does, albeit not very well. One other Conductor-Musicart duo, Lenny and Titan (which is probably a Leonard Bernstein reference), meet with the main trio and they try to train Takt and Destiny. It ultimately boils down to Lenny saying, “Feel the harmony,” without actually explaining what that means. I can readily accept that becoming adept at battle requires practice, just like music requires practice. But the idea that a single phrase or battle somehow manages to put Takt and Destiny in such synch together makes little sense. I wanted to believe that it was going to go for an angle that their synchronicity was a sign that Cosette was within Destiny somewhere. It would have helped salvage the ambiguous relationship between Takt and Cosette. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen, nor is their relationship ever put in its proper limelight.

Visually, the series manages to be just adequate on most fronts. The action sequences are alright, but never blew me away despite their fluidity. The landscape depictions are decent, and the designs on the D2s crazy forms and the Musicarts show creativity. Speaking of the Musicarts, just like music’s ability to take on different forms and genres, the various Musicarts all have distinct designs that establish them as their own individualized beings, emotional content notwithstanding. Some of the ways they’re able to incorporate their forms into attacking are fun, although takt op.Destiny misses an opportunity to make even fuller use of this. Each Musicart is named after a piece of classical music, yet it never seems like the piece of music serves as an actual influence on the attacks themselves or their personalities. The composition names are framed more as namedrops instead of having a deeper, symbolic connection to the character. “Destiny” as a designation is indeed a reference to a Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony nickname, but it doesn’t extend any further other than implying that Destiny the character is a protagonist, “destined” to stop the D2s. I guess I’m just confused as to what this show was trying to accomplish with all its musical business. 

And that, in a sense, is why takt op.Destiny doesn’t work; it’s a series confused about what it actually is trying to do. It wants to be a mahou shoujo action piece, but also wants to aspire to more meaningful discussions about what music means to people. It wants to be a road comedy, but the comedy dries up so quickly that it breaks down rather than cruises. It wants to make the D2s out to be malevolent, but leaves them without direction. Not knowing what the point of the D2s or their attacks was remained until the final episode, making the show’s building to the climax come across as ill-conceived and desperate.

takt op.Destiny fails as road comedy, action romp, and thought-provoking show about music. Its characters are never given enough time to fully flesh-out their personalities beyond small quirks or emotions, and the true aim of the antagonists is kept in the dark for far too long. The action pieces are merely passable despite some decent individual moments, yet do not salvage the languishing story. Its discussions about music cannot move beyond simplistic blanket statements about how wonderful the art form is, and it never sufficiently explains the connection between Musicart and Conductor. This show committed the cardinal sin of art – it made me, derisively, ask what the point of it all was, and not even care enough to hear an answer. It may have been a glorified advertisement for the mobile game, but that is not an excuse for poor execution."
10719,"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a show in the slice of life school genre which is focused on a high school club of people that for whatever reason or another, have some trouble making friends. Hence the name of the show. It's also a rather thinly veiled excuse at a harem romance comedy as well. 

With regards to the technical aspects of the show, they are for the most part rather good. This is a well drawn anime with good music and sound effects. The voice actors do a good job with the characters and have a decent range of emotions so that this feels like a pretty good production. The fact that it was a light novel adaptation and ended up with a second season says something about the show's success and relative quality, as many of those do not get reupped as they are pretty poor.

The show stands slightly above many others in the genre due to the strong personalities of the characters. Most of the main characters in the club have difficult personalities that make them hard to get along with. A lot of the fun of this show is watching the characters interact, overreact, and maliciously and jealously push each other's buttons repeatedly. Two seasons is also enough time for there to be some development of the personalities and back story for many of the main cast as well. As much as the main characters have trouble getting along, they do eventually end up becoming if not ""friends"" at least comrades and their opinions of each other evolve quite a bit. One could make the argument that most of the characters do lean quite a bit on certain character tropes, but as the series goes on, there is enough hints of development that it can be overlooked and you begin to enjoy the characters more. 

The show doesn't quite make it into the greatness tier because it is held back by taking an interesting concept of a club of misfits and turning it into a harem fantasy comedy as the show goes along. While there isn't anything necessarily wrong about this, the show could have been even better had it stayed a bit more on the topic of terrible personalities trying to navigate social issues and making friends, with a few more dudes thrown in to balance things out.

At the risk of some spoilers (hint, spoiler alert) While many people discussing the show tend to have a strong opinion on who should win the MC bowl here, I sort of ended up wishing that the main character would ignore all of them indefinitely. Unfortunately, that becomes very hard for him to do.

Beyond my personal opinions of how the romance angle is handled, this show is one of the better entries in the slice of life genre. It is genuinely entertaining to watch and is silly enough to make for a nice guilty pleasure or easy to watch show.  One of the major things that I look for with regards to whether or not I should rate a show well is whether or not I'm genuinely enjoying it and I can say that it was a fun show to watch.

The second season is also a bit stronger than the first season and I found myself really enjoying the show more by making the full investment, even if the ending was a bit abrupt as they didn't catch up to the light novel (which is typical for a show of this type).

Beyond that, there is some value in a show like this in understanding that even people who have trouble getting along with others still seek companionship and relationships, even if forming and maintaining them becomes hard. Many of the show's character's personalities make their friendless predicaments pretty easy to understand, but the fact that everyone in the show does want to belong to something and have friends that they can talk to is something that I think anyone can relate to.  Being a bit of a misfit is not easy, certainly not so in the rigid culture of Japan, so there may be a bit of a cultural commentary going on here.  However, It's hard to get too philosophical about a fanservicey school rom com through, so your mileage will definitely vary on this.

Personally, I think that if you're looking for a somewhat better show in the genre and like the misfit friends angle, Toradora is a somewhat stronger entry. However, Boku wa Tomodachi Sukunai can be very entertaining if you can look past its shortcomings. You could certainly do a lot worse, as there are a lot of boring mediocre entries in the genre.  

In my humble opinion, it's worth a watch."

img(/revision/latest?cb=20161223083039)

This movie is the clear loser amongst the three kizumonogatari movies. With that said, it is also the most visually stimulating and stylized entry. If I'm being honest, I don't think I have much to say about this movie on it's own. I give it it's praise in it's very engaging visual and directing choices whether it be the best opening scene I've ever seen in a film with Araragi being burned up by the sun which just gave off a very uneasy feeling and also was a good indicator of the animation and art to come which are both phenomenal across all three films. It is also the most comedic out of the three with the detail of the car crashing after Hanekawa gets exposed never failing to make me laugh as it's such a strange and subtle detail that's easy to muss but very rewarding if you catch it, the way that Araragi gets horny after seeing Hanekawa and races to get material to relieve himself with the footage of that 3D train movie playing behind him, there are also what I refer to as the Looney Tunes moments where the animation style changes drastically to be much more simple and rounded, (they even have the old disney eyes that you would see in old mickey mouse cartoons) during scenes of slapstick comedy between Araragi and Kiss-Shot. This movie and the others feel like a love letter to animation and it's history just by virtue of the changing art and animation styles throughout the film, combining 3D with 2D animation constantly which looks absolutely stunning a lot of the time and they even mix the 2D animation with live-action in addition to changing it's style for different comedic effects. You could just feel the passion bleeding through the screen when you watch this trilogy of movies.

Character Re-Introductions

img(

In addition to that, the character introductions were quite fascinating especially considering their characters before this point. Araragi's loner attitude was an odd choice considering his dedication to help others in Bake but it is that very dedication that causes him to want to avoid people in the first place since he is highly empathic and would find it very troubling to share emotions with another person as he would see it as a burden to both himself and that other person which I found to be an interesting take on the loner character archetype. There's also Hanekawa's introduction where I was off-put by how bubbly and playful she seemed toward Araragi. Then there's also Kiss-Shot who feels the most different to how we would have previously known her as (for obvious reasons). She's much more energetic and playful here and they even bother to make her speak very formal, archaic Japanese, or at least that's what the sub I saw would indicate. We also get the intimidating presences of Dramaturgy, Episode and Guillotine Cutter who were made clear to be very threatening in both kiss-Shot's description of them as well as Araragi's encounter with them and the reveal of their designs which either serve to be large and imposing (Dramaturgy), have a loud overwhelming personality attached (Episode), or be more enigmatic and unsuspecting like they would retain the element of surprise and you would have no idea what they could do (Guillotine Cutter). Then of course, we have the same old Oshino which is by no means a bad thing as we get his very relaxed, cool in the face of danger, reliable and pragmatic personality which is refreshing to see in the crazy world of Monogatari. I just find it very refreshing to see how different Araragi, Hanekawa and Kiss-Shot felt in this movie because it makes it much easier to see them as people with an actual history behind them who are constantly changing as opposed to being stagnant and unchanging, makes it feel like they respect how they write these characters and it's an indicator of the change they will go through after the journey of the 3 films. 

Narrative and Closing Thoughts

img()

Just like Bake, this film more so forms the purpose of introducing the grand story to be told rather than telling it's own story. It sets up Araragi's character well where he chooses to help Kiss-Shot despite the graphic gore of her body and his fear at both what he's seeing and the confirmation of the existence of the supernatural through her vampiric nature, showing his dedication of life to others, even at the cost of his own. They also establish the arc of Araragi opening himself to others through Hanekawa as well as the goal to defeat Dramaturgy, Episode and Guillotine Cutter to retrieve body parts they stole from Kiss-Shot in order to give her back all her strength as well as give her the ability to turn Araragi into a human once more, then there's the information on how he would be able to turn back into a human left up in the air, which we know from Bake doesn't quite work out so we expect a complication in the solution. This film was very enjoyable on it's own but in all honesty probably doesn't even deserve the very high rating I'm giving it which is more for the part it plays in the entirety of the plot as well as for the animation, character, comedy, dialogue and directing which are always excellent elements throughout the Monogatari series. It might just be an introduction to the story, but it certainly is a strong one and made an impact on it's own merits. See you at the next movie and check out these better reviews of this movie lol

14345,"BTOOOM! is what happens when boredom meets lack of creativity. BTOOOM! is just another one of those (poorly named) animes  that are cashing in on the ""stuck in a game""  genre that has been increasing in popularity almost exponentially. BTOOOM! happens to follow the life of people who get abducted and thrown in a real world game that is very similar to the viral online game appropriately named BTOOOM! and now they have to blow each other to kingdom come to survive. A  very original premise, and almost as original a story. That was sarcasm, by the way. 

That said, I overused the word BTOOOM! in the above paragraph just to drive home the point that it really is terribly named.

Now, to give it a proper grading. I will rate it based on five aspects, all of 20 grades each, to reach a total out of 100. 

Artwork and Animation - 17/20
The artwork is good, its a rather dull dark world, and the artwork is able pull it off without looking stupid. The emotions are also rather well done and the artwork is generally convincing. The animation is also fair enough. There is the occasional out of place movement, but nothing too damaging.
Sound and music - 14/20
Not much to discuss here, the sounds are fairly consistent, but they are unable to keep up the ""tropical jungle"" theme for too long. Other than that, music is fairly okay. Even though I never got into it, a lot of people might.

Plot - 8/20
The plot of BTOOOM! is by far the biggest chink in its armor. even with a semi-decent plot BTOOOM! could have been grouped with the ""average"" crowd, but it just had to get blown off the ridge. The plot is unoriginal, uninspired and it isn't very clever. 

The lack of originality is rampant throughout the anime, its your everyday generic survival story, even Hollywood has more original ideas. Its the same old 20-something NEET who is very good at games and gets drawn into a game. 
The inspiration is clearly lacking on every front, it is FULL of plot holes and the action sequences are very illogical. The protagonist, who is clearly a shut-in beta, is somehow able to throw bombs very accurately and run and dodge like a dude running from child support. He is also somehow resistant to the usually fatal bomb-exploded-in-face. And all this based on what? His skill at games? Why, that's bullshit right there.

BTOOOM! is also not very clever the few times it plans on coming up with a plot device (for example, lack of food). Anyone who has ever touched a game that is played by more than one player knows how to create killzones, how to fuck with people's radars and throw up false clues. Even the COD fanboy knows that if the game shouts ""THE BOMB HAS BEEN PLANTED"" on everyone's screen, every other guy in the lobby is gonna descend on the point like bats out of hell, no exception. But for some reason, the protagonist (who happens to be world #10 and best in japan) is shocked when he sees a killzone created by the only source of food.

There are obviously other plot holes, like Sakamoto's uncanny ability to teleport behind his enemies, or Himiko's ability to always have something appropriate in her pocket or Taira's lack of understanding of medicine (what's the thing you do after almost getting your leg bitten off by an animal? Why - you don't wrap it and you just ""walk it off"" by walking in a potentially disease filled river because ""you don't have time"")

Characters - 17/20
The characters are the redeeming quality of BTOOOM! they are probably the only thing done right. The characters are surprisingly deep and they have emotional conflicts. I actually went so far as to feel bad for Himiko and Sakamoro's mom (Sakamoto is an asshole by the way). Even so, a lot of characters with potential are un-developed/undeveloped. The effects of being on the island are  pronounced, with almost everyone becoming a sociapath, and creepy encounters leaving quite the mark on people. The development of characters isn't all that good, the essence of the people never really changes even at the end, but its still something.

Enjoyment - 10/20
BTOOOM! is enjoyable if you are into the genre, but try to watch something else if you aren't. its action is somewhat decent and it sometimes does land a actually decent plot device, sadly these are ruined by a very easily predictable plot, the enjoyment is definitely there, just a bit hard to find.

Admittedly, my review has been overly critical of the series, but it isn't as bad as I made it sound, it does have some genuinely good scenes. Sadly, it wasted the potential to turn them into something good. 

Adding up, we get 18+10+8+13+14 = 66/100"
245,"Great Teacher Onizuka is a very popular title. Let us see why. The series focuses on the life of Onizuka Eikichi, who is an ex-bike gang leader. The man has only one goal now-- to become the greatest teacher in Japan. While doing his teaching internship as part of his studies to become a qualified teacher, he ends up not in an all-girls class as he has been dreaming for awhile, but in a delinquent class. There Onizuka learns the importance of the power and respect gained from one's students. Thanks to pure luck, or Onizuka’s shining charisma, after internship he gets a job at one of the most prestigious private schools in Japan to handle their 'problem class' that made the past few teachers quit. The problem is, however, is that the problem children have some really smart boys and gals that are able to drive even a grownup crazy. Onizuka can, indeed, solve any issue using force. He, however, wants to find the right approach to every pupil, even to the teachers that hate him. Will the most incompetent teach become the greatest teacher there is in Japan? 

The story-line is not the best part about GTO, of course. Yet, it has its appeal. It is rather slow, yet you never feel bored. The way it is built gives you one detailed explanation about everything you need to know: peoples’ backstories, their motives, desires, likes and dislikes. And the best thing about it that you will surely appreciate is the fact that it is never boring. The moment you feel it is getting too boring, the story-line will prove you how wrong you are in the same moment you felt boredom. 

Animation wise, this is the weakest part about GTO. Cannot expect too much from something that aired almost 20 years ago. However, I would not say that it is too much of a challenge: the animation still captures emotions pretty well, especially Onizuka’s priceless facial expressions. Sound wise, it is pretty good. Do not want to sound biased, but the Japanese voice actors did a much better job than the English voice actors. English dub is not always terrible, but GTO is to be seen in Japanese: the emotions the Japanese voice actors put in their characters is something to see with your own eyes. OST is also pretty enjoyable and helps you appreciate the series even more.  

Characters is, indeed, the best thing about this series. Maybe because of the work of the voice actors, maybe because of the ingenious script Tooru Fujisawa, the reason does not matter, the only thing that matters is the result, which is beyond great. While there is really only one protagonist, the series provides all characters with enough development. Even a nurse that has little to do with the story-line gets own screen time and a back-story. Anyways, with that being said, the main focus of the series is the self-proclaimed best teacher in Japan Onizuka Eikichi, who is 22. He graduated from an average university only thanks to cheating and his friends. And all he does now is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. Well, what do you expect from a 22 years-old virgin? That is the main reason for his desire to become a teacher. This might tarnish your attitude towards Onizuka, but, in reality, it should not. Onizuka is young and, of course, the opposite sex attracts him. He is different. And you will see why by yourself. He has the idea that with the right approach you can win trust of every pupil. 

All in all, Great Teacher Onizuka somewhat reminds me of Gintama. Do not hate me for this comparison, please. They are similar in a way that they are both comedies that have some amazing drama that makes you worry about the characters, yet, it never feels to be forced and unneeded. Great Teacher Onizuka will surely make you laugh crying tears of joy and it will also make you hold Onizuka’s actions in high regard. He is the real man, he is the real teacher any person would love to see as a homeroom teacher. Many more things can be said about him, but this will only make your watch less interesting.

With that being said, the anime series is definitely something no one would want to miss. It has all the characteristics of a great show: the scenes are exciting, the script is cleverly written, and the humor will have you chuckling nonstop. Some of the most memorable moments are simply the expressions on Onizuka's face as he goes through various emotions. It is, of course, the last thing you want to see with your kid brother, or sister, but mid and late-teens and older  will surely get the message of Great Teacher Onizuka. And I must say that this message is the last thing a person watching anime can miss. Not liking the old animation is also the last excuse one can think of to avoid watching this pure gem. Do watch it! Onizuka is the greatest teacher there is. 

10/10."

Amagi Brilliant Park is a mainly humorous series released in 2014, and this can be seen quite clearly in the characteristics of the main characters, which are rather clichéd for the time. Amagi Brilliant Park has the rare chance of having a fairly original storyline, as few if any anime are about amusement parks, let alone bringing one back to life. Mixing all this with fantasy is also pleasantly surprising, but it's clearly an excellent idea for bringing the whole park to life and making it more immersive.

Coming back to the fantasy aspect, I think it's good to bring back a more realistic aspect to the characters in the park, and a more zany one too. On the other hand, the story with the princess is simple, and I can understand why they didn't want to develop it further, as the series isn't really about that.

The romance is also present and quite pleasant, but unfortunately the series focuses very little on it, and doesn't give us a very interesting ending on this aspect to my great displeasure.

As for the characters, they each get their own screen time and importance. For some this will be minimal and for others more important, but I really appreciated that on the whole each character had time to express themselves and entertain us.
On the whole, the characters complement each other perfectly, they're not particularly original, but they're ultimately perfectly human.

The comedy is definitely the reason to watch this anime, the jokes really work! Some of them come back from time to time, but strangely enough, I never felt that repetitive aspect throughout the 13 episodes. Each character manages to make us laugh, to share a feeling, and while the series may seem a little childish, make no mistake, it's absolutely not. Some characters, notably the stuffed animals, have a darker sense of humor, aimed at a much more mature audience.

The series is also entitled to an excellent opening, which sets the mood for a pleasant moment when the episode airs and makes you want to listen to it again and again.
The animation is also very good for 2014, so there's nothing special to say about that.

“Amagi Brilliant Park” is a humorous series with very likeable characters. With its varied, good-humored humor, it's sure to make your viewing experience a pleasant one.
Despite the shortcomings of the series, I really fell in love with it! Of course, 100/100 may seem like an exaggeration to some, but it really took me by surprise. It's not a revolutionary series, nor is it a series with characters with incredible development, but it's a series that's really very enjoyable and easy to watch.

For this review, I'll give it a score of 80/100 to balance my pleasure and my objective opinion of the series.

43,"Ghost in the Shell (1995)

img220()

I believe that the act of explaining any subject matter is equivalent to the act of killing. In that regard, can a meager writer such as myself overcome the dire obstacle and responsibility that is explaining a movie like Ghost in the Shell? Am I a murderer willing to deliver verbal assault on something so sacred and cherished? 

Unfortunately for all of you... I am. 

I'm not here to argue a masterpiece case for Production I.G.'s tour de force (...kinda contradicted myself there); rather, I'm here to offer my own insights into the symbolism and thematic points of the film. With that being said, let us descend down the rabbit hole that is Ghost in the Shell. 


In-depth review

CAUTION: POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD

The year is A.D. 2029, a cyber hacker known only as ""The Puppet Master"" is being hunted by Japan's Internal Bureau of Investigations. Leading the hunt is the esteemed and stoic Daisuke Aramaki and his highly trained group of cybernetic anti-terrorist investigators: Public Security Section 9. Chief among them is Major Motoko Kusanagi, who's intense level of cybernetic augmentation seems to connect her on a certain level to the elusive Puppet Master. However, not everything is as it seems. 

The world in which these characters inhabit is a cyber one. The Internet has become a collective unconscious that any person can tap into without a moments notice, thanks to brain enhancement. It's effectively stripping away our physical shells, and in this case, bringing Major Kusanagi ever closer to her soul in the process. It is what she may have been referring to as her ""ghost"". In plot terms, a ghost is a cerebral line of memories and brain function embedded into a cybernetic brain. But Kusanagi seems to be leaning toward a more loose interpretation. In her efforts of understanding this idea, she will become one of the first in a new stage of human evolution. Although, there is one other who's journey seems to parallel hers: The Puppet Master, aka Project 2501. Their relationship is one of many in Ghost in the Shell   that tends to hook our imaginations. 

Speaking of relationships, Kusanagi's partner in crime, Batou, has a very interesting dynamic with the Major. Their connection seems to be one of philosophical contradiction. Batou is down-to-earth and concerned with the material world, where as Kusanagi is grasping at the immaterial. In one of their conversations, she blatantly questions the significance of the human experience, comparing it to a simulation of sorts (An idea the Wachowki's would further explore in The Matrix), even doubting her originality. This is one of the elements of ""cyber-punk"".

As is the case with the cyber-punk genre (a genre practically popularized by this movie), there is a juxtaposition of high functioning technology with low functioning human flaw, especially in the case of city-scape. For instance, in one of Oshii's previous films, Patlabor, there is a deliberate display of poverty stricken districts alongside enterprising skyscrapers. Following his modus operandi, Oshii does the same here. This presentation seems to mirror humanity's willingness to throw away our past for the sake of future development. Yet, there remains remnants of our past to this day, almost like a ghost. 

In a similar vein, the ghostly visage is present in physical terms as well, given the military use of therm-optic camouflage. As the opening scene indicates with the use of said technology, there is a heavy political tinge to the entirety of our story. To The Puppet Master, whom itself is a computerized entity, twirls governments and politics like a play thing. A political ruse orchestrated by Project 2501 serves only one purpose: Get closer to Section 9, and in effect, get closer to Major Kusanagi. In order to achieve a new sense of being, the consciousness that is 2501 must ""merge"" with the consciousness that is Kusanagi, who is in some way deemed like The Puppet Master. This is its goal. 

Throughout the film there are omens foreshadowing the Major's fate. Whether it be short glances at a distant doppelganger, or ascending to a reflective sea floor, the Major cannot foresee the inevitable. 

Concerning the inevitable, the closing stretch of Ghost in the Shell remains, for me, one of the most fascinating exchanges of ideas present throughout the film. And as of this writing, this has been a very personal study of a film that has long perplexed me. I hope my efforts have in some way pulled back the curtain, but even I understand that my views are limited, and you will have to come to your own conclusions. 

Anyway... 

Twas a good movie."

Story(9/10) and characters(8/10)
Josee, the tiger and the fish is a pretty cliche story as people have pointed out but romance movies be like that. I think the story was mostly good and satisfactory.

There were instances like when Josee got mad at mc at his workplace and Josee’s grandmother's death where the pace was pretty fast but it’s a one and a half hour movie so I guess it's to be expected. In a sense I'm glad since fast pacing does make cringy moments go faster too and prevents stuff where it takes a long time for the characters to in example make up after a fight. I hate when it sometimes takes like six episodes in some romance series. Not to say that there were a lot of such moments in Josee, quite the opposite actually.

The dynamic was rather interesting having Josee be impaired and all.

Even though the movie didn’t have any major tragedy vibes to it, I was still pretty scared when the mc got hit by a car. I'm glad it didn't go down that route though. No pancreas for me, thank you very much.

So in conclusion, 9/10 for me but I do see why others wouldn’t rate the story so highly.


Tsuneo
Mc was normal. The kind and proper type. Nothing wrong with it.

Josee
She couldn’t walk so then the mc became the one to support her and she became more independent too. If I remember correctly it was implied that she was 24 so the mc truly did have a great impact on her since she was just kind of at a standstill before. Pretty wholesome and enjoyable. Also I really liked her voice actress.

Grandma
She was kind of grumpy and I thought that she just didn’t know what was best for Josee but I guess she acted how she did because of past experiences with Josee probably getting in some dangerous situations. In the end she was happy with Josee having Tsuneo supporting her. Very nice and cool indeed.

2nd girl
I guess she did exist huh?


Audio(9/10)
The OST was pretty great and it fit well but it's not my favorite music genre or anything so I can't give it a 10/10. I was pretty surprised that there was an insert song and an ending song by Eve though, those were great! Glad to see that he is doing more songs for anime.

It's a movie so sound effects were top notch as expected.

I also especially liked Josee’s voice actress. She had a pretty deep and unique voice for an anime voice actress. She has had only one role before playing Josee which is pretty surprising. Definitely looking forward to her acting in the future.


Visuals(9/10)
Overall the animation is awesome and there were some cool rotating shots but there were some pretty rough frames in the mix too. They didn’t really bother me but still.

Backgrounds were outstandingly well done and I think that's why the roughly drawn frames really did stand out at times.

It had the movie treatment with blur effects and the red and blue effect kind of like a lense distortion, don't know what to call it but yeah good stuff.

Saying a bit about the character designs and such, they were normal. Honestly I’m not sure just how they could even deviate from the norm in a story that has a realistic setting. I Definitely prefer this over having all the colors of the rainbow presented in the main cast’s hair colors.


Enjoyment(9/10)
I knew what I was going to watch and what I wanted and so I sure got what I came for. In short, I really enjoyed Josee. Satisfying story, great music and good visuals, what is there not to like?

But I guess the watchers’ enjoyment will vary greatly depending on what expectations and wants they had, of course. I saw some discussion about the story being bad because it is cliche and honestly I think they just don’t like the romance genre since there really aren't that many ways for an hour and thirty minute romance movie to play out.

That concludes this review. I’d appreciate it if you, yes you, would leave a comment on my profile about what you thought of the review. While I don’t do or plan to do reviews for the sake of others, it’s always cool to hear people’s opinions. Thank you for reading."
6,"Life is hard on the sun scorched world of Gunsmoke. People fight constantly over money and precious resources, and just like anywere else in human history, the strong rule over the weak. All that's between humanity and total extinction are the mysterious power sources known as the Plants. It isn't all doom and gloom, however. Even on a desolate, ruined planet like this one, humanity always finds a way to live on. Therefore, this is not a tale of death and desolation, but one of life and hope. A tale of angels, comically oversized firearms, and gunslingers. And donuts, lots and lots of donuts. Please join me on this look into the life and times of the biggest walking disaster area the galaxy has ever seen, Vash the Stampede.



For a limited adaptation attempting to capture the spirit of the original, Trigun is something of a miracle. The manga was cancelled when the magazine went under, so the grand story that Yasuhiro Nightow wanted to tell was a bit..... underdeveloped. In that most of it didn't really exist yet. However, with Nightow's amazing vision and careful planning, Trigun manages to encapsulate almost every theme and major plot point that the Maximum sequel would eventually contain. It's shorter and has less time for extensive development, but that doesn't hurt the show, as it takes the framework left by the original and builds upon it in its own unique way. It's rare that you can find an anime that so deftly compresses everything the original stands for into one neat little 26 episode package, without being a direct shot-for-shot adaptation. 

Trigun is what I like to call a Trojan Horse show. It baits you in with a carrot on a stick consisting of wacky comedy hijinks, then slowly introduces little hints that all is not as it seems, until you're eventually left wondering whether you somehow ended up watching the wrong anime. The first half consists of mainly episodic filler, with the actual plot kicking in somewhat later. This uneven distribution of filler ends up working in its favor, in a weird way. Shows that start out fairly innocuous and evolve into something much more serious require a lot of patience from the viewer, but are in general very rewarding. Such is the case with Trigun. It lulls you into a false sense of security, making you think that it's just a cute little comedy, all the while planting the seeds of intrigue. ""Perhaps there's more to this anime than meets the eye?"" You think to yourself, as you watch Vash stumble into a bar and diffuse a hostage situation seemingly by accident. And once those seeds finally bloom, it's a sight to behold. As such, the second half of the show is undoubtedly the better part, but the first half's importance in establishing the characters and the world is indispensable.

One of the few areas where the anime version of Trigun is somewhat inferior to its manga counterpart is the antagonist characterization. One of Trigun's main missions is showing that everyone has reasons for the way they are, and that even the most vile of villains are capable of redemption. The slight differences in Knives and Vash's backstory, and Knives's limited screentime end up making him come off as less sympathetic than he does in the manga, which makes the idea that he can be redeemed a bit harder to swallow. Similarly, Legato's lack of any backstory or explanation for how he became a disciple of Knives makes the long shadow he casts over the story that much more sinister. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing in Legato's case, as his portrayal in the anime is considerably more intimidating than his Maximum counterpart, thereby filling the void that was left when Knives's screentime was cut. All in all, Trigun's villains are not as compelling as Trigun Maximum's, but only by a smidge.

Lovable ditz Milly and the ever practical Meryl have a very important job to do. Like many others, they are on a mission to find the infamous Humanoid Typhoon. However, it's not the reward they're after. For an insurance company like Bernadelli, a natural disaster like Vash is a logistical nightmare! If they want to keep their job security, the intrepid office workers are going to have to prevent the plethora of disasters that always seem to pop up whenever Vash is around.

I find Meryl and Milly to be much more memorable in the anime than the manga, simply because Nightow actually remembered to give them something important to do this time. They still get somewhat overshadowed, but they play an important role in supporting both Vash and Wolfwood. After all, even Superman needs a shoulder to cry on every now and then.

For the commandments, ""You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,"" and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself."" - Romans 13:9

Vash may be the most wanted criminal in all of Gunsmoke, but you're more likely to find him waiting eagerly in line at a local donut shop than out committing heinous crimes. Protected only by his inhuman marksmanship and his frightening reputation, Vash drifts from settlement to settlement, dodging bounty hunters along the way through what he'd like you to believe is just an unholy amount of luck. And of course, he always leaves a respectable amount of mayhem behind him, whether he wants to or not. Despite Vash's vow of pacifism, his philosophy does not involve just sitting and taking whatever people throw at him. He doesn't believe in answering violence with violence, but that never stops him from protecting himself and others when it comes down to it.

Vash may make his job look absolutely effortless, but the twisted scars all over his body tell a different story. He's sacrificed his physical and emotional wellbeing many times over in order to abide by his no killing policy, to the point where he's almost literally falling apart. Guilt and doubt over the people he's failed to save dog his heels everyday. Yet even after all of that suffering, Vash's story is one of hope. For his great sacrifices end up paying off in the end, as Wolfwood, Meryl, and countless others all over Planet Gunsmoke learn peace and forgiveness through his steadfast example.

Anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner: fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury. Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death. - Leviticus 24: 19-21

Charges money for confessions? Crack shot with a pistol? Chain-smoking and drinking habit? A shocking readiness to solve any and all confrontations with lead? Well, he ain't like any priest I've ever seen. But when you get past all his vices, he's a pretty cool fellow. A part-time gun for hire and self proclaimed man of the cloth, Wolfwood travels throughout Gunsmoke looking to make money to support the orphanage he oversees. He encounters Vash on numerous occasions, and the two never fail to butt heads over their irreconcilable approaches. Is he Vash's stalwart ally, or is he just waiting for his chance to take those sixty billion double dollars for himself?

!For me,Trigun just isn't the same when good old Wolfwood's not around. His role as Vash's steadfast companion and foil are vital to the show's themes, and his eventual departure tears a gaping hole in the story that never fully heals. His hard-won fight for redemption remains one of the most tragic, inspiring character arcs I've ever witnessed.

Wolfwood was trapped by violence from a very young age. Raised by the notorious Chapel to be an assassin, he was taught that the only way to stay alive is through killing. Both Vash and Wolfwood took it upon themselves to rid the world of evil, but while Vash took the hard way, Wolfwood chose the easy way. He believes that in order to save the innocent, he has to make sacrifices of the wicked. Wolfwood projects an ""I did what I had to do"" attitude, but with just a little observation it's clear that the terrible things he's had to do have killed his spirit. By his definition of justice, the guiltiest one is himself, after all. He wants to save everyone, but he doesn't have faith that it's possible. That all changes when he meets Vash, who wastes no time in showing Wolfwood a better way. Once he finally realizes that it really can be done, he regains his trust in God and the human race. Anyone can be saved, if they're willing to reach out for it, and this realization shows him that he too could be saved.!




Trigun has a very clear message to teach, and it does so with a firm hand. However, it's never satisfied just saying ""killing is wrong"" and calling it a day. It makes sure to show it like it is, rather than looking at the issue through rose-colored glasses. Pacifism is the right thing to do, but that doesn't make it easy or convenient, or even sensible, and the anime keeps the audience painfully aware of this fact. Trigun's examination of pacifism is surprisingly nuanced and balanced in its approach, making sure to show its goodness while also revealing its drawbacks.

Someone who has attempted murder is always capable of doing so again. When you refuse to kill someone in self defense, you put not only yourself, but others at risk. Many times over Vash lets someone go free when the world would have been a much safer place without them. Vash combats this issue with two different tactics: scare 'em straight by showing them that he could kill them at anytime if he wanted to, or shoot them in the legs so they can't do anything. These methods are not nearly as secure as just killing them. And if they do go on to hurt others again, that brings a whole new problem into the equation.

When Vash lets a criminal go that he could have killed, and they go on to hurt or kill someone else, does he bear some of the responsibility for that criminal's actions? Is it really enough for him to just keep his own hands clean? Even Legato points out that Vash has only succeeded in avoiding killing by his own hands, and this fact is often used against him by his enemies.

The biggest, most obvious flaw of the pacifist approach is how much harder it is than just putting a cap in the opponent's noggin. Taking a bad guy down nonlethally while bullets are whizzing past your head is not an easy task by any sense of the word. Even an unstoppable force of Nature like Vash has to train vigorously everyday, putting his life and health on the line constantly. There's no doubt that killing is wrong. On a ruthless world like Gunsmoke however, it would take a superhuman to avoid it.

Trigun acknowledges that sometimes, avoiding killing just isn't possible. So even with this in mind, why is killing those who do you wrong still considered to be bad by Trigun's standards? Well....




Life is about freedom of choice. It consists of a series of choices that lead to consequences, which lead to even more choices. Every person has an infinite amount of potential to influence the world around them and the people in it, both for the better and for the worse. When someone is killed, their freedom is taken away from them. Any contribution they could have made to the world is now cut off for good. You might say, ""They were scum, the only thing they would have done was cause more pain."" And that's certainly possible, maybe even likely. But how do we know for sure that's the case? Who are we to decide whether someone is or isn't capable of changing? Human beings can't exactly look into somebody's future and say without a shadow of a doubt that they're irredeemable. No matter what kind of person it is, the possibility for change is always there. It's a small possibility, but it's the smallest things that can make the biggest difference. After all, the ticket to the future is always blank.

I will forever be grateful to Yasuhiro Nightow for writing such a sensitive, compassionate story. A story about forgiveness, and kindness, and unending patience. It's about loving totally and unconditionally, even people that don't deserve it. Especially people that don't deserve it. Love is not an easy thing. It's messy, it's painful, it causes all sorts of problems and leaves you vunerable to the worst kinds of hurt. But if we can't love, if we can't forgive and forget, then we'll forever be stuck chasing our own tails in an endless cycle of pain and revenge. It has to end eventually, so why shouldn't it end with us?"
33,"I will try my best to keep spoilers at a minimum for this review. Nonetheless, if at all possible, I personally recommend jumping into Berserk while knowing as little as possible. Hence if you still know very little about Berserk overall, I probably recommend not even reading this review and to just dive in. 

Again, there's really no in-depth spoilers, but I do talk about a lot of things I really love about Berserk 97 and Berserk in general which could very easily spoil the sort of nature of what this series is. So again, if you do still know nothing about Berserk whatsoever, just dive in and give it a try. If you have a fondness for dark and gory action series, that is.



Whether that's the 97 TV series (the only TV anime that Berserk ever got, mind you), the [2012 Golden Age movies](https://anilist.co/anime/10218/Berserk-The-Golden-Age-Arc-I--The-Egg-of-the-King/), the relatively recent [Berserk Musou](https://store.steampowered.com/app/502280/BERSERKandtheBandoftheHawk/) game from Koei Tecmo, or hell, just the straight up undiluted [original manga](https://anilist.co/manga/30002/Berserk/) by [Kentaro Miura](https://anilist.co/staff/96868/Kentaro-Miura).

Personally, I jumped straight into the manga because a friend had been recommending it to me for years and years. But literally all I knew was that the main guy had a giant sword, and it was apparently quote, ""super fucked up.""



The VERY first scene of the entire manga. With no explanation or context, of course.

And of course when I finally gave the manga a shot in very late 2015, I ended up catching up to the current chapters in a matter of days. And then after a brief recovery period, I proceeded to give the anime a try, confident that since I had already read the manga, the effects would have been diminished... on the second go...



They weren't.

...And thus, Berserk was my true yet incredibly rough start in anime and manga.

By rough, I mean, there's clearly a reason I don't see many other people who say ""oh yeah I started right out of the gate with fucking Berserk.""








I think it goes without saying that Berserk 97 is even far more appreciated than ever before due to the last couple of years. The Golden Age films in 2012 by Studio 4°C was the first Berserk adaptation since the [Japan only PS2 game in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk:MillenniumFalconHenSeimaSenkinoSh%C5%8D). I to this day would still argue that the Golden Age movies are just fine. Specifically the [third one.](https://anilist.co/anime/12115/Berserk-The-Golden-Age-Arc-III--The-Advent/) The third one is by far the best.

img()  

Sure, they cut out a whole bunch more than the original anime did due to the much shorter length in comparison...

Sure, the CG leaves quite a bit to be desired...

And sure, it isn't new. It covers only a couple new bits that the 97 anime didn't. Meanwhile cutting a bunch of other stuff the 97 anime did. We don't see much of any of the arc that is to follow chronologically. Weirdly enough on the other hand, the 97 anime actually gives us a sneak peek at least of that part of Guts' life.








This is a very worthy thing to discuss while reviewing Berserk 97. As I've seen more than a few others to suggest if you watch Berserk 97 to skip the first episode entirely or watch it only after the other 24 episodes.

While I can understand the idea, I am staunchly upon the side of watching the first episode and watching it first. Like I really, really, really love the first episode. 



And I'm not saying that solely because none of the Black Swordsman arc has ever been animated beyond this single episode. I really view the first episode as just a wonderful way to set up the rest of the anime.



Apart... from a single line that really makes no sense in the grand scheme of things and just feels like something they just threw in there because they had no idea of where the manga was gonna go at the time.

!img440()

Granted, this line can easily be overlooked. So much so that I completely forgot about its existence until I rewatched this with a friend.!

We just start out with this gloomy looking character who very quickly proves that if you cross him, you're probably going to end up having a heap of raw iron slamming through your midsection.



He's on a journey but we of course at the time have no idea what the purpose of said journey is. But we continue to be fed more hints as we're shown him suffering from strange and creepy visions of strange beings and he's being haunted by spirits that claim that this man's flesh is theirs.



His blood, his flesh, his bones, his agony, his sadness, his fear.

Everything.



But while this is happening when Guts is just trying to take a fucking nap after walking and killing all day, we are also introduced to very odd and very evil looking Baron.



Who, if I'm speaking honestly here, is a very underrated character as far as the whole of Berserk goes. Sure when you get down to it, he's really just a cannibalistic evil Baron who also happens to be a Snake Apostle. 

But I fucking love that very first battle of Guts against the Snake Baron.

  

Guts isn't a hero. Guts isn't even particularly a good person. Before this journey we join him in the middle of, he's gone through no short amount of hell to transform into this walking whirlwind of hatred and pure viscera. 

 

He's the walking tatters of a human being who is now living a life of throwing himself into one hellish battle against monsters after the other, and he can't even get a goddamned night's rest because the nightmares and the spirits will haunt him the moment he shuts his one remaining good eye.



This is why the first episode of Berserk 97 and the Black Swordsman arc of the original manga worked so much for me. Because I was absolutely riveted and excited to see what fucking happened to result in the creation of a person just so irreparably fucked up.



Disclaimer, this is actually from Lost Children but chronologically it's still Black Swordsman Guts. Miura's art has just improved 100% since the last time he drew him.

Ah... the first episode... it was effectively dark, grim, and I genuinely loved the battle scene. The voices of the spirits haunting Guts were appropriately demonic, mocking, and scary... and Guts' screams were pained and full of fear...

Oh how I wish I could enter a portal to the parallel universe where Pokémon failed so [Oriental Light and Magic](https://anilist.co/studio/28/Oriental-Light-and-Magic) instead went on with making the fabled and nonexistent Berserk season 2.

How many times have I gone through the Golden Age now?

The manga, the anime, the 2012 movies, the anime again (with a friend)... 



...the manga again, the manga a third time (physical reread) and the Berserk Musou game though it primarily uses scenes from the movies for the Golden Age section.



That's at least seven times. I think the Golden Age is probably one of the more common favorite arcs among Berserk fans. Personally, it's not my favorite... actually, while I'm thinking about it:

!Conviction (aka the Lost Children chapter specifically) > Black Swordsman > Golden Age > Falcon of the Millennium Empire > Fantasia (SO FAR)

Course, that's just me. I know it's probably fucking considered sacrilege by plenty to rank the Black Swordsman that high but hey a lot of the shit I love about Berserk was established there. AND I'M STILL DYING TO KNOW WHO IS GONNA END UP GETTING THE COUNT'S BEHELIT. IT'S BEEN OVER TWENTY FUCKING YEARS BUT SOMEONE'S GETTING THAT GODDAMNED THING.

MIURA PLEASE.

img()!

However, no matter what way you slice it, the Golden Age is really where Berserk starts. 

img()

And I have no doubts that if Miura was given the opportunity to just instantly and effortlessly redo Berserk, he would probably make that so since he now obviously knows where he was gonna take the story. But of course if you remove the Black Swordsman arc where he was still just feeling around, would it even still be Berserk?



I've genuinely over the years read multiple people making the argument to outright skip to like the end of volume 3 of the manga. Again, I kind of get the reasoning as far as the first episode of Berserk 97 goes, but come on. Please read the manga in order...

Hence my whole prior diatribe on the idea of skipping the first episode. It's important to have that... peek, into the things that are gonna come into Guts' life down the road. 

  

And mind you, that very first peek the anime offers you is a whole lot less extensive than the manga's. Really still leaves you wondering how in the hell episode 1 is gonna relate to the rest.

Because the Golden Age is just more or less on the surface medieval action. 

img()

It's still the world of Berserk though so it's still dark and bloody and gritty, but you're still really wondering where and when the giant snake monsters are going to come back into play.

I know I went all in on talking about the first episode, but... I actually don't want to talk too much about the Golden Age itself. And I know what the header at the top of this review says. It didn't say The Black Swordsman, it said The Golden Age.

img()

But after experiencing the Golden Age as many times as I have (still nowhere near as many times as the Berserk fans from before I joined the ranks, I reckon), I now see Golden Age as the heart of Berserk. Because again, that's really where it all began.

That's where this saga that's been running for over thirty years begun.

Before we wrap up here, you probably already saw this coming as it's not at all the first time I've said it but:


img()

Nine tracks. Eleven if you count Tell Me Why by Penpals and Waiting So Long by Silverfins.

- Tell Me Why (even the people who describe this as terrible still fucking remember it. I unironically fuckin' love it.)
- Waiting So Long (GRIFFITH'S FACE.)

But only nine by Susumu Hirasawa himself.

- Behelit (fucking haunting and probably one of my secondary favorites)
- Ghosts (literally only used in the first episode and it hurts)
- Ball (obviously the weakest but it's fine for what it's for)
- Guts (it's been twenty two years and Guts still has no better theme. Hai Yo? Nah.)
- Murder (the absolute fucking stuff of nightmares)
- Fear (appropriately named and makes the entrance of certain characters all the more terrifying)
- Monster (again, appropriately named. Zodd the Immortal!)
- Earth (one of the less dark or ominous tracks, still very very good)
- Forces (HAI YAI FORCES, HAI YAI FORCES)

And none of them ever got old. Which is fucking amazing because I remember hearing Gattsu Guts and like Behelit SO MANY TIMES.

And my absolute favorite one which is appropriately titled Murder is probably one of the darkest things I've ever heard off of any soundtrack of anything. It is... the section of the series it goes to incarnate. It's just absolute madness and despair and oh christ.

That's not even to put down what's probably the favorite of the majority of fans.

img()

And apart from the ending previews that plays at the end of episodes, I only remember Forces playing a couple of episodes. And yet even though I said Murder's my favorite, Forces is still probably the one I've listened to the most what with the various remixes and like also the [original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMfhwv3gU) that he turned into Forces with his goddamned sorcery...


youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-et5qY46rQ)




Berserk 1997 is a 8.5 out of 10 or 85 out 100.

And I don't think there's a lot of room to argue against it being the best anime adaptation of the manga that currently exists at the time of this review.

 

The Golden Age movies have their charm for sure, but 1997 still presents a more complete version of the Golden Age. Sure, the movies expand a little bit past the infamous ending of 1997, but I personally love that ending a whole lot more.



To very briefly and loosely go a bit more specific on things that get cut out:
!Both: The Kushan (Silat appears in the movies, but the rest don't), the Black Dog Knights, Wyald. The focus for both is the Golden Age, but I'm still gonna include The Count. Granted, he appeared in the actual Eclipse for both.

1997: Puck and the Skull Knight. Oh yeah, I remember there being also this weird filler episode with Adon where he's just fucking around for some reason? None of that ever happened in the manga. It just made Adon even more of a clown character rather than a clownish scumbag. The actual moment where Skull Knight bursts into the Eclipse to save Guts and Casca. A very big moment to not include, but can you honestly tell me a better ""read the manga"" ending than that? Especially since the first thing you see when the ED comes up is Griffith's fucking smiling face. They had to have known what they were doing.

Golden Age movies: Snake Baron (including his appearance in the Golden Age). Rosine's Golden Age appearance along with The Count when they spook Rickert. The Queen of Midland's plot to kill Griffith. The Bonfire of Dreams. Gaston's death. Judeau's last words. They include a moment where Guts almost actually strikes Femto/Griffith. Godo. Most of Guts' childhood. There is a very brief flash of the most infamous moment from his childhood in the movies, but the 97 series actually included Guts killing his adoptive father. They include Serpico and Farnese when they didn't need to... and probably more I'm not remembering off the top of my head.

Again, this actually is straight from the top of my head. I could be misremembering some of these. The Golden Age is almost fucking seared into the back of my skull at this point.!

Anyways, yeah. I still love Berserk 1997 to death and still view it as one of the best Berserk adaptations. I mean, it's not perfect of course, but it could certainly be worse.

Still... I'm really wondering when we're going to get a new proper TV anime... it's been twenty two years already...

133844,"Fans and haters of Overlord all know that Ainz is probably one of the most overpowered isekai protagonists out there. In this season, that is no exception. This series follows a similar formula throughout its run, and that formula is “People underestimate Ainz, and then get slaughtered”. This time around, the characters are actually somewhat catching on that, yes, Ainz is nearly unbeatable, so maybe we should work with him instead. To me, I think that the change in formula made the series a bit boring, but there were also quite a few other issues that presented themselves in this season.

My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20

STORY: 11.2/25

The story isn’t by any means messy, it’s just that I struggled to care about the plot this season. In the previous seasons, we saw a whole lot more emphasis on side characters and their developments, which was great. From the Lizardmen arc in Season 2, to the Two Leaders arc with Enri and Nphirea in Season 3, say what you will about the arcs, but personally, they just felt way more impactful than whatever what shown in this season. This season focused a lot on Ainz taking over kingdoms and empires, for his goal of destroying the Re-Estize kingdom. There were a lot of political strifes and discussions sprinkled throughout as well, but it felt so insignificant. The jump from arc to arc felt very self-contained and not connected enough, which really lowered the significance of Ainz’s opposition throughout the series. Sure, there are some plot twists, and some rather satisfying and shocking moments, but I didn’t take much away from the plot this season compared to the other three seasons.

ART: 7/10

This show still looks a tad mediocre, but the CGI was slightly less prevalent, although clearly present. Not as jarring, but not the best still.

MUSIC: 8.4/10

The one thing that Overlord has kept consistent throughout the years was its music. The OP and ED were pretty solid once again, and worth listening to over and over.

CHARACTERS: 10/20

The characters from Nazarick never really intrigued me a whole lot, and with the focus being on them a bit more this season, it felt much more boring to me. Ainz is still the same as over, though he seemed more cold this season, Albedo is still her same fun self, Aura and Mare are still powerful, overall just much of the same. One key difference which felt a bit shocking to me was how “childish” Shalltear felt in this season. At some points, she felt like a newcomer learning the ropes of how the Nazarick group functioned, which was kind of weird. It was great to see Pandora’s Actor getting a chance to shine this season though.

Once again, I found the side characters and opposition of Nazarick more interesting, from Jircniv, Zanac, and many more, it’s always fun to see the futile schemes of Ainz’s opposition.

ENJOYMENT: 9.5/15

There were some exciting moments, but a lot of it was boring, which was unfortunate.

THEMATIC EXECUTION: 9/20

A key element in Overlord is how they execute Ainz’s supremacy over every other group in the world, and this time around, it felt really flat. The deaths that Ainz caused felt too quick and easy, and lacking in intrigue. Didn’t really feel for anyone, since the characters weren’t exactly developed very well.

OVERALL: 55.1/100

It’s always fun to watch the futile struggles of Ainz’s opposition, but I wished they focused on the opposition more to be honest. We know how powerful Ainz is, so I’m ok with him getting less screen time. The side characters are in my opinion what makes this show more compelling, and I felt considerably more bored of this season than any other. The movie will be coming out later on, so I’ll be sure to give that a watch when it comes out."
116566,"Story time.

Redline, 2009. Takeshi Koike and his team spent 7 arduous years at Studio Madhouse to produce one of the most adrenaline-fueled, well-animated films in all of anime. It bombed hard to the point where almost no film production has gone down this path since. It may go down as a cult classic a decade later, but at the turn of the decade, it was a miserable flop.

Keijo, 2016. Hideya Takahashi noticed a ridiculous sports manga about bodacious babes bumping boobs and buts off of water balconies. He and his team at Xebec took that fun action comedy romp and made it one of the biggest meme titles of 2016. It doesn’t quite get the respect it deserves, and the production values aren’t that great for TV anime standards, but it is a noteworthy title.

Finally, Akudama Drive, 2020. Tomohisa Taguchi and his team at Studio Pierrot got drugged up on Hotline Miami and cyberpunk aesthetics before deciding to make a show about it. This is probably not how it happened, but simply saying “individuals with talent and creativity had a wacky idea they wanted to run with” is a reality too boring for a show such as this. It’s sheer balls to the wall glory. For the most part, it’s exactly what action anime has largely neglected to be.

Can you guess what the term is? Do you know what anime has been missing for a while?

Straightforward entertainment.

Action anime is so focused on gimmicks and drama. A lot of the time, these productions would be so much better if they focused on being either over the top or otherwise just focusing on entertainment value to maximize their potential and aesthetics. There’s a reason Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure became a hit long before the nature of its ambition incorporated particularly dramatic storytelling. There’s a reason the Slime isekai is a lot more well-regarded than most of its peers. Hellsing Ultimate is mainstream for this as well. Prioritizing fun and aesthetics above all else has become criminally undervalued.

This is where Akudama comes in, barreling through horde after horde of anime in post-apocalyptic 2020 with the biggest, stupidest grin on its face. Its characters are about as outlandish and simple, forcing their bombastic nature and chemistry to carry their weight. Otherwise one-dimensional characters such as the meathead Brawler or the red and blood-obsessed psychopath, Cutthroat, remain entertaining as a result of this chemistry and how their gimmicks are handled. Even the least asinine members of the group, such as the Ordinary Person and the Hoodlum, have enough comedic value in their interactions to fake their way in and react in perhaps even more over the top ways to the situations than everyone else. Even then, each of these weirdos has little personality quirks to help them all stand out amongst each other and butt heads on a consistent basis. There’s enough vibrancy to the characters to sell the insane nature of events in the show, perfectly complimenting the show’s wonderful presentation.

Tomohisa Taguchi and his team must have had an absolute blast during this production. The vibrant cyberpunk aesthetic is stark, with tons of atmospheric lighting all around and combinations of red and blue being used to their fullest. The transitions are also hilarious, with environments shoving themselves into the screen. Perhaps the most hilarious scene transition is in episode 2, where after everyone is about to crash as Ordinary Person and Hoodlum are screaming, we fade to black and cut to an exposition dump on the setting of Kansai, which is presented by animals drawn on paper and held up by sticks. The show truly gives all and no fucks at once if it’s willing to present exposition this way. It helps that the show also has several gorgeous shots in both the calmer and more hectic moments.

As for the character designs, they are both somewhat simple and somewhat busy, and are rendered in an interesting, slightly more realistic art style. The hair and especially eye detail is constantly on display, even when the action ramps up. The fight scenes are fluid and exciting, especially when the lighting changes to ramp up the intensity of the fights. There’s a sense of weight to each impact, and characters can get tossed around like ragdolls. This is, sadly, where some mechanical CGI comes into the picture and that doesn’t look great. There are also a few moments of reused animation and slideshows. However, when the action is this good and the collateral damage and laser beam effects are this wonderful, a few blemishes won’t hurt. We are dealing with some of the best digital particle effects usage in recent anime, after all. It’s just a shame that some of it gets censored since there are several drop-dead gorgeous sequences that further elevate this show to one of the most well-animated TV productions of the year.

As for the soundtrack, it’s solid. There’s a mix of electronica, jazz, and more that get utilized effectively. Only a few tracks stand out, such as the menacing techno track that has so far been labeled as Cutthroat’s theme, and the piece that plays during the final fight between Brawler and the Master Executioner in episode 6. Regardless, they’re all still fine as they complement the show well enough, and more interesting pieces reveal themselves over time. There’s also an OP and ED but let’s not get into them, regardless of if they fit the show.

As for the show and how it’s written, Akudama Drive is stupid. It’s over the top with characters uppercutting people with bikes, shielding themselves from radiation of some sort with weird unexplained tech shields, and characters crashing through walls all the time. Sometimes the show does take a breather to explore characters like Ordinary Person and Hacker a bit more or to even just take in the gorgeous atmosphere. It can even be surprisingly sweet at times. However, not only does the show earn it with its likable cast, we’re more often barreling through corpses than sitting down to eat, if that makes sense. The show’s asinine nature does somewhat come at a cost with unexplained things like Cutthroat surviving being thrown off a hotel or their employers playing flutes that provide unexplained barriers to keep them alive. Everyone has something for every situation, convenient or no, though rarely does the show become obnoxiously or detrimentally contrived.

There are other issues. While the main method of exposition is cute, it does become repetitive after a while. It also comes after some inopportune times, such as after the blistering and emotional climax of episode 6. More importantly, the narrative and interesting world-building become more of a focus in the second half. Some of the reveals are just downright braindead, like the reveal of the fate of the moon in episode 7. The show also takes itself more seriously, and while it’s earned, that does make it harder for the show to maintain the bombastic edge that made it stand out in the first place. It also makes it harder to excuse some of the ridiculous reveals or moments where characters survived deaths they should not have. It’s not a complete trainwreck in the second half, as there are still some solid emotional moments. There are brilliant bits and pieces such as the comedic exposition broadcast being hijacked in episode 9, only for it to turn out that hijacking the airwaves during a time of Akudama-induced panic was a horrible idea. However, the show never completely recovers from the awkward, sometimes gaudy and nonsensical stumbling blocks of episodes 7-9. It’s fun seeing the character flaws of the Akudama start to erode the group, just as it’s fun to see the dystopia’s authoritarianism go absolutely haywire. However, the direction the show goes in never reaches the peaks the simpler first half did.

Simple, straightforward fun is what Akudama promised. The first half of the show is what more anime should aspire to be, with its lively presentation and bombastic cast of characters. Unfortunately, it seems Akudama Drive was just a bit more ambitious than that, just as a lot of anime are. Ambition isn’t everything, and sometimes just being earnest and having the drive to be fun more than anything else is what we need. There will always be a place for drama, relaxation, and even titillation. Anime is a diverse market. However, whether it be in the form of spectacle or whimsey, the simple need to be fun is still important. It will always be welcome. This is an entertainment medium, after all."
20725,"The last time I watched Kuroko was back when the second season was announced. I finally decided to finish the whole thing this year and while it is not the greatest sports anime I've watched, it still was a fun ride even if I was very aware of some plot convenience elements. Reviews for some reason have to be more than 2,000 characters so since I probably won't write a review for the other seasons, I'll just wrap up the series as a whole in this.

Kuroko has always been ridiculous in the powers and moves used throughout the series, but the last game against Rakuzan was something else. I still don't quite know how I feel about it but if I had to pick a word I'd pick underwhelmed. There were so many things that could have made this series better but it just feels like the author wanted to be done with it for good. While I still don't think the ending was the best thing I've ever seen, I still think I would rather get this, than get the story elongated with even more stuff only for it to take away from what it already is or make it worse. We don't need another Boruto. I'll first begin by talking about the good things since I would still highly recommend this series to other people who are into sports anime. 

Characters. Even if they aren't all fleshed out,  they grow on you and are otherwise fairly likable with a few exceptions like the dudes from Kirisaki Daiichi. Not all of them are interesting but I didn't find any of them totally boring either. Plenty of characters who I thought were given great character development even this late in the game were Kise and Midorima, and others like Momoi, Akashi, and Himuro could have used a little bit more help. Out of all the characters in the generation of miracles, I think Kise and Midorima were the ones with the best growth, and they certainly got a much better writing treatment. 

Kise was always the nicest person in the generation of miracles even back in the first season. He was cocky, as all of them were,  otherwise he was a pretty good guy. In this last season,  I was rooting for him and his team to win against Seirin. The backstory between him and Kasamatsu, the fact that he arrived in Kaijou with an air of arrogance and then got lowered to earth by a senior, everything made me appreciate his character more. This time he was not crying because HE as a person couldn't win; he was crying because he wanted to win for his TEAM. For the people who have been supporting and believing in him. What an amazing turnaround for the guy who cried in season 1 because it was the first time he lost. When he broke down in tears in front of Kasamatsu saying how much he had wanted to win, I felt it and I cried with him.

Midorima was just as arrogant if not more than Kise. I've always thought he was changing little by little, just by watching him become friendlier with Kagami without realizing, to the point that they even shared a nice talk in season 3 before the game against Akashi. Midorima felt like an aloof character who only cared about himself. Even after his loss against Seirin, he didn't seem to make a huge change. In the the last season however, I just couldn't help but cry at his growth and cheer for him and his teammates. He stated outright that nobody in his current team was a hindrance. This arrogant man defended his team and he also learned to trust in them so much to the point that he is able to make a shot he otherwise wouldn't? I love that. That three-pointer he starts making without having a ball is one of the best things I have seen in anime and I probably won't ever forget it. Just the fact that he wasn't just shooting threes and was actually running in the game, and passing to his teammates,  was good enough but the whole game against Rakuzan just made me respect him a whole lot more and it is probably my favorite match in KNB besides the Seirin vs Touo one. If I had to pick a team in the series that I loved it would be Shutoku. 

Everyone who was a part of the generation of miracles ended up in a team that actually makes them grow and who uses their strengths better and whether that was intentional or not by the author, it made me think that another plot in Kuroko could more than well be the fact that you will eventually end up in a way better place than you started. Out of all the teams in Kuroko no basket, I think Kaijou and Shutoku are the teams I enjoyed the most. It feels like Midorima and Kise found a place where they finally belong and I am a sucker for the found family trope in anime. 

It is inevitable but some characters weren't used as well as they could have, and that is mostly because the writing just didn't do as much as it could, particularly for the few female characters in the series. I get that this is an anime that will mostly focus on the male characters who play the sport, but was it so hard to give us more moments for Riko and Momoi? I like Riko. She is a hardworking girl who wants nothing but the best for the team. Her cooking sucks but other than that, she is a good coach. That is all we have on her. We don't need a whole character arc for her, however, some other traits or even giving her more screentime would have added more layers to her persona.

I have a love/hate relationship with Momoi. She is not particularly bad, but she is not great either. She is mostly used for fanservice shots and that's it. She is smart, she also sucks at cooking. That's all. It was hard to take her seriously even when she was a part of the antagonists. They could have made her way more interesting but they just reduced her to fanservice and that is one of the reasons I just couldn't enjoy her character more.

Alex was just used as a plot device for the plot of Himuro vs Kagami and I wish we had more backstory on her career or even just more of her traits. It would have made her better as a character instead of just fanservice girl #2.

PLOT. It is very simple so you won't be too confused while watching. It has always been straightforward (maybe too much now that I look into it). The main goal since the beginning has been to beat the generation of miracles, and that is exactly what happens in all three seasons. There are some plot lines that I honestly think were not planned correctly or just came out of nowhere. Kuroko being the gatekeeper is the worst thing that could have happened. We were never given any foreshadowing of this, and even the shadow they were using many episodes ago did not resemble Kuroko at all. It ended up just feeling like the mangaka pulled it out of his sleeve and I am not a fan of that. Teams being able to all go into the zone even if the characters in the said team were not that talented was another plot element that I heavily disliked. After the cheering for Seirin started, the powerups got so out of control that I couldn't help but laugh. The fact is that if Seirin had lost against Akashi it would have honestly been a much better development. You can't always win and that's fine.

MUSIC. Nothing particularly beautiful or memorable in the OST. It was mostly decent and some of the opening and ending themes work great as songs to listen to during a workout. I find that the openings usually had the best animation cuts, which isn't surprising since they only last a minute and a half, unlike actual episodes. 

ANIMATION. It is fair to decent. As mentioned above, some of the best cuts are sadly in the openings. I still think that cut where Kagami and everyone is in the zone against Akashi is still very beautiful if you forget about the plot convenience of course. Other standouts are Aomine vs Kagami when they both got into the zone, some of the scenes where Himuro is dribbling and attempting to make shots in the Yosen game, and the first meteor jam that Kagami made in that same game. Like a lot of anime, Kuroko is not safe from the many still panning shots. There are a ton of them. Some of them don't even have decent artwork in them. This last season didn't have as much of them so I was incredibly thankful for that. It is not lazy animation but there are many shortcuts being used especially when animating some characters walking but again it is pretty serviceable.

My main complaint in the series is that the powerups and some of the games make no sense.  Many of the matches we got ,in the end, did not play in a way I found enjoyable and some didn't even feel like they needed to end in such a way. It just looked like some teams won because of plot convenience. As much as I love Seirin, I still firmly believe they should have lost against Kaijou, or against Rakuzan in the end. Kiyoshi's injuries weren't addressed in a way that I found realistic. There is no way he could have lasted the games he lasted in with his condition. I would have found it way more entertaining and it would have made a lot of sense, if Kiyoshi was not able to play the last two games and then other characters could have subbed in. Mitobe and Koganei could have brought many good things to the table and it is sad that the author didn't use them more after Kiyoshi was introduced. The other freshmen could have been used in a better way than just as replacements for Furihata in order to confuse Akashi but it was inevitable if we look at how they were just background characters since the first season. I can't even remember their names.

Another concern I had while watching this was the message the series, even if they aren't aware of it, sends to viewers. Yes, we all should be able to differentiate fiction from reality but I still would like to add it here since it bothered me. Many sports anime, not just Kuroko, make it seem like even if you get injured, you are not a true player if you don't keep going. I cannot stress enough how terrible and unprofessional it is for Riko and her father at one point, to let Kiyoshi keep playing. I doubt that she is not aware of his condition. His condition was so bad that at the end of the series we find out he is traveling to get surgery. The fact that it was that bad but she continued to send him to the court just baffles me. This is in part the fault of the author but in the real world, I bet coaches would not be sending injured players out in games and risk them getting even more hurt. This same thing happened in season 1 when Kagami was injured and she still sent him out even as she said she was sorry to ask for help from a hurt person. Not only is the message you are sending terrible, but it also takes away from Riko as a character, making it seem like she doesn't care about the players which is a completely bad take since she does care.

I was torn in the end because while I obviously wanted Seirin to win, I still did not think them winning against Rakuzan was good in any way. Akashi was built up to be the big bad of the series , and then suddenly he changes with one game? Even with Aomine it took two games before that happened. I can't help but feel the ending was rushed and that's heartbreaking. He had a crazy power, went into the zone, and still couldn't beat Seirin even if his team was arguably better than theirs? this is the craziest nakama power boost I've seen since fairy tail. The breakdown he had in the middle of the game with his other personality wasn't fleshed out properly, his relationship with his teammates wasn't showcased in a way that made it seem logical for him and all of them to suddenly work well together, etc. The more I think about this game the more I realize how terrible this match was.

Kuroko will still live in my heart as a sports anime I enjoyed but I'll always wish it had been just a bit longer so that the author could have perfected some of his characters and plot elements better.

I rated it an 8 because it was still a good show for me, despite all the things I criticized it for even if right now I am honest to god considering giving this last season a 6. I liked Kuroko back in 2013, and even in 2020 I still found myself having a good time."
131083,"Mieruko-chan Season 1 - Spoiler Free Review
img220()

When I started watching Mieruko-chan, I did not know what to expect from it - a horror-comedy anime series felt kind of strange to think about. Anyways, I decided to watch it and now that it's completed, I can say that it was a different but enjoyable experience overall.

So the story is basically about a girl named Miko Yotsuya who, one evening, standing at the bus stop, unlocks the ability of seeing ghosts or spirits around her. And, instead of screaming, she manages to just ""ignore"" it, suppressing all her emotions! Soon, she starts seeing spirits almost everywhere and tries her best to turn a blind eye to them, in order to save herself and others. But that is easier said than done. The show turns out to be a psychological horror of sort, as the struggle of controlling your fear is one difficult thing to do. It applies some comedy elements to drown out the darker impacts on the audience, and for me, it failed to be a proper comedy as the horror elements outweighed the humor. So, you should not dive into it to find comedy solely; instead it shines in delivering a better experience in other aspects.

The show is also a slice-of-life, as we get to see the daily school and other activities of Miko, and her best friend Hana - who is an extremely optimistic, always-hungry young girl, who is easily scared. Due to this, Miko decides to not tell anyone about it, so as to help protect her loved ones. A daily life mixed with dealing with supernatural entities is actually interesting to watch, and this show gave us an escape from the usual types of anime we are all used to see. The show turns dramatically more serious at the later half, and we get to see some very interesting developments in the story. One thing which felt a little disappointing was that we never actually got to know how Miko is the way she is now, as it does not give much time in explaining stuff to us. That being said, if we get to see another season where all of this is explored, it will be cool. But considering many good anime don't live to see a second season, this was a let down.

The supernatural aspect of the story is nothing ground-breaking, at least not in this season. It relies on some previously-known tropes to progress the story, although this did not feel bad. I like simple stories often anyways. I believe the show's strength lies in its suspenseful nature, which managed to keep me watching till the end of this season. One important message this show tries to convey was that: you should not judge a person merely by their features on a surface level, rather we must try to understand them better by trying. The story gets interesting as it moves on, and this is a major selling point of this anime. You can get hooked, but unfortunately you won't get to know the underlying intricacies. But it is worth trying in my opinion.

The animation was pretty good I must say. Studio Passione, although being somewhat unknown before, managed to do a good job with this one. Not extraordinary, but still good enough, which adds to the show's overall merits.

Mieruko-chan was not actually scary, at least not for me. But I must say that the spirit/monster designs and voices were well done and they do feel creepy sometimes. The show also relies on some slight Ecchi scenes in its beginning part, and if this is something you want to see, then well enough (always welcome for me though). The major problem this show has is its blending of different genres, which does not always work in its favor. But, if you are looking for something different to watch, I will recommend you to give it a try because despite all of its shortcomings, it is still an enjoyable watch, and I am happy that I gave this one a chance. Definitely keeping my fingers crossed to see another season soon!

Thank you for reading. Have a good day/night, keep watching anime and be happy!

 Before we begin the review...

img2200()
With a brand new season 3 on the way, I'd like to take a moment to write about this shocker of a season. Frankly put, the first part of Season 2 made it exceedingly obvious how much the quality had dropped compared to the beautiful world displayed back in Season 1. There was no direction and the pacing was pretty poor, so it was natural for me to not be expecting much, yet ... here we are. Even without some of the key animators of Studio Bind being involved in the production, this part of the series established itself as an S-tier seasonal anime with pure writing and directing. Props to [Ryousuke Shibuya ](https://anilist.co/staff/134727/Ryousuke-Shibuya) for that one. 


webm(https://v.animethemes.moe/MushokuTenseiS2Part2-ED2.webm)

Episode 3 was the first episode that provided me with a grain of hope. A single episode dedicated to Nanahoshi Shizuka and her longing to return home. Her grim facial expression and amazing voice acting made us as viewers wonder how we would be doing if put in her position. Quite specifically, the scene where she freaks out and displays her mental instability reminded me of the voice actor's prior performance as Takina Inoue in Lycoris Recoil. As the icing on the cake, the anime surprised us with a one-time special ED sung by Shion Wakayama herself, which instantly became one of my favourites.

Then, shortly after, they just decide to hit us with one of the best episodes of the series as a whole. Good enough that it is easily on par with some of the best episodes of S1.





Episode 5 was peak. So much of Rudeus's character derives from painful experiences in his previous life, so we knew it wouldn't sit right with him if someone he knew was going through the same pain. We could clearly see that he was anxious and not calm enough. He found out that his sister was on her way to becoming a shut-in and if that wasn't bad enough, he had been the reason for it. This feeling of guilt and pure empathy led to him confronting Norn directly, which resulted in one of the most heartfelt moments in the entire series. Norn, for the first time ever, questioned her feelings towards her own brother and opened up to him. And then, guess what? They absolutely deliver by finishing the episode off with Rudeus's words to his irl (irl definitely makes sense) brother:  ""Sorry. And thank you"".

Not enough? How about a major plot development?





That's right! Turning Point 3 in the next episode, making us feel the weight of a heavy decision that has consequences regardless of the path. Rudeus begins his journey to Rapan, where we suddenly realize that Peak Isekai had come back. Why? WORLD-BUILDING, ACTION SEQUENCES. We faithful fans had at last escaped Ranoa. A sudden surge of nostalgia and love tickles our nerves as we once again feast our eyes upon actual combat, adventure, and all too familiar characters. Paul, Geese, Talhand, Lilia and best girl Roxy all making a fresh appearance. Just when you're having the time of your life watching hilarious interactions between Paul and Rudy, the obvious romance blossoming around him and Roxy, father's day had arrived.




!After countless foreshadowings both in the OP song and right before the incident, Mushoku Tensei proved to us that Gojo could be found in every anime. And if you didn't know, they purposefully waited a week to release Episode 10 on father's day. Absolutely foul. Paul was dead and we had lost a scumbag person, but a great father. Istg, they still don't miss when it comes to the final minutes of an episode. As if Paul's death wasn't bad enough, we are introduced to a vegetable-Zenith's current state. PAINNN. Also, the animation in the fight against the Hydra was surprsingly well-done and fluid. Hopefully, it gets even better now that key animators are supposedly returning from a project.!

Episode 11 = Seggs


A few hours ago the season finale aired and it is really put into light how much characters had grown. 

Even though Norn was incredibly saddened after hearing the news, she tried her best to think rationally and eventually came to the understanding that her brother had given it his all and that she couldn't blame him. Her anger with the Roxy situation can be justified too because she's a Millis follower and she had also seen up close just how devoted and loving Sylphie was. 
Sylphie's maturity was apparent both physically and mentally. She had grown her hair out and exerted an air of confidence, unlike before. She handled the situation maturely and finally gained the achievement of 'Actually being in the conversation for best girl'.
I don't even think I need to talk about Rudeus. Hate him all you want, but his progression is top tier. 


In conclusion, this excels and can be considered top tier in aspects such as Action, Drama, Character complexity, Plot, World-building, Beauty, Character development and Emotions. This was my first time writing a review, so I'll be expecting your helpful feedbacks.

14713,"Note: Review is for  both seasons

Nanami Momozono suddenly becomes homeless after her dad disappears and leaves behind a huge debt, which forces her out of their apartment. On the street Nanami rescues a strange man from a dog and in thanks he gives her his house, which proves to be a run-down shrine, inhabited by a hostile fox-eared young man. Turns out she’s been given the position of local land god. This ought to be interesting…

Me, scrolling through streaming options looking for something to play in the background without much commitment: huh, this looks like it’ll fit

Me: …

Me: oh no it’s Good

(my roommate, initially passing by in the background: wait no I like this don’t watch it without me)



It sounds light and silly, sure: A mysterious man named Mikage gives Nanami not only his “house,” but (initially unbeknownst to her) transfers his position as the local land god to her. While the shrine spirits are delighted to have a god in residence again—turns out Mikage ran off 20 years prior—his familiar, the fox spirit Tomoe who has tried to keep the shrine running, rejects Nanami for both her humanity and his feelings of abandonment by Mikage.



But Nanami isn’t going to give up—in large part because otherwise she’d be homeless, but also because she’s stubborn and plucky—and does her best to learn a land god’s duties and fulfill requests, all while going to high school. 

First order of business: making a contract with Tomoe to be her familiar. Like this:


(A question plaguing me throughout the entire series: did Mikage also kiss Tomoe???)

Tomoe is powerful, arrogant, and stubborn. He’s great at his job, keeping the shrine running, fending off threats, and can navigate the careful politics of formal situations. He’s not good at spontaneity or acknowledging emotions, both of which are Nanami’s thing. 

In fact, Nanami is the perfect foil: she won’t do exactly as he says—she’ll listen to him, sometimes, but won’t automatically do what he thinks is best, particularly when it’s not explained. Tomoe, when he’s not grumping about a human and a child and why does she need to go to school and her spiritual power is weak, is genuinely baffled by her gumption. He likes things orderly and predictable, and Nanami is not those things.



Nanami’s not perfect, of course, but her actions and impulsiveness make a lot of sense because, y’know, she’s 17. And for the most part, she takes her new situation in stride and works hard to do her new job even as she resents being bossed around by Tomoe.

Now that she’s involved in the supernatural world, Nanami finds herself in situations from trying to grant prayers, hosting other gods curious about this newcomer, questing for magical items, and attending supernatural-filled events.

Along the way, she picks up another familiar, and a shikigami, becomes friends with a sarcastic tengu (crow spirit) disguised as a pop idol attending her school, and when you include the two existing shrine attendants, you end up with a core cast of friends who are 60% sarcasm, which is the best and most fun to watch.



Seriously, I would watch a miniseries composed of Tomoe, Mizuki (familiar #2 and snark king) and Kurama (tengu) all day.



What’s nice, and unexpected, is that on the romance front, it’s just the will they/won’t they between Nanami and Tomoe, and it takes a while. But considering how many other male characters there are, I was surprised that there wasn’t a concerted effort to put, say, Mizuki or Kurama in there to make a love triangle.

I mean, there are times when various other characters develop crushes on Nanami, but there’s no concerted effort to make that a problem. The other main male characters’ relationships range from “friendship” to “devoted platonic love.”



Kamisama Kiss is just pure fun. I expected silly shoujo fluff, and I got that along with more story and more interesting characters than I anticipated. The two anime seasons aired before the manga finished, so while there are backstories and character side-stories that don’t get delved into, overall it still ends on a nice note.



Verdict

English dub? Yes, and wooooo is Tomoe’s voice nice, so smooth. 

Visuals: Pretty supernatural boys, oh yeah

Worth watching? You know what I have a weakness for? Sarcastic characters who are secretly nice. You know what else I have a weakness for? Powerful supernatural characters with mysterious pasts who get tangled up with humans and often have to act as protector. You know what else I have a weakness for? When those two things combine into one character who also has pretty hair.

AND GUESS WHAT KAMISAMA KISS HAS:


The series is like candy. It’s colorful, sweet, and safe to use as a distraction from the world. At 25 episodes, it gives you a good amount of story without lingering too long.

Noted, there’s one minor recurring god who is often portrayed with feminine outfits and mannerisms but is referred to with he/him pronouns, and is repeatedly referred to as “he-she guy” by Nanami. Watching the dub, it’s not clear to me if this is supposed to be funny, rude, or if the character is supposed to not be a binary gender."
